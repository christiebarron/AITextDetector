I believe that censorship of materials in libraries and other institutions should not be tolerated," said Filippino.

This includes censorship of materials found in public libraries.

"A library or similar organization should be completely neutral, transparent, free of conflict of interest in all matters which come before it, and where there is actual conflicts there must be only fair and reasonable examination and punishment," said Filippino.

In October, a library in Prenzlauer (Austria) announced that in violation of a section of the Federal Register, any materials found in books or papers may not be taken over by an individual, even if it is deemed it is related to that person.

The list of publications and their owner, which would be subject to the Freedom of Information Act of 1974, has sparked considerable debate.

In 2015 the World Bank released a report on Internet access, but it said that there needs to be the ability to read all text in a library and be able to read the content to understand it.

The World Bank has also introduced an information protection law, though the government recently announced the creation of a special law to protect privacy and improve civil liberties.

"The Internet has the potential to change the way the media and the individual is able to communicate, to bring a fair and balanced interpretation of how people and the world live," said Viggo Morte.
