Dear Editor, 

I believe computers have had an overwhelmingly positive effect on todayâ€™s society. They have made access to information far more accessible than ever before in our history. Education, job opportunities, and even communication have all been made easier for people of all walks of life due to computers.

No longer does someone need to be near a high priced school or library to have access to information. Now, with a simple click of a mouse, one can access a plethora of knowledge from all around the world. Free online educational resources, such as Khan Academy, have enabled underprivileged countries and their children to receive an education.

Computers have revolutionized job opportunities by creating entire new fields and companies that never existed before. Technology companies have given countless people access to jobs that were never available before, while businesses have been streamlined and given new ways to increase sales.

Finally, computers have allowed us to stay in contact with others in a way that was never before possible. With programs like Skype, FaceTime, and instant messaging, staying in touch with friends and family has never been quicker or easier.

All in all, computers have enabled us to do things never thought possible in the past
