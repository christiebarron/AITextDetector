 

I was headed to meet a group of friends for a much needed night of catching up and laughing. Everyone had been so busy lately, I was really looking forward to finally being able to sit down and hear what was going on in everyone's lives.

I arrived to the restaurant and spotted my friends all seated at a large corner booth. As I got closer, I saw that there was already a ton of laughter and chatter filling the air. I smiled as I approached the table and was about to join the conversation when the waiter walked up and asked us what we wanted to drink.

My good friend Mark, now slightly tipsy from whatever he had already had to drink, decided it was the perfect opportunity to give me a hard time. He said, in a funny, teasing voice, "Shauna, why don't you get us some delicious strawberry daiquiris!" We all cracked up in laughter at his joke.

I laughed along in delight. I was so thankful to be able to share in this moment of joy with my friends. At that moment, we were all connected by our shared laughter and it felt so amazing. From that night on, every time I think back to that experience, the same smiles and laughter still fill my heart.
