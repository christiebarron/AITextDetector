The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first walled-off entrance had been installed to the center of the construction grounds in 1927 and was intended by the World Trade Organization's "secretariat" to allow dirigibles to dock inside the building.

U.S. government officials said that in early 1935, U.S. engineers began the construction process of a dirigible docking system. Though they failed to make it to the next stage, several Chinese built dirigibles and a dirigible dock in order to dock to the building. But later, according to U.S. government records, U.S. planners failed to make their final attempt and were unable to get a dirigible dock out of the building. Also, because of the difficulty of integrating the docking systems into U.S. construction planning, some American builders made their own custom dirigibles, and others used Chinese construction books and other documentation.

In addition, there were problems that could result in dirigibles docking, including electrical, wiring and other difficulties. One problem was that the two main platforms attached to the building were too high. As a result, dirigibles could not dock on those platforms.

The design of the U.S. dirigibles was also controversial in Canada, where the government prohibited dirigibles on all public buildings except government service areas. At one time, Canada's Government Relations Committee
