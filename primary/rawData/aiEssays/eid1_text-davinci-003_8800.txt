 

I remember it like it was yesterday. My best friend and I had been inseparable for more than five years. We spent almost every day together, either at school, her house, or out at the movies. We were always laughing and sharing stories, so it was natural for us to join in a laughter therapy class at the local park one summer day. 

When we arrived, we were practically the only two in the class. The instructor started by going around the circle and having us each state why we were there. My friend bravely looked around the room and explained that she wanted to learn how to laugh more, adding with a giggle that she felt like she had forgotten how to do it. Everyone smiled and nodded in agreement, all of us relating to her struggles. 

Then it was my turn. I couldn't help but smile and get carried away as I shared with the group the funny memory of how we had gotten lost just a few weeks ago while driving around in my car. As I gave the details of the story and my friend chimed in to add her version, everyone started to laugh.

The laughter was infectious and it felt really good. Everything we said afterwards seemed funnier because we all felt so connected to one another. We laughed endlessly throughout the rest of the class and even afterward as we went out for ice cream. That laughter bond that we all shared that day still brings a smile to my face, reminding me
