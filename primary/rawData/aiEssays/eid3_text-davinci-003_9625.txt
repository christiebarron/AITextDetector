The features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski’s story ‘Rough Road Ahead’ have a great impact on the cyclist. The person in question has been travelling for weeks to reach an unnamed mountain top but the road has been arduous and fraught with obstacles.

The road itself is extremely rough, full of sharp turns and coils which the cyclist must navigate with caution. As the road is challenging, the cyclist must be aware of his surroundings at all times in order to optimally maneuver the bends and curves ahead. To some extent, this is a metaphor for how life can be unpredictable and full of obstacles, much like the road.

The landscape of the setting is full of rocks, dust and potholes, signifying how life can be challenging with its different elements and ever-changing components. There is also a gradual change in the elevation of the road which signifies how the journey of life can bring about various changes. The cyclist in the story must traverse this road to experience the change of elevation in order to reach the mountain top.

The constant presence of the sun also affects the cyclist. Throughout the journey, the sun is always shining and the cyclist must use his will and strength to overcome the difficulties ahead. This symbolizes the power of determination and perseverance- no matter what life throws at us, we can always fight against it and prevail.
