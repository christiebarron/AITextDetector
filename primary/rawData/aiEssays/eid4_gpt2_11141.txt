The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it takes a page out from a lot of the "we all need to make more money" myths we hear about. But there is a twist—the book also presents a different perspective on how to approach the idea of what it means to leave the workplace. That's how the book's a little more optimistic: it recognizes that people who do leave work don't necessarily want a place to live—as far as the financial health on their day at work isn't concerned—but rather a place for their children to play.

The author's wife, Claire, also gets to write the book. They share a great love for each other and both work on the same team, which is why she takes their son along for the ride, which is why she puts her dog out for the day. "We don't run into each other when we're just trying to do something that doesn't exist and it's fun so much," said Claire. "It's fun to have the kids, especially if your day is not at work, let alone on an occasion like this."
