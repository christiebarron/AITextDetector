My favorite memory of laughter with a loved one happened one summer while I was visiting my grandparents. My grandparents live in a small beach town and we decided to explore the local boardwalk together. 

We had stopped to get some food and were walking along the beach when my grandfather told a funny joke. It was silly but it made me laugh and I couldn't help but giggle. He knew he'd made me laugh and started to laugh too. Then, he put his arm around me and we laughed together until we were both out of breath. 

We shared a lot of love that day as we talked and laughed. Even though the funny moment only lasted a couple of minutes, I'll never forget the feeling of being so close to my grandfather and the joy we shared that day. Laughter really can bridge the distance between two people and create beautiful moments.
