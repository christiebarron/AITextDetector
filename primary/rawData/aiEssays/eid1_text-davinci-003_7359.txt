The setting of Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead” has a major impact on the cyclist’s experience. The cityscape takes on a menacing quality, due in part to its “rough, grey cobblestones,” “scurrying shadows,” and “black clouds”; a combination which creates a feeling of isolation and darkness. These features also make the cyclist feel vulnerable; his journey is one of physical exertion in a bleak and lonely environment. The setting serves to both challenge and haunt the cyclist, adding an extra dimension of difficulty to his journey. The presence of unfriendly animals, such as “graying crows” and rats, also gives the cityscape a dangerous air and underscores the sense of danger that the cyclist is enduring. 

The cyclist is further motivated to keep moving forward by the oppressive imagery of the landscape, which includes an “endless horizon” that stretches out for miles. This sense of vastness emphasizes the enormity of the cyclist’s task and makes it difficult for him to give up. Similarly, the sense of impermanence created by the changing light, which “flickering [with] no direction,” helps to intensify the sense of urgency and instability of the cyclist’s journey.
