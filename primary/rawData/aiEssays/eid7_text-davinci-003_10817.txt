I was recently waiting in line at the supermarket when the person in front of me was having trouble figuring out their payment method. The cashier was being patient and kind but I could see the frustration beginning to show on their face. I wanted to help but wasn't sure if I should step in. 

Fortunately, the person in front of me had a moment of clarity and remembered that they were signed up to the store's membership program. Once they had that figured out, the cashier was able to quickly process the payment, and I was one step closer to getting my groceries. It might not seem like much, but in that moment I was really proud of myself for being patient and not jumping in to help. I knew that this person was smart enough to figure it out by themselves and, by waiting, respected their ability to do so.
