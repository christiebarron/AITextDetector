The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho is meant to illustrate the idea of resilience and perseverance. The protagonist has just failed a test, but instead of being discouraged, she takes it as a challenge to work harder and do better. Her decision to take the test again in the spring is symbolic of her determination to keep trying despite temporary setbacks. The imagery of the melting snow and returning geese serves to emphasize the themes of rebirth and hope that often accompany the spring season.
