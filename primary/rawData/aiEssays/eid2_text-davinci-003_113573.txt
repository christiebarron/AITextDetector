Recently, there has been much debate in our community around the idea of censorship in our libraries. Should certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines be removed from the library shelves if they are found to be offensive? In my opinion, the answer is an unequivocal “No.”

Libraries have always been known as repositories of knowledge, where almost any subject matter can be found. Denying patrons the opportunity to access certain materials is, essentially, denying them access to knowledge. Furthermore, insisting that materials be removed could lead to self-censorship, where authors begin to bow to popular demands and avoid writing about certain subjects in order to avoid censure.

In addition, as modern libraries have become far more than just libraries of books, they have evolved to be places of relaxation and socialization — places where people come together to educate and to discuss controversial topics in a safe, secure environment. The presence of diverse materials in the library allows for a healthy dialogue and exchange of ideas between youth and adults of all ages. It allows patrons to discuss relevant topics and debate opposing perspectives in a civil manner.

Finally, censorship placed upon library materials means denying people their right to freedom of speech and expression — a right that is guaranteed to all citizens of this country. It is our job as a community to inform our citizens about all perspectives, in order to allow them to make choices that are in line with their own values and ideals.
