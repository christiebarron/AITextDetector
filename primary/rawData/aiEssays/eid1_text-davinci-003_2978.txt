Dear [Newspaper],

I am writing to express my opinion concerning the effects computers have on people. As technology advances, more and more of us are relying on computers to function in our everyday lives. Whether it’s for work, school, or entertainment, computers are becoming an indispensable part of modern life.

While computers do offer some advantages, they also have some negative impacts. For one, computers are causing us to become isolated from one another. When people spend the majority of their time in front of a computer, they limit their opportunities for face to face interaction. This can lead to issues such as loneliness, depression, and anxiety. Additionally, computers are also having a detrimental effect on our physical wellbeing. Spending long periods of time on a computer puts a person at risk for obesity, cardiovascular problems, and back pain.

I believe it’s important to weigh the pros and cons of using computers when deciding how much to integrate them into our lives. It’s important to remember to set aside time to spend with friends and family, and to get out and exercise. Balance is essential when dealing with computers.

I urge readers to consider the effects computers can have on people and
