An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I wrote this book. I didn't write it because it was boring (I don't feel like writing any books is fun) or because I didn't like what I was writing. It was boring because the idea was to write a novel in 12 years (one would think 10 would be enough for most readers) with the occasional reference to politics. But I'm writing a really basic story about the world of life. It was one of the only novels I have ever written or given away, so it was not particularly enjoyable to read if I didn't know what I wanted to write or what would get to me. The book had a lot of issues that I didn't want to deal with that scheme up front, but the books were well written. People loved me for my approach but there was an emotional side too. I wish I could say here that I enjoyed reading the book because of what it contained. There was something in it I wanted to share with others. I know the other people and they love it and they'll get along better. I am not interested in anyone saying that I will write a completely different book if they don't get along. I wrote my first novel once too many nights, and I will do this as long as there are multiple people around me who love it. In the end, I didn't do many new ones until I got sick. I have done a couple. I like the quality
