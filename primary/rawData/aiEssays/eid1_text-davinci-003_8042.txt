The construction of the Empire State Building was an endeavor fraught with obstacles, including a unique engineering challenge associated with allowing dirigibles, or airships, to dock. This process was first proposed in 1929, prior to the building’s completion, when visionary entrepreneur Walter Chandler requested the addition of a mooring mast for the dirigible “USS Los Angeles” to dock at the building’s uppermost heights.

In order to accomplish this feat, the engineers designing the Empire State Building had to account for a number of technical issues that would make mooring the Los Angeles possible. Given the size of the airship, the mooring mast required to accommodate its arrival had to be 290 feet in length and would have to be located on the building’s southern side, in order to offer the greatest possible wind protection. This posed a considerable engineering challenge, since the existing structure of the building and wind patterns would both have to be taken into consideration.

Furthermore, the mast had to be designed to hold both the weight and the sheer size of the airship, a process that ultimately required the installation of a large steel beam. This beam was engineered to extend from the 103rd floor of the building and then arc outward into a large loop at the end of the docked airship, helping to relieve pressure on both the mooring line and the rooftop of the building. 

The building’s designers also had to
