Dear Editor,

I write to express my opinion on the effects of computers and technology on people. The debate continues over whether or not computers are harmful to us, but I firmly believe that computers are actually beneficial.

The integration of computers into our daily lives has greatly increased the speed and accuracy of tasks previously done by hand. Decades ago, it could take a person hours of manual calculations to solve a problem. Now it could take a matter of seconds, with the ubiquity of computers and powerful software. Computers also provide us with the opportunity to store data, share photos and videos, and communicate with each other across the world. With the help of computers, people now have access to a vast array of information that was previously unavailable.

Some may argue that computers are negatively impacting our brains by making us less creative and reliant on machines. However, computers actually provide us with new tools to increase creativity. They allow us to manipulate images and create music in ways that would have been impossible before. With the help of computers, people can generate new ideas and products that would not be possible without this technology.

The bottom line is that computers are making our lives easier and allowing us to become more productive and
