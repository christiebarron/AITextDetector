The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it's all in the background and the book leaves you wanting more. I didn't get any of the actual character interactions coming out of the books so I have no idea what exactly I will. That's what makes it different, it's how much you care about the character and how quickly you get there. A lot of people can get really lost in them or even out their own ideas or feelings. In the end you will discover all of these things." -John Grisham

"I was inspired by one of the reviewers on The Last Summer saying that it seemed more like the final version of the book was a lot darker, it had more of a dark tone. They say that the book gives an alternate account of the Holocaust and the people still alive who were put prefers to look at pictures and feel it while being haunted by things. That is the kind of thing I was trying to do. A lot of the work was done in the dark on the inside, but that also had a lot to do with the setting and the time of the war. I thought it was kind of too dark for those of us that read it. I would like to see the book look different and it also has a lot to do with the writing. It was fun doing it because I think it gets into the heart of who we all were and then it turns into some of the most wonderful interactions so far on this planet." -
