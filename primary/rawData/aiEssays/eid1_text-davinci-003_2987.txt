Dear Editor,

We live in an age where technological advances dominate the market and our lives. As computers become increasingly more prominent, we are beginning to see their effects on peopleâ€™s lives. For some, computers offer a world of possibilities and the opportunity to stay connected with friends and family, access news and information, and generally improve their lives.

However, many people are beginning to worry that computers are taking away from face-to-face relationships, leaving people isolated, and causing them to miss out on important life experiences. Studies suggest that computer usage can lead to negative outcomes such as sleep deprivation, obesity, lower grades, and even more severe mental health issues.

In order to make the best use of computers, it is important to assess how they will affect our lives. People should make an effort to regulate their computer use in order to avoid potential negative consequences. Parents should also set good examples for their children and monitor their computer use, making sure it does not disrupt other aspects of their lives such as schoolwork, social activities, and relationships with family and friends.

The scientific evidence is clear: in order to get the most out of using computers, a healthy amount of balance is key.
