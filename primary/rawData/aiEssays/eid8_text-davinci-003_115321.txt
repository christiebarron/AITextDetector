My friend and I had been caught up getting ready for our day, and I realized I had forgotten to pick up my brother from school. I hurriedly asked her if she could drop him off on her way home, and with a comedic consolation, she said, "It better not be too out of the way!" 

I knew she was joking, so I retorted in laughter, "Oh, it certainly won't be. It's literally your street, so no need to worry!" 

We both burst into a fit of laughter, and with that, we parted ways, knowing that we could always depend on each other even if it was in the smallest of tasks. Laughter has always been a part of our friendship and I'm glad that I can still easily share a good laugh with her.
