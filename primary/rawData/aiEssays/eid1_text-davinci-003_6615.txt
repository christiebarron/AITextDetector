Dear Editor,

I am writing to voice my opinion on the effects computers have on people and to persuade readers to agree with me. With the rise of digital technologies, computers are becoming increasingly important in many areas of our lives. Even though many aspects of our lives have been simplified by the help of computers, it is important to consider the negative consequences they can bring along.

Firstly, computers have caused a decrease in physical activity, which can lead to health problems such as obesity. People are less likely to walk to the store or go outside to meet friends. They might even have difficulty standing up and walking long distances. We also know that spending too much time in front of the monitor can cause eyestrain and headaches.

Furthermore, computers can lead to addictions that lead to more severe problems. People can become addicted to online streaming and gaming that can lead to lower academic achievements, social problems, and depression. Spending too much time online also limits people’s access to the real world. They don’t get the chance to interact with other people in person and this can cause feelings of loneliness and isolation.

Therefore, we should be aware of the potential risks and dangers of computers and we should avoid spending too much time online. Instead, we should take some time off to go outside and interact with other people in the real world.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
