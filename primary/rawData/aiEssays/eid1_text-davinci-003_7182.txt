The lack of greenery along their path indicates that not only are they traveling through an area that is mostly uninhabited, but also that they are likely deprived of sustenance as there are no sources of nutrition or comfort nearby.

Furthermore, the cyclist has to traverse the landscape in harsh conditions, with no one to give them moral support. The intense heat of the sun, lack of shade, and the competition with the wind which is constantly trying to pull them back, serves to embolden the cyclist to push their limits.
