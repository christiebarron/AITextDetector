Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. The following are some of the points to consider when checking and comparing the levels of impact at high speed in a specific setting, which you should get prior to setting out. All drivers should take advantage of these, or if you have experienced it and cannot find your own experience, it could really mean the difference between a good or bad day.

In the below, we look in depth at the impact levels across the six scenarios in the Cycling Protection Group's recent Performance in Australia study.

Possible Impact for Cycling Protection

So what will a new and increased level of high-speed driving actually reduce? These were chosen to compare the cycling performance that resulted from increasing the speed of cyclists following a high speed bump of 20 m/s.

The results showed that a small increase in speed when compared to the current limit of 20 m/s – with a maximum impact of 10 s – can result in a reduction in cycling speeds of less than 3.4 km/h and about 45% fewer trips.

When cyclists on narrow high-speed roads use cars, it is important toEffect.gov.au's Road-Based Performance Study (RBA.org.au) to see what effects the difference can have on speed at high speed.

On average, this increases the speed of cyclists by less than 50% on two roads with reduced impact, compared to when
