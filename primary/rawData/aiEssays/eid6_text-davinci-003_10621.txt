When builders of the Empire State Building began its construction in 1930, it was originally designed to include a 200-foot-tall mooring mast atop the roof so that dirigibles could dock and passengers could disembark safely and without the need for ladders or cables. However, the project faced many obstacles before the mooring mast was finally completed.

The first obstacle was funding. The project was initially estimated to cost $1 million, but it quickly ballooned to over $10 million due to the complexity of the job and the large number of workers that needed to be hired. One of the conditions of the increased funding was that the buildingâ€™s owner, John Jakob Raskob, must guarantee that a dirigible docking system would be included in the building. 

The second obstacle was the logistics of safely and securely connecting the mooring mast to the roof of the building. The builders had to be careful not to weaken the structural integrity of the building as they drilled the steel that would eventually hold the mooring mast. Furthermore, they had to make sure that the bolts and plates used in the construction of the mooring mast were corrosion-resistant.

The third, and perhaps most daunting, obstacle was the actual construction of the mooring mast itself. It was necessary to construct the mast to a height of 200 feet and make sure it was strong enough to support the strain of a dirigible attempting to dock. It also
