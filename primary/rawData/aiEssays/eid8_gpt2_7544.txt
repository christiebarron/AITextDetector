One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was a teenager. I said to the waitress who would sometimes help me out, "I don't like this kind of joke or anything, but you can make this happen."

When you look at a scene, there are a few things that are unique about that scene:

You can have funny moments with your characters; if you'd have the courage to do that, you wouldn't even have to change their costumes. Also, the writers and the actresses could put as much effort into their performances as possible. If you take off pants and the makeup is just a little bit too heavy, then you look different.

As I mentioned before, while this scene had plenty of laughs, it would probably take some serious action to get that reaction from our viewers.

So with this episode, here's something I'm looking forward to doing to celebrate:

*For your reading pleasure, I'm making this episode with a mix of "You're welcome, but let's stop 'em if we win the game, okay?" and "Hurry up, guys!"

*What do you think about an episode that includes this? How do you feel about a scenario that makes it on your schedule? Tell me in the comments!
