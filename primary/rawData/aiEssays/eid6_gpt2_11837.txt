The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. After they got the approval for such a project, a company that has operated the building into its third-quarter last year filed for bankruptcy protection, according to Bloomberg.

"It's a great deal of effort from (the owner)," said David Zukanoff, director of New York's law firm Baker, McKenzie and Weiss.

For the builders, however, the problems are not as simple as building dirigs.

"Even if these things work, it's a little bit different on the highway," said John Giesen, owner of the City of Manhattan, which houses the state building, "than on the street."

Riding an electric car with no rear lights is a fairly straightforward process for any car driven by a person over 100 years old. It's an issue that Giesen, a former ammonia plant worker, began asking the City Council last year after he encountered a similar problem: Please build a dirig.

"Nobody built a dirigible at the time. It just couldn't be done," Giesen said. He says it's more of a " towards the end of the day thing than the end of the life process."
