I was in line at the grocery store, when I realized that the person in front of me had completely forgotten to bring their wallet with them. The cashier was getting more and more frustrated, as the customer began to apologize over and over again, not knowing what to do. Everyone behind them was beginning to get agitated, as the line was getting longer and longer.

Instead of joining in with the rest of the customers in complaining, I decided to take action. I took out my wallet and offered to let the customer use my debit card to purchase their items. Everyone else in the store was completely shocked by my act of kindness, and the customer was extremely thankful for my generosity.

Not only did I save the customer from embarrassment, but I also managed to stay patient throughout the whole process, allowing the customer to get their groceries without a fuss. It felt good to know that I was able to put others before myself, and patience was definitely the key to resolving the issue.
