The scaffolders and builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their efforts to allow dirigibles to dock with the building. The construction of the building took place during the 1930s, when airship travel was becoming more popular. The airship was seen as a symbol of modern progress and, as such, the idea of the Empire State Building being an airship dock was both a thrilling and daunting prospect.

The main obstacle to the creation of an airship dock at the Empire State Building was the wind. Managing the wind around New York City's skyscrapers was a challenge, as the wind patterns at the top of tall buildings are often unpredictable. The Empire State Building was no exception. The scaffolders had to make calculations and predictions about the amount of wind pressure that the airships would have to withstand in order to dock with the building.

Another challenge that the builders faced was the sheer size of the airships that would attempt to dock. The airships of the 1930s were very large and, in order to accommodate them, the mast and supporting structure of the Empire State Building had to be strong enough to bear the load. This posed a difficult engineering problem as the mast had to be constructed in such a way that could withstand the gusts of wind that would occur at the top of a skyscraper of this height.

The last obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome was safety. The mooring
