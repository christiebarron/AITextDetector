The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They came up with a way of having passengers disembarked rather than trying to wait for the aircraft to pick them up.

Even though its name means "city center", the building is still very distinctive. Here are three examples. It was built by E.C. Witten. Witten made a series of works between 1857 and 1868, some even following the "Fashioning the Future", which was a vision of the future world for the building's future development. In 1894, Witten moved his factory into a small building on Hainaut Street in Toronto, Ontario. After Witten was replaced in 1901 by the former mayor and architect, Robert Tamburri, the old building had been closed down for over 60 years. The tower has since been converted into an art installation and the tower was commissioned in 1995 under the banner of the Toronto Opera House which will be open through this fall.
