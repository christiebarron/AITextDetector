The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because we find out that as an adult we can go into a really big change without worrying about what we might do. It's about dealing with a really powerful world that we can both understand and love, when our whole lives and careers are the opposite of those of other people.

I got a message to write to today's students about the book. I'll try and get it out soon.

Here's how to download the bookâ€¦
