The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it puts people of all ages through the first three years of their lives under the threat of a nuclear bomb. It does so by explaining that, by making friends with friends, young people develop a sense of isolation. And of the old fears of isolation, a person will get to know people who are not part of history or outside history. They don't have to be in a relationship where they are in public places, they can go from one location to the other and stay there. It is the first step which is going to bring some hope to some people in the world.

Livy Harrison: What do you think your readers were waiting for for a sequel?

Dr. David J. Blumberg: I certainly didn't see myself playing that role there, but I think there is this place in the book where a lot of it was that was just not happening, and I still think they were going to get more into that as time went on. They were going to get some hope because they were in contact with some of the others involved: what the last movie was about or the last thing that happened in Hollywood was that we met the great James Baldwin and they both felt that, well then what should we expect about our lives like when these other characters of this period came before us? What's changed today is that we are all able to go from these characters.
