An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a 15 year-old girl in San Antonio, Texas. I remember her as being a little nervous and afraid and she made a joke about us sleeping together in a bar somewhere.

So when I read accompaniment to his song I thought, "well, it can't really be right and now we'll all have to go. I can try again tonight. He'll play like 'Tenderloin'."

Well, it can't actually just be right. He must be really trying. We still cannot all be really happy at the same time. We may not be able to laugh yet at each another. There is something sad about that. But this is my time to reflect on who I am.

For me, it was the early days in life. We were trying to keep one eye on what was going on, hoping to get by. We kept one open mind for each other and wanted to find another way forward.

I want to play with love but I want this as well. I think this is what I am about to find. I can never do without my love. I know we are close friends. A few years ago at a party, I was in Texas. When my parents were on holiday, I heard the band was out and I went to get some food. I was at a small cafe, in my 20th birthday party.

I was out by myself
