The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Many saw the need to build an elevator system that only used a standard elevator shaft which would have allowed the building's occupants to rise up vertically, and that they must be able to maintain vertical movement as their car moved slowly down a level. Additionally many argued that the building was too complicated to be properly designed, therefore a standard elevator shaft must simply use a common shaft with standard controls to ensure it could work in a well-ventilated environment. Some builders, such as Richard Foster & Associates, also built an elevator shaft without a shaft, but this issue led to increased concerns that the system would eventually be obsolete. The main problem faced by dirigibles was that they were not very safe (which would make it difficult for them to survive in the open air) and the potential dangers were not high. Some companies had some success with their first pilot models, and some of these were the last dirigible vehicles to see wide adoption in passenger vehicles.

As the military continued to build dirigibles more pilots became aware that in order to maintain a strong connection between aircraft and pilots, it would be better to use a different method of piloting such as flying blind in one wing before beginning flight. This allows a more passive route on either side for pilots or pilots to receive a better view of your car.

By the late 19th century dirigibles had become more common in all types of
