I was at the grocery store the other day picking up a few items I needed for dinner. As I was in the checkout line, the couple ahead of me was having trouble with their debit card. They were obviously frustrated and the cashier was trying to help as much as she could. I was already running late to begin with, but instead of getting angry or impatient, I decided to be patient and allow the couple to take the time they needed. 

Eventually the card started working and they were able to pay for their items, and as they thanked me and apologized for the wait I told them not to worry. I reassured them that they needed to take the time they needed and I was more than happy to wait. This interaction got me thinking about how patience is so important in life and how I should always try to practice it.
