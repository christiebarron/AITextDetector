I believe that censorship of materials in libraries can affect people's freedom of expression. I am convinced that a more equal process of censorship of material can save lives, and that the United States of America is the only nation to have the power to regulate its censorship."

"It appears thatwall is no friend for those who believe that a free society is not a place for everyone," Lee said in a written statement. "This fact should be borne in mind when considering whether censorship of political speech can or should be tolerated as long as those who believe in political freedom can and must live their lives without censorship."

In other words, the Supreme Court ruling that blocks censorship in libraries is a decision taken by the court, while the decision does not have to be overturned.

However, the court's ruling does not make its own statement about how censorship of political speech is "likely" to be addressed with legislation â€” which will be decided later. In an interview with Breitbart News, Chief Justice Roberts took the unprecedented step of saying that, "I do think there has to be a balance between the principle of freedom of expression and the principle of censorship."
