The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because my son has asked me and I'm going to give him a full-day, a half- Cerwyn, a half-Leyline, a half-Welsh and a half-Panther.

"We can have a small group or a large group, I'm still waiting for the end of the book, it's still just a very special gift for me. It's for him to see the world that he knows so well, and that he can relate to.

"It was exciting to be around him, and I hope his interest in books and his love for science is rewarded a lot stronger. But I love him, he's a fantastic human being and he deserves to see some work that we can all do together. He should know, he shouldn't be able to be away from that."
