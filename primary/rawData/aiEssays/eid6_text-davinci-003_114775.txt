The task of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was an incredibly difficult and dangerous undertaking due to the sheer size and mass of the aircraft. As described in The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, in order to succeed in this endeavor, the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome many obstacles. 

The first obstacle the builders faced was the strong winds that would buffet the airships. These winds posed a major issue as they could throw the airship off course or send it crashing into buildings. In order to combat this issue, the builders devised an ingenious solution - they installed a retractable 50-foot-high steel mast on top of the Empire State Building that was “powerful enough [for an airship] to fasten its mooring lines onto”. This mast provided the airships enough stability to land safely.

Another obstacle was the sheer size and weight of dirigibles. This posed an issue due to their immense size, which was a challenge for the Empire State Building’s already scant 300-foot-high rooftop. There was simply not enough space for airships to land safely on the rooftop. To address this issue, engineers built a long, narrow walkway attached to the Empire State Building which extended out to the mast on top of the building. This walkway was just wide enough to fit the massive airships, allowing them to land safely.
