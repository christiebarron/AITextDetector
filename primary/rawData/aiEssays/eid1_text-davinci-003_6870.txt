In the age of online multimedia access, the role of libraries has grown increasingly important and should not be undermined by the censorship of certain materials. As public spaces, libraries are seen to be supportive of intellectual freedom and free speech, and while this watchdog attitude may impede opposing viewpoints, it does provide a safeguard against bigotry and intolerance. 

Those in favour of censoring certain materials argue that it would protect young readers or vulnerable groups from potentially hurtful or offensive material. But this approach does nothing to promote the effective use of the library as an educational site and can lead to the suppression of books on controversial or sensitive topics. Furthermore, censorship has a disproportionally strong effect on young readers as it limits their exposure to alternative perspectives and hinders the process of critical thinking. 

Libraries can serve a vital role in providing an unbiased platform for free expression. Libraries should not be in the business of imposing ideas or preferences; however, they should respect the opinions of patrons by providing access to all kinds of material without attempting to police or restrain their readers. 

Ultimately, protecting library patrons from hurtful material is a noble goal but one that must be weighed against the vital importance of open access to knowledge. Censorship of books, music, magazines and movies could stifle educational purposes and lead to intellectual stagnation. Rather than shield readers from potentially offensive material, libraries should be dedicated to fostering informed readers who can engage with different perspectives, news and opinions.
