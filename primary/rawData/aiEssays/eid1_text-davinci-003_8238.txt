The Empire State Building has an illustrious history as one of the most recognizable and iconic structures on the planet. Its construction in the 1930’s aimed to take advantage of the growing popularity of dirigibles for commercial passenger travel. Topping out at 1,250 feet, its ‘mooring mast’ was designed to allow zeppelins to dock, and make an important architectural contribution to the “Empire of the Sky”. However, for the builders of the Empire State Building, the attempt to make this mast suitable for the docking of large dirigibles posed significant challenges. 

The greatest challenge was the limited space that builders had to work with. Prior to the installation of the mast on the building, the surrounding area had already been cleared to make way for the steel skeleton which was to become the Empire State Building. This left little space for the installation of the mast, and ultimately made cargo delivery difficult. Additionally, the mast’s precarious location between two of the building’s highest floors added to the weight bearing capacity of the structure. As such, the construction of the mast was only the beginning; the mast also needed to be reliably strong, so as to withstand the treacherous winds which would buffet large dirigibles. 

In addition to the logistical limitations posed by the construction of the mast, efforts to make the area suitable for dirigibles to dock also necessitated a significant financial investment. The cost of constructing
