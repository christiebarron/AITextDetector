The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In 1882, U, C., and D were unable to move their building toward the West and were given two weeks' notice to give up their proposals to move the building toward the east and then allow them to build a second tower of the same design on the south side of the structure. This was denied on the second day of May.


In 1893 the State Capitol Building was erected. The building became the tallest structure in New York City during the Great Depression. In 1912, six months before the height was to be officially determined, the building was opened. The building was completed in 1928 and the rest of the building, which had been abandoned at this time, is now preserved for future maintenance.


Today, the building is the residence of the City of New York and part of the historic Manhattan skyline. The facade is adorned with several classic and architectural sculptures. The building's history can be traced back generations to the 18th-century 1842 Dauphin family, who built their first domed building in the courtyard at the corner of West Fifth and Central.
