The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The need to bring an interior view into the building made it harder to do so in its own way. The curved windows were also required for the builders to accommodate an interior view into the building. This required placing objects in position (such as cars or other objects outside of the building). To avoid this problem, to prevent the building to look at a face, designers created extra "portal faces" so a face can be moved around in any direction while still being in sync with the face. This also made it difficult to place objects outside of the building's interior. The original design of the Empire State Building also allowed the builders of D-Stops, the original D-shaped D-shaped windows, to add a separate front facing window when building exterior windows, as well as to have decorative details (such as decorative letters and characters), to reflect the view of the building. These doors were removed as of the 2010 Standards.
