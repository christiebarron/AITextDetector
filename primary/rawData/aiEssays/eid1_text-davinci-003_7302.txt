The features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski’s ‘Rough Road Ahead’ have a huge impact on the cyclist. The terrain plays a major role in the cyclist’s experience. The road is bumpy, full of holes, and littered with rocks of differing sizes. This makes it extremely difficult to navigate and therefore the cyclist has to focus and pay attention to the terrain in order to avoid any potential obstacles. The cyclist is constantly having to adjust their speed and balance, making it difficult to maintain a consistent pace.

The environment also affects the cyclist. It is a hot and sunny day, creating an uncomfortable and tiring atmosphere for the cyclist. The heat, combined with the bumpy road, makes the journey more exhausting than usual. In addition, the lack of shade makes it difficult to find any respite or comfort from the environment.

The cyclist in the story also has to deal with mental pressures. The terrain, the environment and the difficulty of the journey all contribute to increasing the pressure of the challenge. The cyclist has to stay focused and composed in order to keep progressing.

In summary, the features of the setting in ‘Rough Road Ahead’ play a large role in the cyclist’s experience. The terrain, the environment and the mental strain of the journey all make the journey difficult and challenging. As a result, the cyclist has to stay calm and focused in order to keep going.
