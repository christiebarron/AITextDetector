I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a dangerous act. We're very concerned."

Mikin told the Boston Globe that he spoke to his former library, the Library of Congress, but never learned about "this" or would speak publicly against censorship.

"Libraries are a safe place and a lot of libraries have been closed and the public is feeling safe," he said. "I do that because it doesn't necessarily make any difference if people see the content on this website. I'm more worried if people see the content on this website and are offended. People just want to be exposed as criminals, but I'm just not comfortable."

This story was produced largely to cover the "Libraries Are Not Safe Tour" on CNN. We do not control their content and opinions.
