In the poem, the narrator is a student who is discouraged with school and feels out of place. She sees a winter hibiscus outside her window which reminds her that life will continue in the spring. She finds hope and strength from the hibiscus and the promise of the changing of the seasons. By ending the poem with this line, the narrator is expressing a renewed determination and optimism about life. The metaphor of the hibiscus and the return of the spring can be seen as a representation of perseverance and a reminder to never give up.
