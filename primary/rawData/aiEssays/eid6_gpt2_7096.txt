The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. But an early model of selfie-compatible Dior said an alternative could be created: the headband that's currently being offered by L&T.

"It has a good, good design, but it's one thing to remove one (sic) headband and remove two (sic) lenses, and it's another to attach two lens glasses to an existing headband," the model said. "We'd like to give us an easier time to see the glasses. As soon as we have more glasses, we'll make the headband less noticeable than we're selling. We're very excited to bring the best Dior headband designs to you. So if you prefer to use the headband that looks better on a flat table or the sideburns or whatever, go ahead and do it. But don't be afraid to let us know if you like it or that you don't like it as it'll take some practice. We're currently working with our designers on the design."
