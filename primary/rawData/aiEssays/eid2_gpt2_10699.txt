I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is wrong...the government does not want people reading it that are not willing to be censored.

The fact that these people have been subjected to these kinds of attacks and yet they aren't allowed to read any stuff that is even remotely relevant to our nation's issues is disturbing...It certainly has an effect on my job. If the government were just a bunch of ignorant, ignorant, ignorant people and let this happen and it's taken the rest of us by storm over our government's complete failure to listen to their concerns, I don't think we would have one right now.

Do you think the government should be able to stop those people from doing political activities or are you concerned that it is using their freedom of expression and association to further your own political agenda?
