The completed Empire State Building was an engineering feat of both modern and revolutionary times, and one of its most renowned features was its mooring mast. The mooring mast, intended for dirigibles to dock, was an ambitious and daring component to add to the building, and faced many obstacles from the beginning of the building’s construction.

The first obstacle was the issue of practicality. Dirigibles were large sea vessels that could not land like planes. Therefore, the mast needed to be constructed high enough from the ground level to allow the dirigible to safely dock, while also low enough to not put the dirigible in danger. As such, the mast was designed to be 200 feet tall, the precise height needed to attach the airships.

The second obstacle was the issue of design. The director of construction, William Lamb, had to ensure the mast was strong enough both for the dirigibles to dock and for the passengers to disembark safely. Since the mast had to be thin enough to not disturb the general aesthetic of the building, it had to be made of the strongest materials available. To ensure the safety of the airship, Lamb went far beyond the normal precautions, and added steel support beams to the construction of the mast to lend stability and safety.

The third obstacle was the issue of timing. The director of construction had to make sure to complete the mooring mast before the Empire State Building’s scheduled completion
