I will never forget the summer day when I was waiting in line at the movies. After standing in line for a long time, I got to the box office and asked for three tickets. The cashier informed me that they only had two tickets left and the theater was sold out. I was a bit frustrated, as I had spent the past twenty minutes standing in line. 

Instead of lashing out, I decided to remain calm and stay patient. I asked if there was anything I could do to get a third ticket or if the theater had any plans to show a later showing of the movie. The cashier seemed surprised by my courtesy and offered to see if any of the theater's employees had any extra tickets they could give us.

Sure enough, another employee, unbeknownst to the cashier, had an extra ticket they were willing to donate to us. With a smile on my face, I thanked the cashier and employee for their help, and we were able to get our tickets and watch the movie.

I believe that it was my patience that ultimately allowed us to secure the tickets. If I had gotten angry or demanding, it's likely that no one would have helped us. That was a great lesson for me to learn patience in the face of adversity, and it has served me well ever since.
