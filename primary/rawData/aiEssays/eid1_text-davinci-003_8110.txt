The Empire State Building was constructed between 1930 and 1931 with an intended purpose of being one of the most easily recognizable structures in the world. At the time, the building also held promise as a docking station for dirigibles, also known as airships, which were large, steerable aircraft that could travel great distances while carrying large amounts of cargo. While the idea was promising, the builders of the Empire State Building ultimately faced numerous obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

The first obstacle the builders encountered was the immense height of the building itself. Because the top of the building was over a thousand feet high, it was difficult to accurately determine the exact airspeed and rate of descent for a dirigible attempting to dock. To alleviate this problem, an additional mast was added to the buildingâ€™s roof at an elevation of almost 1,350 feet. This mast, known as the Mooring Mast, was intended to be a point of contact for dirigibles and served as the basis for all dirigible docking operations.

The second obstacle the builders faced was the presence of high-rise buildings in the area. This posed a significant risk to dirigibles due to their immense size and limited maneuverability. To address this, the builders designed a system of air corridors around the buildings to separate the dirigibles from the structures that could potentially obstruct them. This system was then extended to the nearby airships landing fields, which allowed for the operation of dirig
