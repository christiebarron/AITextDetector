Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my views on the effects computers have on people. In todayâ€™s world, computers have become an essential part of everyday life for many people. While some people see them as helpful tools, others see them as a source of destruction.

I believe the effects of computers on people are mainly positive. For starters, computers offer a great way to stay connected with family and friends. People can communicate more quickly and easily with the help of computer technology. Additionally, with the invention of the internet, people all over the world are exposed to a plethora of information that they would not have had access to before. This greatly expands our knowledge of topics we would never have known about before.

Also, computers help people increase their efficiency for everyday tasks. With the help of a computer, it is possible to finish a task like writing an essay in a fraction of the time it would take to finish it without a computer. Finally, computers can help other people benefit from what we have. We can easily donate money, participate in online events, and join communities around the world with the help of computers. This greatly enhances our ability to help others in need.

Therefore, I believe computers are an incredibly valuable asset to people and should be seen as such. I am confident that if more people looked at the positive effects of computers, they would be more willing to use them in their everyday lives.

Sincerely,
