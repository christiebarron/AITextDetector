The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because that was just a chapter in a book and there's no way it would have changed anything. It had changed so much in that chapter. And yet I think it turned out so well with that. I've tried to put the book in a way that makes certain I don't miss that scene. So I just felt like it wasn't even a problem, but I couldn't remember it because it was pretty close to the scene where everybody got shot up and I was in those moments where they were, you know, not really even in time to get shot. And that's because we were going up the street, and in those moments, we were shooting a shot. And if I remember it correctly, that was one of the most dramatic shots of the movie. [Laughs.] That's a big part of that scene. [Laughs.]

For instance, the very last scene of The Matrix we actually shot in this movie, as it happens, isn't even mentioned. There was a different scene in the movie called "The Matrix Part 1: Where We Go Down the Road" where we put this huge rock in its place. As it turned out, it's where the real 'Futurama' of The Matrix really comes from. That has two parts that are going to be really important to me, because if you go back to that scene [of The Matrix Part 4], I couldn't go up that road
