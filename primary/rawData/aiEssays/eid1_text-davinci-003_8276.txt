The Empire State Building is a testament to architectural and engineering excellence. But its iconic status may have been prevented from fully realizing its potential space-age feature of dirigible docking. Such an audacious goal was met with numerous obstacles that had to be overcome.

The foremost concern was the immense gravity of the structure and the hugely hazardous challenge of tethering a balloon to it’s top. The empire state building was designed to stand 1,2450ft, which posed a great challenge for the dirigibles as they had to ascend to the 79th floor in order to dock safely. This was a daunting task as the prevailing winds back in the 1930’s could easily cause the balloon to sway off course. Also windshear, which is so predominant in the area due to so many skyscrapers, was known to be a major concern amongst engineers.

Additionally, the mooring mast concept was a completely new idea. There had never been any building that had been designed with a direct intent of being able to house an airship before. As a result, there were no existing systems for safely securing and housing dirigibles, which meant that the plans had to be tested and revised multiple times. The final iterations of the mooring should have been incredibly sturdy and centered on a specially designed disk that was designed to swivel and rotate to adjust to the changing winds.
