I remember a time when I was in the checkout line of a grocery store and the woman in front of me had a lot of items. She was carefully counting out her coins so that she could pay for her groceries which was taking up a lot of time. The line was growing longer and longer with people clearly becoming impatient. 

However, I was able to remain patient and understanding throughout the ordeal. I tried to tamp down my own feelings of impatience and I smiled warmly at the woman. I even offered to let her go ahead of me and she thankfully accepted.

My patience was rewarded. The woman thanked me for such understanding and kindness. She realized that I could have gotten angry but I chose to be patient instead. Not only did I make someone's day, but it helped me to practice self-control in a situation that could have turned sour.
