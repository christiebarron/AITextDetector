I believe that censorship of materials in libraries (where that is permitted) is the most effective method of ensuring that free expression is allowed without being in doubt," the bill's authors said in a statement.

"We urge state legislatures to pass legislation to ensure that censorship is not authorized without due consideration and review for the needs and interests of the public."

The bill would also allow "public safety" officers to fire up about 45 pages of library documents with only the author's permission, and take on the duties of an investigator.

The Illinois State Library and Visitors' Association, which represents about 6,800 Illinois residents, supported the bill.

But the Illinois State Library and Visitors' Association said Illinois should have done more to ban people using online publications in libraries than to allow them to share those documents with anyone.

"By banning those who share their own information and with those who are concerned about free speech, we're preventing some to be free with the government, including the public and the media," said Jodi Balsa, the association's Executive Director. "We don't feel that is the best way to go about it."
