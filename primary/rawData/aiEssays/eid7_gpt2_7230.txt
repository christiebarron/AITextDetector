An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the time I was a kid, sitting at the bar with my head high on a glass of water, and saw an old woman in her mid twenties just holding her hand and pointing her finger at a man in her early sixties, who is a very nice guy in his late forties. I'm really sorry about this, but it wasn't something you were expecting because your parents would be telling you it was.

You were so embarrassed by his look of pity or contempt that you could only stare and pretend that it didn't affect you at all. I don't know what it was that made him stop. I'm sure he had to be afraid he was going to be sent to the hospital and that he would be sent home. Even better, for once, he understood the consequences. The child of my life, now he was one more person who could not see to his parents, or at least could not understand what it meant to have a life of their own. Of course there was nobody he could see his parents talking to about it after that, because he didn't want it to look like that. But I felt his compassion, his determination, and my own.

All the time I was a little sad. I was always so sad when somebody was hurt. Maybe it was the end of my day, but I still had to have that little voice about myself. That I wouldn't get embarrassed into
