Dear Editor, 

I am writing to share my opinion on the effects computers have had on people. In today’s world, computers are everywhere. We rely on them for everything from communication and entertainment to work and learning. While computers have made many aspects of our lives simpler and more efficient, I see evidence that they have had negative effects on how we socialize and interact with each other.

It is no surprise that we are more connected than ever before. We can stay in touch with friends and family all over the world with just a few clicks. However, I can’t help but feel that something has been lost when we replace real-life interactions with our screens. We are no longer having meaningful conversations with each other, but instead spending our time scrolling on our phones and clicking away on our computers. Not only is this isolating, but it can also lead to loneliness and depression.

Another consequence of technology is the way it has diminished physical activity. We are spending more and more time in front of screens, leading to a more sedentary lifestyle. This has been linked to the growing health crisis of obesity and other physical problems.

I firmly believe that we should be mindful of how our lives are being affected by technology. We should take the time to step away from our screens, bond with each other through conversation, and get outside and be active. Doing so will have a positive effect on our physical and mental health.
