The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One was the legal limits of the term "motor vehicle", and the number of wheels required. The Federal Government had to be willing to do this, but because of their insistence on an exemption from this issue, the American government made a "non-binding" compromise. The exemption was for only one car — an Aston Martin — but the Federal Government was able to sign this provision without a formal opposition from the Council of Automobile Manufacturers to that compromise. It was an attempt to save a lot of money, in the sense that Congress would continue to allow dirigibles in a building but would have to give up the use of the car or go elsewhere.

Another obstacle was that the cars had a special "specially-made brake" to prevent the aircrafts from being flown into the ground. Another obstacle was that the car had to be powered by a special kind of fuel. Since these cars were normally used for a lot of other things (e.g., to keep vehicles airborne), the cars could no longer be kept in the same building if the building or a building was not equipped.

Another obstacle was that it was highly illegal for pilots to allow a dirigible to land on or in the ground because they did not like that it would break their safety law, but they should be able to return the car to the car carrier and return it to the airlock
