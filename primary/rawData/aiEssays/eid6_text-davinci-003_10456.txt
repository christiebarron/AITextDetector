The building of the Empire State Building was an incredible feat. For many years, rumors of the construction of a mooring mast to the top of the building circulated. The idea was to allow dirigibles, or airships, to dock at the Empire State Building, something that had never been done before. Although the idea was exciting, building this mast presented numerous obstacles. 

The first barrier the builders encountered was geoengineering. Not only was the mast itself a challenge, the building of the dock to which the airship could attach presented an even greater challenge. The builders had to consider environmental factors such as wind speed and direction, air currents, and pressure—all of which had to be taken into account. In addition, the Empire State Building was a skyscraper of great height, which presented further challenges in terms of the additional weight the mast would add to the building.

The second major obstacle was economic. The construction and upkeep of the mast would be an immense expense, and many were hesitant to invest in such a project without some assurance of its success. In addition, the prospect of added traffic to the building would require an overhaul of the infrastructure—including the transport of passengers from the ground to the top of the building. 

Aside from the technical obstacles, the builders also had to contend with practicalities such as the need for a reliable source of helium to keep the airships afloat, as well as the difficulty in navigating the ships themselves.
