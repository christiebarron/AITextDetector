I believe that censorship of materials in libraries, even if done very efficiently and with a minimal fuss, would be able to make a significant impact on the way public people communicate," he said.

"This is not the first time that the Library of Congress has tried to censor books and films. A 2013 decision from the Government Accountability Office, on a voluntary basis, found that the Library of Congress failed to adequately provide enough resources to assist libraries to maintain copyright protection. However, the lack of resources could have been a source of difficulty under the new Copyright and Intellectual Property Act (ILPA) Act if Congress had opted to enact a legislative framework to address the problem of piracy for books and film. Unfortunately, the situation has certainly not developed a more favorable political climate for publishing and public speaking by scholars and academics."

The first, and undoubtedly most influential of these reforms, was a 2013 bill, the Public Library Act which established a "broad and general enforcement" of copyright, in which any publication that infringes copyright within the protected context (usually from outside sources) would also be liable to a loss of copyright if the publisher were found to have done so within that context.

The original version of Public Library Act included the provision "that any books or films (or computer programs, or anything which reproduces or otherwise enables or facilitates the transmission of music, pictures or video of any nature) found or made available by any person for noncommercial purpose shall be held responsible under this Constitution
