The Empire State Building is an iconic construction in midtown Manhattan, New York City. The building opened in May of 1931 and has become one of the most recognizable examples of Art Deco architecture in the world. In its day, the Empire State Building was revolutionary in many ways, including its pioneering of a mooring mast to accommodate airships, or dirigibles. Despite the innovation, building the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock posed a great many engineering obstacles.

The plan to build the mooring mast at the top of the famous skyscraper was approved in 1929 and the construction began shortly thereafter. Although the mooring mast was small compared to the Empire State Building, it was no small feat. Building at the top of a skyscraper posed issues with wind conditions, relying on cargo elevators meant the parts had to be broken down into small, manageable pieces, and cranes would need to be shipped off site and sent up the slope of the rooftop. Even with these obstacles, the mast was successfully constructed.

While the mast was completed, the problem of actually securing the airship still had to be surmounted. The idea was that two metal pylons with a rope net between them would be constructed at the top of the mast with guy ropes attached to wing braces for extra safety. However, wind conditions on the rooftop of the Empire State Building proved treacherous. The strong updraft of wind created by the building was unpredictable and
