Computers have many effects on people. Our understanding of our environment might be changing rapidly, and the results of those changes may be significant for many. What we might not know until the public becomes aware of those effects will ultimately depend critically on what our studies predict. The work of many of our field colleagues might have been conducted without an audience. I am also deeply concerned by how often the published studies (in a way that is both unethical and unethical) are misrepresented by those seeking to use those models as evidence for our findings. What I hope a better understanding of their influence will allow is that the research results from these studies can then be applied to our next research.

This new paper is based primarily on data collected in the early 1960s, and some of the results may even be used in future research. We have not yet used those models; we will use only experimental knowledge provided by people having used those models. The paper has recently been published in, for example, the journal Physical Review Letters.

A more recent study (Kruger et al, 2014) was published in the peer-reviewed Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences:

In 1998 the European Physical Society awarded the first American contribution to the research area of energyâ€“storage storage and the first contribution of the United States research community to the journal Energy & Environment. The journal's publication of the results of previous grants and research shows that it is one of the most prominent scientific publications in the U.
