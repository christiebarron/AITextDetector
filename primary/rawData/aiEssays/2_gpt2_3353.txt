I believe that censorship of materials in libraries will also diminish learning options for those of us who love reading books," said Daniel Greenfield, president of Yale Book and Record Center, the online trade publication.

In the latest study, which was submitted to the College Board on Tuesday, Greenfield and his colleagues found that the distribution and access of library content is less important than content on the Web.

The authors noted the recent data from the University Press of New York in which the median pay for a library subscriber in 2012 was $35,053 for an undergrad and $22,564 for a graduate student from 2000 to 2008.

And a study on the effect of copyright law in the U.K. showed that publishers' rights have taken a more radical turn and more often are given to third parties rather than to authors. Publishers have become more selective about publishing their copyrighted works in which they may not be required to show ownership documents to consumers, said Greenfield, who also co-authored the paper of his with Paula Kowal.

In the U.K., publishers have made this shift more aggressive. Last year, for example, the Government Trade Council, which reviews trade deals, banned its publisher, Reading Books, from publishing its trade book with Google's Android application.

Another publisher, The Penguin Group, has stopped publishing book books by third parties, including Google's Chromebook, the company's original ebook-based book distribution system.
