The other night, I was having dinner with my best friend when one of us accidentally knocked a glass off the table. Not even a second had passed and we both started laughing hysterically. It was one of those uncontrollable laughs that just burst out as soon as it happened. We both knew that the other was laughing just as much as we were, so that helped keep the laughter going on and on. Eventually, the laughter simmered down, but the energy in the room was electric. We just continued to smile at each other and talk, our words still somehow filled with laughter and joy.

It's moments like these I cherish the most. Knowing that laughter could bring us so much closer together, it's a precious thing to have. The ability to share in the joy of life and just let go of all our worries for a while has been my favorite thing about friendship with my best friend. While some moments of our lives have been hard, laughter has always been at the root of it. Itâ€™s been the bridge that has kept us smiling throughout all of it.
