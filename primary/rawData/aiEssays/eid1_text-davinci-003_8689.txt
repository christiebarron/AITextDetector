When I first met my husband, I was a little apprehensive. We had met through a dating website and I wasn't sure if he was going to be the same in person as he was online. But then something magical happened. During our first few conversations, we found ourselves laughing. A lot. What started as a joke about a mutual friend soon had us both in stitches.

I don't think either of us could believe how easy it was for us to get along and find each other funny. The more we laughed together, the more it felt like we had known each other for years. We had a lot in common, and finding humor in the same things bonded us even more. Eventually, we found ourselves laughing so hard that tears were streaming down our faces.

To this day, laughter is still a huge part of our relationship. We never need an excuse to find something to laugh about, and we never take each other's company for granted. No matter how bad things may be outside our home, inside we always find the time to have a good laugh. To us, it's a reminder of why we fell in love in the first place.
