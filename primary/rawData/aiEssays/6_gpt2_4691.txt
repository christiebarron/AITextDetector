The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Because of the high-end dimensions of their buildings, the dirigibles couldn't be housed in smaller space. They were, however, built in such a way as to create the illusion that they were sitting on the floor and not on the ground:

But the designers didn't like the thought of the dirigibles attached to a building. So they dropped games in the air, the dirigibles went flying into the air, and the builders had to deal with it. And their problem turned out to be that they found the idea of bringing a dirigible to the top of the building to be too difficult.

That might be true, but why did it make such a difference, to so many workers, as opposed to only a handful of designers and designers who would have loved it?

Well, because of the complexity involved, the designers saw it as a way to be more effective with their workers. Because they expected their jobs to be at the top of the building. So they could easily get to the top without much effort.

When they tried to do this in Europe, the workers couldn't get away with it.

Not only did they get away with it, they got away with it without any trouble. The Germans had a method for doing this, too, for several decades.

When the engineers came along, they were able to
