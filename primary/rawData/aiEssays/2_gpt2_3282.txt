I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is only part of the problem, as we all know censorship takes place in the privacy of the individual (the very people it is designed to prevent), and it's not something we must hide from our children with this information, so I fear there will be a wave of censorship to protect our kids from this sort of crap. I'll be taking a short break from publishing, and go to bed very soon.
