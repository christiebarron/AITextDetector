Computers have many effects on people. To see whether an interaction of a computer with a human or a computer with an AI machine is causally relevant for a problem we address. As a consequence, we suggest we conduct experiments on the effects of computing on human behavior at the cost of human knowledge and human data. In the book A Turing Test for Computation, Robert Paley and I argue that the question we are most anxious about is the problem of how different the computers are related. Their findings are detailed in The Computer in a Brain: Psychological Variation in Brain Networks. [PDF]

A Computability Model For Humanity

Abstract

This paper aims to explore the effects of computer models of behavior on individuals from different levels of intelligence and experience. The effects of the computer simulation of a human action on these individuals is shown to be mediated by the use of computer models in human cognitive and logical processes. As an example, an example is a task to perform a task involving manipulating two boxes. (The two boxes are positioned so close so that the user makes a direct move, which is the movement of one box)

The study shows that the presence of a computer model and the use of the computer simulate the interaction of various computer systems. It also demonstrates that the use
