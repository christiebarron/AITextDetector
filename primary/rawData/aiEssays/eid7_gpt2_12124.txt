An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my young son and a fellow caregiver in that same day, and he is now in my home right now. I believe he will be back for the holidays.

For him, that said, he would likely live under many different circumstances if he felt safe and able to get the attention of parents. (In my opinion, some families think about the "truly, truly, just" in my son and my son is the one who needs the attention the most, and you want them involved.)

So, if any one of us are feeling an early urge to let kids go this summer with limited or even no contact, we can call the American Psychological Association.
