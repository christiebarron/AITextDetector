Computers have many effects on people. Some result in a more interesting behavior, for example, a happier or depressed person that learns that the computer is better than the person he or she prefers.

Research has provided a number of research benefits for people. For instance, it has helped people understand that computers work differently than people (for example, for women more accurately describe their work and job characteristics rather than their gender), and to make the situation easier for men to find work after the fact. It has allowed women to get jobs more quickly, to learn more and better (or at least better) at what they do, and to get a better quality of life. Computer research has also contributed to the completeness of people's experiences, thereby increasing the reliability of information provided by computers. Computer programs will produce things that people do better than the programs they understand and experience. The good news is that researchers are always encouraged to keep working on such promising research and improve those systems themselves. (For more about the benefits of computer research programs and computing, see "Why Science Matters.")

So what do the next few years demonstrate for human development? Many studies on the possible benefits of computer technology have suggested that we might better understand the biology of the human brain to make decisions about our livesâ€”something that appears as promising as even the most basic computer program. The other side of these studies suggests that perhaps the cognitive and cognitive neuroscience gains here are substantial.

As always, there are positive
