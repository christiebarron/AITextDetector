The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. (See Empire State Building and Building and Building by David E. Kocher, Chapter 7, "Building Construction and Maintenance," in The Modern Industry, 2000, pp. 24-25.)

The building was designed by Claude Lépine-Poulin, an engineering professor at University of Toronto. A plan for the exterior wall was drawn up by an architect based on the theory of H.G. Wells. The plan was a cross of brick and glass on the sides of the building, with two sets of stairs leading up and down. On the second floor, a stairwell opened into the middle of the building and below, near the window, some type of stairway was built. On the third floor, the doorframe was closed.
