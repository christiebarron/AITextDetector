In the story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, a cyclist faces a challenging situation when he sets out on an unusually long and strenuous bike ride. By giving the story a realistic setting, Kurmaski effectively creates an external threat to the cyclist. From the start of the story, the cyclist is aware of the looming danger; he knows that the terrain he is about to embark on is “long and grueling” and that he will have to face whatever comes his way. 

The cyclist’s route takes him through a winding mountain pass, a hilly grassland, a hot, flat desert, a deep forest, and a remote canyon path. Each place is vividly described, building the suspense and immersing the reader in the rider’s environment. As he progresses, each component of the terrain helps to make the experience difficult, as well as more treacherous. 

The cyclist must fight against heavy winds, intense heat, and lack of energy while he is struggling on the course. The road ahead is often not visible, so the cyclist must be aware of the terrain ahead and pay special attention to obstacles. The physical exertion demanded by the journey can be draining, leaving the cyclist with nothing but a never-ending road and a desire to conquer whatever challenges come his way.
