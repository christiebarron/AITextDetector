I recently purchased a new phone and it was taking a while to learn how to use it. But I was determined to figure it out with a positive attitude. I sat there patiently, reading the instructions and researching online support. Each time I encountered a problem I would take a few deep breaths and think thoroughly before deciding how to solve it. 

After a few hours, I finally managed to get the phone set up. It wasn't easy but I was happy that I had persevered and stayed patient. I was confident that I had made the right decision and that my handset would work perfectly now. 

I was proud of myself for proving that patience really does pay off. It requires a lot of willpower and self-control to stay patient, but it can really help to reduce our stress levels.
