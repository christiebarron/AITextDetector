There's also the option to turn on the GPS from an alternate system as mentioned above (although, on a few occasions there have been situations where a rider who had used theDoes not feel that he had enough grip to get around corners â€“ it may explain this in some ways). And, of course, there's the obvious thing that can be achieved by setting a low value, as well as giving a very high value option to keep the cyclist as stationary.

And it's not just a matter of setting the value (no, seriously, not setting the value, it's what's known as 'closing speed'), for a lot of cyclists you'll find in the settings shown above also make it possible to do all of these things.
