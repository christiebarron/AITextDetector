The Empire State Building was a feat of engineering, but the ambitious project of allowing dirigibles to dock on its iconic spire was never completed. Many obstacles and complexities had to be addressed in order to make the dream of alighting airships at the Empire State Building a reality.

The design of the building made it precarious for airships to dock on its top. While the mast atop the building was designed to be 550 feet tall, it was very slim due to weight restrictions. That meant a custom-made gangplank had to be designed if the mast was going to be able to bear the weight of an airship. In addition, the upper part of the mast had to have spindles in order to give more stability to the gangplank and increase its load bearing capacity. Another major obstacle was the flight path of the airships; the pilots had to be sure that the door of the dirigible never opened while at the height of the mast.

The steps taken to create the dock would have been costly, pushing the project over budget. However, investors believed that the publicity and awe of the moment a dirigible pulled up to the Empire State Building would make the investment worth it. A network of mooring mast towers were set up around the perimeter of the Empire State Building. The mooring mast towers would give the airships additional support as they docked.

Despite all the steps taken, the project was never completed.
