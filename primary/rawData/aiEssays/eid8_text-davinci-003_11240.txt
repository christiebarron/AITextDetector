I was out for dinner with a friend I had known for years and we were both so exhausted after a long week that neither of us said a word. We had ordered our drinks and were looking over the menu when something happened.

Out of nowhere, my friend burst into laughter. I had no idea what was so funny, but I couldn't help but join in. We laughed together for several minutes, despite the stares from other tables and the wait staff hovering nearby.

It felt so good to laugh together and simple it out all of the stress and seriousness of our week. Finally, after we both calmed down, we both started talking, and managed to make it through our order without any more outbursts.

It was one of those moments that I will never forget. Laugher really is the best medicine, and after that night, our friendship felt stronger than ever.
