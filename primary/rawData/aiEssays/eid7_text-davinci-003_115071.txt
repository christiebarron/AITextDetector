When I was younger, I used to babysit my neighbor's daughter. She was a great kid, but she could be very exasperating at times. One particular day she had a huge tantrum about wanting to wear her costume to school, even though the principal had already told the parents that it wasn't allowed.

I was really getting frustrated, but I knew I had to be patient with her. So I took a deep breath and sat down with her. I calmly explained why she couldn't wear her costume and tried to get her to understand. 

At first, she was really adamant about it, but eventually I was able to get her to see reason. I was proud of myself that I managed to keep my cool and be patient, even in such a challenging situation. In the end, I was able to help her see that it was best not to wear the costume, and she eventually calmed down and accepted it.
