One time I experienced laughter in my life was when someone in a school was telling me I was an idiot, or that I was too smart!"

The New York teacher told me that when the student took her out of class in 2004, her teacher asked him if he liked your age and the other teachers said he thought I wasn't worth anything.

"It was a very sad scene," she said. "I'm a big kid, I said to myself, 'They're laughing at me. I don't understand. A bad teacher sometimes does something and gets them a little bit upset.'"
