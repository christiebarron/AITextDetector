I had been dating my girlfriend for about 6 months and things were going great. We were always laughing and having a good time. We had been talking about taking a camping trip for months, but it never happened.

Finally, it was the last weekend of summer and we decided to take a spontaneous camping trip. We packed up our car with camping tents, sleeping bags, and hiking supplies. 

The drive was about an hour and a half and we sang along to the radio and had a blast. We were really enjoying our time together and were both looking forward to the camping trip. 

When we finally arrived, it was already getting dark out, so we set up camp in the dark. We were both trying to help, but neither of us had any idea what we were doing. We were laughing so hard, we were both in tears.

Finally, after about an hour, we had everything setup and got settled in. We started a bonfire and stayed up late roasting marshmallows and chatting. We were having such a good time that we forgot it was already midnight. 

We both knew it was time to go to bed but neither of us wanted to end the night. So we just kept laughing and talking and roasting marshmallows until the sunrise. 

We both had a great time and still look back on that night and laugh. It was one of the best trips Iâ€™ve ever taken
