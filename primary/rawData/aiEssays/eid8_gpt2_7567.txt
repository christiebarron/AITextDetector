One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was 12 months old. I think it's important to remember your voice, which is so much more important to live.

That's why I've been living, growing up, doing a lot of things that I've never thought about before - writing books, travelling and doing the same thing. I want to thank everybody who's been a part of mine and the people around me and the people at the school that inspired me to go out into the world, wherever I've travelled for the first time. My life so changed my world.

I want to say thank you to everybody who's been there and helped build it, and I'm really thankful for the support and the love and support from all of you.
