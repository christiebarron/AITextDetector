Narciso Rodriguez’ memoir, “From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,” is a beautiful exploration of his life, weaving art, love, and culture together.

The memoir begins with Rodriguez telling us that his “anchor is my home,” as he talks about his own experience growing up in various countries. His words immediately give us a comforting sense of home, which is reflected in his craft as a designer.

Rodriguez invites us to explore his unique way of life through a deeply personal exploration of his upbringing in Japan,Belgium, and his native Cuba. He shares stories of relationships with his parents, love for his culture and language, and the beauty of travel.

One of the main themes in the memoir is the emotion of nostalgia. From the warm descriptions of Rodriguez’s childhood memories, one really gets the feeling that no matter what home he may have, it is forever in his heart. He describes the sweet taste of his family’s traditional meals and the sense of community that his small town afforded him.

However, there is also a sense of longing for his childhood, as he reflects on the longing for the warmth and safety that the familiarity of his home granted him. He expresses the void of missing his family’s traditions as he has grown older and stretched his wings to pursue his dreams. 

Overall, this memoir is a thoughtful, heartfelt journey
