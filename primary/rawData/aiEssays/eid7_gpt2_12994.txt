An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was sick, and my doctor suggested that you go see an ophthalmologist because you didn't know any better.

The pansy-eyed patient, who had spent the entire day trying to get better while her husband was being discharged, said: "How do you know when I are not being careful?"

He said: "The good doctors say in the hospital, 'That will make your eyes bluish; you will bleed and you have a big scar.' Then the bad doctor says when they are sick, 'You will die soon.' Then I was scared.

"By the time he was discharged I couldn't walk. I just couldn't walk through my room like an idiot."
