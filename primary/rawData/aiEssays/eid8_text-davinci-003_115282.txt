I will never forget the day I first met my husband. We'd been friends for a few months already, chatting online and joking over text messages, but we'd never actually met - until that day.

I stepped out of my house and locked the door behind me, heading towards the coffee shop where we'd arranged to meet. I already had butterflies in my stomach, but when I saw him waiting in front of the cafe, the feeling got even stronger. We had better chemistry in person than we'd ever had through our texts, and as we shared the same laugh over a silly joke and locked eyes with each other, I knew this was real.

Laughter had always been a big part of our relationship, from day one. We laughed together in the cafe, laughing over things we'd already joked about before but never hearing it in each other's voice. We laughed while we each shared a story of our day over a cup of tea, and we laughed as we sat on a park bench and watched people walking by.

It was that shared laughter that made me realize how special this relationship was going to be. Not only did it bring us closer together, but it made us open up emotionally, creating the foundation for a strong, lasting bond.

Laughter has been an important part of our relationship ever since. We've gone through our fair share of ups and downs, but we've always managed to share a laugh, no matter how bad
