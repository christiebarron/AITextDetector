Dear [Editor],

As computers become more advanced and prevalent, the effects computers have on people must be considered. As someone who has seen the positive and negatives of this technology come to life, I am writing to express my opinion on why computers have overall had a beneficial impact.

In the most basic sense, computers have improved the ways in which we communicate and stay connected to the world. This not only applies to our personal lives, but also to our professional ones. Computers are able to solve complex problems quickly and efficiently, which streamlines processes and allows more work to be done in shorter spans of time. Additionally, computers have enabled us to access the full breadth of available information from research to entertainment in seconds.

The improved speed and accessibility of computers are not the only benefits. Computers have enabled medical researchers to make big advances by speeding up modeling of biological systems. They also enable inventors to create models of their inventions at a fraction of the time and cost.

Overall, computers have positively impacted our lives and are only improving with time. Although computers can make mistakes, they are still invaluable to our hardworking society. I hope readers agree with my assessment that computers are a massive boon for people in our increasingly technological world.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
