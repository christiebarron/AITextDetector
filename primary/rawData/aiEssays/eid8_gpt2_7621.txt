One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I tried to say something to the lady about a book coming out in the early morning. The lady was very excited and seemed to be reading the book in rapt anticipation of it coming out on the radio in my car.

So a lot of people may be shocked to learn that someone would like to pay a fortune for a book and then take all their money and sell it over the counter to someone who might not have the money to pay for it once they finish that book and buy the book.

And this book is a great example of this type of thinking.
