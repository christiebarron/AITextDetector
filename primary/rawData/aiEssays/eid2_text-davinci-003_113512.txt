Censorship in libraries is an extremely sensitive and important topic. Some people argue that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. I believe that censorship of library materials should not be done as it is a violation of the right to freedom of expression. 

Censorship of library materials undermines freedom of expression by limiting the pool of material available to library patrons. It deprives library patrons of their right to access and receive diverse information and points of view. Censorship allows only one viewpoint and prevents library patrons from being exposed to diverse perspectives. By censoring library materials,library patrons are denied access to alternative perspectives which are key to forming meaningful opinions about the world.

Furthermore, censorship of library materials eliminates the public's right to make informed decisions for themselves. It removes the power of the individual to choose what material is suitable for them. Censorship assumes that one individual or group is in the best position to make decisions about what is and is not acceptable material for library patrons. This is a dangerous assumption and one that should not be taken lightly, as it puts individuals at risk of having their right to choose stripped away. 

Censorship of library materials also has a detrimental effect on the intellectual development of the public. Censoring library materials puts a cap on the amount of intellectual growth individuals can achieve by limiting their access to different perspectives and voices. Without being
