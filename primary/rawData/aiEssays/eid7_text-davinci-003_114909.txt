I was running late to meet my friend for dinner. We had planned to meet at the restaurant at 6:30 and it was already 6:40 when I finally arrived. I was so embarrassed and started to apologize for being so late, but my friend just smiled and said it was no problem. She reassured me that the restaurant wasn’t too busy and that we had plenty of time to order. I was surprised by her patience and understanding, but also really relieved that I didn’t have to worry about making her wait or being rushed to get our food. She was truly patient with me, and I was so grateful.
