Dear Editor,

As technology has continued to advance at a rapid rate, computers have become a ubiquitous fixture in our daily lives. While it is undeniable that computers have been instrumental in helping us do our work, I believe that they can have a negative effect on people's minds and lives. 

On one hand, people are able to use computers for a variety of purposes, from work to entertainment. They are an incredibly useful tool that can save us time and money. However, it's important to recognize that all technology use comes with a cost, namely an increased exposure to distractions. People often find themselves spending hours browsing the internet, playing video games, or checking social media sites. These activities can be time-wasters and can distract us from important tasks.

Additionally, people are also becoming overly reliant on computers to do their daily work, and in some cases, have even begun to lose touch with reality. We need to be mindful of the importance of a healthy balance between virtual reality and the real world. 

In conclusion, while computers have been incredibly helpful in certain ways, they can also be detrimental to our lives. For the sake of our productivity and mental wellbeing, it’s important to limit our dependence on computers and find ways to engage in activities that don’t involve staring at a screen. 

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
