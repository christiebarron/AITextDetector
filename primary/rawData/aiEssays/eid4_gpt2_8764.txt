The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because he writes about the love, betrayal and cruelty of the emperor in the first chapter. And the same goes with his own book, which is about the life and death of a single character, namely the prince, who tries to rescue the Emperor despite a long-stigma of being a "noble prince."

It also appears that at the very end of his last chapter, the first person in the book to arrive at the palace with a message of love to the Emperor, Iskandar, is a prince known museum curator Nisara Khyber. However these are the only people to see this episode.
