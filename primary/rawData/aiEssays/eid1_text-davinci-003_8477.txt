I recently found myself in a situation where I had to be incredibly patient. A few weeks ago, I was traveling to visit family and was scheduled to be on several flights. I was aware that delays in flights are common, but unfortunately, flights were delayed on two consecutive legs of my trip. I had to wait several hours in the airport before being able to board my next flight.

At first, I was frustrated with the constant delays and anxious to make it to my destination. However, I decided to be patient and make the best out of the situation. I took this time as an opportunity to stroll through the airport shops, eat some food, and even read a book. I knew that getting angry or impatient wasn't going to make my situation better, so I chose to stay calm. 

Eventually, I was able to make it to my destination safely and on time. I was glad that I was able to remain patient throughout the ordeal because it not only made the experience more enjoyable, but it was a great example of staying calm opportunities may arise.
