The building of the Empire State Building included an ambitious plan to allow dirigibles, or airships, to dock at the skyscraper’s 200-foot mast. However, the builders soon faced daunting obstacles in order to make this idea a reality.

The first major obstacle was the heavy weight of the dirigible’s docking lines. In order to be able to hold the airships in place, the mast needed to be incredibly sturdy, but the designers soon realized that the structure would need to be more than four times as heavy as originally planned in order to support the weight of the mooring lines. This meant that the mast would likely exceed the building’s weight limit, which in turn meant that the entire superstructure would have to be reengineered in order to support it.

The next obstacle was the wind. The mast and its mooring system were designed to handle wind gusts of up to ninety miles per hour, but the actual weather at the building site was far more unpredictable. To make matters worse, the surrounding buildings which could potentially increase wind turbulence near the site. The designers had to increase the mast’s mass even more to account for these additional factors, enhancing its sturdiness even further.

Finally, the mooring system needed to be fully automatic in order to minimize the risk to the dirigibles. The engineers had to design a system that could release the lines from the mast in
