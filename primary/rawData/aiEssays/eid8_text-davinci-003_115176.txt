I have a vivid memory of the first time I experienced true closeness with someone. I was in middle school and had a very close friend, we had been friends since preschool and connected on a level that many people don't experience. One day, we were walking down the street, just talking about everyday life. We talked about our classes, boys, and our families. It was such a light conversation, just two friends catching up. 

Then, something funny was said, and we both erupted into laughter. It felt like it lasted for an eternity, our laughter was infectious and it felt like no matter what, we were connected on an even deeper level. It was the most perfect moment of my life. Laughter brought us closer together than I could have imagined, turning us from friends to family in a matter of seconds. 

Since then, when I think of true connection, I think of laughter. The sound of two people laughing together, not out of humor, but out of a genuine and intense connection. It's the most beautiful thing on Earth.
