I believe that censorship of materials in libraries and publishing websites is a violation of copyright law and that censorship is also an unjust practice. We have already seen this with the recent decision by the Electronic Frontier Foundation and other online privacy advocates that we were able to stop the seizure of the contents of online bookstores.

This was very similar to the recent decision in New York to ban the sale of all electronic books on the Internet. The Court has held that this is illegal in a number of countries that support free expression on the Internet. While lobbies againstriver.org and ebooks.org, we oppose this. Our country is not free, our Internet is not free, all our books are copyrighted, but the Government should have the authority to regulate the market for our books.

We are concerned about the censorship that people are using online. It is possible that some people use ebooks to purchase information, which may or may not be copyrighted on the Internet. How do we protect our privacy and rights? The laws on this subject have changed every few years, it is possible that we may be making a big mistake in protecting the privacy and rights of others.

As you know, the Supreme Court is considering how to handle ebooks once we start removing all content from our online communities. Should the Court rule that we have the right to share copies of ebooks, should we also be required â€“ for personal purposes, or for security?
