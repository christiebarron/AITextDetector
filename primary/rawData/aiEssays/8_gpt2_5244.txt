One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I sat down and put my head on my breasts. I cried for hours. I remember saying "I want this all over my face!" It would have been nice if a man would give me the same treatment.

So, what about all the men on this TV show, all those men who get pregnant and don't get pregnant, or get a uterus? That's why the show is a great comedy show in the middle of so many issues. I have to say, many of these men don't realize that. But these are the guys who have suffered and got pregnant and who are the ones who deserve to live a life with dignity and happiness. And they deserve their own freedom.

Don't let these men stop complaining, don't stop being angry.

*As stated, this is not an endorsement of the comedian in question, but rather an endorsement of his character. In addition to being one of the show's writers, the comedian's main character would likely be a regular on any American show, and all of Hollywood is still awash with this variety of comedians, comedians from all genres of comedy.
