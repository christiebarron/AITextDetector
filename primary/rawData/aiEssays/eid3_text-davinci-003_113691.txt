The setting of the story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski has had a major impact on the cyclist's journey. The terrain that he is traversing is described as rough and rocky. This means that the cyclist must work hard to keep his balance and maneuver his bike around on the difficult terrain. Furthermore, the weather is described as being hot and the sun is shining brightly. Under such conditions, the cyclist is required to put in a greater effort in order to make headway due to the lack of natural shade in the area. The cyclist comes up against a variety of obstacles, such as large rocks and steep inclines, and must use all of his stamina and strength to overcome them.

Additionally, the setting of the story is in a remote location that is described as being miles from civilization. The lack of infrastructure, such as roadways or paths, greatly affects the cyclist's progress since he must rely solely on his ability to traverse the rugged terrain. The cyclist must also be careful of potential hazards, such as snakes and other wild animals, which may provide a dangerous distraction and prevent the cyclist from proceeding forward.

Overall, the features of the setting have a major effect on the cyclist. The rough terrain, extreme temperatures, and lack of infrastructure have all acted as impediments to his progress. The cyclist must balance his determination to reach his goal with practicality and safety in order to reach his destination.
