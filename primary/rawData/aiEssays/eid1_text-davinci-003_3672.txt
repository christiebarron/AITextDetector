Dear Editor, 

I am writing to discuss the astonishing effects that computers are having on our lives. Since the revolution of technology, computers have become part of our everyday lives. We now rely upon them for almost everything we doâ€“from professional tasks to communicating with friends and family. With this dependence comes a number of advantages as well as disadvantages. 

On the one hand, computers have changed the way we work, learn and socialise. From complex calculations to teaching us new skills, they have certainly improved our lives in innumerable ways. Notably, computers allow us to keep in touch with one another easier and faster than ever before, revolutionising how we communicate.

On the other hand, computers are proving to be hazardous to our health. Overusing them can damage our vision, increase fatigue and even lead to obesity due to long hours of sitting. Moreover, some of us are becoming overly reliant on them to the extent that they are unable to complete basic tasks on their own.

In conclusion, although modern computers have made our lives easier, they should be used in moderation; otherwise, it can be quite detrimental to our health and wellbeing. Therefore, I urge my fellow readers to use caution and discernment when using computers. 

Regards, 

[Your name]
