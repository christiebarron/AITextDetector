The building of the Empire State Building was no small feat, and the obstacles the builders faced included the task of allowing dirigibles to dock. Since the rooftop of the Empire State Building was 100 stories high, providing a safe landing site for a large airship was going to be a difficult and dangerous undertaking. The builders of the Empire State Building had to come up with an innovative and ingenious solution to make the task of docking dirigibles a reality.

In the book The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, numerous obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building are outlined. One of the primary challenges was finding a way to fasten the dirigibles to the building without the danger of them slipping away due to their immense size and weight. To meet this challenge, the builders decided to build a “mooring mast” – an enormous steel pole punctured with steel eyebolts. The mooring mast was sunk deep into the roof of the Empire State Building, providing an anchor which would be able to withstand the airship's weight.

Another significant obstacle was the issue of high winds. The powerful gusts at such a height would have posed a serious danger to the enormous airships, so the builders of the Empire State Building worked to find a way to prohibit strong winds from pushing the dirigibles away from the mast. As a solution to this problem, the builders used cables to attach additional mooring
