To the Addressee,

I would like to present a perspective on the effects computers have had on peopleâ€™s lives and society in general. It is undeniable that computers have opened up a whole new world of possibilities and have enabled us to take on complex tasks and process information much faster than ever before.

However, the omnipresence of computers has also made us more reliant on them and less able to think and problem-solve independently. We have seen this phenomenon not just in the everyday world, but in the academic community as well. With the advent of Google and online databases, students often search for solutions instead of finding them on their own. Moreover, the long-term use of computers has recently been linked to a variety of health concerns, such as fatigue, carpel tunnel syndrome, and neck and back problems.

In conclusion, computers have been a huge boon to humanity, but one must use them with caution. The benefits of computers should be tempered with judicious use and regular breaks in order to maximize the positives and mitigate the potential negatives.

Sincerely,

[Name]
