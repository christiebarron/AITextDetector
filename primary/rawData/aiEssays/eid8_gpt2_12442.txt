One time I experienced laughter in my life was when the other kid called me up and said one of his favorite episodes was the one where he and his family would all be watching a football game so it was an absolute blast! I feel extremely lucky to have the opportunity to see that this is not just an American episode in and of itself, but really the entire American Simpsons universe. I hope there is another Simpsons episode to come out.
