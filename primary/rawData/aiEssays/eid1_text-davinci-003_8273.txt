The Empire State Building in New York City is a truly remarkable structure, and one of America’s most iconic pieces of architecture. While it is most well-known for its art deco design, during its construction engineers endeavored to make it more than a mere skyscraper – they wished to make it into one of the world’s first passenger airships docks. However, this ambitious endeavor was fraught with numerous obstacles which made achieving mooring capability for dirigibles incredibly difficult.

The first challenge engineers faced when designing the Empire State Building to accommodate airships was the invention and development of the airship itself. While the first ship which could be considered a dirigible (an airship which could be steered using an internal propulsion system) was invented in 1852, they were still mainly used for military and exploration purposes in the early 20th century. This meant that the technology and infrastructure necessary to transport and handle large numbers of passengers had yet to be built – something which greatly hindered the effectiveness of the airship mooring system.

The second challenge was the size and design of the Empire State Building. The building spanned 1,250 feet in height, making attaching mooring cables to it a considerable feat in itself. Additionally, the concrete walls and windows were not designed to support the heavy loads the airships would have generated if mooring had been successful. This meant that the building would then require significant structural modifications in order to accommodate
