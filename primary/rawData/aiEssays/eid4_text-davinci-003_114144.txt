The protagonist of Winter Hibiscus is a young girl named May, who is struggling to prepare for college entrance exams. She doesn't feel as if she has enough time to properly prepare and worries that she won't do as well as her siblings. At the end of the story, May finds motivation in a hardy hibiscus bush that blooms despite snow and bitter cold. 

The closing line serves as a reminder to May that if the hibiscus can thrive despite the challenging conditions of winter, then she too can thrive against the obstacles that life throws her way, coming out the other side. It's symbolic of her resilience and determination to succeed, and serves as a reminder to keep on taking the tests and working hard towards her goals, even when things seem difficult.
