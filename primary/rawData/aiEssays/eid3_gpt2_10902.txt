Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. To avoid any problems, we recommend that the road or road-related materials used for the setting be chosen. There is no one-size-fits-all rule and certain bicycle riders face different road profiles when building a bike. For those of us that live across the city, these guidelines will allow us to choose one or more parts that we feel would allow us to be as successful with each level of service for the cyclist we are designing. If you have suggestions please feel free to post below.


Step 6 - Make the bike

In this section we will use our basic bicycle setting as mentioned here. It's just as easy as any other setting for this setup, but there is at least one more aspect of the system that you will want to understand as well.

Cyclists should be very comfortable with the use of different sized tires, and you will need to decide on how big or small you want to take the bike. The more tires you have, the more room you should have in your bike. You need to know the height, width and distance you want the bike to move. We use a very small rim and use a wider rim.

When we get the bike on this low, our bicycle is set to sit upright. Once our feet are in the seat, we move and turn to the right, back to the bench. We then start back down
