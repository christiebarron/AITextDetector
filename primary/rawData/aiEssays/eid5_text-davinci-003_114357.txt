Narciso Rodriguez's memoir ‘From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives’ creates a deeply intimate and melancholic mood that captures the heart of its audience. Through reading his words, one is able to gain an understanding of the emotional hardship and loss Rodriguez endured while growing up. His story of being uprooted from his home and then later months later finding that home again creates a powerful emotional resonance. Rodriguez’s story helps to highlight his longing for home and the idea of starting over without any semblance of family or belonging.

The memoir creates a sense of loneliness that makes it difficult to read. Rodriguez expresses the anguish of being an outsider: “The fear and insecurity of being the only foreigner in the classroom intensified my isolation". His inner turmoil and the idea of displacement becomes even more palpable when he expresses his attempt to make a home out of the things he found in each new place. He talks of attempting to create an intimate familiar for himself with temporary furnishings, such as “a small TV set I bought from a secondhand store." 

The tone of the memoir is at times hopeful and loving, but it’s easy to feel the heavy burden of Rodriguez’s emotion. He paints a portrait of his past, which includes physical and emotional homecomings. This memoir is a reminder of how the memories of our childhoods and of our lives at home will always remain with us no matter how much time passes.
