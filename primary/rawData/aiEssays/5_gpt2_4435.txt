The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' has now been taken by the writer and his staff to another level: "To be quite candid, the new book has not been written with his own eyes. A person's body is a piece of work—her mind is not a piece of paper." The novelist describes himself as a "well endowed gentleman who has the audacity to give his mind full-grown confidence," a "master of the language of emotion of a man." He says: "As for how I have been writing it, you will have to think in the same way, by the way, how I have done my whole life, having been one hundred percent self-sufficient as I am myself. I still have no sense of a word to speak of. I have no memory of it. I am a true poet, my own true poet."

The book has the unique power to open us up in a new language, the more familiar we become: a language of fear, a language of vulnerability.
