Laughter. It's something that always seems to bond me with people. Even now, years later, I still remember the first time I experienced it with someone else.

I had just moved to a new town and was looking to make friends. I was walking around the park one day when I saw four guys sitting on the grass, playing frisbee. Being the type of person I am, I thought to myself, "Hey, why not try to make friends? I'm sure if we joke we can get along well."

So, I walked up to them and tried to introduce myself. They didn't seem to be too interested in talking to the new kid in town, so I nervously started telling jokes. I remember feeling embarrassed about really not being that funny, but eventually one of them laughed and that seemed to break the ice.

Soon enough, I was exchanging laughter with all four of them. I felt so relieved and, most importantly, welcomed. We all kept laughing and talking until the sun went down, and by the end, we were all good friends.

Laughter is such a powerful tool, one that helped me make my first friends in my new town. It's incredible how something so simple can connect two people, even ones who don't know each other that well. It's something I now use in my friendships and relationships all the time. You never know how much a good joke can do.
