One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I used to tell my cousin she had to kill herself for trying to steal my husband's car. She'd be like, "Yeah, I don't understand what you have to say. What's wrong with you?" The response was, "You're right about it, I'm sorry, it's hard right now, but I'll try." My cousin, now my wife, just looked puzzled. She wanted to know why I hadn't done anything yet.

My heart just opened up at the news the same time I was writing this piece. I remember at this point, I knew there was no rift at all, and it didn't seem that way to my wife. How could she have been angry at me if I weren't looking at her this way? I hadn't felt anything. I felt the world, I thought. I felt the world. I felt that other women didn't feel it the way IHundreds of women out there are struggling to make a living after a lifetime of neglect. We do.

I am still going through my own personal story. I'm always thinking about how to live this story in words and pictures, sometimes putting them in my words, sometimes trying not to think about what's going on. It's not something I just say, it's part of my life to say I feel that way.

I get to know people a lot better than I should ever have before,
