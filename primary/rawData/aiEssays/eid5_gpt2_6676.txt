The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' has been to describe the way in which these women were treated by police and state officials.

One police officer who testified in court said that police were asked by a mother to go downstairs after the daughter of the daughter's boyfriends told her that the couple had beaten her to death.

A third police officer who testified said that he then saw a father-of-two who pulled up in front of the father of the mother and beat the three, as well as the mother of three daughters and boy who were sleeping in his vehicle.

He said that the father-of-two began taking the children outside, then ran to where the body was lying and beat the four girls.

But when no further action was taken by police until after he called for the police, the father-of-two began to move the children from the back seat of his car to his truck and into the middle of his truck, which was empty.
