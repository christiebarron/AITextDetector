As I was walking through the mall with my fiancé, we started to get bored with window shopping and decided to relax in one of the cushioned benches in the hall. As we waited, I noticed a stray balloon on the ground, and picking it up, I handed it over to my fiancé. He put it to his lips and blew the balloon - it took a few attempts until he was finally able to fill it up! 

Giggling together, I couldn't help but take a selfie with us both trying to blow up the balloon. It was so silly, but seeing it light up our faces with joy brought me even more happiness. With the selfie snapped, we shared a brief moment of laughter - the kind of laugh that can bridge any distance and make everything feel alright. 

As we walked away, I held onto my fiancé's hand even tighter. That moment of laughter felt so special and reminded me of why I'm so lucky to have him in my life.
