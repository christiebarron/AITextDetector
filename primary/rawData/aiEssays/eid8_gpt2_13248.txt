One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I read that Richard Schiff, who as President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, told me that "you should be ashamed to admit that you had sexual intercourse with a teenage girl until she was 13." I think what I'm saying here is that that's okay. We don't have to apologize when someone makes a mistake. It makes you feel bad. And that's not who we were before sexual assault of a young lady occurred. It just happened. It's the truth! No, it's not me.

I think most people who would have been raped by a 21-year-old woman because they were 12 or 17 are going to be embarrassed by that, or they're going to be ashamed. How can I be ashamed without having sex to satisfy the lust of an 18-year-old girl?

You're really at the center of this thing. We're being treated disrespectfully by a majority of people. And if anybody were a little more insensitive to the problems he was experiencing and it was the young lady's, we all have this deep pain. And if anything, it's just our sin and our guilt. It's the same thing about the LDS Church.

It's important we make all of our brothers and sisters aware when sex is not a normal part of our lives, especially when sexual assault of a young woman is being prosecuted. That's not why it's so
