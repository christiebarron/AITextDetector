The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. After all, dirigibles are only able to travel up to 100 feet (55 meters) while in their horizontal and vertical planes respectively.

And all of these obstacles were overcome by the efforts of the Chinese designers of their first public display.

It was the Chinese design that allowed our heroes the chance for a unique use.

"Our heroes of the twentieth century wanted to show the human side to the world and demonstrate how the Chinese created unique means to display these things, which they have always used to celebrate the Chinese, or the Chinese's own statehood," said Wu.

Over 100,000 dirigibles have been sent out to the world since 2010.

As long as China remains a part of our global economy, many cities in North America, Latin America and Asia are going to continue the Chinese brand of luxury by offering dirigibles on their streets in a different setting each year.

"Our artists who have worked with the Chinese government can see that the Chinese people will continue to support and expand dirigibles with different local and global themes," said Wu.

The Chinese and American artists, who want each city to celebrate their American heritage with two daoist statues, can also do a little more than decorate city streets, with a special event at City Center Park of Daoist Art at 7pm.
