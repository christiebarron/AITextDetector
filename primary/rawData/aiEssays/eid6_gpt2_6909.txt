The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. "We don't need to have the capability to let the aircraft have the ability to launch. You have to have it," says Thomas Lienberg on what he regards as a massive problem: "The ability to fly at supersonic speed without being able to fire the torpedoes is very, very bad. We have been running two torpedoes to prevent the crew from being able to take them out."

So far, however, we have been talking about the potential for Phillies' Star Wars-derived supersonic aircraft. In some parts of the world, supersonic aircraft were a fairly viable option during the Cold War and then rapidly adopted by the United States with the advent of the Boeing B-24 bombers. "In many ways, to take that airplane would have been extremely revolutionary," says Lienberg. Those of us who are acquainted with the design of Star Wars tend to be in favor of supersonic aircraft. In fact, we frequently hear about the Boeing bombers that flew to Earth only in the late 1940s, and were soon replaced by supersonic aircraft as well.

For the skip ahead, let's just look at the top two supersonic aircraft of the past century, which look about the same overall and are similar in design but are built with a higher cost and have more
