The rough terrain of the road is made up of jagged granite rocks, steep ascents and descents, and perilous ledges. This type of terrain forces the cyclist to push their body to the limit and keeps them on their toes in order to avoid potential danger. The environment of the region greatly affects the cyclist emotionally as well. The cold air of the mountains with an unforgiving landscape and a bleak horizon, leaves the cyclist feeling isolated and alone. There is no sense of comfort provided by nature, forcing the cyclist to rely on only their own internal strength.

The unpredictability of the environment is also a factor to take into account. The cyclist is unable to plan ahead as there is no surety in what lies around the next bend. They are constantly placed in situations of danger, with the possibility of landslides, complex turns, and sharp edges. This is accentuated by the lack of human beings which creates an atmosphere of loneliness, making the cyclist more vulnerable and lonely.

The setting of the story also reveals the character’s courage in overcoming the obstacles, as well as their determination to reach the top. The cyclist is willing to take risks and challenge themselves in order to reach the top of the mountain. By doing this, they prove their strength, resilience and determination
