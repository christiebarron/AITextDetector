The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is also an inspiration.

"A lot of this is just about the process â€“ I'm just curious what's going through my mind. I can't speak more than that I don't feel that is important for my work. I always feel like my own self - a human being- is where I am. And that is where it all starts to manifest itself in my work, it doesn't come with a lot of strings attached, but it will come at some point.

"It's never my intention for this story to be short, but to have a whole journey beyond just talking about my work and all that. I'd like to say the most wonderful thing to me in the book is how I felt about the situation.

"At the beginning of my career I was only talking about being on the bus because I was in college and had done an internship with some other schools. But I felt like I was on a different level. I didn't know anything about what was going on until I started writing. So the experience of doing one project and going from there is really great, and I think it gives me a fresh perspective. I'm just trying to see a future where I can be more selfless to my students. That's what it gets you."
