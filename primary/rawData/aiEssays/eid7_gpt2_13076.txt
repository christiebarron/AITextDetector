An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was with a couple of friends who went back to their hometown to do what they wanted to do. It took me a while and maybe years to build a team to do that in America. But that's just part of the story. And when you're an American, you're going to experience that kind of thing.

So there might be you at that moment where you actually feel it's time you get over to where we do, you feel like, "Oh, we should be getting on this same plane of life."

Well, that's something I'm trying to avoid, but I guess my personal philosophy is if you're going to try to get to where the most important thing is is being in an established team or a successful club or a great team, then it's time to make that effort and that focus on your own personal goals. Maybe you're going to move towards trying to compete at circuit level?

Well, probably not quite so much. I think, for most, that's kind of one of the bigger decisions when you're a professional athlete. But for me I think it's definitely been a huge challenge. I mean, there are times where I have such success. I probably didn't make it at the level where we're at now. But I do think it's a hard thing to do to be a pro athlete. You have to take the experience of your life
