An example of a time someone in my life was patient was after she had been killed (who was not herself as she didn't want to be associated with her deceased kin during this time, not that it would matter, except that someone that was not related to the deceased was responsible for the death of her sister). As much as she was upset about the case and saddened by the accident, she was able to overcome the problems she had with her current situation. When she finally died, she spoke to her daughter and asked them what life was before the accident. They informed her that their daughter died, and she then asked them if they could have her funeral or funeral arrangements. She spoke about where her life had been and what the funeral cost was. What she learned from the experience was that she had a full body, and that in the funeral, that person in the room next to her didn't seem as much like a deceased person as her cousin. It was her own fault the funeral cost was so much higher (her cousin was also not as far away from her as her sister). She later wrote an entire book about the experience and how she was the "second person" to die.
