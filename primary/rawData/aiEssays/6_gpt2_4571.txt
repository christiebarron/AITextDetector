The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. While there remained a lack of space to build the Empire State Building itself during construction, that is likely what led to several major construction upgrades beginning in 1820.

The first was the construction of the World Trade Center, which included the Pentagon. These towers provided a view of the World Trade Center from the first of its six stages of development before a new tower opened in 1870.[3] The WTC opened in 1911 and was the tallest building to open in the United States in the same year. Later, a three-story, 130-story Twin Towers was completed in 1939 and the Pentagon in 1941. After World War II, towers were constructed in the following decades.[4]

One of the tallest and oldest buildings in the world was the World Trade Center, with a height of 1012 feet, the greatest ever seen in the history of architecture. At the time of construction, the skyscraper was the ninth highest in Britain. Although a landmark in its day, it now stands as the tallest building in the world, it had almost no room to store its interior.[5]

Building History

The design of the towers began on September 21, 1773.[6] Built by the city of New York,[7] many of the tallest structures were built before the start of World War II, with the largest being the Wilbur White House and the Empire State Building located in Washington
