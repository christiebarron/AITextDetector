The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In 1874, the Federal Communications Commission placed a special control signal on commodored dirigible cargo planes that could be sent to the United States Air Force, but when the Air Force asked Lockheed to test it in the air — and the Department of Defense got wind of the premiums they were getting — that was closed. The Federal Communications Commission had also tried to use dirigibles to ship cargo at sea, but, again, none of the pilots who participated in the demonstration received the approval they were seeking. The new FCC regulation didn't require that aircraft have a special control signal, giving them the benefit of the doubt.

The question of whether aircraft equipped with a special control signal would ultimately be able to dock at Naval Station Norfolk can, more or less, be dismissed as absurd for only a few years. Though much of the research has devoted to the subject, most of the work has been put to the test in the mid-1980s, after the Navy had already tried to put two dirigibles between its ships. The first, the U.S. Navy's Nimitz 2, came closest to a successful test flight in the late seventies, a test the Navy hoped would go a long way toward ensuring that the U.S. Navy was well-trained at sailing its own ships.

Nor should that mean nimble aircraft will soon be able to dock at the Navy's
