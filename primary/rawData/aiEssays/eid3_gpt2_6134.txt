Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. Its effects are not as clear cut as other settings, but the fact that some people think they have a 'good' or 'bad' effect isn't one of them. (See also: How I got there... )

But there are three problems with that. First, it's not possible to know the overall effect until you do a full physical-data study from across the country to see how it can be changed. Second, the setting does not exist â€“ and so neither is it likely that you are going to get that effect. Third, even if the effect is well-documented and you have some experience with it, some people will try to use it instead. This is also why we recommend you take the approach of asking for detailed reports to determine if it works well for you.

I found something quite interesting. You can take the method of an actual study, like the ones below, from the New York Times' website, and look at it from a methodological standpoint. What we found was that participants chose very different scenarios (most people get the 'good' effect) and they chose very different results.

The best way to go about doing this is to make a detailed estimate of actual time that you go, then go down that path into data analysis.

Do this for people who have taken a short or long distance ride
