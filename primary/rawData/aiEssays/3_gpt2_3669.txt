This type of weight, on the other hand, has no effect on the ride. The bike's front suspension has a low, limited, fixed torque to assist in that particular task, which makes maintaining a straight line as difficult as possible.

Rider's Braking System

Rider's handling system is something we like to talk about in this article because we think it's incredibly fun, simple, enjoyable and provides a way for the rider to experience a ride in just two minutes. One can also get an idea of this from looking the 'Traffic Light' settings. When they add to these simple lines, riders who use that system can see that they're not at all hampered by the heavy gear, and they can keep improving their attitude and speed.

But first, we're interested in these two
