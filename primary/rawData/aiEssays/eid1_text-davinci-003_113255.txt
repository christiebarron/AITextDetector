Dear Editor,

I am writing to lend my opinion about the effects of computers on people, and to persuade your readers to agree with my assessment.

It is undeniable that computers have a great deal of advantages, particularly in our modern world. They save time, simplify processes, and increase the efficiency of many everyday activities. Businesses rely on computers for a wide range of tasks, and even students rely on them as a valuable academic tool.

However, it is also important to consider the potential downsides of computers. For example, many people spend too much time in front of screens, often without considering the potential long-term effects on their mental and physical health. Additionally, some people become so dependent on using technology that they have difficulty transitioning back to more traditional methods of doing things.

In conclusion, I believe we should use computers and other technology wisely and responsibly. We should recognize that, while technology can be a valuable asset, there can be harmful effects if used incorrectly or excessively.

I urge your readers to consider the positives and negatives of computers when debating on this issue.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
