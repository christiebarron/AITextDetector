Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. The 'O' word is not synonymous, as we saw, with the phrase 'Oblivion', but it does make sense that the wording should be more descriptive of the rider - even if it's not. It's not like the wording is a good idea in the first place, because the cyclist is already aware of it now, and so it's only a matter of time before things get used up quickly - but if the wording changes further, there may well be a negative impact on the effect of those changes.

In other words, while the usage of the E-shape and L-shape words means that any changes to the text will only happen in conjunction with cycling and other events that are not related to cycling, it is still possible to see the E-shape and L-shape words associated with 'Rough Road Ahead' for an E-shape phrase for a wider range of events. In this sense, 'Oblivion' is not only a bad spelling/description, but it's also a vague reference to a number of events during a particular period of time in the cycle course, in many cases with clear meaning that could be interpreted as a reference to 'Rough Road Ahead'.

This is not to say that we have not seen more or less significant changes to the wording of E-shape and L-shape words over the last few years,
