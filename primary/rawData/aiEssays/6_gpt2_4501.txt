The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One of the biggest was the fact that the roof was often not even partially roofed. It was difficult to find new roofs for dirigibles in New York City during this time. Several of the tallest towers in the Bronx were closed to dirigibles.

Reed's own grandfather, John Franklin, was the first dirigid to actually install them. He built his first and last of his twin dirigid cabins at a time in a single-story tower at 8th Ave. and Fifth St. It was there that the first dirigible was made. Eventually he came up with a plan that reduced the roof area to make room for an additional 8 and an an 18.

"It worked. It felt pretty good to go up, and it felt perfect to go down. It felt like an open platform," Reed said. "You could see how the canopy looks when you lift the roof up, and see how it looks during the day. It was very clean and finished quickly."

According to Reed, that final stage of the dirigid's life came in the form of a single passenger side taxi that made its way up the sides of the building. When the taxi came to a halt on Fifth and St. as it drove up, the driver took off, and the passenger's name was written on the front end of the cab. Reed was excited
