One time I was at a restaurant with my family and we were waiting a really long time for our food. Everyone was getting increasingly frustrated, but I stayed calm and reminded everyone that the restaurant was really busy and that our food would come eventually. After about 45 minutes, we finally got our food and everyone was relieved and grateful that I kept my calm and was patient.
