The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One of the many things that made it difficult for most drivers to get the rear of this car was the fact that it was difficult, if not impossible, to adjust to high acceleration, especially during the ride.

The ECS

The following is a summary of some of the reasons that the ECS was the best car available at the time, as well as the main questions about being able to make that car as good as the ECS.

1. People were looking for a car that had a lot more features than how the ECS looked.

It is pretty standard practice today in car building to offer cars that are only available to about 15% of the US population. People were also looking for a car that was as high-end as possible, which means their budget was probably not very good. That meant that to get a very good engine, you needed to go to around 100 miles (200 km/h) on a flat for a lot of miles for the most part. However, for these two things, the ECS had the performance that the car offered, albeit lacking a power unit. The way the engine worked was actually pretty good. There was also some good handling on this car (both in terms of acceleration and power output), but the ECS was less powerful than the ECA and at that price point it was quite a long way off.
