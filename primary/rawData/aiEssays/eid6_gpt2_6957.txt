The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The problem is that most of the materials inside had high melting points. In addition, the glass and wood of the building were in terrible condition (it is said, for example, that the roof broke out in 1936).

The buildings in the Empire State Building

The Empire State Building began in 1925. When the first dirigibles were introduced in 1926 they were used only for commercial purposes, with only 1.5 percent of their construction being dirigibles. After their introduction and continued use, the industry began to improve. For example, in 1927, dirigibles in the first two floors of the building were used for both a steam elevators and a gasoline locomotive. In addition, two of the 2nd floor's two engines were also named the "Aerofin and Oster."

When the first dirigibles were introduced in 1927, they were used only for commercial purposes, although the economy was booming. When the first dirigibles were introduced in 1928, they were used only for transport and business purposes. This trend has been continued in the present age in the Empire State Building, where an average of 2.7 dirigibles go on sale every year.

The Building Corporation (CC) in 1928 started the D-Bahn (which is also named after a French architect, Jean B. B. T. Bernet) as a project
