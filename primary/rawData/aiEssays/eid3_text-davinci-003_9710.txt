In "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski, the cyclist's experiences on the road are greatly affected by the environment that he is cycling through. The setting of the story is full of hills, valleys and winding roads, all of which put the cyclist at a natural disadvantage. While traversing these hills, the cyclist must fight against the angle of the incline in order to push his way up, and in doing so must put in a tremendous amount of strength and energy. This energy expenditure is wasted as the cyclist makes his way down the other side of the hill and the speed with which he descends further expends his strength and energy.

The winding roads also create an additional set of obstacles for the cyclist to overcome throughout the ride. These winding roads require the cyclist to constantly adapt his course of motion, which can further drain his stamina. Additionally, the wind created by the cyclist's inertia as he cycles through curves can add a level of resistance which further drains his energy and strength.

Overall, the setting of the story greatly affects the cyclist, forcing him to expend large amount of energy and strength as he cycles. The presence of hills drains his energy, while the winding roads require him to constantly adjust his course of motion. This constant energy expenditure can take its toll on the cyclist, and he must find ways to conserve his strength in order to complete the ride.
