My best friend and I have been inseparable since high school. Last year we decided to book a last minute getaway to California to celebrate our 10-year friendship. We booked a cabin in the woods far away from the city and technology. 

We explored the area, enjoyed the local cuisine, and laughed at all the ridiculous tourist traps we came across. 

On our last day, we decided to go for a hike. As we walked, we talked and laughed about old memories and our past. Then, we heard a loud roar. We thought it was thunder and kept walking. When we rounded the corner, we were met with a giant herd of deer! I grabbed my friend’s arm and his face showed pure shock and delight! 

We stood and watched as the deer made its way past us. We burst out laughing, not only at the sight of the deer but at our surprise. We couldn't believe what we had just experienced! We stood there for what felt like forever just taking it all in– the beauty of the nature before us, the incredible surprise, and the thought that our friendship was only going to get better in the years to come. 

That day, laughter, was the simplest language we spoke. It reaffirmed our relationship and was a reminder of why we had chosen to be there, together, in the wilderness of California.
