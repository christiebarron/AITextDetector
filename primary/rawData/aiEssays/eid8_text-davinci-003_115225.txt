Looking back, one of the fondest memories I have is the day my best friend and I had our first good laugh together.

We had been friends for a few months, but always careful around one another, as if we were both trying to be the one not to cross the line.

That day, after classes, I suggested we go to a new cafe that was surprisingly cheaper than the one we normally hung out at. Little did I know that this was the moment when we could finally just let loose.

The cafe was full of the most unique blend of music you could imagine, and my friend and I both commented on how surreal it was. After we both ordered our coffees and had swapped a few stories, I decided to joke around. 
I thought that maybe I could tease him about not having a romantic partner or something to that degree. 
I remember the exact moment he laughed at my lame jokeâ€”it was like a floodgate opened and suddenly conversations between us had become so much easier. 

Everything seemed to just come naturally. We found ourselves comfortably talking about our aspirations, cracking jokes at each other, and simply enjoying each other's company in the purest of forms. I'm grateful for that cafe and its weird yet beautiful music that allowed us to let loose and just laugh.
