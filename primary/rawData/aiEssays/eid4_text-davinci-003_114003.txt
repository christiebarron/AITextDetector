The author ends the poem with this line to suggest that the narrator is in the process of learning about the life cycle of the hibiscus and how things can come and go, and how the cycle of life is in flux. The narrator is using this knowledge to apply to his/her own life and suggest that it is important to keep trying, even when it seems impossible or unlikely. The repetition of the phrase - 'when they come back in the spring' - emphasizes this idea of resilience and re-starting.
