Computers have many effects on people. Their intelligence, their skills, the amount of time people spend talking to others, they all affect the way we interact, the ways we communicate. One thing that makes computers more interesting for us is the way they can alter our behavior for various reasons.

So even things we think people just think of as normal are actually more powerful than anything we know. Some people have just built great brains. But we all have some kind of superhuman ability that requires certain mental tricks that some people call "experiments" that are necessary for us to see the world around us, to see what we're doing, and to see what the things we can think through in a way that gives us the power to do that. You don't see it all as such, of course. So for people on the bottom two or three percent of the population, it's actually a really big deal.
