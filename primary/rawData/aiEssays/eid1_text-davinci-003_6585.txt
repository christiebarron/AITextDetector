Dear Editor,

I'm writing to share my opinion on the effects computers have had on people. As computers become increasingly prevalent in our society, many people are starting to become dependent on them.

One of the primary concerns I have is that people can become complacent relying on computers to do all of their work. This leads to people not developing the necessary skills to do certain tasks independently. Because computers are generally quite fast and efficient, people tend to use them instead of honing their own skills.

Additionally, people are beginning to place too much trust in computers. This can be especially dangerous when it comes to major decisions. People often rely on things like autopilot to do their thinking for them, and this can lead to poor decision making.

Finally, computers can be addictive, particularly in the world of online gaming, or social media. This can lead to people feeling isolated, or lead them to neglect important aspects of their lives.

Overall, computers are a wonderful tool that have granted us access to a wealth of information and resources. However, we must proceed with caution and discernment when using them and understand the potential problems that can arise when we rely too heavily on them. 

Sincerely,
