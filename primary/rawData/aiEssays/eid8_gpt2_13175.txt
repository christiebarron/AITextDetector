One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was in my teens and I didn't know what to say to it.

"Maybe it's not so funny if my mother says 'you're very funny. It's hard to stop laughing.' But sometimes I don't speak out."

A third time was with an autistic child, and she was very proud of who she was.

A fourth time was with a gay teenage boy, but felt that she might be more offended when someone made an obscene, homophobic remark.
