The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, the building had to be designed to be as durable as possible, so it posed a large and expensive barrier to vehicles. Second, despite the high cost of building dirigibles, the fact that they included a set of metal plates, made them more durable than the rest of the building. Finally, due to their small size compared to conventional building materials, some of these metal plates may have caused problems in the development process of the system. Ultimately, the builder decided to redesign the entire structure to make it lighter and more complete, which was quite the cost to the builder. In addition, there was a major safety issue with the feathers of the blades, a problem that was also addressed by the designers.

The Empire State Building was first constructed around December 1820. The first dirigible was installed in 1826. It was soon adopted as the standard of transport by the New York State Police and used the same model as the other dirigibles. This version of the Empire State Building (above) is displayed by a local builder for a period before being scrapped in 1863.
