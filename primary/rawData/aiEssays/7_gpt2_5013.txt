An example of a time someone in my life was patient was at the bottom of the bar, and I had the beer, so I had to take it off, and by the time I walked out the door, I knew what a beer was, because the bar was empty anyway, I was drinking my beer. I said "That's a waste of my time, it's a waste of money," and walked out and did a little tour of the bar.

That's when my family called – and there I was, in a glass case holding three bottles of beer, and I had spent all of that money, with all the debt I had, and I thought I should just say, "I just got my head together here, I'm going to be fine. When I see that it can all be resolved, I'm going to run for exploration in the beer world. If something can't happen to me, do nothing." I didn't want to get involved in that, and that is the way the beer industry is — to use the word money."

"When I had the beer, I realized I could afford it. That was a big breakthrough. I was thinking, I can buy a dozen for the next four years as a kind of "Hey, look! We Fill. We Fill. They Fill. We Fill. We'll give you it. We have to fill our own bottles." You can not go that far. You cannot just run it out
