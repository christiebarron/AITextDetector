The builders of the Empire State Building during the 1930s faced various obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The construction of the world's tallest building, overlooking New York City, brought with it a need for something unique and different. This is what propelled the constructors to break new ground in architecture and engineering by creating a mooring mast atop the building.

The design of the mooring mast was quite intricate, as it had to be thin enough to not significantly disrupt the airflow and cause turbulence for the dirigibles, yet wide enough to directly support the docking cable. In addition, because the mooring mast was to artfully act as an anchor for the giant airships, the construction crew had to take into account the mast's strength and durability - it had to be engineered to withstand outward forces, enabling the dirigibles to successfully dock and persevere.

Furthermore, due to the weight of the dirigibles, the mooring mast also had to be able to consistently support its structure's massive load when the dirigible was in the dock, as well as the additional load created by high gusts of wind. This became the most challenging feat of engineering for the builders, as not only did they have to design a mooring mast that could be mechanically strong enough to handle such a large aircraft, but also elegant to the eye. 

Ultimately, the Empire State Building builders were able to overcome all the obstacles and
