Dear Editor,

As computer technology continues to advance, it has become an integral part of our lives. Yet, there still remains much debate regarding the positive and negative effects of computers on people.

I believe that computers have had a mostly positive influence on people. It has allowed us to stay connected to family and friends near and far by providing communication services such as email, Skype, or social media sites. Also, computers enable us to access vast amounts of knowledge in a more efficient manner. Rather than having to search through a library's shelves, all one needs to do is press a few keys to find exactly what they are looking for.

On the other hand, many people are concerned with the potential risks of computers and the Internet. The most common risk is from viruses, spyware, and identity theft. Fortunately, these threats are quite easily avoided with the installation of proper software and a firewall.

In conclusion, the impact of computers on people is mostly beneficial in nature. People are able to stay more connected to their community, as well as access a vast amount of information quickly. Despite potential risks from computer viruses and other threats, these issues can be easily avoided with a few simple precautions.
