The line at the end of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho reflects the narrator's courage and resilience in the face of adversity. Despite the fact that she has not passed the test yet, she remains hopeful for the future, knowing that she will have another chance to try again in the spring. The imagery of the snows melting and the return of the geese serves as a reminder that despite hardship, life inevitably continues and that hope always exists. It also reflects the feeling of renewal and rebirth that the coming of spring represents.
