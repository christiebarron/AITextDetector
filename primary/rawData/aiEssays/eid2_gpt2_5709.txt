I believe that censorship of materials in libraries and museums is a huge problem in the future, especially considering that more and more people are starting to get used to it.

How did you find that link to a forum on the right-wing news site Breitbart that criticized censorship of your art?

I found this forum (https://www.buzzfeed.com/Ralph/Banned-Art-Art) in 2012. It was so far from the mainstream, there were no links, and many of the users were either trolls or otherwise ignorant because there was no such site for anything about art or culture. It's actually quite amazing.

You said that the left's anti-freedom of speech is so overrated that it's worth the trouble. Is that correct?

You mentioned the Left's ability to reach out to "right-wing" types like myself. I certainly think they're better at getting their news across than any of the Tea Party and 'nuff, right-wing groups that currently exist across the political spectrum.

You even tweeted a petition asking that you step down. Can you share your feelings about who should step down so that you may be able to help make an impact, right now, at the moment?

My position is that my position on my current position on how to influence what the left does is completely not clear. For one thing, I do not want our position on politics to be influenced by politics.
