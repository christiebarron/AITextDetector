Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects of computers on our society. Computers are being used in countless ways and are becoming more integral to everyday life. 

People may think that computers bring only positive benefits, but there could be serious consequences depending on use. Increased computer use is leading to many changes in individuals’ behavior. When people become engrossed in computer activities, they are often less involved in interpersonal human activities. In addition, extended computer use has a detrimental effect on people’s physical health and mental wellbeing. 

We must be aware of the negative impacts of computer activities and limit our use of these machines. We need to be aware of how often we spend hours on our devices and take breaks away from our screens to ensure we take proper care of our bodies, socialize, and stay connected to our environment. 

At the same time, computers can be used as a constructive and educational tool. With the right restrictions and guidance, computers can be used as a great source of entertainment which is free of the dangers posed by addictive online gaming, as well as a valuable source of knowledge and information, which can cultivate creativity and innovative ways of thinking.
