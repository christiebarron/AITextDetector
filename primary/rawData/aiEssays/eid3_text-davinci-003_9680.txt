In Joe Kurmaski's short story "Rough Road Ahead," the setting is a critical factor in the cyclist's experience. Whether it's the intimidating darkness of the night or the boundless nature of the countryside, each feature of the story's setting is intended to create a tense atmosphere.

The darkness of the night increases the cyclist's sense of vulnerability. As he navigates the empty and unknown roads, the darkness makes him even more conscious of the potential dangers lurking in the shadows. He is also farther away from civilization and help, as he cycles an apparently infinite distance in search of comfort and safety.

The vast expanse of the countryside demonstrates the cyclist's physical and mental journey. More than being another obstacle to be conquered, the long road with its winding curves and uneven surface serves as an obstacle to be faced, a test of his physical and mental strength as he pushes on through the night. The danger of the situation is further magnified by his commitment to the journey, as he continues well past his own physical and mental limits.

The stark reality of the setting with its threatening darkness and daunting topography leaves no room for doubt that the cyclist faces an uphill battle. Every twist in the road poses a challenge and each rise is met with determination. Ultimately, the setting serves to illustrate the cyclist's bravery, as he conquers his fear and takes control of his own destiny.
