Dear Editor:

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects of computers technology on people. I believe computers have had a dramatic effect on the way we work, communicate, and live our lives.

The use of computers has had positive effects that have enabled us to be more productive in our day to day lives. They have allowed us to quickly and easily access information from virtually any location, as well as allow us to store and process large amounts of data. Additionally, computers have changed the way we work and collaborate in business settings, allowing us to communicate with far-reaching clients or colleagues in real-time while also reducing the amount of paperwork and manual effort required to perform tasks.

Having said that, I also recognize the negative aspects associated with computers. They have created a distance between us, potentially leading to a lack of meaningful interpersonal dialogue. Spending excessive amounts of time in front of a computer can lead to physical and mental health issues, such as decreased physical activity, eyestrain, and stress.

Given my opinion, I strongly urge readers to consider the implications of computer technology on society. It can be an amazing boon to productivity, however, we should not forget to explore the social and physiological consequences of over-reliance on a single technology.

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
