 

When I was a child, my family would spend the holidays at my grandparent's house. On one particular Christmas, my sister and I were playing hide and seek. We had just finished searching the entire house and we were gathering back together around the living room when, suddenly, my grandfather's festive rug and rug roller slipped out from beneath his feet. He fell backwards and hit his head with a thud, sending us into an uproar of laughter! 

At first, my sister and I tried desperately to control ourselves, but my grandfather's attempts to get up from the floor only made us laugh harder. After a few minutes of this, my grandfather managed to regain his composure and join us in our laughter. 

The three of us laughed together long and hard that day, and it was the perfect beginning of a very special holiday. It reminded us all about the joys and laughter that can come from a family just spending time together. That's a memory that will forever stay with me.
