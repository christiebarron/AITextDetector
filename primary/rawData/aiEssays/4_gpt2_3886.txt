The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because the other characters are completely removed from it. So many scenes were lost when they left or were replaced. This book makes these characters completely irrelevant - these are the characters at the forefront of their stories. There is not even a mention of them in the whole book. Even in the end when The Hijab Chronicles ends, they are completely insignificant. In the end, when they are back in the family tree, they are completely forgettable. A story can be about not having been a member of the family. A story can be about not having known anything. It is not a story about being a woman or a man or anything for that matter. These are the characters in the book. They are not even there in the book. As someone who has read the book over a long period of time I can understand their feelings. It is not clear whether the characters are merely there to make up a story or that they were completely unaware or confused by it. I can only believe for a moment that these characters felt confused because they didn't know that this book was supposed to be about a family but they were still confused. I think even the characters that were completely removed from the story in Winter Hibiscus make up a character in the book, who is also the narrator of the HORROR that is happening in the family tree. I saw these characters back when I was actually reading the book. I have been in such a mood
