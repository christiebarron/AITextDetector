Dear Editor,

I am writing to discuss the effects that computers have had on people in our area. As technology has become more accessible, computers are being used more and more frequently and can be found in many homes. 

I have noticed that these gadgets have changed how people communicate and think, and I believe that this has had mostly positive effects on them. People can stay connected with friends and family through social media, and computers help them stay organized and manage their tasks easily. They can also improve their knowledge and find information quickly and efficiently. 

Furthermore, computers provide users with a great amount of entertainment. People don't have to leave their homes to indulge in a hobby or watch movies anymore; they just need to using their computers.

Finally, computers make communication faster and allow people to work remotely. This helps people in the workplace become more productive and efficient, paving way for new advancements or business opportunities.

All in all, I believe that people have benefited from the use of computers, and I urge readers to agree with me. 

Sincerely, 

[Name]
