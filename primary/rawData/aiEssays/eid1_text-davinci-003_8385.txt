I recently had a long day at work after I had to stay late to finish a project. I was already tired and when I got home, I walked into a messy house. I was incredibly frustrated and wanted to scream at everyone, but I knew it wouldn’t do any good. 

Instead I decided to take a deep breath and stay patient. I began to clean up the living room and bit by bit the mess began to disappear. I took my time and calmly talked to my family about cleaning up after themselves. 

It took a few hours of cleaning to finally get the house in order, but I was proud of myself for managing my anger and remaining patient. By doing so, I was able to keep my cool instead of having a big argument. I’m glad I decided to be the bigger person and stay patient in the situation.
