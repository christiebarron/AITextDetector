Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

One example is with certain scenarios where people are doing a'slow run' of three kilometres or more and the cyclist hits the brakes and goes 'walk' â€“ meaning that, at very worst, and on a much wider scale of traffic, the 'walk' is not going well.

There is also the issue of the speed of the cyclist. There is, of course, no doubt that speed is a subjective factor, given the nature of the individual cyclist. But, in this case, there is no doubt that the speed of some cycling drivers - and the conditions where drivers come and are involved, on a daily basis, with their speed - affects their quality of life.

So why are so many cyclists in rough roads and on the road at very high speeds? When given these circumstances, there is virtually no difference in driving ability among people who enjoy these road conditions as different drivers do the same kinds of stunts and use the same kind of braking techniques.

For this analysis to be as accurate as possible, these particular situations are likely to be unique to the particular group of people who ride with the highest risk of injury and death and do, in fact, play a substantial role in cycling safety.

However, they are also likely to be unique to a particular individual who does not ride alone with higher levels of risk.

This means that at varying times,
