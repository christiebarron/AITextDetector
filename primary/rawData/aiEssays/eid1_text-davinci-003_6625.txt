Dear Editor,

I'm writing this letter to express my opinion on the effects of computers on people. In recent years, computers have become an integral part of our lives, and it's undeniable that computers have had a profound impact on how we work, socialize, and communicate.

The positive effects of computers are often discussed. Computers are efficient tools for streamlining processes, providing data quickly and accurately. They also save us time and give us access to vast amounts of information. Computers have enabled us to collaborate with people from around the world and learn new skills rapidly.

However, I feel that the drawbacks to computers are often overlooked. By relying heavily on computers, we have become increasingly isolated from face-to-face interactions. Computers can also create a feeling of removed disconnection and can be distracting, hindering our ability to focus on tasks.

Ultimately, it's important to recognize the potential perils that come with computers and strive to find a balance between the benefits and risks of their use. As such, I encourage everyone to engage in meaningful discussions and activities that require face-to-face interactions, instead of just relying on computers.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
