I was visiting my grandparents a few years ago when they asked me to help out in their garden. I had never done any garden work before, so I was a bit uncertain about what to do. I told them this, and they replied that it was okay, that they would show me what to do and it would take some time.

Their patience was remarkable: every step of the way, they took the time to explain what to do and to answer any questions I had. With their help, I managed to rake up the leaves, plant some vegetables and flowers, weed the garden and water it too. After a few hours of working together, the garden was looking its best!

I'm very thankful for their patience that day. Not only did it help me learn a bunch of gardening skills, but I was able to spend a fun day with my grandparents, which I will never forget.
