Fourth, because the Empire State Building was divided into a number of small rooms, a separate corridor between the other two buildings (which makes no sense) has never been used.

It is likely that most of the major design problems with the Empire State Building arise from other reasons: The building is poorly designed, and the building often overlooks many of the buildings.
