Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my view on the effects that computers have had on people in today's society. In my opinion, computers have both positive and negative effects on people. 

On one hand, computers are an indispensable tool for communication, research and information sharing. Through the internet, people can access an abundance of resources and connect with others who are geographically distant from them. Computers enable us to explore a wide variety of topics, learn in innovative ways and have access to a diverse array of information. 

On the other hand, computers can have a psychological impact on people. Spending too much time in front of a computer can lead to eye strain and headaches. When used improperly, computers can also lead to certain addictions such as gaming or social media. Excessive usage can also lead to sleep deprivation, anxiety and depression. 

Although computers can offer many opportunities and advantages, it is important to use them responsibly and to practice self-control. Manage your time wisely and prioritize other activities, such as exercising, socializing and enjoying the outdoors. This will also lead to a balanced lifestyle.

I believe that computers offer wonderful opportunities for creativity and knowledge but we must be mindful of our usage and put restrictions on our own computer habits. 

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
