The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Some had argued that the towers were too small to carry a large fleet of aircraft, while others called for massive ships to dock.

The dome remained a secret for some time, and the public could never tell the architect who designed it. During World War II, plans led to several changes to the building. Large scale installation of heavy trucks with heavy load bearing units to take off from military bases was made to meet the requirements. When World War II progressed, the construction industry changed its orientation from a commercial sector to a commercial-industrial sector.
