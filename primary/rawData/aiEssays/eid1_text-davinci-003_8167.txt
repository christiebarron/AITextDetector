The construction of the Empire State Building presented a unique problem for the engineers and builders of the building â€“ allowing dirigibles to dock. While the idea of a mooring mast having the capability to allow a dirigible, or airship, to dock on the top of the building was a daring prospect, it required careful planning in order to be effectively executed.

The first obstacle the builders faced was the fact that the Empire State Building had yet to be completed. In order for a mooring mast to be effective in allowing dirigibles to dock safely, the mast needed to be accurately fixed to the building. However, the construction of the Empire State Building did not take this into account. The original plans for the building had not included the mooring mast, so the engineers and builders needed to account for the change.

The second obstacle the builders needed to overcome was related to the height of the building, as the mooring mast had to be tall enough to allow for the dirigible to dock safely. This was a difficult challenge because the mast would need to be tall enough to reach the highest point of the dirigible, but not be so tall that it compromised the structural integrity of the building, something which was essential to consider due to the fact that the mast would only be as strong as the foundation of the building.

The final obstacle builders faced was the need for the mooring mast to be able to withstand strong winds. Without
