The construction of the Empire State Building presented new opportunities for construction techniques and public transportation in the form of dirigibles docking within the building’s spire. In order to make this feature a reality, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles. This essay will discuss some of these challenges, as described in Marcia Amidon Lusted’s “The Mooring Mast: The Exciting Story of the Empire State Building’s Dirigible Dock.” 

First, the builders of the Empire State building needed the approval of the US Department of Commerce and the Post Office Department. The US Department of Commerce had long been hesitant about allowing dirigibles to dock in New York City, due to the potential risk of disaster. Luckily for the Empire State Building builders, they were able to get the necessary approvals after convincing the department that they had taken extra safety precautions to minimize potential risks.

Second, constructing the mooring mast itself was a challenge. Dirigibles were much larger than any other flying vehicles. Therefore, designing and building an extra-large mast that could securely hold the size and weight of a dirigible presented an engineering dilemma. To solve it, the Empire State Building engineers used a roller bracket system which could rotate to support the dirigible and raise it up when it was no longer in use. 

The third obstacle was purely economic. As the 1930s were a time of economic hardship, the Empire
