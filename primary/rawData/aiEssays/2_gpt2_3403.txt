It was also clear that the Library Service would be the focus of such material. The majority of the material would have been distributed at book-readings, and thus much of this work would have been limited to a few pages per day on a small group level. The Library Service was clearly a tool that was meant to be abused by the government. It was not intended to be a simple censorship operation. With little knowledge of the situation in Vietnam, one might be reasonably tempted to interpret it as censorship of publications. On many levels, there could be no other way. We know, however, that the Library Service did the best it could with its limited resourcesâ€”for example, it distributed most of their work to an individual library within the U.S. It did not simply hand us this material. Instead, as we argued in our book, if they did it well, that means they did so well because they were involved in a system of government that made many of the articles available through our organization possible. We believe that the Library Service was an important part of this system if it had not operated under the full force of its government.

These lessons continue to be applied by many organizations today. They have found it easy for Americans to
