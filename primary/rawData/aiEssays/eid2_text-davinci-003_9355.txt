As readers and patrons of the local library, we must address the growing concern of censorship in libraries. It has become clear to many that particularly controversial materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, are increasingly targeted by those in power as objects to be removed from libraries.

Critics of censorship in libraries argue that if a book is offensive, no one should be forced to buy or read it. Others argue that censoring certain materials confines our knowledge and thwarts the progress that society has made in terms of civil liberties. While it is a reasonable position to refuse to buy or read an offensive book, censoring a book simply because it is considered “offensive” is an act of censorship in itself.

To censor a book or any other medium of communication is a form of censorship in itself. It is not only a violation of the First Amendment to the Constitution, but it is also a massive infringement on our rights as citizens of a free society. When someone is prevented from accessing or reading certain materials, it suppresses the ability of knowledge-seekers to understand a wide range of topics and is a violation of their right to informed opinion. 

Furthermore, prohibiting individuals from accessing or reading certain materials limits the right to expression and restricts our primary understanding of our society and its culture. It also limits the diversity of our reading material. If we cannot read different perspectives, our narrow viewpoint may prevent us from understanding a variety of topics.
