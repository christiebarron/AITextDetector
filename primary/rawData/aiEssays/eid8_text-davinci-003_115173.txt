I'll never forget the first time I laughed with my best friend. We had grown up together since grade school, but it had never felt quite like this before. We were in high school at the time, and we were out exploring the city when a silly idea popped into my head.

I decided to randomly turn around and yell "Look out!" into the people walking down the sidewalk behind us. My best friend was so startled by my outburst that he immediately burst out into laughter. I couldn't help but join in, and this was the first time we really shared a good laugh together.

Since that moment, I can look back and recognize how important laughter has been to our friendshipâ€”we can be serious and somber at times, sure, but the moments that bring us together and make us truly happy are the funny little interactions that happen between us. We always come back to laughter as a way to reconnect with each other in an easy, effortless way.

It's a reminder that just a little bit of silliness can go a long way.
