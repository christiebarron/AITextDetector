An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a man I met at a bar. I found him there about 8:00am and he was sitting there by the side of the room in a t-shirt, talking about food issues and all that, and he asked me to put him on the ice and he wasn't happy about that. So I put him on the ice for about ten minutes and he couldn't hold it up. So I put the puck outside and then when I saw the play he ran up in the lane and we took turns hitting the boards and he got on top again and he got on top and got down, I think he's a little bit sad. He came up to me and I just was laughing because I thought that was not going to go down that well when it happened at the end of the game and he was right out of his mind. It was just just great for the whole family."

The Ducks return to town on Saturday and will be back in action on Monday. More on their schedule is forthcoming.
