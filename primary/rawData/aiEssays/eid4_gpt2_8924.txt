The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because the title gives you back hope that the world will follow this version of me. While my hope is to not get trapped, it also encourages us to change. I may be as hardline as not-so-hardy as you. And I know as much to some extent about growing, as I am one who's been living it. In our conversations, most have been the same: I am not sure when, where, or how we will become. The longer we're in school, the more you become immersed in being more open. You begin to accept the truth that you aren't alone, and you can't hold back. It may seem contradictory for two reasons: For a while, you thought you weren't alone, and for a while now, you were. I have become more and more aware of the world around me. The book opens with one story, and with three characters, each of whom has a different name. We become more connected, because our lives are intertwined. It becomes more and more clear over time that they're not just my one, but everyone else's. I wonder if my father or my brother are the one who has created these three characters; maybe my mother or my grandmother? I feel like I'm growing into my own reality, like I know everyone I'll meet on the street, from all the things that I don't want to do and the things I'd rather not do
