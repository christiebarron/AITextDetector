An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was in the hospital for an emergency. We had to put a block through an old wall and we needed a stretcher. Everyone I knew thought it was a good idea. I was a nice person, but no one knew if I was good or bad because I wasn't. I knew I'd need a lot of care and support to make this happen. Then a new time came. I found out that I had an incurable cancer just the other night and after I told my family, I felt great and I was in good spirits. There were only two things that seemed to be working out. I had a new family that came in the next month, and it was a great feeling. I never felt I needed new support because I was growing up and getting a new life.

How did you become so optimistic after having such a horrible experience? Did there really not exist so much negativity about who youlining?

I feel that we need a lot of positive people to see who we are because we share our story. There are so many positive people who have worked in this role and they would like to be part of the whole project. One person's life story can only be as much about who they were as it is about who they've been. I am extremely optimistic that we can get past those negative things and be successful in a positive way.

It's nice to hear your story and
