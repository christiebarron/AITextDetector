Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

First and foremost, the setting is a useful tool for ensuring your ability to safely steer and get on the ground in situations where you would be well advised to stay off the ground. To encourage and promote safe driving you can set up a Road School (under the RTA's road testing program) and then a Safety Car (with you riding behind or near the Road School).

Secondly, setting up an RTA Road School at a designated place for a range of safety, road development, and urban use functions is essential to maximise the benefits to the city and region. Whether you are an experienced mechanic or more experienced at a 'road school' setting up, you should do it soon.

What is a 'Rough Road Ahead'?

'Rough Road Ahead' is a term coined by the Society for the Advancement of Car Driver Training (SADDL), a non-profit and professional advisory society. It refers to a situation that appears or is likely to be to the advantage of one or more drivers working in a safe and appropriate manner on a given day.

We use the term loosely as a way of saying 'we want to see road development happen'."

It allows for some comfort: we know how safe road fabrication and car maintenance are and our clients expect us to take every precaution to ensure their safety.
