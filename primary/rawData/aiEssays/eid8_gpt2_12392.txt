One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I saw that one funnyman in my life was wearing a very long, long hair tie, and I took some pictures of my hair. In the pictures they said she was from Scotland, and, then I found out how much she likes to smoke. I felt my life began to fade out of sight. It lasted about 24 hours.

This man was trying to sell me cigarettes by saying he's got some of my gold. If you see him in the news you'll see he's selling my gold. I was sitting in my office talking to him. He said he wants about 2,000 bitcoins. I went and bought his gold. He said, "Hey, you see he's just about worth it." I then put the Bitcoin on and we went to the store and bought a second piece of mine. About 300 bitcoins.

And he said, "We'll sell you half of those coins if you want them for 50 cents on the dollar." So he was selling me half of them, of my gold. So I went to give him his 20 dollars and he got off. And then he said, "Well, you know what, if you want the money, put in one of my coins and you get 50 cents on the dollar." So I think that was my greatest moment in my life.
