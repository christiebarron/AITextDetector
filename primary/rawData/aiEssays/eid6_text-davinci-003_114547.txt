The Empire State Building was the worldâ€™s tallest building when it opened in 1931, and its height and design made it a prime candidate for use as a docking station for dirigibles, now commonly known as airships. However, there were many challenges that had to be overcome by the builders in order to allow dirigibles to dock. 

One of the first issues to consider was the construction of the building itself. Building designs and materials in the early 1900s would prove inadequate to be able to keep the large and heavy airships from crashing into the tower if the wind shifted or if the dirigible was coming on the wrong angle. Special consideration had to be given to the strength of the building to be able to handle the added weight of a large airship. 

Once the construction was secure, the Empire State Building had to be outfitted with a platform for dirigibles to dock on. A suspension system was developed, relying on large mooring posts - similar to those found in body of water - to secure the airships to the building. This system used very thin steel wires that could support the weight of a large airship despite the wind resistance. These had to be regularly maintained in order to ensure the safety of the dirigibles. 

Finally, the air traffic had to be managed in such a way to avoid airships colliding with one another while disembarking or embarking from the tower. Navigation systems and safety
