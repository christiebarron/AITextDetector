Dear Editor,

I am writing in regards to the significant effect computers have upon people in today’s world and how this has become a growing concern. Computers have become pervasive in our lives and it is undeniable that the impact of these devices is having a significant influence on us as a society.

There is no question that computers have made life easier in numerous ways. For instance, they enable us to communicate more quickly and access information from all around the world. Computers can also make our daily work and school life simpler and more productive. However, an excessive use of computers can have detrimental effects on people’s wellbeing. Long hours spent in front of a computer screen lead to fatigue and eye strain. This can lead to lower productivity and a host of other health-related issues.

Moreover, too much time in front of a computer can cause people to become socially isolated. They might miss out on meaningful interactions with real people and miss out on valuable experiences, such as outdoor activities or sports. Furthermore, too much computer usage can lead to an increase in disturbing content, such as pornographic material and other unhealthy habits.

We should strive to use computers in a responsible and balanced manner. Taking breaks from screens, getting plenty of fresh air, and engaging in meaningful conversations should be encouraged. I believe our local communities have a responsibility to promote a healthy use of computers and to create more opportunities for people to engage in healthy alternatives to computer use.
