I remember the day like it was yesterday: my friend and I had just finished our shift at work and we decided to grab coffee on the way home. I could tell the workday had been particularly trying for her, so I decided to inject a bit of lightheartedness into the conversation. I began to tell her a funny story about something that had happened to me, and before I knew it, we were both in fits of laughter. 

It was only then that I realised how much of a stress reliever it was for both of us. The stress of the long day that had just passed us by, seemed to magically disappear in those few moments of laughter. It was like a mini victory for both of us - the kind of victory that comes from finding something to laugh about, even in the midst of a challenging situation.

From that day forward, I decided that incorporating a bit of laughter into our daily lives would be a great way to strengthen our friendship and bond with one another. It was the laughter that ultimately taught us that no matter what obstacles and challenges life may throw our way, we are never truly alone as long as we have each other to laugh with.
