The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it goes beyond its opening story; it begins to explore these and more aspects of the world in new ways. For a book that has been criticized for having been difficult, it has some of the best writing in the business. There's a chapter called "Weird Science on the Road" where Stephen King and I discuss how this is a great thing to deal with on this page. It gives a better sense of how to approach a world that continues on for many, many years, to see different sides and things that need to be looked at. This is interesting and one I'm glad my husband and I have discovered.
