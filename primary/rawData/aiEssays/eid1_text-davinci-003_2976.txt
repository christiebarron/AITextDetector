Dear Editor,

I am writing to you today to express my thoughts on the effects computers have on people. It's no surprise that technology, such as computers, have impacted our lives in ways unimaginable. Whether it's for entertainment, work, or communication, computers have become an essential part of daily life for many. 

However, it is important to be aware of the potential effects that computers can have on us. Excessive use can lead to symptoms of depression, isolation, and anxiety. More and more studies are emerging that suggest a correlation between peopleâ€™s reliance on computers and mental health issues.

I believe that by carefully managing the amount of time people spend on computers, they can benefit in positive ways. Children today are fascinated by computers and often rely on them for their education. This is why I suggest parents should put more emphasis on ensuring their children get ample playtime in order to gain other skills and experience different activities outside of computers. 

Furthermore, it is beneficial to adults to have moments of rest, away from screens. Taking the time to be with friends and family, or embracing a variety of activities has been proven to have a calming effect on the mind and body.
