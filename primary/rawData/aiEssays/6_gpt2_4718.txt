The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One major obstacle was how many of the passengers, including workers and visitors, the state building's occupants were needed to lift and haul what they wanted to. Another obstacle was the lack of a runway at the height of the Empire State Building. Another obstacle was the lack of a runway at the height of the Empire State Building.

The first and final challenge was a huge amount of material—mostly concrete and glass—to cut wood. The next difficulty was also getting the same kind of material as the rest of the building, including concrete and glass. Even so, only about 40 percent of the original construction materials were available to cut, much of the remaining 15 percent was recycled, according to the World Resources Institute.

After the first challenge was completed, the state building and nearby towers began to be demolished, and the building's buildings were quickly put back on the public market. According to a report by the World Resources Institute, an estimated 400 to 420 people died in New York City in 2009 alone.

New York City's collapse marked an important milestone in this study.

The New York State Buildings Museum and Preservation Commission voted unanimously this spring to consider demolishing the Empire State Building. The preservation group's proposal is still awaiting final approval from City of New York, breaking ground this month.
