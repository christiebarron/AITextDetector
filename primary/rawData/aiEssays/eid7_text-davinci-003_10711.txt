I recently had a situation where I had to be very patient. It was the middle of a busy workday and I was trying to get some paperwork done. But, my boss had made some last minute requests that added to my workload. I had a lot of stress and anxiety about getting it done, but I knew that I had to maintain a sense of patience. I took deep breaths and reminded myself that things take time and that it would be ok if it wasn't perfect. I continued my work slowly and steadily, and eventually the paperwork was completed. I was relieved and proud of myself for being patient even in the midst of a stressful situation.
