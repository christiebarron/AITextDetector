Dear Editor, 

As technology continues to become more advanced, computers and devices have become an integral part of our lives. But in spite of their incredible capabilities, it's important to remember the effects that computer usage has on people.

Recently, I have noticed many people becoming preoccupied with their computer and device usage. They often spend hours on end connected to the internet, and very little time engaging in dialogue with other people. This has created a detrimental effect on our communication skills, as well as our physical and mental health.

It has been proven that prolonged computer usage can lead to physical health issues such as back pain, carpal tunnel, and even obesity. Mental health concerns, including depression and insomnia, are also associated with too much screen time.

I believe that it is our responsibility to regulate our computer usage, taking into consideration the possible negative side effects. We can lessen these effects by limiting the amount of time spent online, and using the time we do spend on the computer to be productive.

I urge everyone to take responsibility for their health and be mindful of the time they spend on their computers. Let's stay connected but also remain aware of the potential implications of our tech usage.

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
