The construction of the Empire State Building in 1931 was a feat of engineering and determination. Although the building was not originally designed to accommodate dirigibles, the engineers and builders seeking to incorporate this feature faced several challenges. “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted explains the obstacles builders faced in creating the Empire State Building's mooring mast, allowing dirigibles to dock.

The first obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building had to face was the building’s structural design. The steel frame of the building itself was not well-suited to hold the weight of a dirigible. Due to this, the designers’ had to modify the building’s structure, a process that took two weeks, to create supports that would properly support the weight of a docking dirigible.

The second obstacle builders faced when creating the mooring mast was the need for a tall, sturdy mast that could provide a safe landing for the dirigibles. In order to build a 196-foot sturdy mast, the engineers had to reconcile two issues. First, they had to figure out how to construct the mast without damaging the structure of the building; and second, they had to ensure the mast could withstand gusty winds that weren’t a factor when the building was originally constructed. The builders solved both of these issues by creating a mast out of stainless steel eight feet in diameter and installing it in a specially-designed
