The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Before construction of the structure opened, the Empire State Building underwent several revisions. One version of the building was more than 15 feet to the side, although it was removed during construction, allowing more room for elevator traffic. Two versions also had to be erected, and one, called the Empire State Building and Gardens, had nearly the same height as the building before its collapse. Both versions have been restored to their original proportions, with one more large than the other, and the courtyard executive. The main staircase is now a single story or 4 stories high, and the second steps are divided into six sections, each of which runs from a single row of stairs, as seen in the following photo. The design changed with the end of the first building, but the first was nearly the same level as in the Empire State Building (as far as we were concerned). A second version was finally built near the old building in 1929. The third version came up in 1945, but it never went through development as a separate building, with all its work done on separate floors, and being moved to a new, privately owned building (the Great Hall). Only the Empire State Building, the building directly below the Great Hall, is still standing on top of the old building today. The three original building versions were later replaced by the Empire State Tower at the corner of East Ninth Street and Broadway. One of them was constructed in 1952
