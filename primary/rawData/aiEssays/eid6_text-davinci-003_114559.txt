The Empire State Building in New York City was the first structure in America specifically designed with dirigible docking capabilities. Despite its lofty ambition, the building’s engineers and builders faced numerous challenges in their quest to make this a reality. 

The primary issue to overcome was the enormous size of the dirigible, which would be much larger than the small balloon-like craft humans had used in the past. The Empire State Building was originally designed as a traditional skyscraper, leaving it ill-equipped to handle the bulk of these large airships. In order to provide safe mooring, the building needed to add a structure called a “mooring mast.” This presented several technical issues, including the need to construct steel towers atop the building, as well as modifications to the windows and facade.

Another issue was the sheer height of the building itself, which posed a difficult challenge for the dirigible captains. On the day of the building’s grand opening, several dirigibles attempted to dock, only to find that the extreme height of the building compared to their usual route pattern made it too hard to control the airship’s altitude. To rectify this, the engineers had to professionally install the dirigible mast and devise a plan requiring captains to approach the Empire State Building from the East, rather than the usual West, in order to make navigation easier.

In order to complete their mission, the Empire State Building builders and
