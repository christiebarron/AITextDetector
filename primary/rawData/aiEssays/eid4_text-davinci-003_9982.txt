The speaker in Winter Hibiscus wants to show the passing of time, and how time can bring forth change. At the start of the poem, the speaker talks about being afraid of failing a test, but by the end of the poem, the speaker regains confidence in preparing for the test. By ending the poem with the hope that the hibiscus blooms in the spring, the speaker wants to imply that this test will be taken in a time with better prospects. The hibiscus is a symbol for change, rebirth, and new beginnings. When the speaker looks to the hibiscus in the spring and sees it blooming, she will have regained the confidence to take the test.
