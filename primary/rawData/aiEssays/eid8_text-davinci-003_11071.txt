I was walking to the corner store to pick up some snacks for a movie night with my friends when I noticed a middle aged couple walking in the opposite direction. As we got closer to each other, I noticed their smiles. We passed each other, but the man said something funny under his breath. Instinctively, I turned around to find the couple bursting out with laughter. I couldn't help but laugh out loud as well. This made them laugh even harder, so much so that the man had tears streaming down his face. 

I couldn't help but smile. I continued on my way to the store, but I couldn't forget the sound of their laughter. In that moment, I realized how powerful a simple joke can be. It can bring two people together and turn strangers into friends. 

At the end of the night, my friends and I talked about the couple we saw and we all agreed that we need joy, laughter, and humor to get through the tough times in life. We went to bed with smiles on our faces that night, grateful for simple moments like that.
