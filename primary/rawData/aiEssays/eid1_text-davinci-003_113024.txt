Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the massive impact computers have in our lives today. As computer technology has advanced, so has our society's reliance on computers – for work, entertainment, communication, and research. 

From a business standpoint, computers have made us more efficient and our operations faster. Incorporating computers into the workplace has allowed us to complete tasks quickly and accurately. On a personal level, computers can provide hours of entertainment that fulfill our need for mental stimulation and stimulation of the senses. Whether it’s solving puzzles on your tablet, playing video games, or watching movies, computers provide an effective outlet for our daily needs.

Computers have also completely revolutionized communication, both privately and publicly. Sharing and exchanging information instantly connects us and gives us a sense of belonging. Social networking and email provide us with an avenue to express our thoughts and opinions as metaphors to our culture.

Most importantly, computers have opened the door for scientific research and knowledge. Science, mathematics, and medicine are all quickly advancing due to our access to vast amounts of data at our fingertips. Computers have allowed us to push the limits of scientific knowledge and discover truths that would be impossible without computers.

In conclusion, computers are a tool that drastically changes and improves our everyday lives. I firmly believe that the impacts of computer use are more positive than negative.

Thank you for your consideration and for reading my point of view.
