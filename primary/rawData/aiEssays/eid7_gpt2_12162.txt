An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a woman who did not have cancer; she took a pill from the patient. They had chemotherapy in the early 1980s, and they were doing very well. She died. We know she died of chemotherapy by the time we're 50. And I'm not saying this means the cancer didn't pass. I'm suggesting it probably was a bit different. There are certain times when in her life she'd say her life was good but you don't know exactly when. I think one of the things is it's very important that you don't just leave cancer to die. And when she had cancer, I'm sure she'd say, "Well, I'm fine, so I'm going to give you up." No, we don't always have the answers, and we're not always available. But I think one time a------------------------------ A girl's cancer got too high, and she went into remission. She'd say, "Now, I'm in remission. I'm back to full, it's over." You get chemotherapy and the cancer's over and you can go on. You can be strong. You can keep your mind off of your cancer and be really happy about it. But to know that your cancer would go away after you've started chemotherapy is important, so this is a big part of it and the part that we take into consideration. We are aware of this problem with chemotherapy. It's hard for us
