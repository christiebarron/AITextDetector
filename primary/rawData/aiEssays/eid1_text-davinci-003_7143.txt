In Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead," the features of the setting profoundly influence the cyclist's experiences. The bicycle ride begins in familiar terrain, but as the cyclist progresses down the country road, the changing terrain becomes unforgiving and intimidating. The cyclist encounters hilly terrain which reminds him of his own vulnerability and mortality as a human. The road is made up of "loose gravel that snatches at the bike's wheels, hidden potholes, protruding stones," which cause him to feel constantly nervous about his safety and his ability to traverse the terrain successfully.

The difficult terrain also serves to challenge the cyclist as he perseveres through it. He is forced to confront his fear of the unknown as he navigates through an uncertain path, and overcomes obstacles both physical and mental. The winding, hilly road tests his stamina and requires him to maintain intense focus and concentration on every turn. This commitment to the difficult series of turns is also therefore a commitment to his own personal growth as well.

The cyclist's connection to nature is also deeply affected by the terrain of the setting. As he takes in the panoramic views of his surroundings, the cyclist can take in a sense of security, safety, and even oneness with the environment he finds himself in. The beauty of the landscape and the pangs of fear that the difficult terrain evoke provide the cyclist with an opportunity to find strength, courage, and inspiration from the dynamic setting
