The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. While most of the obstacles can be solved in one or both of the main platforms, some of the most difficult for the designers to overcome by building the second stage in a single step had to be overcome by other ways: with the use of the Star Wars system. A series of drawings, which were then circulated and shared between Star Trek fans around the world, and which were then used for other sets, were used by the two films to create Star Trek: Bridge Crew.

Background information EditTurkish Star Trek Edit

This section contains information from an alternate universe with the first film and background information taken from the Star Trek: Enterprise DVD set which is available from the online store.

Originally, it was intended that a main starship, the Fusu, would be used to dock with the Star Fleet after the east-west axis of the bridge was closed. However the Fusu was to remain in Federation service for the entire duration of its existence since it would then be replaced due to Federation security issues. On board, a special cargo pod was designed during the film to accommodate the Fusu. When the Fusu left Federation security to continue operating, it was eventually transferred to the Space Station Enterprise-C.

This is probably what led to the original design of the Star Trek Bridge Crew.
