The prospect of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was an ambitious idea, but one that came with numerous obstacles. This was particularly evident when engineer, General Cyrus S. Brackett, proposed the inclusion of a mooring mast in the building’s design. As explained in Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s book, The Mooring Mast, not only were the necessary modifications for the mooring mast incredibly expensive and time consuming to construct, but the process further tested the technological capabilities of the era.

The difficulties of the mooring mast project began with the sheer magnitude of the construction. Constructing the top of the mast on the roof of the 86th floor of the skyscraper and feeding the mast into the building in sections required members of the design team, such as former Marine Pilot, Willy Messerschmitt, to develop and experiment with new devices to ensure the success of the task. To hoist the massive gears to the roof and movements within the interior of the building, engineers had to create an intricate setup of pulleys and counterweights that, with the help of a specially devised tow tractor, operated without disrupting the construction of the Empire State Building below.

The experimental nature of the process, as well as the complexity of the construction, made safety one of the greatest challenges of the task. Incorporating the mooring mast into the building meant introducing additional stress on an already complex structural
