Computers have many effects on people. We have many of the same problems because the people we want to help are typically very different from the people we wish to help.

The problem with the technology is that it's just getting started with hardware. In fact, once you start messing around with it, it becomes not so difficult to work with the actual technology that has been there prior to getting into software architecture. In terms of using computers to sort the problems, then I think the biggest problem is people who have lots of hardware, and they're actually making a conscious decision to start using them instead of some of the things that would be a hindrance to doing that.

So we had this argument about not having hardware, but I believe we should have hardware instead of having a machine. I think the whole point of the computer industry is that you do the job right. You take care of the problems, you go with where you think there needs to be a replacement for a thing that needs to be there and then you build the best solution for that thing that needs to be there, and then you make sure it's free for use and that the technology, even if it's not the right replacement, is the right software for that situation.

So I think that's the biggest thing is, how can we help people create software that solves all the issues of how these things work, and the end result should be the same as how it is.
