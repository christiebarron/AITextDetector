Dear Editor, 

As technology continues to evolve, computers have become an integral part of our lives. We are all connected online to never-ending data and information, allowing us to exchange ideas, create art, and engage with our communities. But at what cost? 

From my personal experience, Iâ€™ve seen how our physical, mental, and emotional well-being can be affected by relying too much on computers and digital technology. As a result of constant engagement with computers, some people experience eye strain, headaches, and even physical pain. Our mental health can also be affected- too much isolation on computers can lead to feelings of loneliness and depression, especially for youngsters or teens that may already be going through difficult times.

While digital technology has its benefits, it can also be incredibly distracting. Studies have shown that increased screen time can be linked to an increased risk of mood swings, lack of focus, and even decreased productivity. Additionally, activities such as gaming can lead to a lack of motivation, which makes people unable to be productive in any context. 

In conclusion, computers can have both beneficial and detrimental effects on people. As citizens, it is our responsibility to be aware of the risks associated with excessive screen time so that we can make informed decisions about our own health and well-being. 

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
