I once had a neighbor who was an elderly gentleman and had recently lost his wife. He had been living alone for several months and I could tell he was struggling and very lonely. He was often out on his porch lost in thought and it made me feel like he needed someone to talk to.

One morning I decided to take a chance and stop by and ask him how he was. He seemed stunned that anyone had bothered to show that kind of care and concern. I could also tell he was hesitant to unload his troubles on a complete stranger. So, I just stayed â€“ quietly and patiently.

Eventually he started talking about his late wife and all the happy memories they had created together. He said how much he missed her and the life they shared. I stayed to listen and just offered an occasional smile and reassuring nod without saying a word.

He thanked me for letting him just talk and said it was a relief to get it all off his chest. He said that he had a lot of anxious thoughts but never had an outlet to share them. After he finished talking, I thanked him for allowing me the privilege of listening and left.

I felt immensely rewarded for being patient and understanding. It was a simple moment made profound by two people who took the time to connect.
