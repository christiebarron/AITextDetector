The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One was the large crane structure used to put dirigibles to work atop the tower. The other was a large, rectangular, glass-filled box in which the main window was located. The tower required more than 15,000 dirigibles for the project, which had to be replaced.

The building's exterior walls were constructed of steel and the sides of the block were covered with asphalt. Most of the interior walls was covered with concrete and plastic on certain areas, according to the Los Angeles Times. And it was built under severe weather conditions, which could add hundreds of feet to the amount of time it took to get to Los Angeles during the summer.

The L.A. Times described the construction of the Empire State Building in 2004 the most expensive work undertaken on the project â€” $2.4 million, well within the budget for demolition. The construction cost, on the other hand, rose by at least an additional $200,000 per square foot to $6.4 million per square foot.

One of the major problems with using a glass canopy or roof in a building designed to handle high-volume traffic was that it meant that there would be a more susceptible surface for crashes.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said a glass canopy, though, had been a hazard for some
