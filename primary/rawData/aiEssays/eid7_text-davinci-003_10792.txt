I remember being in middle school and being part of a large project group. We were working on a big presentation for school, and things weren't going according to plan. Everyone was getting frustrated and overwhelmed with all the tasks that needed to be finished. 

But one person in the group kept calm and was patient with all of us. She took on the role of team leader and distributed tasks to each person in the group. She was patient with us when we asked questions and took the time to explain things in detail. She encouraged us to stay focused and reminded us that we were all in this together. 

Her kind words and guidance helped us finish the project a lot faster and easier than we thought it would. I learned a lot about working in teams and patience from her, and it was something that I will always remember.
