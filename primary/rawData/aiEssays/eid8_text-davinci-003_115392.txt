I still can remember the sound of laughter that filled the air that day. It was my first time introducing my best friend to my extended family at a summer barbecue. As my family laughed and talked, the atmosphere of joy made me feel as if I was floating on clouds. 

My friend was quickly embraced by my family. Puns, stories, and jokes were thrown around the yard all day long. Amidst all these conversations and smiles, I realized that laughter had brought my family and my friend together. 

At one point, my younger cousin perked up with an excited look on her face and said, "I know a joke!" Immediately my family and my friend erupted into laughter. Even before she finished telling her joke, our laughter had filled the air with a sense of joy. 

As the day progressed, we spent our time in the yard, filled with laughter and smiles. That night, I went to bed with a feeling of contentment. I had been able to watch a bond form between my family and my friend, made possible thanks to laughter. 

No matter how much time has passed since that day, I can still feel the joy-filled laughter we shared that summer day when we bonded over jokes and stories.
