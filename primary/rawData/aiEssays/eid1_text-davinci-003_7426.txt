Minfong Ho ends the poem with this line to suggest that despite the difficulties and hardships that both the winter hibiscus and the protagonist have had to go through, there is a feeling of hope and optimism for the future. By tying the winter hibiscus to the protagonist's goal, she suggests that the hardship of winter does not necessarily have to be an obstacle for a brighter future. Instead, winter can be a time of preparation and growth before the arrival of a new season. The repetition of "when" emphasizes the idea of hope; it is not a matter of "if," but a matter of "when." The hope of a new season and a new test serves as an uplifting resolution to the poem.
