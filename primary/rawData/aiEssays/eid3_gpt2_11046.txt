Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. If you find yourself riding in a position where you are less aware of any of the conditions you will be in, this will give a little something of an edge over the situation in which you are going. This will make doing the riding easier and keep you more aware of the situation. In a situation like this you must be able to make the difference between making it or not making it, and being able to see what the odds are. The cyclist has every right to be aware of these conditions too.

If you want to see why cyclists, cyclists who try 'The Road Ahead' take it a bit easier than others who do – then you're already on your footing. A simple adjustment with the right bike is all it takes to make you feel in control. The more time you spend in the front (or under the saddle) the less likely you are to be annoyed by a bit on the corner. In the long-term cyclists will have a different preference for a quick change up that doesn't involve taking their foot off the throttle. I advise those riders who want a change up after seeing the best of the conditions on the road - it's no fun. The fact is – cycling on rough road roads is more difficult than any other form of cycling. There are plenty of ways you can try to turn the corner if you want to stay on the right and avoid a collision with other drivers
