I vividly remember the laughter shared between my sister and I one particular summer afternoon. It had been a particularly hot day, so we had decided to take a dip in our local pool. We grabbed our towels and our water balloons, feeling excited to just let off some steam.

At first, we were just playing around in the water, dunking each other until our laughter filled the entire pool. However, when we got tired of that, we had the perfect solution. We began lobbing water balloons back and forth between us. The act of throwing and catching the balloons quickly became a competition, with each of us attempting to outwit the other one.

As we continued, it only got funnier and funnier. We eventually had to take a break from throwing balloons in order to catch our breath from laughing so hard. Still, we couldn't help ourselves, and soon enough, we were back at it, laughing as we exchanged balloons in midair. 

The afternoon was filled with joy, and all because of that laughter shared between the two of us. Laughter like that is something I will never forget.
