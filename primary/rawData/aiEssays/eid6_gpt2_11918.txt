The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, some of those workers employed by the Federal Building Workers Union, or the Federal Building and Loan Board, had to hire workers to assemble dirigibles. The Federal Building and Loan Board set about developing the "D.B.G." pilot program for dirigibles. In early 1955, a pilot program was launched to make flywheel machines like those already in use at the State Department. The Federal Building and Loan Office had contracted to develop a small unit of dirigible equipment under the contract for the pilot program. The pilot program allowed dirigibles to be delivered only by those skilled in such aircraft. These pilot pilots could fly at night, in a field within an airbase, or in a building that was at least 150 feet from the base. One of these aircraft carriers, a Lockheed-made F-16 Fighting Falcon, was flying to the American mainland this June when it was shot down over Japan. It may be that the Pentagon's plans, as they were then, weren't entirely satisfactory. The United States government had requested that the Federal Building and Loan Bureau provide dirigibles to pilots with the help of the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for the National Transportation Security. These pilots who owned the F-16, the most popular carrier, would then be given the responsibility of making sure the pilots weren't flying for commercial commercial purposes.
