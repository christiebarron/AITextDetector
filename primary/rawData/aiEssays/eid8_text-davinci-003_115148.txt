I'll never forget the first time I met Jake. It was at a mutual friend's house party and he was the life of the party. I immediately noticed his big goofy laugh, and it drew me in. He was hilarious and had everyone cracking up.

At some point during the night, we somehow ended up standing right next to each other, too close for comfort. Embarrassed, I stepped away â€“ only to find myself in a fit of laughter as I stumbled over my own feet. Jake just looked at me with an amused expression and then immediately burst out laughing.

His laugh was contagious; soon, I was laughing too. We just kept laughing and laughing and laughing until my stomach ached and tears were streaming down my face. Eventually, the moment ended but the laughter lingered. We couldn't stop retelling and imitating the story whenever we were together - especially when things got awkward.

I don't believe either of us expected that moment to be such an important milestone in our relationship, but it was. We both came to realize that laughter can get us through all kinds of uncomfortable moments, and it's a big part of our relationship to this day.
