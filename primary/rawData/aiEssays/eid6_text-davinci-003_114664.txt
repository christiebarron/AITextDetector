The builders of the Empire State Building encountered significant obstacles when they set out to convert the upper floors of the building into a docking station for dirigibles. The Empire State Building is one of the most iconic buildings in the world and one of the tallest skyscrapers ever built, standing 102 stories high. From its initial construction in 1930, the intention was for the mooring mast of the building to act as the terminal for dirigible transportation. However, the harsh complications and challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State Building, as outlined in “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, made it difficult to successfully convert the building for this purpose.

First and foremost, the architects of the Empire State Building had to account for the immense scale of the building, which posed an overwhelming challenge. The addition of a mooring mast necessitated a substantial network of cables and anchor points, as well as the installation of ladders and platforms to allow for dirigibles to dock safely. Additionally, the mast itself had to be located high enough to accommodate the dirigibles while still being low enough to allow passengers to disembark from the ships. Other requirements included the installation of emergency railings, as well as the capability to easily transport passengers from the mooring mast to the ground.

Another major hurdle the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome was ensuring that the dirigibles could dock at the Empire State Building in
