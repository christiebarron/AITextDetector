Dear Editor,

The increasing prevalence of technology and computers in our society has been debated fiercely in recent years. There is no doubt that the impact of this technology is immense, but the question of whether it has a positive or negative effect on people is still the subject of much discussion.

I argue wholeheartedly that the effect of computers on people has been overwhelmingly positive. Many people are now able to enjoy a wider variety of both entertainment and education. With the rise of digital sources of media, entertainment has become accessible for more people at an affordable cost. On the educational side, there are now more levels of online education available to those who are unable to attend a physical school, and the ability to search for information on any subject means that learning can be done in any environment.

On top of the impact on peoplesâ€™ lifestyles, computers are now being used in industry to increase efficiency, increase productivity, and reduce the workload on laborers. Automation now dominates many sectors of the economy, leading to a more balanced and equitable society.

The increase of computers in everyday life clearly has its drawbacks as well. Digital illiteracy continues to be a problem in certain segments of the population, and the addictive qualities of some computer games can often be to the detriment of younger people. However, when taken in its totality, I believe that computers have had a profoundly positive effect on people, and should be seen as an invaluable part of modern life.

Sincerely,
