One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I saw a man dressed as a black man. And I wanted to know why the man didn't put up a sign telling white people to shut the hell up while white people who want to ban same-sex marriage do so, because my black friends and all other white people who would be offended by Trump's comments were white. The Trump supporters there who thought it was funny that his white counterpart was holding up a sign saying "ban marriage" were white. And those that thought it insulting that the other white men were standing up and calling the other white people white were white. And those white guys should have been on their knees. But just because their own skin tone doesn't make them any less offended. Which is why I'm standing with white nationalists who say we should shut the fâ€“k down and stop telling black people to shut it up. We need white people standing up to speak about not being offended at the point of action that Trump is making. I'm not going to stop shouting at Trump, just like I've never said before. And white people should say to him, "Listen I don't care what you think, you're just the wrong person and the right person for me to be having this debate. Because you are just being rude. I'm not saying don't do this yourself, don't be rude. But I am so sorry you're a few thousand miles away from where you came from. And I hope
