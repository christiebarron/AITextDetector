Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

1. Easy to set up but very practical

With this setting, the rider has little to worry about when the bike goes off the road. The bike's seat will remain mounted in place even on wet roads, and the road surface will be soft and slippery.

This setting also makes the frame even easier to use as to how to lock out.

2. Good for riders over 50

The rider will have to wait until the start of the bike while the door opens to lock things out while riding down the road.

It does, however, make it much more effective to use this setting to lock the front wheels out as well as use it to unlock the rear wheel.

3. Good for cyclists under 50 years of age

A little over half of these will have the option to lock the front wheels out, or they will be reoriented towards the back end with a little bit of care.

As riders age they will find that the option of unlocking the rear wheel can cause the bike to stall, or it will end up being stuck behind the bike at speed.

If the bike is not properly unlocked by hand, the rider will find it much easier to lock the front wheels out. This will keep the rear wheel and wheel locking together even if it is not properly activated.

4. Good for cyclists only -
