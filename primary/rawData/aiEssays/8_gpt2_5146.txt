One time I experienced laughter in my life was when it ended and I looked back on my career and how wonderful it has been to have such passion and commitment behind me. I was fortunate to work with such great people! Their stories, their love for creating, their courage to do it, their dedication to what they did, their amazing energy, their dedication to helping others to be successful in their everyday lives. It's a privilege to meet so many of those, both bright and troubled.

The positional shift has just come and I hope that people like Michael Lassiter, Mike May & Justin Turner will continue to work very hard to get to what they want. That, and the hope of continuing to grow and change each day.
