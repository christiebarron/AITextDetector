Computers have many effects on people. They help increase cognitive ability. This may be done through the use of computer programs that manipulate and stimulate the brain's reward centers, a research team believes.

By creating software programs designed to process data in a new way, researchers are able to increase people's capacity for decision-making when they don't necessarily see value in the results.

To understand this effect as well as other psychological functions, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institute on Aging analyzed data from 1.2 million adults who reported being tested to learn how or where information was presented to them during a four-day period for the National Center for Sleep Research.

In other words, the researchers found, the more people got information about how or when information was presented, the more likely they were to choose correctly.

For example, an older, more sensitive person may experience a more negative outcome when she or she is exposed to fewer and fewer choices than expected.

But a younger person who is also less sensitive may experience a better outcome when she or she is asked to think about a larger part of the story.

That way, the study found, if an older person can learn more about the importance of whether or not her information contained a key piece of information about a problem, it's possible to improve the ability to judge if an action is in the right direction.

For example, people who are more
