The U.S.-based company, Pearson International, was formed and it made a fortune, selling aircraft of similar quality and capacity. The planes were PCR (pronounced "right-on") as well as American-made.

There it could be used as a movable conveyance for military ships. The company also tried to avoid its own collapse. Japanese government officials refused to allow any of the dirigibles to enter the structure and its owner, Shige
