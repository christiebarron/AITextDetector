I believe that censorship of materials in libraries has a tendency to be so harmful, that the censorship ought to stop or curtail the freedom of individuals in such libraries," he added.

The ruling by the European Parliament follows a spate of similar rulings by Belgium and the U.S. last year, where they asked the court in Luxembourg to rule that public libraries shouldn't be used to "provide free educational information" and "to promote national unity".

It's not the first time the United States has been in a position to bar materials from being distributed in public because of a "hate speech" statute.

Last year, Washington and Paris issued an opinion in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that free speech cannot be used as a form of discrimination against political opponents or as a "judicial sanction" for speech because of a "moral disapproval of certain beliefs based on religion".

In February, Washington and Paris also issued rulings in which they took a more narrow view. The court ruled that libraries and other religious groups shouldn't be allowed to "extend, or promote, official, or official sponsored speech, or any speech which, as a result of its official or official sponsored use, would not otherwise be protected by any law, statute or regulation thereon."

Under the recent directive from Brussels, American public libraries will be required to share library information. The New York Times is expected to publish its own report on that issue.
