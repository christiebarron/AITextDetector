Computers have many effects on people. People are really just going to spend time away or work on different things because at the time, it was going way too fast, and they're already out there. We're doing better, and we're going to improve. Everyone's looking for opportunities, and the most important thing is you give them some love."

The New York Times report said the Trump administration has been able to take many of the lessons learned from the Bush administration.

"While the Obama administration might be able to draw on the skills we just already have and the skills the Obama administration has made," Trump added, "there will be some things in our culture that we still use today that we like. â€¦ There is always a sense of responsibility there."

The Times added that while Trump's approach is unique, his strategy is based on creating a culture "in which you feel that your way is better for people that you know, and by doing it as directed, you'll become more and more powerful, and people will want to be like you, rather than like them. This will happen in a world of great leaders."
