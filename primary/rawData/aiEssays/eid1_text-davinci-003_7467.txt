The author is making an analogy between the hibiscus and enduring difficult times. The winter hibiscus is a flower which needs to weather the winter, and the protagonist needs to persevere through academic difficulties. By ending with the statement, the author is reassuring themselves and their audience that they can make it through anything, similar to how the flower can bloom in the spring. Additionally, the statement serves to imply that the protagonist will eventually prevail, with the expectation of taking the test again in the spring. Thus, the ending serves a motivational and hopeful purpose.
