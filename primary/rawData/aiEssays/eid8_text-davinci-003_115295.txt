I remember when my brother and I used to participate in our annual family talent show. This one particular year, we decided to attempt a fairly ambitious comedy sketch. We practiced tirelessly, crafting and revising the script, staging the movements, perfecting our deliveryâ€¦ and finally, we were ready for our performance.

We exploded onto the stage, eagerly awaiting our cue. I was so nervous, my legs were trembling and my stomach was in knots. A hush settled over the crowd as our intro speech began. Or at least, it was meant to begin. Instead of carefully rehearsed dialogue, what we got was a fit of laughter. 

Turns out, my brother forgot what he was supposed to say and his anxiety translated into a few silly lines that had the entire audience in stitches. I managed to maintain my composure but I was laughing along with everyone else. We regained our composure and launched back into the act. It was funny and adorable and the entire room was cheering for us. 

Our makeshift comedy show was a success! We couldn't believe it. We hugged tightly afterward with huge grins on our faces and it was in that moment that I realized just how much laughter can mean in a relationship. We had stumbled into a success despite or initial missteps and, in a way, that made it even more special.
