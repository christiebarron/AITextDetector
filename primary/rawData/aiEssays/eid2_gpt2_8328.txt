I believe that censorship of materials in libraries can provide a more equitable platform for scholarly exchange, and provide the foundation for the growth of our society. As such, I hope to expand the library ecosystem far beyond the books I've curated and read these days.

The Library and Library: A Collaboration Among Us

This is one of a large number books I currently am reading, and would like to point out a few things. I have had a few complaints about how some libraries can be used for scholarly communication. In addition to this I have many other projects that I'd like to explore. I don't intend to stop here. I am, first and foremost, an advocate for learning to read. I am also a great supporter of learning to read, and my work should serve as example for others. As an educational advocate, this includes all disciplines in addition to the humanities (and, I'll talk more about this with the rest of the post, too).

Books and Libraries: Learning to read as a Student

In my own mind, my academic work is mainly academic (with students of all genders), but that has not stopped me from studying all academic disciplines. So on the other hand, I am interested in being able to learn to read about literature and other arts. If I can get enough students involved, I'll be able to put together a working library system that makes up for the lack of students participating in academia to some degree.
