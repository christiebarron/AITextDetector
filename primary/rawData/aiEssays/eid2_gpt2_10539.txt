I believe that censorship of materials in libraries can lead to significant loss of privacy and other free choices in the future. Libraries have great research resources available, and, like many institutions, they use them to ensure that any content must be carefully curated and vetted. But today, in many respects, the fact that a library's research resources are available only to researchers does not mean that the content from its library belongs any more.

What does censorship mean for free expression

Yet many of their policies and procedures apply only to the research they conduct. While research is free speech, they are not free of this freedom. When we want what we want, we have to get what we need. In the past year, it has been my experience that there have been efforts to prevent open access to material to be examined and discussed in the open with a small percentage of the research community.

More research in the open

I was reminded of the problem of my college years when I first tried to teach the subject at an institution with a history of open access. One
