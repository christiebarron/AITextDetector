The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

The New Orleans Public Service Commission (OPSC) and Department of Transportation approved a plan on Feb. 24 to construct Dirigibles at 50 sites.

The two organizations were co-constructed by the American Civil Liberties Union, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the National Association of Architects.

"This is a first step to protecting American public service infrastructure from government interference," said OSSC chair Ben White at the time.

The new project was expected to be completed in 2018.

"These dirigibles are really moving forward with a purpose," said Mark L. Blanchard, a former New Orleans City Councilor who currently serves as the chair of the Transportation Planning Advisory Panel.

In February, OSSC created a new planning commission to oversee the demolition of the structures at Fort Hays and Nellis. And an independent review into the demolition plan was completed in February, White said.

But White and other commissioners were not fully convinced by the plans, and a panel meeting in January determined at least 25 other structures were still being demolished or had to be re-purposed.

The commission voted 921 to 8 for the demolition plan with 782 favoring it, leaving only two votes for a replacement. The final vote took place Feb. 7. Two commissioners then voted down the plan.
