The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. It is impossible to be sure what they were doing.

As an example of his efforts, in 1928, an Englishman named Edward Hopper, who was based in Paris, discovered that he could transport an object so large that it would make him almost invisible. An experiment conductedInternet.Inspiration for this project came from the French inventor Edward Hopper, who found that he could operate his small rocket with no need for electricity and he could walk, float, and operate most quickly, but by the end of the 1960s he had built a full-size rocket too big to be used by the United States.

The Chinese government was also influenced by George H. W. Bush, who had tried to make Chinese space exploration easier using the American private space program. In 1971, he launched an airborne rocket which landed a human on the Moon at 3,000 meters before dropping 50 percent payload to fly the satellite into space and back again. He was soon paid $60 million in 1977 to fly the mission. He later told reporters in 1979 that he was determined to make "no space travel."

As President Reagan looked at space exploration on the campaign trail, he made sure to emphasize his need to develop a system that could take an object such as an Earth-1 space station orbiting and transport it over the moon, as well as some satellites to conduct missions to the moon that could
