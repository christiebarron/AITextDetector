The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' was very positive, including a number of good reactions at the outset. But, as with many book reviews, no one thought the book was worth seeing, as a few read it from the perspective someone who might have thought of it, and then just gave up.

The final novel, 'Falling in Love' won both Booker Awards and AFI's 'Best Novel', although the writing was less impressive. The book received three Golden Nominations – two for good writing – and some fine work in the literary literature section, which was very impressive.

The book is available for Kindle and iPad in Europe and Latin America and has been well received by readers from all over the world.
