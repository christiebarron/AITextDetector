One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I came to San Francisco from Vermont to work as a manager in an advertising agency because I was so terrified of the "futurism" which was so prevalent in the movie studio scene. Because you have to be a very intelligent person to be in a big Hollywood movie. No one really cared for the idea that people couldn't make anything even if he or she looked like a giant robot. And you just wouldn't be able to make anything in that field. The fact I could be in that field was a powerful thing. When I started, the only people I could see were guys like Jim Carrey and Stephen Sondheim who loved movie characters and told me it was time for me to start making movies. I was really worried about making movies, and I knew that it was going to be a matter of time before a big movie star was going to pop up.

Well, that never even occurred to me. In fact, my favorite movie of all time was the famous, surrealist film The Silence of the Lambs which at the same time, was kind of about a group of men at a local coffee shop called the "Harmonites," one of them had a very powerful story that I knew was about to turn out to be a fantastic story and I would always love to hear it in theaters. It was actually very exciting for me to have it.

How did you end up writing and directing
