The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In order for that to happen, it first needed time to build. Then, some time after building it, the new owners of the building asked for the building to be placed where it could serve as a point of entry between the two towers.

The building's two towers were later moved from Manhattan to Fort Myer in Rhode Island. When George Mason University moved them to Fort Myer in Rhode Island, a couple months later, the building's new owners demanded the building be relocated to another building on East 29th Street in New Haven, Connecticut.
