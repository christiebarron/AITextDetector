I remember one time when I was in college and I was having a hard time with one of my classes. I was struggling to understand the material and none of the instructors seemed to have time to help. I was feeling very frustrated and burnt out, but I decided to take a step back and take a deep breath. Instead of getting overwhelmed and quitting, I decided to just take it slow and be patient.

I started by breaking the material down into chunks and giving myself smaller, more achievable goals for each day. I also worked to maintain a positive attitude about the situation and focused on learning even the small details. Instead of being hard on myself and giving up after a few days, I kept going and eventually managed to get a decent handle on the concept.

The key was to stay patient and focus on what I could learn instead of what I couldn't. I allowed myself time by recognizing that I wasn't going to learn it all overnight and that it was part of the process. Knowing I could do it kept me motivated and in the end, I was able to understand the material and perform well on the final. 

Patience truly paid off in the end and taught me a valuable lesson about choosing to stay calm in difficult situations.
