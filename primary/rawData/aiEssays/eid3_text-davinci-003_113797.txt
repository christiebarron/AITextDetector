The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski have a marked effect on the cyclist. First and foremost, the geography of the landscape plays an important role in the cyclist’s experience. The “enormous downed tree” blocking his motorcycle’s path forces the cyclist into a dangerous path down a steep ravine and across a “wild” river. This creates an almost insurmountable obstacle—one which the cyclist must overcome if he is to continue.

The presence of the neglected and disused pavilion also shapes the cyclist’s experience. At first, the structure appears to be a threat, a sense of dread that lingers even after the cyclist has overcome his initial fear. The cyclist’s unease is compounded when he discovers the pavilion’s resident—the man in white—who appears to be monitoring the cyclist’s progress. This presence, be it real or imagined, plants an uneasy feeling in the cyclist as he moves forward.

The element of weather—which is described as “incessant” and a “low, dark sky”—also affects the cyclist. The weather serves to both isolate and trap the cyclist, enveloping him within his own thoughts and feelings. The dreary conditions are a lasting reminder that the cyclist is alone in this journey, with only his own mettle to rely on in
