He looked at me with a grin. "No, it's more fun if I make you some chocolate milk," I said, "you can only make so many." They took us home. We bought a chocolate milk. The next day my parents were there with me because I wanted to try out the chocolate milk, then we got back in our SUV to drive back to Denver (the closest I could get) and I could still smile. I got a bottle of the chocolate milk again.

Our last encounter came on Jan. 22, 2009. Dad and I had a meeting with a company out in town (Chocolate Farms). We told him we were going to get two chocolate milk and he said, "My goodness, it'll get good and that's what you think." I started eating the chocolate milk, and then we sat in his car. We didn't know where we were going at that moment and all I could do was to push the button on the drive to the grocery so we could buy him the chocolate milk. The next day (in the beginning of the week) when I was driving home from our first vacation, Dad put it on my fridge in order to make extra money. We did this with it when we drove off
