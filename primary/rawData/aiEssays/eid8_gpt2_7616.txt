One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was just 7. During my senior year, I had the option to come to his family house and watch football with my friends. My friend did not think for a moment that it was a good idea, but he did.

I always looked forward to it, and when I had the chance to play in the league (in my early twenties), I never wanted that to happen at all. It was almost like a miracle.
