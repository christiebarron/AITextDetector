The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it makes new blood from a bloodthirsty dragon, and gives her some new blood and new power.

In "The Shadow of War," the battle between dragonkind and other animals will ultimately prove to be quite a bit harder. For my very own enjoyment in writing Winter Hibiscus, I couldn't find the way to get all of this from a single book. My first attempt at writing the chapter I had, though, was the title track on a prerelease CD, so you never know. But, I have to admit that from the look of it, I think that the story was very well done. There's definitely something to this book that I wish I'd gotten a second time out of it, but there is no way I could finish it to make it a final product.
