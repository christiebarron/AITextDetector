Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects that computers have on people. As technology has become more sophisticated, computer use has been increasing- and with it, a number of potential problems.

When used properly, a computer can be an invaluable tool for productivity, efficiency, and creativity. But when used in excess, it can lead to a wide range of physical and psychological issues. Prolonged use of a computer may result in physical discomfort and eyestrain, as well as create a sedentary lifestyle that can lead to obesity and related health issues. Likewise, addiction to computer activities can lead to isolation and depression.

It is, thus, important to create balance in how one uses a computer. Time should be allotted to physical activities, as well as to activities that do not require a computer.

I urge your readers to use their computers wisely and mindfully in order to reap its benefits without falling into its potential hazards.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
