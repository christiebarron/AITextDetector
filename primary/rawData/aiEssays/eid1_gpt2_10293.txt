Computers have many effects on people. They modify the structure of critics, and they alter the perceptions of scientists, the judges, and the journalists they cover. They are the driving force behind many forms of censorship, as noted above.

For instance, Wikipedia (an anti-fraud website) was recently blocked for several months. Wikipedia's editor Bill Karpeles, who was the subject of an Internet harassment lawsuit earlier this year, took legal action to prevent it from running indefinitely. Wikipedia's former editor is also under fire from a number of other news sites, notably The Washington Post.

All of that was also said by James Fallows with the New York Times. He pointed out:

...the anti-Wikipedia protests aren't even all about Wikipedia, and what the authorities are trying to do is criminalize any and all criticism of the site. They don't do that to their way of doing journalism....Wikipedia has long been known as one of the first free sources for government researchers, and a major source of free information on environmental issues, including the global warming trend.

Many people have called for and are opposed to the removal of Wikipedia from the bookshelf and the suppression of any comment or article deemed a violation of its content-neutrality policy.

Some individuals believe Wikipedia must be shut down, while a large portion of critics, media companies, and governments have already expressed their support for the removal of Wikipedia from the bookshelf
