I remember a time when I was driving back home from work. I had been at the office for hours, and I was exhausted and ready to go to bed. As I was driving home, I noticed a group of teenagers walking down the street, taking up the entire sidewalk. Immediately, I felt my frustrations rising as I had to slow down and drive around them. 

But then I took a deep breath and reminded myself to be patient. I reminded myself that these teens were just kids who were probably having fun and spending time with each other. So rather than honking my horn or getting angry, I just drove around them, smiled, and waved. And I'm so glad I did because when I drove past them, they waved back and smiled. It made my day! 

Sometimes it can take a lot of effort to stay patient, but it can make all the difference in a situation.
