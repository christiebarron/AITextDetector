I remember a time when I was challenged to be patient and it required a great deal of mental strength. I was helping my grandmother move from her apartment to her new home. Of all her possessions, the thing that we had the most difficulty moving was her old couch. It was so big and bulky, and seemed to weigh a ton. The best way to move it would have been to take it apart, but we knew there was a tight timeline and had no tools to do it. 

So we figured out a way to lift the couch and drag it down 3 flights of stairs. It took several attempts and a lot of pushing and pulling to make it. I wanted to give up so many times, but I stayed as patient as possible. With every pull and every step down the stairs, my grandmother cheered me on with encouragement.

Finally, after what seemed to be an eternity, the couch was out of the building, loaded up and secured. It was satisfying to know that all our hard work had paid off. As we drove away, I reflected on that moment and what I had learned - that if I stay patient in challenging situations, I can prevail.
