The construction of the Empire State Building in New York City was a feat of engineering that created a skyscraper with 102 stories. While the building remains iconic today, there was much debate at the time about the inclusion of docking for dirigibles. This technology was touted as the future of air travel and envisioned as a safe and efficient transport for passengers and goods. However, the obstacles faced in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building were many.

The most fundamental challenge posed by the idea of a mooring mast was the practicality of adding one to the building. The sheer height of the Empire State Building meant the mast would need to be longer than even the tallest building itself. This created restrictions in terms of architecture and safety, as it would need to remain stable to prevent any accidents from occurring. In addition, the mast would need to have some form of communications between the building and the dirigible to coordinate docking. This could prove difficult given the size of the mast and the vast distance between the two.

On top of this, the design requirements of attaching the pendent mooring mast to the building were stringent. The mooring mast would need to be placed in line with the buildingâ€™s alignment yet still be separated from any other structures in the area, including the Empire State Building itself. The mooring mast would need to be capable of supporting the heft of an airship and its mooring lines, which
