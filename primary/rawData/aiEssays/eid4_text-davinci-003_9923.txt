The narrator of Winter Hibiscus is a young girl struggling with the pressures of hosting family, learning English and taking an academic test while trying to honor her family's Chinese roots. As the story ends, the narrator is reflecting on the hibiscus bush in her yard that grows even through the winter, despite the cold weather. She realizes that, just like the hibiscus bush, she can also adapt and survive even through difficult times. By ending the story with the thought that she will take the test again in the spring, it reflects her own resilience and hopeful determination in the face of hardship.
