An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a friend of mine who worked for a magazine that was trying to take on the world of fashion. I tried to give her what we would call a'skinny black lace' but she just kept walking away and kept talking about 'black' fashion and that was what happened.

They ended up running away like crazy from then on. It was at that point that she decided to leave. But I knew what I was doing and if I got to know her I definitely wouldn't have let all this happen to me again.

We had a relationship that lasted from 1994 to 2001 and I worked with her at an Italian outfit shop. We were able to move away but my only family came and I went back to France with my husband in 1992. When I found out that I had just had my second child I kept asking her whether I felt that the time had passed. I honestly didn't think she'd know. I also don't think she ever even mentioned that we started our relationship. It was as if shelegged and she was the one of her two best friends from those days.

But we were so close and that's what made it amazing. I can remember going into the bathroom at lunch every weekday, going over with her to get some cheese and having such a laugh over how much I loved her, how much I loved getting her to wear whatever she was wearing around here. You were the best
