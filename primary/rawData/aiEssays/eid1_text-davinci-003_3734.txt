Dear Editor,

With the development of technology, computers have become a part of our everyday life. As a society, we can now be more productive, efficient, and connected because of computers. However, while the uses of computers are undeniable, people have to be aware of the potential risks and consequences of such a powerful tool.

It is important to remember that computers can cause significantly more harm than good. Excessive reliance on the internet can lead to cyberbullying, lack of physical exercise, and other psychological issues, especially in young people. Additionally, having access to certain social media sites puts them at risk of being exposed to inappropriate content.

Another considerable downside to computers is their potential to malign our interpersonal relationships. Daily computer usage can limit the time available to meet with friends and spend time outside, and instead replace it with time spent alone, which can develop a more isolated mentality.

The effects computers have on people are both positive and negative; it is up to us to carefully monitor our computersâ€™ usage so that we can take advantage of the positive effects while also being aware of potential risks. It is not impossible to use computers in a beneficial manner, but only if we use them in a responsible way.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
