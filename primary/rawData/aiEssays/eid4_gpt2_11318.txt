The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it is hard to know that there is an alternate timeline where the game is not ending. While some of our heroes don't have their own timeline, each one has many more things to do before the conclusion of Winter Hibiscus. There is a time line, or timeline, where Viola and the rest find themselves in the "real world", which is that the game ended when the last time the last book was published was ten years before the ending of Winter Hibiscus occurred.
Winter Hibiscus ends with the "real" world ending and in the case of Viola as her parents' lives is going to be over, it is almost heartbreaking. I hope I helped readers understand that the ending is a prophecy made by the Dark Lord to end the world, a part of the plot to change the world so that one day it will end so that there is a place for everyone, even children, or some other part of the people. I do not expect to read this book many more times, but I hope I did my part. I hope we can learn something from it.
The most satisfying ending of Winter Hibiscus is, without a doubt, its ending. But I believe we'll be seeing our favourite story of the trilogy over the coming years.
That is how I saw the ending once I read it.
I could have only hoped that it was that happy ending.
