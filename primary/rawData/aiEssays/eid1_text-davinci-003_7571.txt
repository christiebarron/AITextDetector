The author uses the phrase "take that test again" as a metaphor for perseverance. It symbolizes the hard work and determination of the protagonist, Khun Ying, to make a better life for her family. The words "snow melting", "geese returning" and "hibiscus budding" represent the changing of the seasons, and the idea of transformation and hope that spring brings.

It provides a sense of optimism and encourages the audience to have faith in themselves and stay positive, even in the face of adversity.
