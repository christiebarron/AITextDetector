One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was at my first public practice in 1995 with a group of people working on an electric car.

"They had come up from all over the world and they were all talking about what went on at the practice," Mr Gatt said.

"I was like, 'Well, this is not funny'."

On another occasion, Mr Henson said, a stranger pointed at the driver, "and the two of us were on the steering wheel."

"I knew about it from the first moment of our conversation, before we knew it was going to get out of hand," Mr Henson said.

But then he remembered one of the drivers saying that it was "just right" to bring about a'savage' exchange.

There was a slight pause in the laughter as the stranger continued: "You know, you get a bit uncomfortable when the man has made fun of me."

This situation was described very clearly in the police report, although not as severe as in the first incident.

After he was convicted by a New South Wales court, Mr Henson gave detailed proof he was not aware of any abuse that he had suffered in his life.

He described the moment in detail: "The man called out to me; I said that I can't keep talking 'just right...' I think he meant 'yes, we'll have to talk about it again
