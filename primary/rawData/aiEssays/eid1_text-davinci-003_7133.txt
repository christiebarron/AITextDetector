When analyzing the story “Rough Road Ahead”, written by Joe Kurmaski, the setting of the story plays a pivotal role in effecting the cyclist. The setting, which depicts a long and winding road with a steep incline, provides the obstacle for the cyclist to overcome and is instrumental in his journey. 

To begin, the steep incline makes the ride particularly challenging for the cyclist. They have to use more power and stamina to move up the hill than they would have to move horizontally across flat terrain. The value in the physical struggle is then significantly increased due to the lengthy duration of the climb - as the cyclist travels further along the road they are met with more difficulties, such as increased fatigue and reduced energy levels. This fatigue and exhaustion takes an emotional toll on the cyclist, as evidenced in the story when the cyclist experiences feelings of doubt and despair. 

The length of the climb, up the winding road, serves to ensure that the cyclist fails multiple times before succeeding. This is purposeful as it allows the road to represent a physical metaphor - as the cyclist faces many obstacles throughout the journey, they also gain a greater sense of self. As the cyclist falls down, they are forced to pick themselves up and try again, learning a lesson of resilience and perseverance that can be applied to their daily lives.
