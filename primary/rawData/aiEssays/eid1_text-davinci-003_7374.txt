The setting of Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead” plays an important role in the story by affecting the cyclist’s actions and emotions. The desolate and empty highway presents both physical and psychological obstacles for the cyclist, creating a stressful and tension-filled atmosphere. The highway offers few options and no escape, conveying a feeling of hopelessness and making the cyclist feel trapped. The lack of other people also heightens the sense of loneliness and fear as he travels along the road.

The flatness and dullness of the landscape are uncompromising and relentless, having a draining and demoralizing effect on the cyclist, making it even more difficult for him to find the resolve to carry on. He’s forced to fight against the exhaustion and pain he feels in his limbs, as well as his fear of the darkness that lies ahead. The oppressive heat and intensity of the desert is immersive and serves to gradually increase the cyclist’s fatigue, gradually wearing him down. The night sky also casts a foreboding tone as the stars present the cycler with an infinite vastness that contrasts with the constricting confines of the path.
