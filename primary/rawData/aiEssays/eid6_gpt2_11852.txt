The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. But those hurdles also were eased by the federal government's decision to allow a pilot experiment to bring small unmanned models to the market. The Air Force's proposal at the time was considered the biggest change in the history of unmanned aircraft design. It would allow piloting of the aircraft into and out of a field with minimal interference during testing. It was a significant step forward at its first test flight and led to further investment in the program, as well as the design of the 747.

While the U.S. government was still building models to fly their small unmanned aircraft systems, the FAA came under fire for failing to take a step along the road of reducing their size. The agency took a stronger position by approving multiple pilot clicker programs. The first version of the technology to do this was called the X-ray Spectrometer (XSI). There were numerous variations on the idea, but most of them were much bigger.

After the pilot's computer, which allowed them to read the location of the aircraft, made a fly over the aircraft and a laser and a sound, the technicians at an airfield in West Virginia designed a test aircraft. According to FAA reports, the XSI was able to perform very fast maneuvers while the pilots at the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) in West Virginia had difficulty navigating the controls. The XSI had the ability to track each vehicle and
