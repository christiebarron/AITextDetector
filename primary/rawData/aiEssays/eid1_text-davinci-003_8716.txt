 

I remember the moment so clearly. I had just had a huge fight with my best friend. I was so mad at her that I could have screamed, but instead I just walked away. As I was walking, I heard a strange sound coming from behind me. I turned around and saw my best friend laughing uncontrollably. I was so confused and asked her what she was laughing about. She said, "I was just thinking about how silly we must look fighting like this." 

That one moment changed everything. We both began to laugh together and it felt like a huge weight had been lifted from my shoulders. Soon, we were both rolling on the ground with laughter and all the anger that had been between us melted away. We continued to laugh together and soon enough, we were both smiling and hugging each other. 

That moment taught me a valuable lesson. Laughter can bring people together even in the most difficult situations. Since then I believe that laughter is the most powerful tool for creating and maintaining relationships.
