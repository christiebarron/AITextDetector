Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho ends with this question to emphasize the idea that even during tough times, we can still endure and press forward. The snow melting and the geese returning are both symbols of new life and hope, and the protagonist's desire to "take that test again" highlights his resilience in the face of adversity. The imagery of the hibiscus blooming evokes the idea of new beginnings, and serves to remind the reader of the protagonist's perseverance and growth.
