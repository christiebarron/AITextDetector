The features of the setting in "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski significantly affect the cyclist's experience. The first aspect which affects the cyclist is the terrain. The cyclist is forced to struggle against a “treacherous climb” which tests their physical abilities, as well as their mental fortitude. The rough terrain brings about a sense of challenge and accomplishment, as well as the thrill of a hard-earned victory. The other lush geographical features, such as the “impressively tall trees”, the “sparkling lakes”, and the “hills and valleys all around” are also awe-inspiring and make the cycling experience even more enjoyable. 

The cyclist is also affected by the atmosphere which is depicted in the story. Despite the fact that it is “bitterly cold”, the cyclist still manages to keep their spirits up and ride on until they reach their destination. The beauty and tranquility of the scene make the cyclist forget their physical discomfort momentarily. Moreover, the environment is conducive to pushing oneself to one's limits, due to the fact that there are no people around to distract or hinder the cyclist.

Finally, the sense of adventure and exploration evoked by the setting also affects the cyclist. Even if they have never been on this particular route before, being in such a remote and scenic place makes the cyclist feel as though they are on some sort of quest.
