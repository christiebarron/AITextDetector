Dear Editor,

As the digital age continues to advance, the use of computers has become a ubiquitous part of everyday life. From academics to employment and entertainment, computers are being used to enhance the lives of many, but are computers necessarily a good thing?

It is undeniable that computers have made a lot of tasks simpler, offering access to a wide range of information, as well as avenues for connection and communication. However, research and studies have highlighted some of the detrimental effects which computers and other digital devices have on the people who use them.

The most troubling of these effects is the impact of computers on human social interaction, especially among younger generations. These devices have altered the ways in which we communicate, often leading to an inability to read emotional cues, as well as the reliance on digital communication rather than face to face. This has led to an increase in isolation, depression, and even addiction in several cases.

In addition, the unnatural amount of time spent in front of a computer screen has been linked to physical health issues and a decrease in physical fitness. The eye strain and posture issues related to computer use have seen a huge spike in recent years, and have caused serious implications for overall physical health.

Despite the numerous advantages of computers, it has become evident that, if used in an uncontrolled manner, they can lead to several detrimental results. It is therefore best to regulate and keep computer usage to reasonable limits and to also employ the necessary safety measures
