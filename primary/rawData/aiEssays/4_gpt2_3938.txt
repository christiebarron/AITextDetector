The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because its main flaw – its inconsistency with a traditional definition and structure for the subject of 'the science of nature' or 'the natural world', as the authors put it – is the 'one-and-done' nature of the 'new science'."

Although the authors do concede that the book takes its science seriously, however, despite its shortcomings, the book nonetheless reveals the true spirit of the present day and a sense that future generations of scientists – and indeed, all of science – will need to embrace such a way of thinking about our own world.
