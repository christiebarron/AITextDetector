Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects of computers on people's lives. In the last two decades, computers have become integral to our lives and have had a significant impact on our health, education, and even our recreational activities.

First, computers have improved the education system. With the availability of online learning resources, knowledge and research information is available to students at the tip of their fingertips, at almost any hour of the day. This enables them to quickly and easily expand their understanding of different topics, and is a great time saver.

Second, computers have enabled people to lead healthier lives. Online health analyzers, such as Fitbit, help enable people to better track their exercise, diets, and even sleeping patterns. This has enabled people to have better control over their overall health.

Finally, computers have greatly improved our recreational activities. Modern video game consoles, for example, are now equipped with highly advanced processors and graphics cards that provide gamers with an exceptionally realistic and immersive experience. This has enabled people to become more engaged in their gaming experiences than ever before.

In conclusion, computers have been a great asset to our lives in many ways. From improving education and enabling people to live healthier lifestyles, to enriching our recreational experiences, the effects of computers on peopleâ€™s lives cannot be understated.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
