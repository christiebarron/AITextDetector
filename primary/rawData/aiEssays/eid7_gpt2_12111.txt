People are not as lucky, in fact I've seen the number of people who are treated for perevisomastoid go up. I've been diagnosed with breast cancer, a rare but progressive disease of the upper brainstem called mastoid cell disease.

I've been treated with perevisomastoid on almost daily. I've had many doctors tell me she's treated more people than she's treated herself. She hasn't kept at it because she had chemotherapy.
