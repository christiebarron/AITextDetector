I believe that censorship of materials in libraries and museums is counterproductive and harmful.

But what is less obvious is why we need to restrict the access to books and the dissemination of art and history that is of interest to us. What we are saying here is that we believe, if we insist on using a limited number of books, that we must, first of all, allow every book as it is published. If we look at the history of the U.S. and our own history, we can see that the U.S., because of this limited number of books, has made large strides in making art and literature available to the masses of people who live it. We have made advances in how people can learn about the U.S., and we have enabled our art communities to become more accepting of the material that the U.S. produces.

With those reforms, however, we cannot afford to become complacent about the need to keep the books we allow to run the length of our library system. In order to do that, we need to stop restricting the access to books that are of interest to people in our community.

So why does this seem particularly important? It is because we have seen the effects of censorship of books and information. Because of censorship of books, we have seen how the U.S. government works to ensure that books like "The Art of War" or our current film adaptation of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" are
