Censorship in libraries is a hotly debated topic, but we must recognize the importance of preserving intellectual freedom. Libraries should be places where people feel welcome to discover, challenge, and nurture their intellectual curiosity. Censorship in libraries can have a chilling effect on the core values of intellectual freedom, self-expression, and creative thought. 

The issue of censorship in libraries is largely about managing the conflict between individual rights and public responsibility. There must be a balance of freedom to express oneself as well as protection from harm or offense. The public’s need for access to information specifically for educational, professional, and leisurely purposes must be respected. However, in order to protect the general public from certain materials that may be found offensive or legally illegal, libraries must be selective in their considerations when stocking their shelves.

Books, music, movies, and magazines should not be willingly removed due to potential offense, but libraries must be mindful of what is on the shelves. Libraries should reserve the right to choose what materials are appropriate in accordance with their local policies and values. Beyond the boundaries of our libraries are a vast array of online sources that offer a variety of information, so having materials selectively removed makes the library environment more suitable for its patrons. We cannot deny that there exists certain works containing ‘offensive’ content. That being said, public libraries should draw the line while protecting our right to access ideas without limitation.
