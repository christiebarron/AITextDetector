Library censorship is a controversial topic that has been debated amongst the public and library professionals for many years. Some believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, should be removed from the shelves if they are deemed offensive. Others disagree, arguing that censorship of any kind is detrimental to society and the first amendment. 

When it comes to censorship in libraries, it is important to consider the impact it can have on readers and their freedom of expression. Libraries are places of learning and discovery, and limiting access to any material can be seen as limiting the opportunity for growth and knowledge. In addition, censorship can lead to the silencing of important voices in our society, stifling the positive changes that could potentially come from challenge and debate.

In addition, censorship can be dangerous when it is based off of subjective opinions. If something is ‘found offensive’, what does that actually mean? Who makes this determination? Is it an individual, or a group of people? This type of subjective censorship can be just as damaging as overt censorship.

Rather than censoring material, it may be a better solution for libraries to provide access to a wide range of material, both for and against certain ideas. Through access to a variety of materials, readers can make an educated decision for themselves regarding what is and isn't offensive or productive. It will also promote respect and understanding between people from different backgrounds by fostering open dialogue and debate.
