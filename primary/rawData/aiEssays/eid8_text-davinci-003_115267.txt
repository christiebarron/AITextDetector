I remember the first time I met my now wife. It was at a mutual friends' wedding, and I was instantly captivated by her. We talked all night, and eventually we left together and had a picnic out on the beach. 

It was in the middle of the night, so it was dark outside. The stars were so clear and bright above the ocean, it was breathtaking. In that moment I really felt like I was in a dream. 

But what really stuck with me was when we started to laugh together. I thought it was just going to be a regular picnic, but then my wife started telling jokes about her crazy family. I couldn’t help but chuckle along with her, and before we knew it we were in fits of hysterical laughter. We laughed and laughed until we ran out of breath. 

It was in that moment that I knew we would be together forever. That night I realized that laughter is one of the most important things in a relationship. It’s a way for two people to just be in the moment, laugh and make memories together. 

To this day, almost two years into our marriage, she still makes me laugh uncontrollably. I can’t wait to see what memories we share next.
