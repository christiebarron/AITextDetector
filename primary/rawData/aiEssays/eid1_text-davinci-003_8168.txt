In the 1930s, the idea of allowing airships, or dirigibles, to dock at the top of the Empire State Building was an ambitious undertaking. While many had visions of a massive docking station, the obstacles that had to be overcome for this technology to become a reality proved to be immense.

The first issue was the nature of the building itself. Manhattan's skyline was already home to the tallest buildings in the city, and the Empire State Building was no different. The main mast at the top would be an ideal place for airships to dock, but built for strength, not for airship docking. To make such a possibility requires extensive work, which is why the building was initially designed and built without such a feature. 

Second, the airship technology needed to be improved for this new application. Early assembly of dirigibles depended on mooring mast apparatus that could tether an airship to a tall structure. This system depended on a single, free-standing mast, mounted to the building but capable of stabilizing the airship in the face of changing weather conditions. The problem was that these systems needed to be significantly more complex and designed to cope with greater stresses.

Third, the people of New York City needed to accept airship travel, since it was a mode of transportation that was very new. It's always risky to adopt a new technology, especially one that would be built on top of city's tallest building and introducing a
