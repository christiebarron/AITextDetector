One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I went to the hospital with my mom, just down the stairs from where I was. I don't remember how shealled me to have fun with the whole situation, but no one was interested in getting close enough so I was going.

I was a little nervous, but was ready to move forward. I didn't want to be my usual self and get a whole bunch of people who would tell me I was a "crazy" or that they was "crazy." I was like, "What the?" I said, "I'm a little bit scared. I'm sure my mom will think something different." She didn't come up to me and do anything like that. But that's where it gets interesting.
