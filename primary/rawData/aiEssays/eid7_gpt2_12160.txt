An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I lost my boyfriend, and he did not want her to talk to me about his girlfriend. He was scared, he felt too upset with my girlfriend for him to say "no." He was upset that my girlfriend did not go out with him, that was the main reason for why he thought I was "crazy." I started talking about my boyfriend's sexual issues and I was just like "what do you expect me to say?"

I started to write my own things that would help me understand my issues, and it gave you a little bit of inspiration to see how I could help others in my life as if they were my real problems within an interpersonal sense. I had some of my friends start putting their own spin on it, and they were like "okay, let's help people on their own terms. We can talk about it, we can talk about this, let's just not be angry or anything like that."

It just gave me time to realize what I am experiencing that I am not experiencing inside of me and what I am trying to do in this relationship with my girlfriend.

It made me realize how much of my problem it is that my boyfriend has never been able to talk to me about a sexual attraction. He has gotten so scared out of his mind that he doesn't even tell anyone about his fear of hurting me or how badly he is feeling about hurting me, something that
