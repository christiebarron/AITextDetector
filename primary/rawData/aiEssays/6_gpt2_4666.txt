The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. A "high Router Mode" meant they couldn't use the control module to "drive-to-the-right" where the vehicle's cockpit had been removed. They didn't want the drone being able to carry its payload while in the sky or in low-gravity. It also meant that it had no control over its position relative to the ground.

"You always needed to think about other possibilities," says David Lutke, a principal engineer with the California Robotics Laboratory and chair of a technical team working on U-2, in an email exchange with Science Daily.

They had to figure out how to build the drone with the help of the US Air Force Research Laboratory at Fort Bragg, where Lutke worked to find a drone's "high-frequency range." They found a way to combine sensors from both drone and ground craft that could deliver remote communication for remote control of U-2's head.

The first time they flew it down a runway -- in February 2015 in an airport near Newark, N.J. -- they experienced a drone as fast as it could, with a 2.0-kilometer (3,000 ft) tail roll and 2.2-kilometer (6,200 ft), which gave it a range of less than a mile. "When you look at it as an aircraft, that's what you need."
