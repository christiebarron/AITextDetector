An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was a child. All I saw in my life were animals and nature. My parents were doctors. They said "let's get you into a hospital, maybe take you back home to your family." They never did.

"That is what I did, just like my parents, and they loved me and looked after me like family. They took care of us like family. Some of us are so messed up, even today we're out of luck. That's what makes for the craziness."

To see photos of kids coming out of the closet, here's a roundup of their favorite moments in my life above:

My favorite movie: The Lego Movie starring Bill Murray, which opened in theaters on June 1, 1971. The first scene is just as good.

My favorites: The two sisters at My Wedding (not really the "My Grandma" films, but that's the thing).

My favorite song: "Weird Candy" by The Doors.

My favorite movies: The Harry Potter series, "The Hateful Eight."

"Just to the Rescue, The One With the Horn" by James Blake, one of my all time favorite albums.

"If I saw someone at my door with a glass of water on their face and asked if I wanted to have a shower" by Ray Charles. This was a great song on
