 

I was at my aunt's birthday party and she had just opened her gifts. To my surprise, one of the gifts did not make it in one piece. I could tell she was really upset and was about to start crying.

Rather than pointing out who had gotten her the gift, and making a scene, I decided to take a step back. I cooled down the situation by calmly reassuring my aunt that it was okay - accidents happen, and asking if anyone had any ideas on fixing it.

Everyone around the table started throwing out ideas on how to repair the broken gift, and before long it was back to normal. Auntie was relieved, and the room was made warm again with smiles and laughter.

I was proud of myself for staying patient in a tough situation and quickly coming up with a plan to fix it. That experience taught me to think before I act and to remain composed in difficult situations, so that I am able to help those around me.
