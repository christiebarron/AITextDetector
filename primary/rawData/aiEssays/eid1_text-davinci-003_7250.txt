The setting of "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski has a notable effect on the cyclist within the piece. The cyclist begins the journey in spring, which is symbolically meaningful as it is a season of growth, hope, and anticipation. This premise gives the cyclist a sense of optimism about the venture as they break out onto the open road with a clean slate and seemingly infinite possibility. 

The uncharted nature of the route adds a sense of adventure to the cyclist. Without knowing where the journey will lead, the cyclist is actually able to stay in the moment, enjoy the present, and embrace the unknown. This element emphasizes an element of risk in the piece and keeps the cyclist on their toes, learning and adapting to the conditions of the road ahead. 

The environment that the cyclist is cycling in plays a role in their endurance and challenge. The hills of the terrain test the cyclist's stamina, and the rocky roads are symbolic of the obstacles that they must confront throughout their journey. The vastness of the space allows for the cyclist to clear their mind and increase their appreciation for the scenery and nature surrounding them. 

In conclusion, the features of the setting are a vital part of the story as they allow the cyclist to have meaningful encounters with the journey. The sense of adventure, anticipation, and reward empowers the cyclist and gives them the courage to overcome unforeseen challenges that may come their way.
