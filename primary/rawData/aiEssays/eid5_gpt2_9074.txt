The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is decidedly less optimistic.

"For me — because I've always been such a bright person – I was excited to be a part of something special for two reasons," Brzozowski said. "One, I was the one who came in through the back door of a garage, and I saw this kid at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 7th Street, and asked to meet up and I thought, you know, I want to go home to go on my adventures with this great family.

"And I was thinking, well I can really turn that around if everyone had this whole family who wants nothing to do with me, right? So I did, and then we were off the road in a few weeks. That first trip back after a weekend was a really great experience.

"Then, as my daughter grew older I realized that I had to figure out what I wanted to do better. So my daughter went into depression, for no one would talk me out of doing things that I was passionate about. And if I wasn't passionate about things, where was my strength? I've had years where I would just say, 'I love this, I'm going to go back' and then I'd have to really figure that out.

"So it was like, all this stuff. You put yourself into a really good situation, you put yourself out there because you feel really good."
