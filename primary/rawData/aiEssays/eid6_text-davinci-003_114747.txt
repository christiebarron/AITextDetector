The idea of the dirigibles docking on the Empire State Building came from General William A. Starling. From the beginning, however, the designers of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in accommodating dirigibles. In the short story, “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, many of those issues are outlined.

The main challenge the builders faced in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was structural. The building did not have an open area large enough to land the dirigible. Most buildings of the time had flat roofs and ornate Art Deco styling, making them unsuitable for landing dirigibles. The Empire State Building, however, was a skyscraper. It was designed with tall, continuous walls, making it difficult to land a large dirigible on top. To overcome this challenge, the builders had to build a special docking station with a large open area, mainly located in the middle of the building.

In addition to the structural obstacles, the designers of the Empire State Building were faced with a number of practical challenges. To make the dirigible landing pad a reality, the engineers had to adapt the building to be able to withstand the stress of the heavy airships. The design of the tower had to be modified to accommodate heavy concentrations of steel bracings and tie-downs, as well as increased wind loads from the large airships. Finally, the Empire State Building had to
