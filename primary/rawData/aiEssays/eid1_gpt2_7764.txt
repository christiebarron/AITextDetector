Computers have many effects on people. A computer can help someone get along with people they aren't supposed to, or a person may experience anxiety, mood swings or other difficulties, or the like so that they don't have their mental health taken care of. When people lose the ability to interact effectively, it takes place through the process of getting into trouble with technology. If we lose the ability to talk, or people turn away from it and become more introverted, it's a form of neglect.

The question is how many people lose to technology. This is a tricky question in which it's probably more difficult for people to answer. It has to do with what they can't say or do, and that's how they are dealt with. In some cases, an example is simply that you no longer feel like there are any rules, rules don't apply, and that you're simply not able to be trusted and respect others' points of view. That's one of the most dangerous features of technology: people have these fears of technology, but these fears do not necessarily take into consideration the other aspects of technology, the benefits or dangers of that particular technology, or the things people might fear they might never take into account when deciding whether they want to use it.
