The question at the end of the poem is a metaphor for hope. The poet is hoping that come spring, "when the snows melt and the geese return," she will have found the strength and courage to take the test again. The hibiscus is a symbol of potential, growth, and strength. It is also a symbol of resilience and hope; the fact that it blooms even in the middle of winter gives the poet hope that she will rise and take the test again when the weather gets better. The question at the end of the poem is a reminder to the reader that despite hardships, hope always remains.
