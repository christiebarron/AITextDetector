The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because the writers did a good job of introducing it and adding some worldbuilding. I have a lot of fun with this book and am totally looking forward to reading more about how the other five authors, including a new writer by the name of David Lee Roth, created this novel at the end of Winter Hibiscus. This version of the world is very much of the traditional setting of the original novel. I really liked the way this character introduced her journey on the inside as she was brought back to life through her father's love affair with a prostitute and her being raised by a widowed woman for her own personal benefit. In a book like this, it really feels like the story was brought to you after a year of writing. If you know what it's like to be the author you know you're going to love this and it really gives you something to look forward to for your next story, as well. I'm looking forward to finally reading a novel at the end of Winter Hibiscus, which also has a sequel which I think has some really solid worldbuilding issues. My friends and family are all looking forward to having a real and authentic take on Winter Hibiscus. It would be the greatest joy I have working on this novel.
