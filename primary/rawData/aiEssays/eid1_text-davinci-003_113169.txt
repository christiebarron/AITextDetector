To the Editor:

As a constant user of computers, I am familiar with their advantages and disadvantages. I believe there is a much greater effect than what we generally recognize.

Computers can be invaluable tools â€“ not only for connecting with people, streaming content and organizing daily activities, but also for creative purposes such as writing, drawing, recording and playing music. These activities are important to our personal well-being and growth.

At the same time, there are two major drawbacks to computer usage: distraction and isolation. Social media, games and countless other platforms suck us into an artificial world, which takes our resources away from more meaningful tasks and relationships. We can even become addicted. 

As well, computers can be a tool of isolation. They can keep us tucked away in our homes, away from physical contact and in-person communication. Interactions can become more and more transactional in nature, making it difficult to nurture meaningful relationships. 

Therefore, although computers can be incredibly valuable, education and preventative measures are needed to ensure we are using them effectively and in a healthy, balanced manner. 

Sincerely,
