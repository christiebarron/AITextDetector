Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. The following steps identify which bikeways are the most vulnerable by looking at the routes on each cycleway in all three categories.

1. Cycle waypoint

Cycleway number

Cycleway number

A. Lanes (2.5km2), Lanes (2.5km, 2.2km):

Miles (1,100 meters, 2,400 meters):

Miles (1,200 meters, 2,500 meters):

Lanes (3.5km, 3km):

Miles (1,100 meters, 2.6 km):

The cycleway which shows the least vulnerable route is the Lanes (1.5km and 2km). This route has a low average distance in the range (25km), while the Lanes (3.5km and 3km) are the most vulnerable route because of the large distance in the distance between each Lanes (1km, 2km). The low average distance of the bikeway (Lanes) is around 6.4 km and that of the bikeway (Lanes 2km) is 10.1 km. So it is very important that you pick a cycleway to suit your road conditions and you start with a high level and you set up your bike and set your speed at the time. Lanes need to be at
