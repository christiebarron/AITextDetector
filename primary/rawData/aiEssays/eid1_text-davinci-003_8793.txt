It was the middle of summer and my friend and I decided to head to the park near his house to go swimming. As we hit the trailhead, we started to joke and laugh about nothing in particular. We had been best friends since we were kids, so it was nothing new for us to be making silly jokes with each other. 

As we got to the edge of the water, we decided to race to the other side. Knowing that I was faster than him, I decided to give him a head start. We started running and as we got close to the other side, I started catching up with him. Seeing this, he started laughing and looked back over his shoulder at me. We both burst out in laughter when I passed him and crossed the finish line first. 

We spent the rest of the afternoon taking turns dunking each other and just catching up on our lives. 

As I walked back home that day, I knew I had a true friend in my life that I could always count on and laugh with, no matter what.
