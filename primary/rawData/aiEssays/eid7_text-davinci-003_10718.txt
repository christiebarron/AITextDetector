I remember one time during my sophomore year of college when my roommate was having a really difficult moment. She was struggling a lot with her schoolwork and was feeling completely overwhelmed. She finally broke down and told me she was having trouble staying focused and finishing her assignments. I could tell she was feeling overwhelmed.

Instead of getting angry or judging her, I listened. I told her I knew she was capable of doing the work and reassured her that no matter what happened she was not alone. I suggested we break her tasks down into more manageable bits and set reminders for herself so that she didn't get overwhelmed again.

We spent about an hour talking and setting her up with a plan to get her work done. I could tell she was grateful for the help and relieved that she had someone to be there with her. Throughout the entire process, I remained understanding and patient with her. I never judged her or made her feel bad about her situation. 

In the end, she was able to finish all her work and I could tell that she was relieved and felt a lot better. I believe that by being patient and understanding with her, she was able to overcome her struggles.
