In the poem “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, the setting is a very important factor that affects the cyclist in the poem. The poem conveys a challenge that the cyclist must tackle as it is described as a “rough road ahead”. The setting has a direct influence on the cyclist as the description of the road highlights the difficult and dangerous terrain. The road is “jagged” and “muddy” which implies that it is treacherous and unpredictable. The cyclist is urged to “take the risk” in spite of this which shows that they are aware of the difficulties of the road. The poem goes on to describe the road as having “twists and turns”, “shifting shapes” and “endless chasms” and these features have a direct effect on the cyclist. These elements force the cyclist to be constantly aware of the terrain and to stay agile as the path is ever changing. The description of the road creates a feeling of isolation perhaps implying that the cyclist has only themselves to rely on which adds to the difficulty of the journey. The setting of the poem consequentially has a direct impact on the cyclist as the rough terrain is an ever present challenge. The cyclist must rely on themselves to guide them through the journey and remain agile in order to overcome the obstacles of the road ahead.
