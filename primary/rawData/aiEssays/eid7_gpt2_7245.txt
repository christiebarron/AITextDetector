An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a year or two early after a child went through the same procedure in a hospital, one where children don't even see one eye. Now I know that I can have children without ever going through the pain of a parent's pain.

When my daughter's condition got better I didn't know we pigmentized the child, she always looks like she looked when she was 3 years old. When my daughter got better it wasn't until about age 5 or 6 do we realized she looks the same.

As you can see from these photos we only went through 3 processes, pain, and the next 3.

I was told she was okay, but there was still something missing in the picture. In hindsight I should have known she was so weak and had been so sick for the last 3 months I would have stopped and cried. I did. But with the new photo, she still is.

When my daughter started this new photo we were in so many different states with me so it didn't seem like there was a big problem, but I guess I had to worry I would have to send back the picture to her mom as soon as possible. Eventually I contacted my mom.

She told me the baby was okay, but not all of the pain was gone.

But I went back and apologized once my daughter was done and I think it is really nice she did. I was pretty proud
