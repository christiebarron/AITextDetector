The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The tallest building on the east edge of the Empire State building was actually the one that was built in 1908, which was the middle of the period of German concentration in the New York metropolitan triangle. The Empire State Building's exterior was made of steel, but the interior was entirely constructed of aluminum. Only steel roofs were used in the building. Also, the roof and ceiling had to be raised from the bottom so they could move freely during the construction process (in addition, the ceiling to the outside was so small that it would have been difficult for the building to stand up on its own!).

The Empire State Building's exterior was entirely steel like the city, and was finished in 1920 with only one small window, and a steel frame for the ground floor, to prevent it from falling out. The building was only able to stand around 120,000 feet to the ground. The Empire State Building was a very popular spot on the West Side of Manhattan for commuters who could find ways around the building. The skyscraper also had a very well-equipped security system that prevented them from stealing the information.

The Empire State Building had a complex layout that included five separate apartments, two high-rise units, a single high-rise office, and several hotels. These apartments were all constructed on a mix of floor- and roof-planning materials. These apartments cost about 400 to 500 dollars each.
