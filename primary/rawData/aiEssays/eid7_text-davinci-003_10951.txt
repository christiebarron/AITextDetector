I remember the time I visited my grandparent’s house with my parents. I was excited because I thought we would have a fun time, but the moment I arrived, my grandad started complaining about how he wasn’t feeling well and how things weren’t going his way. Instead of reacting badly, my parents remained calm and patient with him, listening to his grievances without getting angry. 

It was clear that my grandad was having a tough day. My parents, despite their own frustrations, stayed patient and understanding. They reminded my grandad of how much they care for him and how much he means to our family. Their patience and their compassion was a reminder to me of how powerful a little kindness can be. Although my grandad was still a little grumpy, I could see that their patience made him feel a bit better. 

My parents have always been a great example of how to remain patient even in difficult situations. To this day, I strive to be as tolerant and understanding with others as my parents have been with my grandad.
