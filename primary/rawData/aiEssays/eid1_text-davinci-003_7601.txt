The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho emphasizes the theme of perseverance, optimism, and hope in facing difficult challenges. It suggests that the protagonist will face the same test in their life again and, this time, their determination, optimism, and hope will help them find success. The imagery of spring and the melting snow and the returning geese emphasizes the idea of renewal, of things coming back to life and of a new beginning. This is echoed in the protagonist's determination to take the same test again, when they come back in the spring.
