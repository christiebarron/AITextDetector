The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because what happens when you want someone to have a good time with you? When the weather goes wrong. When they feel like a waste. When they feel like they're being held captive by that horrible thing that is the world you've created. You are like their puppet. That's an awful and horrible piece of shit, that you should be doing your best to put out of your misery.

I think most people who've read this book understand that it's about real things. And that's a great feeling. In fact, maybe in the last five minutes of reading the book, I was surprised how well the stories just go.

I feel like this really has been a really interesting book to me. When I was starting out, I was a little bit obsessed with this book called The Winter Hibiscus, and at first I was hoping it would go away and that I would be reading through the first book and then being like, "Ok, well that's it. And here's what we've got to do," and then when I read it, it just didn't feel like a good book. What I do find most interesting as a writer is what I do pull, the way I approach this book with this particular way of writing and how I create that kind of sense of sadness and loss that is not typical.

I didn't get to read The Winter Hibiscus for a very long time
