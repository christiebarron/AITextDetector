The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' by James O'Donnell was a great deal like what was present when he visited London, he says. The "unfettered" view of what it was like to live in the American home would have been much like a foreign person visiting the West Bank after having been denied visa. The world of Udo's was different. It was not such a huge part of his memoir. It was far, far more isolated. What he saw was the new, unapologetic Utopia of his life.

It took his grandfather for two days to see "from home" what the United States was like and where he lived – what it was like to be the American citizen who had traveled between countries. It took all of him to see the horrors of what his father had been taught to fear, and how he had used his education on those worlds to achieve those things.

He has described the life he did after leaving the British and the Canadian government as "pretty happy" when he arrived in England: a bit different from how he did in Udo's lifetime.

O'Donnell's book explores British history, but the book also provides a new twist to what he called British history. In particular, it examines the social and political context for how he lived his life in the United States – an experience he recounts in more detail in the book.
