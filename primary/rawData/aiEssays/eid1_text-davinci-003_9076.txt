Dear Editor,

I am writing to opine on the widespread effects of computers on modern society. Everywhere you look these days, computers are becoming a ubiquitous presence in our lives. They have certainly brought us enormous benefits and in some instances, have made the world a much better place. However, it is also true that computers have had a significant impact on how many of us live our lives, and it is important to consider the consequences of these changes.

First and foremost, the increased reliance on computers has resulted in fewer physical activities, resulting in higher incidents of obesity, and in the long-term, serious health problems. In addition, long hours of computer use have been linked to depression, eyestrain and other mental illnesses. Furthermore, with the rise of the Internet, young people, especially, are becoming entrenched in virtual worlds, leaving them without social skills or offline relationships.

Therefore, I urge all members of my community to be mindful of the effects computers have on people. While technology can be an invaluable asset, it also carries with it some very real risks. We all have a responsibility to look out for each other, and to ensure that we are not putting our mental and physical health at risk, due to excessive computer use.

Sincerely,
