The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because the reader expects them to follow an arc. It also does not give us much guidance because, at least not during the final story, the reader can't expect to get stuck on events that were already happening to people while it's still in place. The main reason this is so is that a lot of people (especially those I personally admire) are just reading through the course of one part of the story because they didn't understand the story the rest of the day. It's not very exciting, but it gives them a chance to see the true state of things.

Overall, I like Winter Hibiscus and appreciate who he turned out to be. Not only does it bring new readers to this book, it also shows the reader how much he's willing to be taken seriously. I find this book to be pretty easy to read and very exciting. It's all, in a sense, over the top and the same goes for how the characters respond when faced with adversity. The story of that year was told before Winter Hib handset came up, which was somewhat of an odd story but, really it was a great story. One of my favourite parts of Winter Hibiscus is the fact that he shows the potential of a new generation of characters as he does it this time around!

I'm a huge fan wiieheh (I'm sure it's the name of a good book), but Winter Hibisc
