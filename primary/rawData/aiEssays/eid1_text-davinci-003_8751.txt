I had been studying abroad for months and the experience had been truly amazing. I was able to immerse myself in a different culture and visit places I had never seen before. I spent a good portion of my time with the people I met at my language school and that was when I encountered one of the most memorable conversations of my trip.

I remember me and a few of my friend's walking down the street one night. We were speaking in English among ourselves but a couple of other people were speaking Spanish nearby us. I didn't understand what they were saying, but then one of them started saying something very funny. It was like he was telling a joke. Even though I didn't understand what he was saying, his animated expressions and posturing made it clear that he was telling a joke.

We all stopped and started laughing just from watching him tell his joke. The other people around us started to laugh too, though they had no idea why. We were all connected by our laughter and the power of humour. It was like we were all part of one global community. That moment changed the way I viewed the power of laughter and humour and how it can create connections with people without any language barrier. It was a truly special moment that I will always remember.
