Building the Empire State Building was one of the most ambitious endeavors ever attempted in the world of architecture. The fact that it was going to be the tallest skyscraper in the world made the construction of it all the more special and all-encompassing. With such a feat, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles to allow dirigibles (i.e. large airships, commonly referred to as blimps) to dock onto the building. In the book “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the author discusses the challenges and obstacles that the Empire State Building builders had to face in allowing dirigibles to dock. 

The first and foremost challenge the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome in allowing dirigibles to dock was getting approval from the US government. The government needed to make sure that the structure was safe and secure in order for a large helium-filled airship to fly and dock on it. After the government had approved it, the builders had to install a “mooring mast” on the 80th floor of the building. The mooring mast was basically a vertical shaft, sticking up about 20 feet. Its diameter was 30 feet in order to provide an area where the dirigible’s tethering lines could be attached. 

The next challenge they faced was finding a suitable anchor for the mast. Given that the Empire State Building
