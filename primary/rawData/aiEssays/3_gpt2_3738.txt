Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. It can bring the cyclist out of the loop at high speeds, give it comfort if under heavy exertion and offer a quick, easy alternative, although a slower, less aggressive approach may result in them crashing into a car.

If one considers the possibility that the cyclist is under such conditions, with only the right side of the road to rest over, the effects of this option can sometimes be particularly jarring.

As well as having the cyclist at ease, it can also be difficult to keep them in the loop due to their safety risks. This is in large part the consequence of a wide range of factors. There is no doubt that for many cyclists they will never succeed on such a large course, but once they encounter an experienced team of cyclists to support their cycling position, they are on their way to achieving similar results.

How will the cycle-racing team be able to support the support they need on the next round of race?
