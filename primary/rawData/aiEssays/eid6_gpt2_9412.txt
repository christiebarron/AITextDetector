The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One was the requirement that the main windows were to be made into hinges, and thus they had to be welded directly to each other. The next obstacle was that the window bays would have to be made of a kind of solid clay. The builders used the technique of welding through the main windows because it wasn't possible under the prevailing conditions that clay bricks could easily be hammered into their hinges. The reason behind that was due to the fact that with the windows facing the street, the bays were covered for the hinges, Watching the bricks fall on the same platform they were pulled apart would break them due to the movement of the bricks. That being said, in the end, the bays that were to go through the bays for the main windows were not welded and all the bays actually hung against the floor. In some circumstances, if the bricks were laid on the floor with the bays still attached to them (even in one instance), this would cause them to snap and break in the joints, making the bays unusable for the main windows. Therefore, both the windows and the bays were sealed off. When an Imperial buildout became feasible, builders of Imperial space vessels, including the Death Star, began welding bays where they already had openings. When the builders began welding bays on the main bays, the doors they had installed on the bridge came off the
