Dear Editor:

I write today to share my opinion on the effects computers have had on people over the past few decades.

The proliferation of computers into our daily lives has been a game changer. With their development, individuals now have access to new opportunities, ways to connect to each other, and access to more information than ever before. In many ways, computers have improved quality of life and brought unimaginable convenience to our modern world.

At the same time, computers can have detrimental effects on people that are often overlooked. From overstimulation of individuals to the addictive effects of the internet, technology has the potential to cause major harm when not used appropriately.

The rise of social media and the prevalence of smartphones are two of the most apparent examples of this point. The internet can be a great source of communication and joy when used responsibly, but can also be a source of overwhelm, anxiety, and distraction.

It is important for us to be mindful of how we use and interact with technology so that we can benefit from it without letting it consume our lives. I believe that if we are aware of the potential harm it can cause, we can use computers responsibly and still enjoy their advantages.
