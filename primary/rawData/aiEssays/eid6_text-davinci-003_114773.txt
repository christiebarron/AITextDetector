When the Empire State Building was built in 1931, it was designed with the intention of allowing dirigibles, or airships, to dock at its mast. This seemed like a feasible idea at the time, as the advances in aviation technology made larger and more efficient airships possible. However, the process of actually allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was no simple task. In her article “The Mooring Mast,” Marcia Amidon Lüsted provides insight on the many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock. 

One of the main challenges that the builders had to address was the sheer size of the potential dirigibles. The exact dimensions of the expected dirigibles were unknown at the time, which created uncertainty around the size of the mooring mast and dock itself. To ensure compatibility with the airships, the mooring mast had to be able to hold the entire dirigible and the dock had to be wide enough to provide a safe and effective entryway to the skyscraper. Additionally, due to the size of the mooring mast, it had to be located at least as high as the 102nd floor of the building, which posed additional structural and engineering challenges. 

A further obstacle was the winds that all airships had to contend with in order to remain airborne. To safely dock at the Empire State Building, the wind had to be sufficiently
