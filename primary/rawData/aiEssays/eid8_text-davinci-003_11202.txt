I had been walking in complete silence with my best friend for what felt like ages. We had been discussing a particularly difficult situation and neither of us could think of a solution. The tension in the air was palpable, and it seemed like the longer we walked, the worse the mood got.

Suddenly, my friend said something totally unexpected. For a moment, I was too stunned to respond. But then, I started to laugh. Not just quietly, but loudly - so loudly I'm sure every passerby heard it. Whatever had set off this sudden burst of laughter was totally ridiculous but also hugely amusing.

My friend started to join in the laughter, and soon enough we were both roaring. I caught a glimpse of my reflection, and noticed my cheeks were wet with tears. We had to lean onto one another to stay upright, we were laughing so hard.

Finally, we came to a stop. We were both still chuckling, and the uncomfortable silence had melted away completely. Through laughter, we had bridged the gap between us and it felt like nothing had ever gone wrong. It's amazing what laughter can do; it can turn a sour situation into one that's much more positive.
