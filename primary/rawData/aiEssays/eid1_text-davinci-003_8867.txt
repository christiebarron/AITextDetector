I'll never forget the night my date and I experienced an incredible fit of laughter. We had been out at dinner, our conversation comfortable and light, but we hadn't laughed very much until that night. 

It started out innocently enough. I had told her a silly story about the time I accidentally spilled salt on the table and it somehow ended up all over my coworker. She started giggling, and it felt good to hear her laughter. 

A few minutes later, a waiter walked by and tripped on his own foot, causing a loud clatter and a gasp from the people around us. Our gazes met, and that's when it hit us—we both started laughing hysterically, out of control, drawing attention from the other people in the restaurant. 

It felt amazing—to be so connected to someone that a silly, harmless thing could set off such a powerful response in both of us. We laughed until we were in tears, and it felt like a bubble of energy was surrounding us, connected us even more strongly.

That moment of shared laughter will live in my memory forever. It taught me that laughter is an incredible connection we can have with people we love, and I'm grateful to have experienced it.
