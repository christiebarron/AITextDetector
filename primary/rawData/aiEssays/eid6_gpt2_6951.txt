The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Many have argued that building them requires more engineering than building a bridge. It is possible that the Empire State building on the south side will be built using the existing bridge from the tower.


The bridge in question was built by J. M. A. Neely in 1911. The first bridge had no air conditioners, a very simple piece of engineering but that did not seem to be the only drawback. The J. M. A.

The tower was once the "Temple-Saw" hotel where guests could stay.
