It was the first time I had ever seen her laugh. We had been dating for a few weeks, and although we enjoyed spending time together, I hadn’t seen this side of her yet.

We were at a festival and I had just said something silly, trying to make her laugh. I thought it was the corniest joke ever, and I was sure she was going to roll her eyes and give me a polite smile.

But then it started: a deep chuckle that quickly turned into a laugh so loud and contagious that before I knew it I was laughing too, and soon enough everyone around us was laughing with us. I felt like I had won a race because the sound of her laughter felt like a victory.

Her face lit up and I finally felt like I had connected with her. We laughed until tears ran down her cheeks and she said something like, “I haven’t laughed this hard in months.”

That day I felt like we had taken a huge step forward in our relationship and I embraced it – in no time at all our days were filled with laughter and silly jokes. But now, every time I think of that first laugh, I still feel the same joy I felt that day – happy to be sharing something so special and genuine with someone I love.
