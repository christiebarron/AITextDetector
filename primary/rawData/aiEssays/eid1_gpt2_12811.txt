Computers have many effects on people. Let's talk about the one that has most impact. I've come up with the theory of the 'cinematic eye'. While we might argue that the retina or the visual cortex is what makes this phenomenon possible, and does not affect our mental health, there is also a problem with the definition.

This is because, if you examine the 'Cinematic Eye' for yourself, you do not see the blue in the picture, because the retina of an animal is larger; indeed, there will appear no one in sight, on the spot, in the frame or the 'body'. That means, the image that you see in your picture is a real thing. But the definition of the 'Cinematic Eye' is more complex.

Consider your computer. If you are a programmer, then you could do a lot of different things. This computer could perform almost all of the computations you would like, and might even do some of the processing you would not like. In other words, if you wanted your computer to run, it probably had some memory. It might have a lot of things to do with your job, such as do something that would be hard to perform. Similarly, one might want to make an online game, which takes very different levels of effort. It might have some interesting things to do too, such as make an infographic or make an educational video.

Now, let's look a bit
