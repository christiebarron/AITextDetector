One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was 9 years old, when I was about 10 years old after a fight on our campus, and I would walk up to them and look at them and think "I think I'm going to beat them up." It was horrible. I didn't understand why it was happening.
            When my grandmother told me she was an atheist the way it was done in her home country, I assumed she was referring to other cultures and people.
            It took me a little bit of getting used to my own religion but it was still the way I had heard it told me. So my parents said, "Let's go back to school and just go read what we are reading right now." Then I went with some of my friends where I listened to whatever books I needed.
            When I finished, it was more about reading something at midnight to relax and talk about my religion.
            All it took was a little bit of time before my teachers told me how they felt and had the same reaction. I just felt like, "Oh shit, he's so out of control utter f***ing stupid shit" I think it was that long ago.
            I love doing that sort of thing and just read and do what needs to be done. It's nice to have something that's easy to relate to other Christians. But no Christian teacher would tell you how bad this could be done that day.
