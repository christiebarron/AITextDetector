The setting in the poem is a rural area filled with steep, winding hills. These hills, though difficult in nature, give the cyclist an opportunity to test his endurance. The poem also describes the cyclist as being “in the heat of the sun”, which adds a sense of fatigue and exhaustion to the ordeal. The cyclist must not only battle the hills, but has to push through the hot weather, making progress even more difficult.

The cyclist is also confronted with a road made of dirt and stones, rather than pavement, which adds to the challenge.
