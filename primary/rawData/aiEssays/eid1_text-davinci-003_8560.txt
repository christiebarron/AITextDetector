I was recently in a long line at the grocery store, and I was feeling increasingly frustrated with the slow process. Just in front of me, there was a woman with a large number of items that she was paying with a check. She had to confirm her ID and account information so many times that it was taking an especially long time.

When it was my turn, I could tell that the clerk was getting flustered and apologetic for the delay. I naturally stepped forward to help out. I asked the woman if there was anything I could do to help her with her check and waited patiently as the checkout process continued. 

At the same time, though, I noticed how compassionate and understanding the woman was with the clerkâ€”smiling and encouraging the clerk to do whatever was necessary to take care of her order. There was absolutely no impatience or frustration in her, even though the entire experience was taking much longer than expected. 

I was so inspired by her patience, because she showed me the beauty of understanding and kindness in an often difficult situation. Her selflessness reminded me of the power of being patient in a variety of circumstances.
