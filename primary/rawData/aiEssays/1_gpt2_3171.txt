Computers have many effects on people. It's as true of the human genome as we are of many things. It has profound effects on our behavior. It may not be at all in line with our genes, but our experience on it is changing. We might have to change at some point, and it's changing as we go up with these new technologies, and we may not have the same way. This may become a huge issue in the coming years.

We will continue to see different types of life. It's up to you as well as your grandchildren, our great grandchildren, to take your advice. You go there and you go and you go and learn about different varieties of life. It depends on the environment you live in. If you are a small country and have very small cities you come to see that there is a very big social environment involved to some degree – and it's not all good if it's all bad – but if it's not all good, then there's still the social complexity that is difficult to overcome. Those that come with that kind of experience can become very poor, and it has consequences, but it doesn't mean something is better. So there are many, many more things that can change that. It can get to a point where the problems are all very much in place.
