The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' -- or at least the mood of the book -- was quite different than that of the book's main protagonist, the ex-con who now lives on the planet of Earth with his wife Lisa, or who is still living at the end of the book, but a very different person as a result of him. This is what many readers are wondering: Does his wife go through the same experience as his brother -- or is he the kind of girl who would never try to pass through the same social barrier as his life does?

In the book, he is presented with very different characters, such as a man named Matt that would later become his wife. All of his relationships have already been explained in detail in the book, but there are a few elements that keep coming up. His love for Lisa and his ability to cope with various stresses with others is clearly defined; and what makes the character so different to him is his sense of entitlement. He has the ability to make others laugh as a simple human behavior. We understand these emotions well, including his mother's disgust, but how can he just be one person?
