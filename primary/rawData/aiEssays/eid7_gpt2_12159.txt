An example of a time someone in my life was patient was in the summer of 1995, the same year that the "Super Bowl" of the NFL was played. I was wearing my football jerseys during the game, and my voice became less hushed if people were there or not.

One day, someone went up to my window and asked "Can you help me move our team a few inches to accommodate the new owner of the stadium here? He asked us two different things. He said they are on location and they need us, so we moved." I said, "I won't move your team in."

It was that day that we got the job done. We started to move the team three feet because we couldn't be bothered to move much taller.

We moved our two cars to San Diego instead of going to Houston to play at home, but it worked out, I think.

A couple of weeks later, I moved the team to Jacksonville to play at home. But I also moved our house and we still have it.

The NFL's largest venue is Houston, which we've called it. It's one of the biggest football stadiums in the world.

We've had the first stadium with 80,000 people and a 30-to-40-seat theater at one time, to run games. It is the fastest venue in the world.

Over052.3 million people live here.
