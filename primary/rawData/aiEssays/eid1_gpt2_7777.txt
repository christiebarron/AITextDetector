Computers have many effects on people. People who have lost their jobs to a disease with a very low incidence or a poor case-fatality rate might get Alzheimer's but might not die after this disease. Most of the research on Alzheimer's has found a protective effect and a low incidence of Alzheimer's. The most important thing about Alzheimer's is the potential for its effects to persist over time. People with Alzheimer's are susceptible to many effects, with few clear treatments. They may not realize that they have such a disease but, if treated with proper care, it may not cause Alzheimer's or dementia. The longer they stay infected with the disease, the more likely it is to be fatal.

There are no known vaccines for Alzheimer's, or vaccines that offer an immunity to Alzheimer's.

Dr. Menno has been taking part in research into various Alzheimer's disease disorders for 20 years. He has noticed a change in patients with mild to moderate symptoms who might not have a diagnosis of Alzheimer's, as well as Alzheimer's patients who might have a few physical and emotional symptoms that might lead them to get their symptoms corrected with treatment or by having their cases treated and cured as part of a randomized trial.
