I remember when I first met my best friend. I was a bit apprehensive and anxious, wondering what the other person would think of me, if I acted too weird or said the wrong thing.

But as soon as we began talking, I noticed how comfortable I felt around her. Before I knew it, we were laughing and cracking jokes. We had an instantly easy rapport and I could feel our friendship growing by the minute.

That was years ago and now we've become inseparable. We often joke that our friendship is built on laughter- after all, we've been able to laugh at each other's mistakes, celebrate each other's successes, and make plenty of inside jokes throughout the years.

Laughter has made it so much easier for us to stay connected, no matter the distance between us. Whenever we get the chance to reconnect, it's always with so much laughter! Those are some of my favorite moments. 

I'm so grateful for my friend and the way laughter has strengthened our bond.
