I believe that censorship of materials in libraries and websites is a form of censorship," said Bill McClellan, executive director of the National Library Foundation.

"In fact, in a world where we are seeing increased access to mass communication, if any censorship efforts are implemented at libraries,AppData.com will go extinct."

The bill would block the ability of private companies to sell and share library information by requiring them to create "digital advertising platforms" or "designate entities" that can be "unreliable and ineffective for providing library resources" at libraries.

If the legislation were passed, it would be illegal to sell public library information but subject it to oversight by the federal government so that libraries could develop their own public libraries.

The bill, however, is not an attempt to give libraries more control over information.

Instead, McClellan said, the U.S. government should look at the use of digital advertising technology to create online platforms for libraries.

"This bill would allow library providers to have a voice in the creation and promotion of content, with the potential to create a real, lasting and meaningful online community that works both offline and offline. Ultimately, the U.S. government should consider all of this for its own purposes."
