The setting of Joe Kurmaski’s story, “Rough Road Ahead,” is key to understanding the struggles of the cyclist. The story takes place in San Luis Obispo County, California, characterized by wind-swept hills and coastal plains. This setting provides both adversity and opportunity to the cyclist, as the geography is both challenging and beautiful.

The rolling hills of San Luis Obispo County pose a major challenge for the cyclist. The arduous ascents coupled with the windy conditions make the going particularly difficult as the cyclist journeys down the road. The added challenge of the hills serves to make the ride more difficult, and provides an opportunity for growth and personal development for the cyclist.

Another feature of the setting is the coastal plain, which contrasts sharply with the rocky hills. The plains serve to provide much-needed respite from the difficulty of the hills, and the cyclist is able to make some good progress on the flat roadways. These sections of the road also serve to sharpen the cyclist’s appreciation for the landscape, from the vibrant colors of the wildflowers to the subtle scent of the ocean air.

The setting of Joe Kurmaski’s story serves to weave a tale of struggle and triumph that can be appreciated by all. In challenging the cyclist with its hills and winds, and in providing respite with its coastal plains, the setting serves to provide an emotional journey that resonates
