The ending of Winter Hibiscus is a hopeful conclusion that looks to the future and the promise of renewal. The imagery of spring and its accompanying thawing of the harsh winter as well as the return of the geese creates a vision of life's possibilities and the rejuvenation of hope. The speaker's intention of taking the test again is an act of courage and resilience in the face of adversity and loss, as well as a reminder of the cyclical nature of life and the possibilities that are found in starting anew.
