To the Editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. There is no doubt that computers have revolutionized the way we approach work, education, and communication. Yet, as useful as these machines can be, there is a side effect of overusing them that can no longer be ignored. 

As the human race moves into the technological world faster than ever before, there is less reliance on the human factor and more on artificial intelligence. Our reliance on computers for most or all of our tasks is slowly erasing our ability to think, feel, and understand on our own. We are becoming desensitized and distracted, losing willpower and ambition. 

It is widely known that the brain needs physical exercise and stimulation in order to remain sharp and efficient. Unfortunately, spending too much time in front of the computer can have a strong adverse impact. The blue light emitted from screens can lead to anxiety, depression, and cognitive health issues, as it inhibits the release of melatonin and disrupts sleep patterns. Not to mention the high-level of stress imposed on individuals when constantly bombarded with notifications, emails, and tasks. 

Therefore, I urge the readers to reconsider the amount of time we spend on computers, and to prioritize activities that benefit both our physical and mental health. The modern world is an amazing place, and technology has the potential to make it even better, as long as we use it responsibly.
