Computers have many effects on people. One of them is a lack of attention to detail.

"When we're at an event and we do have a lot of events going on out there, we often do think it must be some sort of technical problem or a lack of attention to detail in the computer, or something to that effect. And we try to find the easiest way to avoid that and keep the people's attention as much as possible," says McVey with the company. But some of those distractions are what you will often find when traveling.

It's tempting to go out and try out new things, but one of the things that seems to drive a lot of things out of the house is the computer. Many of us in our 20s and 30s spend our days tinkering, but many of us don't need time off to be productive so much. Sometimes you can save money by just going out and looking for an idea. For these reasons, McVey has set up shop in a group called Virtual Hardware for Professional Engineers. The group aims to be a place where people with a deep understanding of computer engineering can build products themselves and help their teams figure out their work needs.

Other virtual hardware is being established on a more personal level, such as the virtualization of professional web pages. Those are not only easy to build and operate but also highly portable (think desktop pages in your notebook and Google Drive).
