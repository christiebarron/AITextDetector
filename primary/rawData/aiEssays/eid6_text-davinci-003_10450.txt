The construction of the Empire State Building was a monumental feat in and of itself, but when it was decided that the mooring mast atop the building should be designed for larger scale dirigibles, the task was even more daunting. The concept of allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building posed a number of unprecedented obstacles that the builders were required to overcome.

Firstly, dirigibles require a tall mast structure in order to securely tether them in place while they moor. To ensure that the mooring mast for the Empire State Building could support the weight of a large airship, designers needed to develop a structure that was both strong and lightweight. In order to achieve this, they settled upon a structure based on a rafter system—supporting the mast with steel trusses in a triangular formation—which greatly reduced the amount of weight carried by the mast while still allowing it to remain strong.

Another significant obstacle associated with the design of the mooring mast was figuring out the most practical and secure method of tethering the airship. While most dock systems used lines and cables to physically attach the ship to the structure, the mooring mast needed to be outfitted with a special clamping system that alternated between open and closed positions. This allowed airship crews to safely attach their vessels to the mast by either using a hand lever or, for larger operations, a system of cables and pulleys.
