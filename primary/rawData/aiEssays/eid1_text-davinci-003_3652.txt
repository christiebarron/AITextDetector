Dear Editor, 

As the world becomes increasingly digitized, computers have become a staple in our daily lives. It is an undeniable fact that computers have positively impacted people in many ways, from advancing medical science to providing immediate access to information. However, it is important to consider the less frequently discussed but equally real effects of computer use.

First, increased usage of computers has led to more repetitive and sedentary lifestyles. This can lead to an increased risk of obesity, heart and eye strain, as well as musculoskeletal disorders. Additionally, people who spend a disproportionate amount of time on the computer are at risk of suffering from physical and emotional fatigue.

Another issue to consider is the impact of computer use on interpersonal relationships. With so many social media outlets and video games available, people are now able to enjoy any type of entertainment from the comfort of their own homes. As such, they are less likely to go out and interact with others in person. This could lead to weakened social skills and a lack of real-world connections.

We must be aware of the effects of computers and be mindful of how we use them. By limiting the amount of time spent on the computer and making an effort to socialize with others in person, we can better enjoy the benefits of computers without having to suffer from their negative consequences.

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
