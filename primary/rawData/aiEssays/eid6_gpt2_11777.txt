The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

To begin with, at the top of the roof were giant, circular mirrors, and to the side were two-by-two, and each would be able to move its view through a "lightbox" designed to fit into the middle of a doorway that would not have light-resistant materials.

In the end, the Empire State Building won by a landslide (as opposed to a landslide, due to the shape of the buildings).
