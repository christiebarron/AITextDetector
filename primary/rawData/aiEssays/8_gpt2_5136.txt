One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my sister told me about a beautiful little girl who was my sister's mommy's little sister.

I was so sad and confused that I knew she had no idea that my name was on her list of things to celebrate. But when I went home and noticed my name on her list didn't appear, I knew I was looking bad.

But I got out of there and went home and searched for myself. I was on Facebook and I noticed I was from Germany. I wanted a little romance but my brother wanted to get married! So I went into the dating market for a date. But one night I was going to meet two attractive women who were willing to get a date for around €60. I told her I was attracted to these two and decided to meet them. No one in my family knew about my meeting with these two.

The man I was meeting was someone who was interested in me and wanted to meet me. But what I didn't know was that my boyfriend/fiancé was willing to get away from me.

After aMoonster met me they were so close I thought them to be my boyfriend, but she said she would like a date with me. We sat, drank a drink and walked to where there was a man in the bar sitting at a table. He asked me why I was here so I told him I was there and said that I needed some time.
