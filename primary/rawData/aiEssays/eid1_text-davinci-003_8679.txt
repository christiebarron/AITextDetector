 

It was one of those days that just seemed so long and tedious. I was exhausted from work and feeling quite blue. I was walking to my car in the parking lot when I saw my good friend Joanne from across the lot. She waved me over and yelled, “Hey jealous girl, come over here and chat with me!”. I smiled, rolled my eyes, and slowly made my way over to her. 

We both laughed in unison as she recounted stories from her day and I shared some of mine. I began to feel so much lighter and content despite how tired I was. Somehow, we always managed to find humor in any situation, no matter how bleak it seemed. 

The next thing I knew, we were both bent over, trying to control our laughter, which was growing more and more uncontrollable by the second. We were laughing so hard that tears were streaming down our faces. 

Joanne left me with some encouraging words of advice before we both went our separate ways. I felt so much better and more at ease after our conversation, and most of all, after all that laughter. Laughter is definitely the fastest way to build lasting friendships and strong relationships.
