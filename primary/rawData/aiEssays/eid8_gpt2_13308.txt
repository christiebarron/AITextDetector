One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was just 12 at a party with some friends. I was sitting alone with my friends and all three of them were singing. "What's happening with us?" "We just got separated; we have been together for years, and we just feel it," my friend told me. It wasn't long before everyone was singing, and everyone laughed. "I didn't even recognize that," I told her as I made my way to the car. "It's so funny, and I wasn't a huge fan of this song." And then my friend remembered the songs and laughed too! "That's what they want to get back to like, but for me it's like, 'Oh, this is awesome,'" she exclaimed. "They want something better. They want to tell everyone what they love and who they want to be, but it's really funny, you know? I just go laugh so hard at people and I think, why am I so excited to hear it?"

But it wasn't until after I was working to bring my new friend back to the studio that I heard the "New York Boys". The New York Boys are a group of bands and dancers. The main difference between them is that they don't have much in the way of makeup, which is why they have really skinny legs and some really beautiful body types.
