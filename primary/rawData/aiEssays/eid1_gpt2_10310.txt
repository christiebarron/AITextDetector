Computers have many effects on people. They take a while to develop, though, so most people get their computing at an early age and get it working, which means that whenessel is released, it tends to be less stable and unstable or even less usable over time, depending on the type of hardware present.

So for the second time, I'll explain the physics behind the behavior of computers, and also the fact that computers can produce a high level of computation without much trouble, but even a decent computer might fail, such as when a lot of people go crazy trying to run a huge number of random numbers (like I was). And even if it were an efficient way of computing complex computations: it could create a nice library of algorithms that solve many complex problems, or many complex algorithms to solve another problem and so onâ€¦

Some of the results on this point are pretty solid, including the possibility of a single programmer being able to take a machine to a single place, or even a very complicated programming language and have a computer that can do something like those for you. But while most of that would work for computers, as long as they are small enough (or maybe small enough) to be fully self-contained, the possibility of more complex algorithms being developed makes it very likely that this will happen eventually. I know a lot of programmers would love to see machines that do things like this, and want to see how much of their code is self-contained.
