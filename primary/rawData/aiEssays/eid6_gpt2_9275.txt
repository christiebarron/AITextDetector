The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

Benedict L. Feuerstein, a German architect who invented both the "Airplanes" and the "Hotelier", described the building as "an industrial cathedral". This meant that planes were to be used as a flying point for high-speed rail services in the East, and a small group of people were expected to provide security at the same time as they constructed the buildings. One of the buildings in the West, as was the Great Hall in Washington, made no appearance except through the use of the "Bunker" and by the construction of a "trolley stop".

In 1859, one could doze off by stepping on a piece of wood and burning a cigarette. This wasn't practical anyway (it took three weeks to smoke for the rest of them to do so), so the German architect Heinrich HÃ¶bbitski made a small "pike road" in the direction of the "Bunker". It was built around the time that the first skyscrapers were built in New York City, while the rest of the World's buildings fell under German control until the 1970s.

The first aircraft on display at the World Trade Center were the P-38 fighters. The first flew on January 8, 1945. Later aircraft such as the P-38B, P-47 and P-47A, which flew until July 17,
