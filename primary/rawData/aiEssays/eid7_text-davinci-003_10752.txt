I remember a time when I was at the DMV, and the wait was unnecessarily long. After sitting there for what felt like hours, I was starting to lose my patience. There seemed to be too much confusion and not enough organization. Everyone in the line was getting restless and I was about to join in on the complaints. 

Then I spotted an elderly man who had been waiting even longer than me, quietly sitting in the corner reading a book. His stoic demeanor reminded me of the importance of being patient and that there was no point in complaining when there was no one to complain to. 

I noticed that he hadn’t gotten up in a long while, so I offered to help him out and get someone’s attention. As I got up, he smiled at me and said, ”Thank you kind sir, patience is a virtue and I’ve been here longer than you.” 

I was taken aback by his kind words and it changed my mentality from one of impatience to one of kindness. I'll remember this moment for the reminder to practice patience, even when the situation doesn't seem to deserve it.
