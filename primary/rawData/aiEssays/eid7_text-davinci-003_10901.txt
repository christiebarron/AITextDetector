I was raised in a very busy household with three siblings and both of my parents working long hours. As the oldest, I was often left in charge of my younger siblings. One particular day, my siblings were being particularly unruly. They were all running around the house, screaming and trying to get me to play with them. I did not have the energy or the patience to keep up with their playfulness, so I decided to take a moment for myself. 

I went out to the back porch and just sat there, taking deep breaths and trying my best to stay patient and calm. After a few minutes, I heard the voices of my siblings slowly growing more quiet as they no longer argued with each other. Eventually, I heard them come out onto the porch to join me. We ended up just sitting there, enjoying the quiet night together. With a little patience and understanding, I was able to help them calm down and get back to being the amazing siblings that I know and love.
