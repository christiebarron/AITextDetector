I believe that censorship of materials in libraries was a matter of great importance to the United States government and, as a matter of fact, we never went out of use of it as a tool of propaganda," he said.

According to the Associated Press, the Associated Press obtained several letters signed by the U.S. government written by those who said they have had negative experiences with its censorship in the past. In one letter to Congress in 1987, one of those people writes: "It has been reported that some of the letters in question have been very offensive to the U.S. government. I want you to know that I think that the government of the United States should not interfere in any way in the freedom of the press."

In that letter to Congress, the former First U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Richard B. Jones Jr. writes: "I am not aware that it would be necessary to present evidence to the court of record to show that the letter was a hostile word."

Jones, who now heads the Institute for Justice, a non-profit, legal advocacy association in Los Angeles, has written numerous publications and articles over the years. He has been criticized for censoring articles written by American Indian groups and former National Association of Public Radio stations.

The Associated Press reached out to the Associated Presskill.com and to the AP to inquire about any information on that period.
