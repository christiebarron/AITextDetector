The features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead" have a significant impact on the cyclist in the story. The cyclist is heading towards a deserted road in the middle of a summer night, so the road is poorly lit and there are no street lights or other illumination. This makes it difficult for the cyclist to see the road ahead and navigate around any obstacles. Additionally, the cyclist is traveling through a rural area of town, so the roads are filled with potholes, roots, and other uneven surfaces that make it difficult to stay on course.

The cyclist is also alone in the night, without the comfort of other people or vehicles. This atmosphere of silence and isolation are intimidating and can create a feeling of anxiety as the cyclist faces the seemingly infinite stretch of road. Additionally, the darkness of the night allows for sinister imaginings, as any shadows could be hiding something sinister. The cyclist is alone with only their thoughts and the vastness of the night.

In spite of these unnerving aspects, the cyclist persists in their journey. This determination in the face of adversity conveys the cyclist's stubbornness and commitment to overcoming the obstacles they are faced with. Through the features of the setting, Kurmaski creates an atmosphere of tension and foreboding that the cyclist must endure. As the story progresses, the cyclist's journey is hindered by the obstacles of the environment, yet they continue onâ€”a testament to tenacity and courage.
