Yesterday I was walking through the grocery store and noticed the checkout line was really long. All the people in line were visibly irritated and impatient, and I could feel the tension in the air. Suddenly, the cashier stopped scanning items and announced that her register had stopped working. Everyone groaned, and some people started muttering angrily. 

As the cashier called for help, something interesting happened. The woman in front of me suddenly took a deep breath and smiled. She turned around to everyone in line and said, “It’s okay. We have the time. It’s alright.”

It was such a small thing, but her simple act of kindness suddenly made the atmosphere less tense. I watched her quietly continue to console the people around her, and before I knew it, a tech support person had arrived to fix the register.

I admired this woman’s patience and unwavering positivity during a difficult situation. Her compassion was truly inspiring.
