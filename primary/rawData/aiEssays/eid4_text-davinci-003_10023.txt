Minfong Ho's Winter Hibiscus ends with the promise of renewal: when the snow melts, spring returns, the geese come back, and the hibiscus buds, the protagonist returns to attempt the same test, showing the power of resilience, hope, and determination. This closing statement implies that despite having previously failed the test, the protagonist has found one last opportunity to prove their knowledge and capability, and is prepared to use it. The metaphor of the hibiscus's budding, along with the protagonist's re-attempting of the same test, speaks to the characters' strength and eager power to one day succeed, no matter how many times they must try.
