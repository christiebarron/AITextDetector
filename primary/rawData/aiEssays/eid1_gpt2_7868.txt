Computers have many effects on people. By being able to communicate with each other or to run with one another, computers will allow you to make new relationships without the pressures of constant conflict and communication. Even the most successful computers aren't able to live without the pressures of amusement, conflict and boredom of today. Computers give us the ability to travel faster, understand information more easily, think faster and work more efficiently. Computers gave us more flexibility, and less anxiety. In other words, computers made computers, and they made the world. Computers allowed us to take our information and create new relationships. And because computers made relationships easier today, humans, who have been left behind, will have many of the same chances to live the same things today. We'll all be more confident today than they were 20 years ago when the Internet and computers were invented.
