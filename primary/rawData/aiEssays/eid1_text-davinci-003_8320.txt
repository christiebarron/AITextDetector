I was recently running late for an important meeting. As I was flying down the highway at 97 miles per hour, I got behind a slow-moving truck. I was getting increasingly frustrated, but I made a conscious effort to be patient. 

I couldn’t have been more late to this meeting if I had tried, but instead of getting mad at the slow driver, I took it as an opportunity to take a few deep breaths and relax. I kept my speed at a steady pace, following the truck’s lead, and tried to enjoy the scenery as I drove.

I was relieved to eventually overtake the truck and get to my meeting in one piece. I was 15 minutes late, but my clients were incredibly understanding. I felt proud of myself for remaining calm and patient while in a tough situation. It’s not easy to contain frustrated feelings when you’re already running late, but staying patient helped me get to my engagement safely and more mindful than I usually would.
