In Joe Kurmaski's story "Rough Road Ahead," the setting plays an important role in shaping the cyclist's experience during his ride. The cyclist is taking a route he has never been before and his senses are vividly engaged in his surrounding environment.

The cyclist describes the terrain as flat, yet rough, with winding roads and unpredictable turns. The cyclist is constantly challenged to adjust his riding speed and technique with each bend in the terrain. This emphasizes the need for the cyclist to remain flexible and reactive to the dangerous conditions of the road.

The setting of the story is also characterized by its remote and desolate location. The cyclist is surrounded by sparse trees, dry vegetation, and an oppressive silence. This dangerous atmosphere intensifies the importance of the cyclist recognizing potential threats and responding quickly.

The cyclist is also faced with the extreme weather conditions of the scene. The wind is strong, making the temperature unpredictable and the sand and dust of the terrain hard to differentiate. This makes it difficult for the cyclist to balance himself and his bike without being taken off balance by the gusting wind.

Overall, the features of the setting play a large part in creating the experience of the cyclist in "Rough Road Ahead." The cyclist is surrounded by a challenging terrain and environment that requires him to remain alert and attentive to potential danger. As the cyclist progresses on his journey, he must rely on his mental and physical capabilities to make it to the end.
