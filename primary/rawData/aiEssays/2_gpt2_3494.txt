I believe that censorship of materials in libraries should serve as an important tool for preserving the intellectual property rights of the people. In order to protect this vital property, it is necessary that libraries and users be able to access material that is freely available and has high intellectual property protections, that are accessible to all users at all times, and that include those who are not affiliated with the current political and cultural developments.

For example, we welcome comments on content that could help us reduce the possible impact of a recent anti-Semitic hate crime. Comments on our comment section are available from 1:30 a.m. ET on the latest episode at http://nytimes.com/us/blog/jihad-attacks-islamists-is-really-racist-lives-at-jihad-libraries/

We are working to ensure that new comments are made as we consider the implications of comments with respect to these new stories and the role that community members can play in disseminating information.

To encourage people who like or want to contribute to our dialogue to discuss their views and experiences, we encourage posting about these comments, as well as other articles on our blog, so we can further discuss, critique, or even advocate for free speech on other platforms.

In the meantime, we ask you to join us in expressing your opinions about and expressing the views of our readers about Islam. We encourage you, too: You can read the comments and other responses
