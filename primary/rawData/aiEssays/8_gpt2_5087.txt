One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was an infant and I was playing on the piano because I wanted to look like one of those young men who'd got in trouble by playing on the piano. Maybe that's why I have the funny one now that I like playing.

It's just the way to get into a game and that's what I'm here to do in this country: give back.

You could win at any age. If you want to be happy and good, you have to believe in themselves. No one can beat you. You never know whether we'll win or not. We've got the best and then the worst. If you want to be successful, the worst can't do it. The best can only be beat by those who go for the good; everyone who wants to win will go for the good that nobody wants to win. But in life, if everybody wants the best, the best are the ones who are winning.

In life, I just think it's like one of the things that makes the game so good is when the ones who do the best are the ones who win. Not everyone is the best of the best. It's just that those who have the best of the best are the ones winning too, the ones who put in the work it takes to make the best of the best.
