I’ll never forget the first time my new boyfriend laughed with me. It was only our second date, and we had decided to go out for ice cream. We joked and laughed about everything and nothing at all. Something about the way he crinkled his nose when he laughed made me feel an inexplicable connection between us during those few minutes. 

Even after we were done eating, we kept joking. I started to make up silly jokes that would make my boyfriend laugh harder and harder. The sound of his contagious laughter filled the room, and before I knew it we had been sitting and talking for hours. 

It was the best night of my life. We laughed so much that other customers started to stare and giggle at us, but it didn’t bother either of us. We just kept on going, talking about everything and laughing at the silliest things. Now whenever I hear the sound of laughter, I think of that night and smile.
