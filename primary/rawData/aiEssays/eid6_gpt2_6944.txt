The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Some builders said they could not dock with a rigid, metal frame. Others were more convinced that using metal would prevent the plane from collapsing when the craft flew over them. Some argued that it would have to be placed behind steel supports. Others cited restrictions on where a pilot could dock with his hands. Some pilots, however, said they could dock with an airplane. Many pilots in the Empire State Complex told them that when they moved from one building to another, they would be faced with difficulties.

A team of engineers examined the pilot's seat, his head and his feet. They asked the pilots to record each step. They asked the pilots to watch them for four hours. Then they watched the pilots' reaction to the motion. They would later describe how they saw things: It flew. It shook. They wondered, Why did it do that? Why did they not react and let the object fall forward? The pilot did not give any further explanations about how this happened.

The experts concluded that no pilot, even with a headshot, simply could not control his car. One pilot told the engineers he could not be sure whether an engineer's actions would cause the airplane to fall. The builders were not prepared for the next moment.

After watching the pilots move to a new location, they watched the pilots as the ball of smoke and the falling aircraft rolled towards the aircraft. They
