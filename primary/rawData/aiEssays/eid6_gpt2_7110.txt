The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The only drawback was that some were simply too cramped or cramped to carry four people, which required them to sit on a chair, so they simply moved the car around like a freight train.

The architects of the building, Richard and John Kehl, also included the idea of using a helicopter to push something away the rest of the way, and to transport people and materials.

The three people had to wait as the vehicle moved back on the platform to get out. As the helicopter drifted onto the flat ground, the men noticed that its position was a little uncomfortable.

"It was awkward," Richard Kehle said. "It felt like you were sitting there onilsthe end of the platform â€“ I don't remember when or where he had been."

While the three men and other members of the engineering group did find it easy to get out of the flat, there were also other problems. The building's two elevators, one of which was down and another on its side, blocked out the view, creating another risk of collapse.

One of the first two to do this was Daniel Levelet, a senior engineer in the engineering group who led team of building engineers from the original tower.

The two elevator systems were used together exodus and removal as well as during demolition to help secure the four people.
