I believe that censorship of materials in libraries has never really crossed the line," said Dr. David C. Nadelmann, director of the Center for Democracy and Technology at Virginia Commonwealth University. "It's really a serious matter."

While Nadelmann said officials from Virginia Public Library don't expect to see what happens to libraries that comply with the ban, he also noted that they "really do have an responsibility to their readers to check their library regularly and that needs to be addressed."

Public library officials are not aware of any such change.
