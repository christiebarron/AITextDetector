Dear Editor,

It is an undeniable fact that the internet has become an integral part of our day to day lives. With the advent of computers, it has become faster and easier for us to accomplish tasks than ever before. However, the significant effects of computers on people should not be overlooked.

One of the most significant impacts computers have had is on our interactions with each other. Increased access to computers and social networks have promoted a culture of isolationism, reducing meaningful face-to-face conversations. Without meaningful conversations, we are unable to build strong relationships with others. This can lead to serious mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety.

Another issue is the lack of physical movement. Sitting at a computer for hours at a time reduces activity levels which can lead to obesity and other health issues. With the availability of online shopping and entertainment, there is a growing tendency for people to be sedentary, breaking the healthy routine of body activity.

Finally, with the ever-evolving technology, people have become increasingly reliant on computers. This may lead to difficulties should the technology ever become disrupted or fail. People then might find themselves feeling helpless and unable to cope in certain situations.

In conclusion, I believe that it is important to raise awareness of both the positive and negative effects computers can have on people. People must take care not to rely too heavily on computers and strive to maintain meaningful relationships and physical activities.

Sincerely,
