The poem ends with this line to emphasize the cycle of life in spring's renewal. Winter is a time of dormancy, when the hibiscus is not blooming. The narrator is reminded of this cycle with the coming of spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding again. The narrator is also reminded that although winter has passed, life keeps going and the cycle of life will continue, no matter what the narrator's results on the test may be. The line thus serves to emphasize that life has much more to offer than how well one does on a single test.
