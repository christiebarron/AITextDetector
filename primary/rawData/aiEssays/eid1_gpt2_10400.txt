Computers have many effects on people. We know that you're doing so much for us. Whether it's a job in our company or being part of a charitable foundation, people will do their part to make this possible. It's the hard work of your community that truly brings us here. That people will make all of this possible. The work of so many companies can also come directly from their community. The hard work of those entrepreneurs in the field of technology, both in-house and through your network can bring all of us together.

In 2012, in conjunction with TechCrunch, the company put out a piece that highlighted how an amazing team of people have given the world more support for open source projects they're working on, and more importantly, for people to come out on top. Over the past year alone, the team has created 6 million devices, provided over 6 million web sites, and produced over 12,000 tech articles based only on those 7,500 words. We're so grateful to such individuals who have supported so many projects and helped make us a better place for people like ourselves.
