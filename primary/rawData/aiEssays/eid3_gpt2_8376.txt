This can be a more nuanced assessment of the effect of rough road ahead, but some studies have taken what they call "piloted" or "piltered" (pun intended). Rough road Ahead is a good starting point for looking at how a cyclist might fit in to other people's conditions, their surroundings and what they feel should be their favourite roads.

To make some sense of some of the aspects of Rough Road Ahead, I've looked at what is known as "piloted" and "piltered" (pun intended), along with some examples taken from A.W. Roberts's book.

I've also looked at the effect of road length, location, conditions, and time of day on how different conditions might shape each area's rough road ahead.

There is a large amount of information out there about how short roads vary in speed and size, and why that changes on a daily basis and that, in particular, when compared with the other road types.

Roads that are shorter, more linear, more rugged and more narrow

The length of roads on average is influenced by the local conditions associated with them, which can range from the longest day of the year in winter to the shortest day of the year in mid-January. These
