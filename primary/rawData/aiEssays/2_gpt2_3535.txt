I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a necessary condition for social justice, including a good society, and the government must protect this right."

"Bland is at the center of our Nation's great tragedy and its aftermath. We must stand up to the powerful of both sides and ensure that all should have the same opportunities to learn about the world we live in," the statement said. "For today, the people of Oklahoma and across the country are asking for answers - not censorship as we've heard from our elected officers and the President that this injustice cannot be permitted on our national university campus and we will continue working to fix this problem as swiftly and effectively as possible."

It was not immediately clear whether Bland's arrest inspired the protest and a boycott of the university. But if that happens, its symbolic role for protests and divestment efforts is to show solidarity with the protesters. The president's endorsement is a direct rebuke of some of what could have been achieved had the group of protesters, some of whom were African-Americans, not been as vocal.

An online petition calling on the Justice Department to shut down Bland was launched after this story broke.
