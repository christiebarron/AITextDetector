The construction of the Empire State Building was filled with many obstacles, but one of the most challenging was the direction to build a docking station on the building for dirigibles.  Building a secure docking mast structure onto a skyscraper posed serious complications when trying to secure the massive metal ships to the mast.

The main difficulties facing the builders were the size and weight of the mooring station, which also had to take into account the aerodynamic force of the dirigibles, particularly during turbulent winds. The first step was to install a well-anchored mast which was strong enough to withstand the extreme wind speeds, and robust enough to bear the weight and size of the ships attempting to dock. In particular, the structure needed to be build with utmost safety in mind so it could be safely used during landing and takeoff.

Additionally, the elaborate operation of securing a lasso to the mast in order to tether the dirigibles was another major challenge.  This was developed over several decades, and required sophisticated technology and engineering to allow the ship to securely tie itself to the mast. Additionally, the pilots needed to be able to manoeuvre the ship and adjust its altitude so that the lasso could be correctly attached with minimal effort.

In light of these difficulties, it took over ten years of development and a series of trial runs before the first dirigible successfully docked at the Empire State Building in 1931. The engineering feat was so successful that the Empire State
