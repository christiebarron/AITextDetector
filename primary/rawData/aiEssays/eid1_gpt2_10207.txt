Computers have many effects on people. In one study, students who read and tried to think were more likely to have had children with depression, according to researchers from the Johns Hopkins Center for Psychiatric Research and Psychiatry's Office of Mental Health. More research is needed, however, to establish whether these effects are caused by something in our brains, or rather, the changes that brain tissue generates along with our thoughts.

"Our research supports a long-held view that, for some people, thought is hard to control," says James L. Leighton, Ph.D., of Johns Hopkins, and lead author of the study reported online today (Dec. 14). He adds, "For others, we can do so much better. With improved brain function, the effects of thought are likely even stronger than previously believed, creating new pathways for improvement."

Study Finds: Thought Is Hard To Control

People who read thoughts are much more likely to have children later in life, Leighton says. This is because, compared with control subjects, "there are fewer children who have had these children (i.e., no more), and there are greater increases in their intelligence when given thoughts about their own family and friends."

One of Leighton's group of investigators is a small group of scientists that study ideas related to the brain and the rest of life through the brain's visual and auditory cortex. There are some reports of thought patterns and patterns in the brain that might explain
