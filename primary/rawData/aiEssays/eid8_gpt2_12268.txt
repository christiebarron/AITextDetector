One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I learned about the first ever National Rifle Association, and a couple generations of kids who were afraid to go to the museum in front of its doors. I learned the lesson that the NRA was in part responsible for the deaths of over a million of its members. It also happened to be my best friend. The NRA was a political force. We were very religious. One of the reasons I felt it was so critical was that, as the NRA became more prominent, they brought it back into the political arena.

My grandfather was a Republican. They were very liberal on marriage. When he made his own policy, it brought his party's support up with him. So his friend, Bill Clinton, supported gay rights, too. It was good for him, but that same attitude that makes you do bad in politics can make you good for politics, too.

There was a time my dad was a Republican. In a small town, my little sister, then a high school science student, died of cancer. She was a great girl with a funny story about her mother. It was almost as if something wonderful happened down there. Her father and another doctor came here and said, "Let's look at this problem." They made it seem like it was about a case where someone would bring up things she had been saying to her and bring them up to them.

It was important to have a healthy, respectable family. Bill
