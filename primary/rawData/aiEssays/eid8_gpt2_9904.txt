One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I discovered that "I felt nothing, to be fair, in anything" and when I tried to stop laughing when writing that story.
The fact is that laughter is always there at the end of "anything". And if you are feeling guilty about being a "funny", then your laugh lines may be too heavy. It's usually just an excuse to make a joke, while keeping yourself up to speed with their developments. It's the most enjoyable way of expressing something.
That said, it's also important that jokes are fun and interesting to you. Just because you want to be a good comedian does not make you a bad one. Some jokes feel good and others are dull. You just have to pick and choose who you want.
