One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was a kid," McEvoy told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. "This was an old lady in my family who, for a while, was very, very busy doing this in this home. I wouldn't say that she was particularly good at the games but she had really done a great job; there was certainly a certain level of professionalism to her and my mom, and my little sister. They were very proud of her.

"People said, 'Why is she so angry?' Well, what would it mean to be a football player, really? The fact of the matter is, she was always going to be proud, she would put herself out there and then, sometimes, she would lose it. Not to mention, I was there for her every day of the week, I would be there for her on the field."
