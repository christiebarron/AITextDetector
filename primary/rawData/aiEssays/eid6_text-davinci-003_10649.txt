The Empire State Building posed a new and unique challenge for its builders—allowing dirigibles to dock at its top floor. Due to their size and weight, dirigibles posed a hefty engineering challenge in which the engineers would have to find a way to design a docking-structure that was both strong enough to detain such a massive transportation vessel and lightweight enough that it had minimal disruption on the building. Despite immense public interest in this form of air travel, the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with great difficulty in figuring out how to accomplish this feat.

The first challenge was identifying a method to build a mooring mast that was durable and efficient. According to Marcia Amidon Lüsted in her book The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building experimented with a few plans, trying to find the most suitable solution. At first they looked at steel designs, but quickly realized they would be too heavy and expensive to construct. The engineers eventually decided upon an aluminum structure, but the challenge remained as to how to build a tower that could compensate for the windy conditions atop the building.

The second obstacle builders of the Empire State Building would have to find a way to overcome was the force of wind. The idea was to construct a mast system that was able to absorb the shock of the docking of the airships as well as the high winds present at the top of the building. To accomplish this, the engineers employed the use of
