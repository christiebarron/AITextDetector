An example of a time someone in my life was patient was with one of my best friends, when he had a seizure and told me to calm down. Now I've been to his treatment facility and he's been great to me.

"I don't feel he's hurting, but I know he needs to be in there. I've done a lot to try and treat him and find a way to help him. As much as he wants to be my therapist, I don't think the way he is doing anything to help me and to my friend is sickening. What I am doing with his time, now is putting him in a state of comfort with that I don't feel is in line with what he's going through."

He added: "You would imagine, for someone to walk out there with these symptoms and it seemed to be a bit of a miracle, if you're talking to somebody like my friend, you would think they would want to help something he needs or wants to do. But when he comes home, his body has really changed. There's no pain so he feels better.

"He's doing a great job, it's a very happy thing, he's a nice guy and it's a fun little story to tell. "Well my friend was very nice, and I'd like to say he made everyone smile and it was really nice that he was coming in to me and sharing the story with everyone."
