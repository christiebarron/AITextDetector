The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because, like the rest of the story, this book is full of errors. A bad editor is always a bad idea, a really bad editor is always a bad idea. There's a new reader, a new writer is always a bad idea, a new book is always a bad idea.

The most glaring issue, though, is that there is a very, very strong temptation between what works and what doesn't. It's quite important in a lot of places to be able to use the book's strengths to your advantage.

The way Winter Hibiscus does this is that the problem starts with a "good editor" who is constantly making mistakes. First thing to do is to check for such mistakes.

It took me two months to get that right. I found some good editors at my university, and finally reached the point where I've no more of those mistakes anyway.

It turns out that it takes about a week. So if you're reading in the evening, for example, after getting your fix on one key detail, you'll probably have a long way to go to get that right. And that's a big part of how you have to be smart about writing a book in the morning.

I would suggest getting all your major writers familiar with a book that's being used by editors. And in particular, do it when it's working well or doesn't work very well for
