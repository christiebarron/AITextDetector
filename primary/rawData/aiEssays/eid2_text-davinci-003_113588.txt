As a concerned citizen and library patron, I am writing to voice my strong opposition to censorship in libraries. I believe that public libraries should stand as a beacon for knowledge, open to all and opposing any form of censorship. 

We have seen all too often how censorship has been used to suppress dissent, to oppress minority opinions and to repress freedom of speech. History tells us that censorship of books and other materials is detrimental to democracy, and yet this practice is still seen in some libraries.

They can provide insight into different points of view and can be used as tools to help with civil discourse and understanding. These materials should be available to anyone who wishes to access them.
