I recently had to wait a long time at the DMV for my license renewal. As soon as I arrived, I was stared at by irritated looking people who had been standing in line for hours already. Even though the wait was long and uncomfortable, I remained patient and understanding of the situation. I kept my frustration in check, knowing that everyone was in the same situation and everyone was being forced to wait in this line like me.

At times, I had to wait even longer when someone in front of me had a complicated problem that demanded extra attention by the clerk. I reminded myself to stay patient and kept my cool - as much as I could. It wasn't easy to remain patient on the hot summer day and I wanted to go home and finish the task, but I stayed calm and kept my focus on the end goal of getting my license renewed.

After hours of waiting, I finally stepped out of the DMV smiling with my renewed license. I had done it. I had been patient and waited my turn, even though it was long and uncomfortable. It was a lesson in patience for me, and I was proud that I kept my frustration to a minimum.
