I was out with a few friends one night. We were at a bar, just hanging out and talking, when I saw an elderly couple walking through the door. They smiled at us and we waved them in. 

We watched them out of the corner of our eyes as they took a seat a few tables away. Every now and then, we'd catch the two of them holding hands and exchanging gentle smiles and affection. I was so envious of the bond that they had.

Suddenly, the couple let out a loud laugh. I couldn't help but chuckle too. It was contagious. Before I knew it, everyone in the bar was laughing. We laughed so hard that tears were streaming down our faces. The elderly couple was laughing too, with huge smiles. It was a beautiful sight to see. 

The elderly couple made their way over to our table. We exchanged a few polite words and it was clear that they were charmed by our sense of humor. They asked us to join them for a drink, and we gladly accepted.

The rest of the night we sat around swapping jokes and stories. Whenever a joke was told or a story was shared, the couple would look at each other and laugh. Their shared laughter brought us all closer together and made us feel like friends. 

Watching the elderly couple laugh, share stories, and be affectionate with each other made me appreciate the relationships I have with my friends even
