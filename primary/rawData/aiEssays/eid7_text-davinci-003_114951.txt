I was recently at a restaurant having dinner with my family. We had ordered our food and were waiting for it to arrive. After waiting for quite some time, our dishes finally showed up, only to find that my order was incorrect. I was initially frustrated, but rather than complain, I chose to remain patient. 

I calmly pointed out the mistake to our waiter and informed him that our order had been incorrect. He apologized profusely and asked me for my patience while he went to remake my dish. I nodded and said of course. I waited patiently while my dish was made and soon enough, it was served to me. 

The food was delicious and I enjoyed the rest of the meal. I was proud of myself for keeping my cool in the situation; I could have easily voiced my frustration, but chose instead to be patient.
