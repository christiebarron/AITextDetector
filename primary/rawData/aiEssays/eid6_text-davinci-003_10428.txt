The construction of the iconic Empire State Building was a remarkable feat of engineering that defied the odds and provided New York City with a unique and iconic architectural masterpiece. However, a lesser known and often overlooked feature of this building was the innovative plan for its “mooring mast”, or the allowance of docking dirigibles. Although it seemed like a simple idea, the building of the mooring mast presented many unique challenges and obstacles to the builders of the Empire State Building. 

In an effort to facilitate airship traffic to the building, the original design of the skyscraper included a 200 foot spire at the very top of the building, to which the dirigibles of the era could dock. The spire was designed to be outfitted with numerous safety features to ensure that airships would have sufficient protection during docking. However, infamously strong winds and unfavorable weather conditions at the site of the building presented one of the earliest obstacles for the mooring mast’s designers. Without accounting for such adverse conditions, the spire would not be able to withstand the strong force of the airships against the walls of the building and the risk of an accident upon docking would be too great. 

A further challenge for the mooring mast was the issue of providing both security to the dirigibles and the passengers aboard them, as well as accessibility for loading and unloading of passengers and goods. To address this, one of the
