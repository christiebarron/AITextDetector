The setting of ‘Rough Road Ahead’ by Joe Kurmaski directly affects the cyclist’s experience and performance. By having it set in a city, the cyclist is immediately faced with a multitude of obstacles like traffic and intersections. This is made more challenging by the surrounding environment of tall buildings that casts long shadows and blocks out much of the sunlight. This contributes to making visibility difficult when deciding what is ahead of them and could lead to an accident.

The city setting also leads to obstacles such as uneven pavement, pot holes, and debris that the cyclist has to avoid as well as cars. All of these objects create a level of risk and allow for the cyclist to be challenged by the terrain.

Furthermore, the setting also contributes to the sense of accomplishment that the cyclist experiences when they eventually reach their destination. Travelling through the city up and down hills, the cyclist has experienced an array of terrain and obstacles, but has been successful in doing so. This can increase the cyclist’s confidence and improve their abilities as a rider.
