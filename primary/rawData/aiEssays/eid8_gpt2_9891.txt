One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was 11 years old, at the time I thought this was the same thing. I was trying to find my voice, that voice I never quite saw again. What is the magic of this? Well the best part it gives you a sense of excitement for your mother and the world.

I found it through watching my father and his friends from university who were trying to get by and I didn't want them to. My parents were all pretty down, their whole community was down, and my mom was down too. It was the least I could do for myself. There was a sense of the world getting lost, and I found that very funny. I had had my own way of being so used to the world, how they would not be telling me, let alone the truth, if I was lucky.

So yeah, I am going to keep doing my thing. I have a new job and I can now live quite comfortably on a budget. I have friends I call my parents. I am in the studio now with the people in my group here at the studio, and I am not only doing my job, I am in studio now. When I am done with this I will be in the studio soon and I will have a new project. I have started to learn with my son the world of art. I am very happy about it and have decided to tell about some of it.

How did you
