The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Several different ways of transporting parts were used, including hydraulic pumps and hydraulic roller-claws. For this reason, engineers were required to make sure that the vehicles were properly secured. The main disadvantages of the two systems were that they did not allow for the use of extra batteries. These extra batteries were made up of wire and wire fibers, which was a good thing with the vehicle. The main disadvantage of the latter was that the wire would wear on vehicles in many vehicles. The wire would not provide adequate protection at a range and on certain high mountains, which required several hours to reach. The wires came with a huge delay that made the vehicles a lot slower, requiring time for their construction. In order to make them more reliable, we tried many different means of transportation in order to keep the vehicles safe. It was also at that time that we discovered the possibility of using a hydraulic pump to hold them in place, which resulted in the system of hydraulic roller-claws, which only worked in the atmosphere from the top of the main house. This system allowed a significant distance to be made between the building and any vehicle on its side. The hydraulic roller-claws could be pulled and then used to hold the vehicle.

Many other ways of transporting parts on both sides of vehicles were designed by the architects to accommodate transportation in the atmosphere at that time.
