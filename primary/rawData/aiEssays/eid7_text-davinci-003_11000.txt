I recently experienced the patience of my grandfather. Just recently, his disability has been gradually getting worse and he can only move around with the help of a wheelchair. He had a very important doctor's appointment one day and his regular caretaker had something urgent to attend to. Instead of getting frustrated, he remained patient and waited until she could return later in the day.

It amazed me to see how he was so understanding of the situation. He could have complained and asked me to help him out, but he chose to have patience. I believe it was taking a toll on his health waiting in the heat of the day, but he never complained once. I truly admire his patience and strength. It is a lesson I will take with me for the rest of my life.
