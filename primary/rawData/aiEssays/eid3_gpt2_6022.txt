Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

Other times the setting enables you to place the bike on the right side, not the left; some use it as a parking space, such as in 'Strictly on the Right' and 'Gone With the Wind' (below). Other times, the setting is turned on your dashboard or backlit to avoid other vehicles from taking pictures or reading text messages. The cyclist must not touch the turning switch. In some cases the setting is turned on for a small number of seconds before it switches off again and the cyclist can begin the other vehicle's road testing or motorway testing.
