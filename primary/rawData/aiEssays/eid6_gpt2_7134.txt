The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. An engineering firm that had once designed the Empire State building's cantilever was bankrupt in 2004, in part because of the company being accused of creating a lack of compliance with both the Federal Building Regulations (FBP) and the City Building Code, the latter of which had allowed dirigibles to be built up. A further challenge involved a problem with the cantilever housing code, which required dirigibles to be built for one dwelling only, and the building had no code for the other dwellings.

However, in 2005, as the Department of Housing and Urban Development published its long-awaited and highly informative analysis of a proposed dirigible system (pdf), the Department of Building and Urban Development (HUD) found that it was unlikely to meet the requirements of the CFR and its regulatory framework in the light of the current government shutdown. A short list of concerns outlined:

· Departure risk. The Department of Housing and Urban Development finds that existing dirigibles could never function in housing, especially for workers. "Warrantless housing" (a term similar to "crowd-dwelling" where one person or two people have to wait for each other for the next person to get out to work), which requires a lot of energy, has a long-term negative impact on the public, and would negatively impact transportation options.
