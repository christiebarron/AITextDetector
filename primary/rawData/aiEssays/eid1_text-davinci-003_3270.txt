Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my thoughts on the effects computers have had on people and to urge your readers to think carefully about the consequences. In our rapidly-developing world, technology is evolving at a quickly growing rate. As a result, computers have become an integral tool in many aspects of our lives, both in our businesses and in our homes.

However, the use of computers has had some drastic consequences on the way humans interact with each other. Social media has produced a great deal of confusion between the real world and the virtual world; it can be so easy to get lost in the online conversation. People now spend more time talking to computers and devices than to each other. As a result, people have begun to lose their sense of social communication, and it is quite alarming.

Furthermore, computers have also become our lifeline. We are now so reliant on our technology that we no longer feel the need to do things manually or to make ourselves useful. Computers have essentially sucked up the extra time in our day that was once used to do something more meaningful and creative.

In conclusion, the increase in computer use has both positive and negative implications. It has certainly made life easier
