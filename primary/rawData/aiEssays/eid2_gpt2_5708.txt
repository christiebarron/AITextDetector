Tokyo police had originally planned on arresting 20 people in connection with the recent cyberattacks of three police units in the city's district, but the Tokyo Police Service said in a statement issued early Thursday that no arrests had been made.

At least eight people were arrested with digital devices in a drive-by shooting that left a 32-year-old man dead on Friday. Police said they believe the attack, which broke into at least nine computers across five Tokyo districts, might have been the work of the authorities.

Japanese news sites were quick to blame the attack on hackers in Europe before the cyberattack on the National Archives.
