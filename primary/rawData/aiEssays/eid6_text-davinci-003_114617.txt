The Empire State Building was designed to incorporate an airship dock, a cutting-edge feature that would accommodate the new technology of passenger air travel. Unfortunately, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles on their mission to make the building's dock compatible with the large dirigibles of the era.

The inclusion of a mooring mast for the dirigibles was one of the first obstacles to overcome. The mooring mast needed to be tall enough for passengers on the airship to transfer safely and securely to the building. The builders of the Empire State Building found a solution to this challenge by locating the mast in the center of the building with two additional masts on the south and north corners of the building for extra support.

However, completing the architectural design of the docking station was only the beginning. When the builders tested the station with a dirigible, they discovered that the mooring mast was not sufficiently stable to support the ship's weight. The engineers addressed this issue by adding steel frames and cables around the mast to create additional points of contact for the dirigible to press against while docking.

The builders also had to devise a way to slow the landing of the dirigible. To do this, they created an air tight compartment underneath the building. This compartment was designed to fill with pressurized air when a dirigible was near, creating enough resistance to slow the dirigible's speed without endangering passengers.

Finally, the
