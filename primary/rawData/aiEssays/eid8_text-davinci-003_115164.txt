I was out with my best friend at a bar one night, and we were having a great time. We were laughing and joking around, telling each other stories, and there was a great sense of an easy bond between us.

Suddenly, we heard an overly loud laugh from one of the groups sitting at another table. We turned towards the sound, and as we looked at them, we realized the person laughing was coming from the woman wearing a purple hat. The laugh was loud, boisterous, and startling, but it was contagious.

My best friend and I looked at each other in astonishment. Even though we had just met this group of people, we were all laughing aloud together. We exchanged pleasantries with them, and everyone around us was amused and laughing too. 

It felt like I had a permanent smile plastered across my face, and I hadn't felt that much joy in a long time. My best friend and I made a new group of friends that night, all brought together from a single loud belly laugh. We parted that night with laughter in our hearts, and an unbreakable bond between us all.
