I still remember the first day I met my future husband. I was a bit nervous, but he immediately put me at ease with his infectious laughter. We were talking about how our families were similar in some ways, and I made some joke that was probably a little corny - but his laughter made me feel so confident and relaxed. I thought he was perfect right then and there.

Even now, after being together for years, one of the things that I love most about our relationship is that we can laugh together. We can laugh over the little things like funny movies or even the silly arguments that happen from time to time. It's like there's an understanding between us that laughter is the best way to make everything sound better.

No matter what else is going on, we always find a way to laugh together. I know that it's what will help keep our relationship strong for years to come.
