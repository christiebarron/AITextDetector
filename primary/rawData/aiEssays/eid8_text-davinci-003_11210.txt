It all started with a silly joke. My best friend and I had been walking around the mall for hours, looking for the perfect gift for my mom's birthday. We stepped into an electronics store to look around and my friend suddenly stopped in the middle of the aisle and said, "Why don't you just get her a TV remote control?" 

I couldn't help but laugh at the suggestion. My friend must have guessed my thoughts because they started to laugh too. We couldn't stop laughing about it, no matter how hard we tried. The laughs just kept coming and coming until we were both rolling on the ground in fits of laughter.

We got some strange looks from the other customers, but it didn't matter. This was the kind of laughter that connected us on a deeper level, hinting that words were not necessary to understand each other.

We eventually moved on to look at other things, but the laughter was still there. Our laughter had brought us something remarkable: a understanding and connection of a kind and something that would keep us smiling for days. 

It was something that made us both realise that, no matter what, we would always be there for each other.
