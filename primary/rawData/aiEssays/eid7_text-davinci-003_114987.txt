I had a sick family member at home and I had to provide care for weeks. It was a very difficult situation as they weren't very pleasant. They would constantly criticize me and accuse me of not doing enough. It was hard to take but I was patient. 

I didn't get angry or defensive, I just kept doing what I could. I reminded myself to keep a positive attitude and think of the end result - that this person I loved was getting better and on their way to being healthy again. 

I had plenty of moments that were difficult, frustrating, and taxing. But I kept going, and remained patient. Eventually things got better and I am proud I was able to keep my composure and stay patient throughout the process.
