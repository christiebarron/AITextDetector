Computers have many effects on people. The average age of a child who develops Alzheimer's disease for one week or even a day is over two. People who have schizophrenia or bipolar disorder will also show behavioral problems, and may suffer from developmental delays.

Because there may be very different kinds of dementia, the study has raised the question as to whether Alzheimer's is caused by an individual's own disease. That, in turn, could mean that other cognitive deficiencies or abnormalities, such as a lack of memory, are present in a baby.

Dr. Martin Gilman, who conducted the study, called the results one more proof that Alzheimer's doesn't just be caused by Alzheimer's.

"This research shows that it is not just one generation, and we need to understand what will happen if the disease evolves over other generations or we can't see a link between Alzheimer's and mental disease â€” or any of the other features we find," he said.
