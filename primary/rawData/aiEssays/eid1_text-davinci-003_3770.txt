Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. The advancements in technology have truly revolutionized our lives significantly, making each task from grocery shopping to handling complex equations a breeze. Nevertheless, the overuse of computers has brought about certain social and psychological concerns which should not be ignored.

First and foremost, reliance on computers has reduced our ability to think and solve issues independently. People struggle to perform complex operations without the aid of a computer. Moreover, the increasing use of computer technology has made people more passive in nature, reducing their availability to take decisions on their own. In addition to that, the overuse of technology has also been linked to mental health concerns such as insomnia, anxiety, depression, and increased levels of stress. 

However, it must be noted that computers offer an abundance of benefits. They allow us to connect with people from around the world and access to a large database of information. As a result, people are better informed about recent developments and can make sound decisions.

In conclusion, computers are essential in our day to day lives. Nevertheless, we must be careful about overusing them and take necessary breaks in order to safeguard our health and well-being.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
