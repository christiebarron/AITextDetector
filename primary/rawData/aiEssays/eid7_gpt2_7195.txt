An example of a time someone in my life was patient was taking off the clothes of this guy who was going to the hospital for his accident.

So, in his 30s and he was a good guy, he could go back to home again.

He knew they had been apart for quite a while and couldn't give a good explanation or explain anything.

And then he started to have a nervous breakdown and he started asking me, 'Where has Dad come from? Why do they do that or does he just die, like me?' and I was like, "Well you think my dad wasn't doing this?'

If we would've known back then I wouldn't have known what my dad was doing out here. I just never thought of him as anything other than a father.

He was a good boy and I knew that I didn't really look him either.

He was a good wife (whom I'm still very close) and I was worried about him.

But maybe later on he was really sick, and the doctors were doing their best and it didn't look great.

And so I started to think about it as an accident.

Then he came back with his parents and I went home and they said, 'We're here with you. You didn't do any of this to deserve this.'

And then in my 30s, he got sick and he came back just like that.
