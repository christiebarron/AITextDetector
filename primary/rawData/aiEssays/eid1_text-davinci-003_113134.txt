Dear Editor,

The advent of computers has changed life in many ways, and recently I have been thinking about the impact that computers have specifically on people. While computers have revolutionized the world through efficient communication, education, and entertainment, they may also be having a negative effect on people.

First of all, computers are slowly replacing human labor, with companies increasingly turning to automation and programs to complete tasks. This leads to fewer job opportunities and potentially lower wages, resulting in a less secure financial future for many people. Moreover, computers can lead some people to become overly reliant on them, forgetting that they can solve problems on their own.

Furthermore, computer addiction has become a real issue. Many people become consumed by nonstop scrolling on their phones, browsing social media, and playing video games, neglecting important activities such as exercise, face-to-face socializing, and sleep. And even when we’re not using them, computers can still be distracting with their vibrant colors and addiction to notifications.

I believe it’s important to recognize the detrimental effects of using computers, and discussions such as these can shed light on the issue and help people make more cognizant decisions about how they use computers in their own lives. For this reason, I urge your readers to reflect on how they use their computers andThink of ways to limit or modify their computer use to better benefit themselves.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
