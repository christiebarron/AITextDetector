I was walking home from school one day, when I noticed an old man struggling to carry his groceries. He had two large bags of food and was barely able to make it down the street. I wanted to help him, but I wasn’t sure if he would accept help from a stranger. I decided to remain patient and just follow him at a distance, so that I wouldn’t make him uncomfortable. 

Finally, he stopped at an intersection and I could tell that he was almost out of breath. I slowly approached him and offered to carry one of his bags for him. To my surprise he was extremely grateful and readily accepted my help. Throughout the rest of the walk, we continued to chat and laugh while I carried his groceries. 

It was a gratifying experience for me to be able to help a stranger in need. I learned that day the importance of staying patient and that sometimes the best way to be kind to someone is to just be there.
