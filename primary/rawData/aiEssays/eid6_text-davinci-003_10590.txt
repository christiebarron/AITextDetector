The Empire State Building is one of the world’s most famous landmarks, and when it was built during the early twentieth century, it was at the forefront of the technology of the era. The idea of incorporating airships, or dirigibles, into the design was ambitious, and a major factor in the building’s fame. However, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock safely.

The main obstacle was a practical one: the airships of the time were far larger than had ever been incorporated into a building’s design before, leading to the need to manually operate the building’s mooring mast - a tall, thin metal structure that allowed airships to temporarily be connected to the building. The mooring mast would need to be extremely tall in order to safely accommodate the largest dirigibles. However, building a structure tall enough to accommodate these airships would have been risky and costly.

In addition to the practical obstacle of creating a safe and operable mooring mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced regulatory challenges. During this time, the U.S. Air Safety Administration had yet to develop the regulations needed to safely integrate airships into the building design. The Empire State Building was in danger of violating the limited air regulations from the time, leading to its pilots being barred from docking.

The builders of the Empire State Building also faced opposition from
