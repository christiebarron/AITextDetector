Rodriguez takes us back to his upbringing in a small rural town in Cuba, and describes his memories of home in vivid detail, painting a picture of a place full of rich culture and virtual indestructibility. He speaks of the intimate relationship between his family members and the community, and how the land shaped him into who he is. 

Rodriguez recalls the feeling of bittersweet loss when he and his family left for the United States, never to return to their beloved home. Although Rodriguez took with him all of his memories of his hometown, these memories remain distant and diminished by the passage of time. He speaks evocatively of a past that he can never completely hold onto and of a future that is constantly moving forward. This sense of loss is reinforced by his dreamlike reflections on the people and places he has left behind, and the impossible prospect of revisiting these places. 

The palpable nostalgia of Rodriguez’s memoir is also laced with hope. He speaks of his dreams and aspirations, his determination to make the most of his new opportunities in the United States, and the self-assuredness he has gained since his move. He speaks of the comfort he finds in returning to these memories, and how they continue to strengthen him as he moves forward.
