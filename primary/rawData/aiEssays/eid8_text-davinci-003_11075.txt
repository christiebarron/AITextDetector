I had just moved to a new city for a new job and needed to make friends. One day while out shopping, I ran into an old college friend I hadn't seen since graduating. We started catching up, and almost as if it was meant to be, we both started laughing at the same time. We laughed for a good five minutes, and it felt like we hadn't missed a beat since our last conversation. 

We chatted for a while and decided to go grab a cup of coffee. We had been chatting for a few hours when the barista called out our order. He handed me my drink, and I noticed he misspelled my name. I typically hated this annoyance, but this time I didn't mind. I showed it to my friend, and we started laughing hysterically. 

That's when it hit me: I'd found a true friend. It's been a few months since then, and we still enjoy the same sort of laughter whenever we're together. With regular conversations full of shared energy, laughter is what sets the foundation for this wonderful relationship.
