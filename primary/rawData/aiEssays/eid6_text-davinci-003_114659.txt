The Empire State Building was one of the most iconic landmarks of the twentieth century. It was designed to allow dirigibles to dock at the tops, something which was seen as impossible when it was first proposed. Despite the potential benefits that would come from allowing dirigibles to dock at the building, the obstacles that needed to be overcome made the project look almost impossible.

The first obstacle that had to be overcome was the size of the Empire State Building. The original idea was to build the top of the building with a spacious landing platform for large dirigibles and a mooring mast. The mast was to be housed in the middle of the landing platform and would be used as a docking spot for the airships. It soon became clear, however, that the size of the building made the plans unfeasible—there simply wasn’t enough room on top of the building for both a landing platform and a mooring mast.

The second obstacle was the weight of the airships. It was determined through trial and error that the structure of the top of the building could not support the weight of a large airship. This was a major problem as it meant that the building could not be used as a docking point for airships even if sufficient space could be found.

The third obstacle was wind. It was found that the winds at the height of the Empire State Building could be strong and unpredictable, making it difficult for dirigibles to
