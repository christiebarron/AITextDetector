The setting of Joe Kurmaski's 'Rough Road Ahead' plays a significant role in the cyclist's experience. The cyclist embarks on a long training ride as they follow a particular stretch of narrow rural road. 

The terrain is described as having steep hills, sharp turns, and slippery hairpin curves. These conditions can be dangerous for a cyclist as it can cause them to quickly lose control of their bicycle and sustain a serious injury.

The harsh weather conditions add an additional layer of difficulty for the cyclist. The heavy rain causes the road to become slick and muddy which makes the sharp turns and slippery hairpins even more difficult to navigate. The heavy downpour reduces visibility, making it harder to see the terrain ahead which increases the risk of hitting any unexpected obstacles.

The hostile environment of the rural road creates a physical challenge for the cyclist. They must expend more energy in order to navigate the rough terrain and weather. This can lead to burnout and fatigue which can ultimately lead to a breakdown in focus and mental exhaustion. 

The cyclist is also subjected to psychological pressure. The sense of loneliness and isolation from the outside world adds an additional level of stress to the cyclist. 

Overall, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a variety of ways. The cyclist must face physical and psychological obstacles in order to complete their journey which can be both intimidating and inspiring.
