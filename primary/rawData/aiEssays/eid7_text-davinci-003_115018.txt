Sometimes, I think the greatest thing I learned from my parents is the importance of patience. I distinctly remember one summer when I was eight years old and we had gone camping in the forest. Everything had gone smoothly and we had reached the campsite early, so much ahead of those other campers that I thought we would surely be the first to pitch our tents.

But then, something unexpected happened. A family of beautiful deer had come out of the woods and it was mesmerizing to watch them, especially the little deer walking around. My parents wanted to take a few photos and while they accessed their camera, the other campers rushed in and started pitching their tents.

I was so frustrated that I had to wait but instead of getting upset, my parents reminded me of the importance of patience. They said that we would have to wait for our turn and there was no need to get worked up.

So, we ended up waiting patiently for our turn and finally, with some determination, we were able to get a spot to pitch our tent. That incident taught me that even when facing adversity, there is no need to be angry or impatient. Being patient and calm can help us handle even the most difficult situations.
