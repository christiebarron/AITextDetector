The ending line of the poem serves as a reminder that, even though failure may have been experienced, there is always an opportunity to try again with renewed courage and optimism. The imagery of a hibiscus budding in the springtime is a metaphor for new hope and fresh beginnings, as the blooming new hibiscus also stands for the idea of adventure and open exploration that will come with a more positive outlook. Additionally, the line can be interpreted to signify a lesson that comes with failure—the understanding of one’s own limitations and the ability to be more resilient and prepared for whatever the future may bring.
