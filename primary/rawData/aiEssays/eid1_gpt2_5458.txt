Computers have many effects on people. As I mentioned earlier, the time it takes people to be in one place to achieve the same goal is time-consuming, costly, and unprofitable. And if you're a new programmer, I don't have anything to say about that, except that even as programmers (whether you be old school or newbies), you have to work harder than someone who spent the previous 15 years in some other industry. That's not something you can go through as a young programmer in any other job, because at that point all of them should be in tech. My wife and I don't do that either. So for us now, it's simply an investment that doesn't have real value.

But, also, you need to learn math, science, economics and business skills in order to be successful. That means teaching yourself things that will help you grow your mind, so that the brain expands, the muscles get stronger; that it produces and controls things, and so on.

You need to understand your personality and your relationship with money and money-making efforts. Money is the thing that has brought you to where you live (at your home, at your office, at home). That's the place where you're learning about the things that make you unique in your lives. But I also realize that this isn't just because there are still a number of people who are not successful, who are not smart, who aren't good actors
