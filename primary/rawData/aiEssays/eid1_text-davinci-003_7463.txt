By ending the poem this way, the speaker in the poem reflects on the idea of growth and renewal. Through the imagery of the winter hibiscus, the speaker conveys the idea of renewal and hope even in the midst of a difficult winter season. The speaker speaks of coming back in spring, when the snows melt and the geese return, hinting at not only the beginning of the natural cycle of the year, with the transition from winter to spring, but also of the idea that things can improve and that renewal is possible. This is highly reflective of the speaker's struggles in the poem, as they face an arduous exam and are filled with doubt over their abilities. The closing line of the poem emphasizes that the speaker is not giving up, but instead looking towards the future with the hope of being able to take the exam again and achieve a better outcome.
