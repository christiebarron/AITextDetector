I remember the time when my daughter was two and had just started kindergarten. She was so excited to be in school and finally have the same experience as her older brother. I was so proud of her for finally being part of the club. 

However, on her first day, it took her an hour just to get out the door. She wanted to put on every piece of clothing in her entire wardrobe, and it was a struggle to try to redirect her attention to getting out the door on time. 

I could feel my frustration boiling over, but I refrained from getting angry. I took deep breaths, counted to ten, and reminded myself that she was only two and did not understand the importance of being on time yet.

Eventually, I was able to reason with her, and we got out the door just in time. Seeing her little face light up as she smiled and ran over to her friends was worth the wait.

The whole experience taught me the importance of patience. We all have our own timelines and it's important to remain understanding and tolerant of the journey each person is taking. It was a reminder that sometimes I need to let go and take it one step--and one smile--at a time.
