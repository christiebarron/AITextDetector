The Empire State Building was an iconic landmark in New York City, and was the central focus of some of the most daring technological advancements in the early 20th century. One of the most difficult tasks facing those who built the building was the uncertain prospect of allowing dirigibles to dock at its roof â€“ something never attempted before. To better understand the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building encountered in this pursuit, one must first investigate the details of these aircraft and their potential requirements for anchorage.

Dirigibles, commonly known as airships, are large, cigar-shaped, helium-filled aircrafts whose buoyancy allows them to lift off the ground and stay afloat in the air. To safely dock a dirigible, designers must create a winching system that can securely attach the dirigible to a mooring mast or tower. This system was made possible by advances in steel technologies, allowing for the creation of strong but lightweight structures, and enabled the cable of the winching system to be securely wound around the Empire State Building's mast.

However, the challenge that remained for the builders of the Empire State Building was that of the size and weight of dirigibles relative to the structure of the building. These large aircrafts were often heavier than the structure of the building was designed to withstand, and as a result, designers had to devise a support system that could be used to securely fasten the dirigibles to the mast and cushion any strain.
