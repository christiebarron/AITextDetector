My husband and I have been married for almost 10 years, and we've been happily in love since the very first day we met. We always feel connected despite being separated at times, but nothing makes us feel closer than when we share a good laugh. 

Recently, when we had gone out to a movie, I noticed that he was acting a bit strange throughout the night. During the movie, he seemed distracted and he kept looking at his watch, so when the credits started rolling, I turned to him with a bit of confusion and asked him what was wrong. 

He hesitated for a moment, and then said, "I lost my wallet!" 

I naturally burst into laughter at that, and it quickly inspired him to join in. Even though I knew he was a bit worried about his wallet, the laughter put us both into a better mood. We eventually found it, but we still reflect back on that moment with a fondness. 

In the end, laughter was the perfect thing to bring us together yet again.
