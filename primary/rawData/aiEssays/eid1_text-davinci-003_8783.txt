I was sitting in a café with my best friend, catching up on news since our last meeting a month prior. A sudden silence fell between us, which seemed to signal a break in the conversation. But then my best friend's face lit up with a mischievous grin, and he began to laugh. I couldn't help but laugh in turn, and soon enough we were both laughing so hard that the people in the café turned to watch us.

The reason for our laughter? Earlier in the day, my best friend had heard a funny joke involving a talking donkey, and in his excitement he had rushed over to the cafe to tell it to me. Except that, in the hurry and confusion, he had somehow gotten the details of the joke confused, and was instead telling a nonsensical story involving a talking cat.

When he realized his mistake, we both just laughed harder! We continued to share stories of our recent adventures afterwards, but it was with the shared memory of our out-of-control laughter that made all the difference.
