 

Dear Editor,

As a concerned citizen, I would like to share my thoughts on the effect computers have on people in our community and beyond.

It is clear that computers have allowed us to make leaps and bounds in terms of efficiency, productivity, and entertainment. We can now communicate with people anywhere, share and access vast stores of information, and automate many tedious tasks. On the other hand, heavy computer use can be damaging to physical and mental states. 

Studies have shown that computers can lead to physical ailments such as eye strain, headaches, and fatigue from fatigue from long periods of sitting in the same posture. Additionally, the blue light that emanates from computers can interrupt sleep patterns and disrupt natural hormone production. 

As for mental health effects, being constantly bombarded with thousands of pieces of information from our screens with breakneck speed can lead to anxiety and stress, as well as distractions from the more meaningful interactions and activities. 

It is important that we become more aware of the negative physical and mental side effects of too much computer use. My hope is that people will be encouraged to take regular breaks for their eyes, to set screen time limits for themselves, and to enjoy meaningful social engagements away from the computer screen. 

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
[your name]
