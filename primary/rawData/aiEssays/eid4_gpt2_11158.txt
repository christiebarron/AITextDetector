The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it is the first time that the game has been so widely spread across the entirety of fandom. A common objection to this particular book is that it is too simplistic, over the top, and poorly written. The game itself is well written, but some of the "game's plot" is underdeveloped in the main plot, the writing (if you are used to the word) of the story and the character interactions is too clunky, and the characters are too loose. There are also a number of inconsistencies throughout the book, some of which are almost incomprehensible to the average gamer, and almost almost nonsensical to anyone else who has ever played the series. The fact that they're both based on characters you know and love in one form or another could be due to some sort of technical or game design problem with their worlds, but I think this is a very minor drawback, and I'd like to see the next generation of the game made by someone with more experience with it. If you read the fan site and read the story, I would be very happy to hear from you about your experiences with Winter Hibiscus. You could give some suggestions on how you would improve the quality of the story or something else, and when the future of the series starts to get a lot closer, we could be very interested in hearing them.

As a fan/writer, I believe that I can play the final chapters, and enjoy it
