A lot of people get in front and leave after 10 to 15 minutes on the roads through 'poor roads'. A lot of people are trying to make it to round the corner and make it to town before the bike race. Most people start on a decent path but quickly come across places that are a bit boring where you have to pay for a good ride.

Most of the towns with cycling and running culture in Europe take a bit of time to develop. Some of them, like Hamburg (which is a good example), had a decent track and a bit of high-speed racing going on at the end of the 90s. They probably weren't the first town to make it but they could've changed that for the better.

The problem is we don't believe in 'the only town to have running culture'. On almost every other European city it still takes at least one year to build a new road. It takes several years of very hard work to build a new road for a particular city on a day
