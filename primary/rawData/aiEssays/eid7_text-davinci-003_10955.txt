I remember the time my husband came home from work with terrible news. He had been laid off from his job of 10 years. We were both in shock. He had been the family's primary breadwinner for the entire time we'd been married. We had no idea how we were going to make ends meet. 

Despite the news, I stayed calm and patient. I could tell he was feeling overwhelmed and I wanted to be there to support him. I knew it wouldn't do any good to panic or be negative. Instead, I put my worries aside and immediately started brainstorming ideas with him. We had to come up with a plan ASAP to make ends meet while he searched for a new job. 

We talked all night, coming up with potential ideas on how to make ends meet. He applied for unemployment benefits and I took on extra hours at work and sold a few things we no longer needed. 

My husband eventually found a job after a couple of months, and we got back to our normal routine. I'm so proud of how patient and resilient I was during that time. It could have easily been a very stressful and overwhelming situation, but I learned that it pays to stay optimistic and take life in stride.
