I had waited in line outside of the post office for 15 minutes already and I was starting to get impatient. The line didn't appear to be moving and I had a lot of important things to do that day. 

Eventually, an elderly lady came to the front of the line with several packages to mail and several sheets of international postage. As she sorted through her packages, it became clear that she didn't know how to fill out the paperwork correctly or calculate the postage. 

The man behind the counter, however, was very patient with her. He took the time to sit down with her and explain each step of the process slowly and clearly, and he even offered to calculate the postage for her so she didn't have to worry about it. 

It took them nearly half an hour, but they eventually got everything sorted out and the elderly lady was able to get her packages on their way. After seeing how patient the post office employee was, I felt ashamed of my impatience.
