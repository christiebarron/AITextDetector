The building of the Empire State Building is often thought of as a revolutionary feat that changed the landscape of American architecture. However, the ambitious plans also included a revolutionary feat of its own: allowing dirigibles to dock atop the building. This feat presented a number of obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome in order to make this ambitious plan a reality.

The first obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building encountered was the lack of existing infrastructure. Unlike ships or airplanes, which had been in use for decades, dirigibles were a relatively new form of transportation, and therefore lacked the infrastructure found in airports or seaports. This meant that the builders had to create a completely unique infrastructure, including a mooring mast, mooring post, and a cabling system in order to secure the dirigible. 

The second obstacle was safety. Dirigibles tend to be much more fragile than other forms of transport, and this means that the techniques used to moor them must be precise. The builders of the Empire State Building knew that any failure on their part could lead to disastrous consequences, so they had to make sure that every part of the mooring system was strong enough to support a large dirigible. In addition, the mooring system had to be built with the utmost care and precision in order to ensure that it would not fail and cause a dirigible crash.

The third obstacle was the weather.
