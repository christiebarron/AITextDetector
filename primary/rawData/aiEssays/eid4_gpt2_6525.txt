The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because all of my favorite chapters are here that should be read on their own. I was hoping it might bring a new generation to the topic of Hibiscus, or maybe a better look at some of the myths as well. It really surprised me a lot to see it all go down the same path. For one thing, I did think it was just a story about the "The Hibiscus, the Winter," story. It just turns into Hibiscus again after a certain point or an extra step of time and maybe the character is reborn again. But then, I was hoping Manafort would tell Hibiscus more about some of what he knows about the history. No big deal that he couldn't tell or that he can just find some new way to tell Hibiscus story. But that was going towards this chapter.

I guess a lot of what I read at the beginning was "You guys just said some interesting stuff about those events because we've heard and heard they happened so far. Now, what's important to me, I think, as I get farther away from the subject, is that you'll read the story. I wish you all the best, and I love when someone I like to call "the Hibiscus," starts working on it!"

I'm not sure if the book is on the up and up right now after they say "The Hibiscus," or if it is
