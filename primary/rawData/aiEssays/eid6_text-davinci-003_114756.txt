The Empire State Building, a renowned icon of New York City, was once seen as a beacon of progress and innovation due to its height and architectural design. A major milestone of the building's completion was the construction of a mooring mast, allowing dirigibles - or airships - to dock and rest atop the Empire State Building. Achieving this goal, however, wasn't as simple as one would imagine. Many different challenges and obstacles stood in the way of the successful completion of this project.

When the Empire State Building was under construction, many were intrigued by the idea of dirigibles being able to land atop such a tall skyscraper. To build the mast, an 82 foot tall aluminum structure would have to be added to the top of the building, functioning as a reachable ‘runway’ for the airships. This runway also had to be engineered to be wind-resistant, as the winds at such a high altitude reached up to 50 mph. This engineering challenge posed a difficult problem, as it needed to be done in compliance with building regulations.

In addition to the engineering challenges, there were also serious financial concerns that needed to be taken into account. Constructing the mast cost an estimated $1 million, which was a significant amount of money during the time. There was also the question of whether or not the revenue the dirigible industry could bring in would be enough to cover the initial cost of the mooring mast.
