At the end of Winter Hibiscus, the protagonist, Hua, is reflecting on a difficult math test that she took as a child. But more importantly, she reflects on the idea that she has been able to persevere and achieve more in life than what she thought was possible when she failed that test so long ago. By associating her potential success with the winter hibiscus blooming in spring, she is reminding herself that she can do anything if she just keeps striving and believing in herself. The ending sentence emphasizes this message of hope and optimism, that she will keep working hard and try the test again when spring and new growth come, as a reminder that anything is possible.
