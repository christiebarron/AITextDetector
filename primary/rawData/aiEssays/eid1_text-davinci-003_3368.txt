Dear Local Newspaper,

I am writing to voice my opinion on the effects computers have on people. In the world of today, computers have become an integral part of everyday life and have had both positive and negative impacts.

On the one hand, the use of computers helps people work more efficiently and accurately by providing the tools that allow us to easily process and store vast amounts of information. In the workplace, efficient computing has also made it possible for people to perform tasks quicker and with greater accuracy, thus providing them with more competitive advantages over their competitors.

However, on the other hand, the use of computers has also had a negative impact on people. With the advent of the internet, people have become more dependent on technology and less reliant on their minds, leading to inefficiency in problem-solving skills and over-reliance on machines for completing tasks. This causes people to become less creative and innovative, which can have a serious impact on a person's productivity in the long run.

In conclusion, it is clear that the use of computers has both positive and negative effects. Although it has certainly simplified the complex and tedious processes of research and calculation, we must not forget the need to exercise common sense
