I tend to have a very short fuse, so when I'm in a crowded grocery store, my patience is typically tested. The other day, I was in the checkout line at my local grocery store on a very busy day. I was watching the cashier slowly and carefully scanning each item, making sure she had checked each item off of the lengthy list the customer before me had.

The customer was obviously in a hurry, as I could tell from the way he was tapping his foot impatiently and tapping his fingers against the countertop. Despite his obvious signs of frustration, he kept his cool and remained quiet.

His patience never wavered, even when the cashier politely asked him to give her a few seconds to go back to the shelf to grab another item she had missed. He simply waited quietly and with a pleasant smile that put me more at ease than I was already feeling.

When the cashier finished, he thanked her politely and left the store. Seeing this display of patience made me realize just how much of an art it truly is. It reminded me of the importance of remaining calm, even in the most seemingly difficult of situations.
