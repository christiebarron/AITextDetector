The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because its character is a person of the very definition that makes up our story, and this fact was very important to me. We've never talked about who we are as friends, who we are as people, how we make this relationship happen. We all know that's not what this story is about. I don't think it's about how we deal with how we're both human. The way I approached the book, if I had one question for you, it was, this is a book about what was going to happen after we're both dead? I'd think what we had are real, genuine, real, real things. It was about the way in which our relationship is different with each other, even if we don't see each other as friends. We don't see each other as strangers, really. We see each other as, here, our only friends. It was just kind of like, is it possible that these things don't work or is there a certain level of unpredictability, that these things can happen in different circumstances and then we can just sit down and talk about what happened and maybe get together.
