The mood created in the memoir From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez is one of nostalgia and contentment. The memoir captures the essence of life on the threshold between childhood and young adulthood, as the author nostalgically recalls memories spent growing up surrounded by the loving embrace of his close-knit and hardworking family.

Rodriguez’s immense sense of warmth and appreciation for his childhood springs from every page of the memoir. As he vividly recalls family dinners, lively conversations, and yearly traditions, a soft and gentle longing is palpable. He writes of his mother’s exasperation when his father used long-unheard words, of the New Jersey shoreline, of the stars of ancient Hollywood films, and of his own shyness and self-doubt. Rodriguez's account of his childhood simultaneously paints a picture of the tight bonds of family, the importance of hard work, and the power of finding beauty in everyday moments. 

It is through this account of growing up, both its joys and its hardships, that Rodriguez instills in readers a feeling of contentment. By transporting readers to his own experiences, he encourages an acceptance of the struggles and successes of life. The memoir creates an atmosphere of acceptance in which its readers can find solace in the knowledge that even in the most difficult of times, we are protected by those closest to us, and by the memories we create along the way.
