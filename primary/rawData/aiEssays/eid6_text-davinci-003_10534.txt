The Empire State Building represented a great feat in human engineering when it was built, not only for its size but for also for its features that were innovative for the time in which it was built. One of its most notable features was a 200ft dock, specifically designed for dirigibles to dock and moor. Although the idea of having dirigibles dock was romantic and eventually heavily successful, the builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles in allowing the airships to dock with the building.

The main obstacle the builders faced was how to moor dirigibles without obstructing the view from the observation deck, as it was meant to be the feature of the observation deck - to be able to see the city from a great height. To ensure a dock of the highest engineering, it was especially necessary to make sure that the dirigibles could land without obscuring the view in any way. Consequently, the builders had to design a mooring mast that was strong and secure enough to allow the dirigible to dock safely while maintaining the beautiful skyline of the city beneath.

In order to ensure a safe and secure mooring, the architects of the time had to produce the strongest mast possible, to facilitate a smooth docking without the mast collapsing or any damage to the dirigible or the building structure. To do this, the architects designed a mast that was more than 200 feet tall, to act as a bridge of sorts between the mast itself and the observation
