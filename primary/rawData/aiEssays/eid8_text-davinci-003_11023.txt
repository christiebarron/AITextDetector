I was at the park the other day with my best friend when we saw an old man wearing an interesting hat. We couldn't help but stare, which made the man laugh. He went on to explain that the hat was from a wedding in his hometown in India years ago. I was amazed that he had held onto this memento for so long.

Suddenly, we heard a loud splashing noise. Looking around, we saw two of the geese in the park making a huge splash in the pond. We both started to laugh hysterically at the sight, and soon the old man joined in with a hearty chuckle.

The laughter was infectious and the mood in the park became so much lighter and brighter. We were all smiling and laughing so hard that it even caused the geese to back off out of the water.

We thanked the man for his story and waved goodbye as we left. But walking away, I couldn't help but feel that laughter was indeed the shortest distance between two people, as it had just connected the three of us in a moment of joy and unity.
