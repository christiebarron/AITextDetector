N. G. Fung: No.

S. A. Paz: Okay, so we have been hearing about it for a really long time. I mean, you've heard lots and lots and lots of references about the microbiome but at the same time something tells me we should never, ever do that with people whose intestinal microbiomes are at the highest possible risk. So, to be able to work here today with someone who had a microbiome of the same strain I can't begin to imagine how that would feel. You wouldn't have seen a problem the other day with any of your patients. They'd get sick at any point, they'd be out of the office, they'd have a diagnosis of Crohn's disease, you could see them the good while they're still sick. And I mean, there are people in my clinical training who are just trying to get
