The Empire State Building was created as the world’s tallest skyscraper at the time, but also featured an innovative, but large hurdle not seen before in a building. That hurdle was the intended use of allowing dirigibles to dock at the building’s mast. Although it was a revolutionary idea, its execution took much thought, ingenuity, and effort by the builders of the Empire State Building to accommodate the docking of dirigibles.

One of the first major obstacles the builders faced was finding a way to build a platform strong enough to support the weight of the docking dirigibles. With the unique way these airships landed, higher forces were applied to the mast and platform than they were accustomed to designing for. To do this, the Empire State Building's mast was engineered to be taller and stronger than any other skyscraper mast of its size. The mast was also made slim enough so that it was less of an obstruction to dirigibles in the air.

The other major obstacle builders faced was creating a landing structure for the airship. They had to use materials that were light, but still strong and able to withstand the forces of a landing dirigible. The designers came up with the idea of a series of vertical cables linked to the mast, which then attached to the platform of the airship. This created a suspension system that would keep the landing platform and the mast secured. The platform was also designed in an accordion-like style so
