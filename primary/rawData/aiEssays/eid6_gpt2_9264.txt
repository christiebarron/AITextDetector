The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

While the first commercial launch of a dirigible into orbit in 1953 was for the Air Force – which would then purchase three and a half dirigibles from Lockheed – the last of the U.S. military's planned dirigibles – the C-39, was built in the 1950s by the Army. Unlike the C-47 and C-39A, which had been sold to Royal Norwegian Space, the C-39A proved successful, scoring a US$6 million, 10-day launch in 1962 from its California research facility. In the wake of the flight, it became the first commercial dirigible from an Air Force facility in that part of the world to climb into Earth orbit. And when the Air Force built the C-39A in 1953, it was not simply any dirigible, but a military vehicle, able to transport two American astronauts to Mars that year.

As NSF Secretary-Designated Manager Ed Bienkmaer says in an email on March 30, "NSF had a great chance to provide a huge amount of funding for the C-39A." Then, in mid-2002, the National Science Foundation (NSF)'s Bureau of Advanced Research (BAR) funded the
