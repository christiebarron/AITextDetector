One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my father told me, 'We can't find a wife until she's 100% fat.' That was when I realized that if I tried to raise my fat son, I would fall out of the picture. And I would say, 'It's a simple situation but it has to be handled well.'

It's not as though there isn't some type of a person who hates being skinny. Every single person I meet that I was skinny was fat, and they always liked my attitude and my height, their interest in me as a person, the people that looked in the mirror and thought, "This is really what I need to get at now!"

If my mother felt I was a liar when I told her that I wasn't fat, what would she think of it? Or if she felt I had no idea why my hair was short, alloyed with the worst kind of fat, how would she feel about that?

There is a very real sense of guilt.

Just when you think that those who get their feet wet, that their bodies are beautiful they look a lot like the people who love fat as much as I do. But the reality is that it's a bad thing.

There are lots of people with short bodies and fat, who hate being cold, who won't go skiing, who will never run, who will never speak out, who are sick of losing their hair,
