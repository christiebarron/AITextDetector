The Empire State Building may be one of the most iconic symbols of America, but this iconic symbol wasn’t just conjured out of thin air. It took years of designing and construction to make it the architectural marvel that it is, and a part of the building’s original design was to allow for dirigibles to dock at the very top of the tower. However, the obstacles that the designers and builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock were immense.

Perhaps the first obstacle that the designers of the Empire State Building had to overcome was ensuring the structural support for the mooring mast. This mast would have to be incredibly detailed and structural sound, strong enough to hold the immense weight of a dirigible, yet nimble enough to move and keep in its place as gusts of wind pushed against it. Since the amount of pressure dirigibles can put on towers is greater than a regular aircraft, finding a way to build a mooring mast that was strong but flexible enough to accommodate the forces of such a craft was a major problem that had to be addressed.

In addition to finding a way to support such a structure, the designers of the Empire State Building had to contend with the issue of constructing the mast itself in such a way that it would be able to support the airship. To ensure the strength of the structure, the materials used had to meet the most stringent requirements. Steel pipes, sheets of
