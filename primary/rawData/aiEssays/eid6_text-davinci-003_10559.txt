The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges when constructing the building to accommodate dirigible docking. One of the primary issues was the structural integrity of the mast, in order for the mast to be able to withstand the wind forces produced by docking a large airship such as a dirigible. The designers had to come up with a safe and reliable mooring system.

The first obstacle was the size of the mast itself. The Empire State Building was constructed at a height of 1,250 feet and the mast must be of an equal height in order to support the weight and size of a dirigible. As a result, the mooring mast had to be a larger structure with strong materials. It was designed with steel I-beams and a base of cross-braced trusses for extra support.

The second obstacle was the mechanisms needed to make sure that the airship was safely secured to the mast when it was being moored. The mooring mast had to be designed to include a number of specialized equipment for attaching the mooring lines from an airship and securing it firmly in place. This included a single lock pneumatic vice, which was used to quickly attach the rope from the airship to the mast and a detachable collar clip. Other items such as a slipping collar and safety bar held the airship securely in place until its mooring lines were secured by hand.

Finally, additional safety measures needed
