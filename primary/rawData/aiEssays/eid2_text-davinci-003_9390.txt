The public library is an important resource that is available to all members of the community. Not only are books, magazines, movies, and music available for checkout, but this vital service also provides access to resources and the tools for life-long learning. As such, censorship can take away these vital services and resources, and is counterintuitive to the purpose of a library.

Censorship of any kind is a form of suppression of the public’s access to knowledge, information, and opportunities for learning. Especially in libraries, a setting that should be free from prejudice and bias, censoring materials harms readers who are deprived of important viewpoints. Limiting access to materials can take away an individual’s freedom express themselves and to open their minds to different opinions. 

Moreover, censorship in libraries can create a space of illogical idealisms. It implies that ideas and materials that are deemed controversial should be hidden away rather than be discussed, explained, and understood. Where is the line to be drawn between what is and is not offensive? Who decides what is acceptable in the library? How can any level of censorship exist without judgement and prejudice? 

The freedom to access a variety of viewpoints is the basis of learning and understanding. Even if some materials and ideas are found offensive, it should not be grounds for censorship. Not only does it deprive the public of the access to information, it would be utilized by those with the power to further their own agenda
