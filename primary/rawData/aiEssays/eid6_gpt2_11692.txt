And while they also had to contend with a growing military of Soviet military aircraft, their military, which made up the bulk of Russia's fleet, was much smaller than those enjoyed by the United States.

The Soviets had been able, for the past few decades, to build their first military planes, with planes that were both capable of penetrating conventional air defenses and more lethal than most airmen on the planet. The New York Empire State Building had, just as it had in the States, also created its own military bases with space-based bases.
