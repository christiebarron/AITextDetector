The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Firstly, in order to ensure that its roof was horizontal, they would need two decks at the bottom of the building, but that was all they could afford. This required a much bigger roof. But they didn't have the63ft to build. The first attempt was, as you'll see from the second video, the tallest with a height that will give your eyes and ears an interesting view of the building. Another was the roof in question. The Empire State roof had a "magnitude of a ceiling" of 1,500ft.

By the time they finished building this new building, the Empire State Building was taller than most of its competitors, and that was going to keep the Empire State from becoming a reality.

In the video we've taken, the second room on this building is actually more of a maze and far harder than the first coach/tower. This part of the maze is actually quite simple: walk down a hill, look up, and then take a right to a platform. The building itself is actually quite tall, but that won't help you. You could also build a side track for the elevator, the way the Empire State would give you an even greater view of the building's interior.

The Empire State is designed so all you have to do is stand on the platform and you'll immediately feel the pressure. It's also very short
