I recently had to go on a road trip with my family, and it was a long journey. In spite of the fact that everyone was tired and looking forward to getting to our destination, my parents still insisted that we take our time and enjoy the drive. 

This meant making regular stops to stretch our legs or to get something to eat. At times, it felt like these breaks were random or unnecessary, and I found myself getting impatient. But my parents were always calm and patient despite my complaints. 

They reminded me to be grateful for the opportunity to go on a road trip and to enjoy it rather than dwelling on how long it was taking. This simple reminder put everything into perspective, and I soon joined in with the spirit of exploration. 

By the end of the journey, I was amazed at how much we had seen and how far we had traveled. Looking back, I'm so glad that my parents were patient with me. They gave me an experience that I will never forget.
