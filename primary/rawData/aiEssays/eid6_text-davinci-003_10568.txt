The Empire State Building was an ambitious project of the early 20th century. The idea of allowing dirigibles—or airships—to dock at the crown of the building was a novel way to draw attention to the already monumental achievement. However, the builders soon found themselves facing a number of obstacles in making this dream a reality.

The first obstacle the builders encountered was obtaining the necessary permits from the City of New York. This was a complex process that involved obtaining approval from the city Department of Transportation, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the police, among other authorities. As the original proposition suggested that the dirigible dock would be situated above an existing street—the 34th Street and 5th Avenue intersection—which involved an additional layer of red tape unique to such a situation.

The second and most prominent obstacle was the feasibility of actually constructing a structure that could capably sustain the weight and pressure of a mooring mast and the airships that would dock to it. In response, the builders designed and built a mooring mast that had been reinforced with steel to guarantee its stability. This mast was then designed to be both tall enough that the airship could easily attach to it and strong enough to securely hold the weight and pressure of the airship during docking.

Thirdly, the builders had to take into consideration unique safety procedures that would need to be enacted in order to protect the building and its inhabitants. Special fire department rescue equipment, strict airborne
