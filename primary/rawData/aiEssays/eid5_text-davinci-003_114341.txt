Narciso Rodriguez’s memoir “From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives” is a deeply personal exploration of identity, family, and culture. Through his vivid and inviting language, Rodriguez paints a narrative that sees the reader entranced in his memories and emotions.

The memoir begins with Rodriguez connecting his immortal roots to his homeland of Miami. We see his exploration of his homeland shaped by the references to his family and their shared culture. This creates a feeling of nostalgia as he remembers the rhythmic beats of the car horns driving through the night and the scent of marinated chicken. This remembrance of his roots being intricately entwined with his home creates the mood of appreciation and reverie.

On his journey home, Rodriguez transports the reader to Mexico. Every detail — from the colonial architecture, to the fabric of his mother’s dress — draws a connection to his childhood. This creates a gentle and calming atmosphere. Although he reflects on difficult moments throughout his journey, the sentimental and nostalgic atmosphere curbs any feeling of sadness — Rodriguez recognizes the beauty of his people and the bittersweet experiences they share together.

Finally, we see in his memoir an appreciation for how these memories have shaped his identity. Rodriguez creates a poignantly uplifting tone to close the memoir, as he reflects on how he can draw strength from his culture and use it to empower his spirit, no matter how far away he may be.
