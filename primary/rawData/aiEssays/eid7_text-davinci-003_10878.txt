I recently had a situation where I had to demonstrate patience. I was waiting in line at the grocery store and the line was very long. I had been waiting for a while and was getting impatient as the line was not moving. However, I stayed in line and waited my turn, as I was aware that it was not the fault of the cashier or the person in front of me. I kept my cool and waited until it was my turn. 

When I finally got to the register, the cashier told me that she was having a hard time finding a price for one of the items I had purchased. She asked me to wait while she tracked it down. I could feel my patience waning as it began to take a bit longer than I expected. Several times I thought about leaving the line and coming back later, but I reminded myself to remain patient. 

After what seemed like an eternity, the cashier found the price and I was able to complete my purchase. Despite my feelings of impatience, I kept a cool head and waited until the issue was resolved. It felt great to know that I had successfully resisted my urge to get frustrated and remained patient throughout the ordeal.
