The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is something I've always loved. "I know it. I love it. I'm not sure what to say or feelâ€”I can do better than doing things that are so wrong or so good. But in the words of my father, 'it's easy for me to look away, to see everything that is wrong with my life, and that I have found.' The truth is no one can answer those things, but for me it is the only way I'm going to take care of myself and get back to being human and make things right."

When The Road to Broken Arrow aired on December 14, 2001, readers were given a chance to tell their inner-workings and inner dreams. Those are what the narrator told them in a self-published memoir, which was written by and from a woman who was living down in L.A. who also died of AIDS. The Road to Broken Arrow, which is due out in theaters on July 16, will consist of short stories from the book, each of which will cover some level of the book or a certain topic. The Road to Broken Arrow is being distributed in 20 languages on January 1st, with an English version on summer 19th.

'From Home Is Spartacus' is available now on Warner Bros. Television.
