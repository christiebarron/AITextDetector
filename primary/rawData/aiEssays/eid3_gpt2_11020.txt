Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. But this is what the study found.

Rising rates of injuries were noted in some of those areas like the Loughborough and London boroughs when cyclists had a bicycle or if they had the keys to their car (all within 2.5km) as their most recent bike ride, just behind school.

People with more than one car in their lives have reduced the risk of an accident. This can result, in more people staying on their bicycles and more on their journeys - including in rural areas, where cycling is a popular form of cycling - than people who use bicycles to commute. As a result, 'roughroad', or an alternative route to the city centre, leads the way to the top of the list of road risks for cyclists. It also places cyclists closer to pedestrians, with higher rates of cycling per kilometre of high road. While those that live in areas where cyclists have a bicycle should be encouraged to ride it, they should also be advised to stay on bikes for at least four more months if they take a high-risk or time-consuming journey. This means that only those who have had a high-risk or time-consuming ride should be allowed to ride the route.

It could be that those who live on low-risk roads, but want to keep riding, have the key.
