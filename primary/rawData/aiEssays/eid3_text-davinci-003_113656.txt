In Joe Kurmaski’s short story “Rough Road Ahead”, setting plays a key role in developing the story’s themes and ideas. The protagonist is a cyclist who has chosen to ride through a barren, rugged, and ultimately humbling landscape. This setting serves as a symbol for the hardships the cyclist is navigating through personal and interpersonal relationships, as he struggles to move forward.

The cyclist is set up as a lone figure, riding through the wild and unknown in search of something greater. This setting evokes feelings of isolation and the unknown, as the cyclist’s perspective is limited to the world he is traveling through. He is forced to confront the harshness of his environment and the uncertainty of what lies ahead.

The cyclist’s internal transformation is reflected in the harsh landscape he is traveling through. The vast, seemingly never-ending expanse of rolling hills and dirt roads symbolizes the difficulty of his journey and his need to confront himself. He is forced to question his choices and confront his own demons, and as the road gets tougher and the environment more punishing, so too does his internal conflict.

The cyclist’s setting thus reflects his internal struggle, and his journey serves as a metaphor for life’s difficult moments. The unpredictable environment keeps him on the edge of his seat, and as he confronts each challenge the reader can’t help but wonder what will come of his journey.
