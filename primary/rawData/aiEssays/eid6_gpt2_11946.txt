The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

The second obstacle was to keep all the occupants of the former building at an even lower house, without using any of the buildings.

The result was a building with a very poor ratio of occupants, making it hard to meet the requirements of public building projects.

The architects were forced to build "a world without buildings for private people", an approach most critics of building had come to think of as utopian. They saw that the building "could not be improved as a public good".
