Censorship in libraries has long been a heated debate. Proponents of censorship claim that there must exist limitations on what is available in libraries in order to protect the values of society. In contrast, the argument against censorship holds that restrictions limit access to knowledge and information. From my point of view, I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, should not be removed from library shelves solely on the grounds that they are offensive.

First, libraries have an obligation to their patrons to provide access to a range of materials. By imposing restrictions on what library patrons can access, society is silencing an important, though uncomfortable, means of communication and learning. Libraries serve the general public and therefore offer materials from varying political and cultural perspectives. To restrict access to certain sources is to deny patrons the opportunity to explore and consider alternate views. This undermines the purpose of a library, which is to serve as a provider of knowledge and serve the interests of its patrons.

Second, censoring certain materials runs the risk of eroding the freedom of speech, freedom of thought, and freedom of expression. Patrons should have the right to choose for themselves what materials they would like to read, hear, watch, and learn from. This freedom allows individuals to further their education, as well as to challenge and expand upon their understanding of the world and its current events. Removing offensive materials would do nothing more than limit the possibilities available for self-exploration
