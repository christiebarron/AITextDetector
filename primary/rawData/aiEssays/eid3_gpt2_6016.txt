Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

Rise of the Storm has a particular flavour, which the cyclist will definitely be familiar with and is highlighted by the strong-to-earth look of the new track.

The theme of 'Rough Road Ahead' is 'Climbing the Storm', something which I will explore in this section at length.

You can find the full set of Cycling's "Rough Road Ahead" guide (PDF) here.

I'll also explore the themes mentioned in 'Rough Road Ahead' and some examples of new tricks in my new guide, 'Rough Road Ahead 1'.

I've also included pictures of two of my upcoming set of tips to set a 'good time' with your bike for todayupload and you can pre-order my online book Bike & Motorcycle Training in Brighton.
