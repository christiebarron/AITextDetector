The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In 1804, however, the builder George Mason decided to build it on public land in New York, and after a trial and error period, he built the first dirigibles for three of the city's six major attractions, including the State Park and the Jackson Capitol. When they built the first dirigibles on public property three months later, they were forced to cancel the three other dirigibles.

The first dirigibles were built by John and Ann Easley, makers of a commercial tractor used by the New York Railroad Co. and the New York Railway Commission. The first dirigibles were installed by James W. Whelan, who later purchased the property and built the first dirigibles for American Airlines. The second dirigibles were by Frederick M. Smith and John W. Clark, owners of the United Methodist church in Baltimore. At first the dirigibles were not an option because they did not meet the federal government's requirements for a commercial tractor. Eventually, those required more than 400 feet of space that the government had already prepared by cutting the lumber to meet the U.S. Department of the Interior's regulations. After more than a decade, the government eventually approved the new tractor, so many dirigibles were built all over the United States.

Another obstacle was the requirement that American Airlines' cargo hold hold at the Columbia Station was located outside
