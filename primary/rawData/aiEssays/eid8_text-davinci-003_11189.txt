I remember the first time I ever told my best friend a joke. We had just hung out for a few hours and we were walking home, both of us in a silly mood. So, I decided to take a chance and try to make her laugh. I told her the oldest joke I know, and I watched as her face lit up in recognition at the punch line. Then, she burst out laughing, to the point where she was bent over and couldn't catch her breath. I couldn't help but join her, even though I'd heard the joke countless times before. 

Since then, laughter has played a huge role in our friendship. Whenever we hang out, one of us is always telling the other a funny story or making jokes at each other's expense. Even when we have a serious conversation, the tension can always be cut with a laugh. That's how I know we'll last forever - just look at the way we make each other laugh.
