In Joe Kurmaski's 'Rough Road Ahead,' the features of the setting create a unique challenge for the cyclist. Described as a hilly terrain, the cycling route is physically draining and mentally fatiguing for the protagonist. From the very beginning of the story, we can see the cyclist struggling to make it up some pretty daunting hills. The presence of these hills frequently throws the cyclist off balance, requiring them to expend a great deal of energy and focus to stay upright.

The hills are not the only challenging aspects of this particular route. In addition to the numerous hills, the cyclist must also navigate numerous other obstacles. The presence of bumps and other unexpected protrusions force the cyclist to be continuously vigilant in order to avoid potential danger. Similarly, the presence of slippery surfaces such as mud and wet leaves, as well as sharp rocks, also requires the cyclist to remain focused and agile in order to safely avoid them.

The harsh environment that the cyclist finds themselves in makes it difficult for them to remain undefeated through the entire route. Even when they make it to the top of a hill, the prospect of another hill, mud, wet leaves, sharp rocks, or bumps make the cyclist feel anxious and fearful that they may not make it. This provides an interesting tension in the story, as the cyclist must constantly push themselves in order to complete the route. Overall, Kurmaski's utilization of these features of the setting allows him to create an impactful story
