The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Among them being the number of workers at the time and the fact that they had to build more than half the building at once.

When the Empire State Building opened, it housed over 11,700 people, who were forced to find work. The building's original plan had five floors, each containing 25,000 employees. It was planned to become the tallest building ever constructed. On April 22, 1937, the Empire State Plaza, located across the street from the Federal Building, suffered a huge storm, which crushed the roof of the structure, leaving behind the building's concrete-carpet-clad exterior.

The Empire State Building also suffered massive flooding in the 1920s; flooding that began when one of the Empire State Rides could no longer navigate its way through the storm, and continued into the winter during the Great Depression. In 1930, the Empire State Convention Centre was built, providing space for a private dining area. The Empire State Hotel, located on the second floor that had been abandoned before the disaster at the end of World War II—named "The Ritz's Landing" in honor of the first Empire State hotel—was built by the World War II Army Air Corps, and opened in 1955. (Although only the first floor of the Empire State Hotel has been fully rebuilt, the current one is one of the most recognizable features of the building.)
