Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. Some aspects have been explored below, but you may want to read our more in-depth review of the 'Rough Road Ahead' setting.

Each street you turn around in (not exactly a regular road, but a roundabout) involves a couple of other areas and areas from other streets. These areas may, like traffic flow and pavement appearance, be controlled in order to give a sense of distance to cyclists, thereby bringing street life to a different level of sophistication. All in all, it may not be the best choice for making the most of those available, but it still represents a safe street from start to finish. In a way, the 'Road Ahead' setting is the best example of a road set to reduce traffic flow due to the way in which it operates.

You'll see many ways to reduce traffic flow in the below video, including one of the features shown above, so it's recommended to have a look at those that seem to help to solve situations here.
