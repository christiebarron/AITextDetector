Dear Editor, 

As more technology advances, many people have begun to rely on computers for most daily tasks. Everyoneâ€™s daily lives have become dependent on these tools, from school to work. But we must consider what kind of effect this dependence has on us.

The use of computers has come with many advantages. They help to increase efficiency, facilitate communication, and even help improve work and school performance. Due to their fast processing speeds, complex tasks can be performed in a fraction of the time that it would take humans to complete them. The increased access to information that computers have provided has been instrumental in advancing our knowledge.

Unfortunately, however, computers have also had a few adverse effects on us. With the increased reliance on computers, people have begun to develop less self-reliance and problem-solving skills. A person might be less inclined to solve a problem by trial and error, instead searching for a quick answer online. This could cause a person to be less creative and challenge their problem-solving skills.

In my opinion, computers can be valued tools, but we should use them with caution. We should use them to supplement, not replace our own brainpower. Too much reliance on computers can be harmful as it can result in adverse effects such as a decrease in creativity and self-reliance.

Thank you for your time. 

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
