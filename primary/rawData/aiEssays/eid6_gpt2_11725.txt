The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First was a lack of space for a camera to work without damaging the building, and the roof that connected to the space was very thin to the sides.

Many of the buildings, such as Washington DC's Lincoln Center and the Lincoln Memorial, had been constructed in the 1950s. The need for a crane to operate most buildings in the Empire State Building was also present. It was not a difficult task, but the amount of time required to take the new roof off the building in a single day, and to make some room up from the lower third of the building for a special prop room built by the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, would have made a huge difference.

In its place was a huge and heavily built mangrove-filled building with a number one, six, and five star churches. The Church of Notre Dame had been built in 1883 and had
