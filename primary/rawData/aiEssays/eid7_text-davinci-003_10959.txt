I remember a time when I had to be very patient. A few weeks ago, I was on vacation with my family. We had gone to a beach holiday and the weather was hot and muggy. We were all so excited to spend some quality time together. 

Unfortunately, after an hour or so at the beach, it started to pour rain. We were all stuck in a nearby caf√©, waiting for the rain to stop. It seemed to take forever and everyone was getting pretty restless. 

I was determined to keep my cool though, so I stayed as patient and laid-back as possible. I kept everyone entertained with games and jokes while we waited out the rain storm. Eventually, the rain stopped and we were able to go back to the beach and had a great time. 

This experience taught me that being patient is not always easy but with practice and self-control, it can pay off in the end.
