One time I experienced laughter in my life was when we had the whole world watching our movies. We would see a bunch of kids, but we would also see a kid in a t-shirt with the lines "F*** you, it's OK", and he would say "Donkey Kong, he's laughing at you". We were all looking to give something back. We got lucky, it was a big thing to have." A friend is the same. "I know she's joking, but she's serious," says Ms Cooper.

The love interests who grew up together are still on the same page. "I'm like 'Oh my God, she could be my daughter!' I'm like, 'I can't believe she's still married', because I've been around her and that's a long time," says Mr Chaney.

Ms Cooper and Jack White have also met in the UK and Australia, where they worked on the BBC's The World According to Jackie, in addition to playing the same role in the ITV films as The Blacklist film.

The BBC has now set up a group called Bluegrass Music Video, to bring together the musical talent involved to create a new kind of music. This is expected to be the first big collaboration from the four of them, and one of the biggest collaborations for the present.
