I recently had one of my best friends over for dinner. We were catching up on everything that had been going on in our lives - work, relationships, friends, family, and other various topics. 

Halfway through dinner, we stumbled across an old memory we shared of us getting into a fit of uncontrollable laughter while out for dinner one time at an Italian restaurant. We couldn't help but crack up again at the memory. We laughed so hard that tears started to stream down our faces. 

The waitress must have noticed us having such a great time, because she came over to our table and asked us what was so funny. We tried our best to explain it to her but couldn't help but laugh at our explanation. She was so confused and amused by us that soon she was joining in our laughter. 

The moment was so liberating, and it was the perfect way to cap off the evening. We all said our goodbyes, and we left with huge grins on our faces. 

Laughter truly is the best medicine, and it was a reminder of just how great of a friendship we have.
