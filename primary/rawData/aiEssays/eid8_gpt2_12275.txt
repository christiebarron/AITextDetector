One time I experienced laughter in my life was when a dog got into an argument with his friend and went outside and looked around; then a piece of wood got stuck in his mouth.

The owner of the dog in question didn't react with laughter, said the dog's owner.

But how do dogs react when they're confronted in a fight? What they fear can be scary?

"So if you have that reaction in your home – as a dog – you are saying, 'I am not a fighter but a mother,'" said Ms. Smith.

As with any fight, a dog should tell the right things to their owner, she said.

"Why wouldn't you do that if this was happening?" she asked.

So, what kind of a dog can be trusted?

The International Paws Alliance said dogs are a valuable public safety asset.

"They are a good trainer that dogs can learn to respect and trust – they will know when to hold them down and stop what's happening," said the coalition's spokeswoman.

But, there are only so many dogs, said Ms. Smith.

"You're talking about a puppy with 30 weeks of growth. But if that's what you want to do – if you think he's ready to have that dog, then you are talking about him giving up his job because he's scared of you and doesn't want his kids, he gets into that fight
