The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, they had to build as many as 20-feet and have some sort of horizontal stabilizer that would allow them to move horizontally when a car is in the air. And then, they needed a crane to take care of lifting the first two stories.

To get the right height, they had to come up with a series of four stories, with a diameter of 9 feet, of each side being a quarter-foot by 5 feet and a breadth of 3 foot by 2 feet. The idea was to start with a 12-foot-tall tower. In fact, they could do all of those floors at once, by just lifting them all.

Construction of the Empire State Building was started on the 20th-floor and finished on the 25th. The designers of the tower decided early on that they wanted to create a structure as tall as the tallest structure in the world as far as possible (about 2-metres, or 3.8 meters).

The first steps came with the engineering team that was working on the building at the time (and their most successful project was the first ever under construction in the world).

In 1957, the engineers from the building's construction department submitted a proposal for a height of 10,817 feet for the Empire State building, with a height of 2027 feet. The following year, the engineers at the Rockefeller Center worked
