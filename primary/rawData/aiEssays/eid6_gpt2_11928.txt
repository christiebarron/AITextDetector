The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. With the rise of technology, they saw the need for more "dramatic" devices to reduce travel times by a factor of ten, even if it meant moving away from the real estate development or out into space.

On the other hand, the Empire State Building's only "dramatic" way around the situation was to dock with the Empire State Building's private cargo ship, The Rickshaw. Although it was built and operated by the State of Florida (or its subsidiaries), The Rickshaw was much more maneuverable than its predecessor and was able to dock at any time with a single tug.

The Rickshaw also had a couple other advantages over the Titanic. First, it was still the same building that occupied the main ship that carried all of the state building industry. Second, when the Rickshaw lost contact with the Titanic it was able to dock up and go to sea in about 12 hours. Third, the Rickshaw could stay in port for long periods of time without being forced to dock.

All of these advantages are important to understand from the perspective of the Titanic and many other state-owned and federally run ships that would have been required to dock in the first place.

When considering possible dock options, consider what advantages they provide to the community and what is the greatest risk to the preservation of the building's history. This is
