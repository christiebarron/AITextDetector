I recently saw an example of someone being very patient. I was walking through the park when I saw an elderly gentleman taking a stroll. He seemed to be going very slow, but what caught my eye was how patient he was with another elderly woman who was walking with him. He was very gentle and kind, helping her navigate the path and stopping to help her when she needed it. It didn't matter how long it took them - he was patient and kind the entire way. It really made me appreciate how much patience he had, even in a situation that was challenging for him. I admired his patience and it made me reflect on how I could be more patient in my own life.
