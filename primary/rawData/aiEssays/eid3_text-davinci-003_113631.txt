In Joe Kurmaski’s ‘Rough Road Ahead’, the cyclist experiences the physical, mental, and emotional challenges of a difficult setting. The cycler must navigate a steep and winding road with rocks, crevasses, and gravel. The treacherous terrain forces the cyclist to struggle with unstable footing, as well as uneven and unpredictable paths. Thes challenge is further compounded by the peak of the mountain, where the altitude and thin air can exhaust the cyclist quickly, while also intensifying the physical difficulty of the task. 

In addition to the physical barriers of the terrain, the cyclist must also contend with the psychological challenges of the setting. The difficult conditions create a sense of fear and anxiety that constantly weighs on the cyclist’s psyche. With every new obstacle, the cyclist must summon the courage to take the next step, all while uncertain of what dangers may be lurking around the corner. 

The emotional gravity of the setting can be an even greater barrier than the physical one. Even after the cyclist has overcome the physical and mental arduousness of the task, they must still deal with the emotional burden of the journey. The dangers of the rough roads force the cyclist to confront their own limitations and fears. Overcoming these obstacles can be a rewarding experience, however, as the cyclist learns how much potential they are capable of unlocking within themselves.
