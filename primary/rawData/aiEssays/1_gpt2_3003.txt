Computers have many effects on people. An old study found that people who were diagnosed with bipolar disorder reported a similar decrease in blood sugar.

The latest research suggests that those people with bipolar and bipolar I disorder often have very sensitive nerves, which can cause severe depression and anxiety. There is also much debate over whether or not it's just a sign of a higher level of neurodiversity or some of the issues with it.

The research from the University of Melbourne's Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Sciences looks at the effects of certain personality traits and their associations within a person with bipolar and bipolar I disorder. The two disorders are associated collectively as Type 1 and Type 2 Disorder (DSM)--II, which have been linked to some serious brain changes.

Dr Leveque was one of the first to discover that bipolar disorder is associated with elevated levels of dopamine activity in the collegial prefrontal cortex (PFC) of patients with bipolar and bipolar and bipolar II.

Using the same approach, she and her team analysed whether there was an increase in dopamine levels within people without bipolar disorder.

They found that if people had a history of any kind of psychosis, there was a 50 per cent higher risk of symptoms of bipolar I, with the highest risk being a severe form
