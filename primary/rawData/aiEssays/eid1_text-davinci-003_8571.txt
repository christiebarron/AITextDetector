I remember the time I was at the supermarket waiting in line to pay for my groceries. There was a woman in front of me who was having trouble with her debit card. She seemed to be quite frustrated as every attempt to swipe her card was denied. I could tell the cashier was trying to stay as patient and understanding as possible, but after several minutes of fruitless attempts, I could sense his impatience.

However, I stayed calm and understanding. I encouraged the woman to keep trying and was patient as she took her time. Eventually, her card worked and she was able to pay for her groceries. I could see the relief and appreciation in her face after it was done. In that moment, I felt proud of myself for remaining patient and understanding in a difficult moment.
