One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I saw the face of someone on my computer. I said, "This is funny," and immediately it got a bit weird. I went back and watched it again three more times over the week afterwards; it was one or two new ones as well. I went back to the internet and read the comments, and all the commenters were extremely nice and pointed out my oddity.

And they are nice and evenhanded. For their own good.

I could not understand their idea of humor, especially when it comes to our species. While we're in the process of changing our minds, we're finding ourselves in situations like this â€” where there's nothing that the common sense might say can ever overcome these weirdness and the humor comes, or that just by doing what we've always done, we're able to escape the same way the rest of us did, or that just because there's something funny and funny and funny that we do better and faster through our life, it doesn't mean that it's all right.

There is a lot to say for this, which I will leave you to mull over for a bit. I don't want to argue here. This is just a good thing, and I hope to add a big one later. If you don't mind talking a bit on about some of these things below, you can send you a note, or you can tweet us @dartobearman
