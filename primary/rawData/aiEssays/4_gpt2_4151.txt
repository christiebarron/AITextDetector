The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it breaks the conventions and expectations of how a book deals with the emotions of those around us, the characters, or the world. The way Winter Hibiscus is presented does not only offer a new perspective on the world of fiction. It also offers an understanding of life and relationships that readers have in common with people with different backgrounds. Winter Hibiscus is well-written and it gives readers both an understanding of the world and how one feels about characters and their beliefs, and of the character world in general. The fact that it contains a book that deals with emotions rather than an article about them shows that the book is a strong book that has good content and good pacing.

This is a book that should be cherished.
