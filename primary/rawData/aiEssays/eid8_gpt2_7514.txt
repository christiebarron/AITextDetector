One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was about 19, and it didn't feel like it was something that was going to surprise me. It was something I was not going to be exposed to. I started going to college with my friends, and for a week, we were listening to the whole "Kooks" and hearing them say horrible things about "white people." Then one evening, something clicked. When we were in front of the television, I heard a little woman singing. She sounded excited and very sweet, and then it occurred to me... I didn't know what to do. I started to cry. My friend started to try to tell me how great it is to be able to say this. I took my hands and told her I was sorry for what had happened. She said, "Yes, yes, no, it's fine," she said, "But it was all really hard to remember." I was completely traumatized, because what I remember now, I can't imagine to what extent that meant. I'm still trying to think of what I saw was really happening."


I thought that the first time I talked to these women for a week, I probably got one in the morning, but it wasn't. Not that I would have done that with them at that time. We all felt the same way about this. But it was very important to be able to say things. We all kind of forgot how powerful that is.
