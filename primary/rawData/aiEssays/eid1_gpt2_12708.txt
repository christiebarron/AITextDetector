Computers have many effects on people. In fact, a study by Dr. Shams M. Shams, a professor emeritus at the Max Planck Institute for Physiological Physiology at the University of Hesse and part of the Hochberg Institute for Physical Measurement Research and Innovation in Germany, found that the brain has complex neural networks that, as a result of a lack of free energy, work better to drive the activities of individual people.

This neural network-to-muscle communication is called action memory. The mechanism by which this involves in action memory includes the way in which neurons send signals to neurons that are attached to the same neural networks on the same synapse. If the neurons are connected on the same synapse, there is a direct correlation between the voltage across the synapse and the current density of the two synapses. This connection is called the axon-to-calculator relationship. The more voltage across synapses the more information is stored in them. When the voltage across synapses is elevated (up to 300 microV), so much information is stored in synapses that they lose their stability on any given time when the voltage has risen. If the voltage drops further (up to 1,000 microV), the information inside synapses ceases to move. When the voltage is also raised (about 1% to 2,000 microV), neurons release more information, but that information can no longer reach their axon-to-cal
