The closing line acts as a call to action for the reader, implying that they should take the test again once they come across the hibiscus once spring has come again. It serves as a reminder about the importance of perseverance and putting in the extra effort to get the results one desires. Moreover, it is a call to continue striving even when the result seems distant and out of reach. By closing with this line, the poem speaks to the power of hope and resilience.
