The library is an essential part of any community; it is a place to seek knowledge and to connect with the written word. The library exists to provide access to materials that enrich individuals and expand their understanding, and the freedom to choose for oneself what topics to explore is part of the library mission. But with that freedom of choice comes an elephant in the room: censorship. 

Censorship in libraries is a complex and emotion-ridden topic, and the debate around what kind of censorship should be allowed is raging. Some argue that anything deemed offensive should be removed, while others believe that this takes away from the essential purpose of the library - to provide equitable access to information and resources.

On one hand, it is essential to protect library users from offensive and potentially harmful materials, especially if the materials could be accessed by anyone, particularly children. Removing certain materials that are deemed inappropriate or offensive can protect vulnerable populations and free them from inadvertently viewing content which could cause them harm. 

On the other hand, libraries give us the opportunity to freely explore and investigate topics and ideas that challenge the status quo. It is important to strike a balance between the protection of our communities and the right to education and access to knowledge, both important parts of our shared understanding of the world. By promoting an environment in which we can explore a variety of topics, including ones that may be considered controversial, libraries encourage conversations and foster a deeper understanding of the world and its challenges.
