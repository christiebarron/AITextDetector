An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I went to work one day and I was so relieved to discover that a few people were working in my clinic. I said, oh okay, because I've never worked for them before, and I've always known that I'm the only one that could ever care for them and that this is how we had a working relationship.


And I have always been such a good person because I always knew that people who were working very hard in the clinic was working for me. There was always a lot that was done, but it was always going to be the same.


How do you keep yourself busy, stay motivated, keep your health under control, all of those things? I've never had a day I went through without thinking about how much I love to see the person doing this for me, how I love seeing them doing this work because sometimes I miss that moment.
