I remember the first time I shared a real laugh with my now-husband Paul. We had been dating for several months and although the conversation was always easy and we had an undeniable chemistry, there was something still missing between us.

That moment changed when we were walking together down the beach at sunset one evening. I had stumbled over a pile of seaweed and ended up face-down on the sand. Paul instantly ran to my rescue and, seeing the look of utmost seriousness on his face as he helped me up, I started cracking up. He joined in and, before I knew it, we were both hysterical with laughter. On looking back, I realize that neither of us could have known it then, but that was the moment when the last few layers of awkwardness between us evaporated and we truly felt like we were connected.

This caught us both off guard and the laughing died away. But the feeling of being at ease with each other remained. We continued on our walk in a companionable silence, looking out at the sunset, and that night we went home and told each other we loved one another for the first time.

To this day, when I look back on that moment at the beach, I smile and feel grateful for the laughter that allowed us to take those first steps on the journey of our life-long love affair.
