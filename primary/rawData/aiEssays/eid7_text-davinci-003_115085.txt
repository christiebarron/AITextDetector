I was grocery shopping the other day and it was particularly busy. There was only one line open and the line was incredibly long. Everyone who was in the line was visibly irritated and grumbling about how long it was taking. I made the decision to stay in the line rather than abandon the effort and try a different store. Everyone around me was getting increasingly impatient and some were starting to get quite rude with the cashier. 

I decided to take a deep breath and focus on the present moment. I try to clear my mind and resist any urge to join the irritating complaining around me. I decided to focus on something else besides the wait time and the people around me. I started to look around the store and eventually, I started making mental shopping lists for future trips. 

By the time I had reached the front of the line, I felt a lot calmer and more relaxed. The cashier was very thankful for my patience and grateful for me not joining in with other customers. She even gave me an extra coupon for my troubles! Despite how long the line had been, I felt surprisingly good about the whole experience. I had practiced patience by staying in the line and refocusing my attention on the present moment.
