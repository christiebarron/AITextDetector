An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the day she was sent home for a pregnancy test. I was not expecting a child and was just hoping her mother would learn to love her as well. I asked her if her mother would like me to come over so she can ask a family friend to come and try and help because I was not expecting a child. She immediately said no and started crying. I had never thought about that before. She was a wonderful baby girl and she is so grateful for what we can create together." That is something I am grateful for because while I may not have the vocabulary for this sentence or the expression "you're so good", what I can tell you is that she is very grateful and I am so glad that she did. But this will come as the icing on the cake.

As it stands with all of this, I cannot remember the last time I thought of this and how I have dealt with this. I don't know how I have gotten used to this type of situation yet and I am still struggling to know the right words. But as stated, I don't actually feel responsible for what happened. Instead, I feel free to say out loud that I am Gaher and that I will do anything to get the miscarriage and pregnancy ended. When I do, I will let the doctor tell her I did not get my baby and because it was not my first pregnancy I wasn't trying to be negative.
