Dear Editor,

I am writing to voice my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Computers are the primary source of information for many people these days. But this can create a problem. In a world surrounded by technology, it is not uncommon for people to become desensitized to the real world.

The internet has made it easier for us to stay connected and share information, but it can also be a form of distraction. Computers can take us away from meaningful conversations, face-to-face interactions, and real-life experiences. Most people use their computers to research topics, watch movies, or play games instead of engaging in meaningful exchanges with others.

Studies have even shown that the excessive use of computers has a negative impact on health. Too much exposure to blue light from the screens can cause physical eye strain, impaired vision, and difficulty sleeping. Additionally, spending too much time seated in front of a computer can cause health issues such as bad posture, muscle weakness, and stress.

Therefore, I argue that computers should be used more as a tool and less as a form of entertainment. We should also take regular breaks from the computer to limit its negative impacts. By using computers responsibly
