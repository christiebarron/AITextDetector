I believe that censorship of materials in libraries, newspapers, books, and tyre-stops should be made to a minimum level before libraries ban them â€“ in general, when it comes to the rights of authors or publishers. If such a policy has not yet been implemented, we should take that into account. Our first recommendation would be for the Ministry of Civil Affairs to come up with a proposal on public relations that would also take into account what the current situation with censorship and censorship of literature is as well. For example, we should consider whether there should be provisions in the Criminal Law for a law to take the place of an offence punishable by a fine of EUR 500 or a fine of EUR 4,000 for failing to publish a book containing a child and a reference to another person. But we will be keeping a special review on this matter after we have taken up a proposal to regulate the activities of the National Crime Branch to avoid any negative impact on education and research. We still believe that it is time to make a recommendation."
