The construction of the Empire State Building in 1931 was monumental for its time, and being the world’s tallest building, it drew attention from the entire world. Inspired by the possibilities of the building, its visionary designers proposed an ambitious idea – to allow for dirigibles, or airships, to dock at the tower’s top. But in executing this project, they faced numerous obstacles.

First, the engineers had to construct a steel mast attached to the tower’s upper level that could support the dirigibles’ weight. This was a complex endeavor and, although the laborers were able to install it in just six months, the completion of the mast was an incredibly difficult challenge. Installation was further complicated as the mast had to be constructed around the building itself, following the existing shape and allowing for little flexibility.

Next, the builders had to find the right type of airships to moor to the tower. Finding the perfect combination of size and stability proved difficult, and the designers had to consider the winds, directions, and winding steel stairs and landings that restricted the positioning of the mast.

From there, they had to contend with public safety and public health rules, as city officials had to decide if the docking of dirigibles came with too great of a risk to citizens. Questions of safety, hygiene, and necessary security measures needed to be considered by the local government, and more often than not, they could be a
