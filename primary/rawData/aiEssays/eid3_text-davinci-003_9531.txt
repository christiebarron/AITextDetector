In the poem “Rough Road Ahead”, Joe Kurmaski describes a cyclist on a “rough road” as she attempts to reach an unspecified destination. The poem serves as a metaphor for the trials and difficulties we may face on the road to achieving our personal goals. The poem’s setting is important in conveying the difficult and endurance-testing journey of the cyclist and in understanding her mental state.

The features of the setting have a strong influence on the cyclist’s experience. For instance, the setting includes a “mile…of rock and gravel”. The rugged terrain of the road is indicative of the challenges the cyclist will face. The road is a “long and maddening” one, suggesting that the cyclist will encounter difficult obstacles throughout her journey, yet she is determined to reach the end, no matter the difficulty.

Furthermore, the “blinding sun” symbolizes the difficulty of the cyclist's journey, but also her determination to keep going. The sun’s intensity is a reminder of the difficult terrain she must traverse yet; despite this, she continues on. Additionally, the poet uses the sound of the cyclist’s spinning wheels to symbolize her relentlessness and heroism. The sound of spinning wheels implies that she will not give in despite the tough conditions, emphasizing the strength and courage of her spirit.
