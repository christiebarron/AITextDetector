Dear Editor, 

It is no secret that computers have taken over the world. Everywhere we turn, people are tapping away at their keyboards, busy connecting with others, scrolling through social media, and playing online games.

Although computers have provided us with numerous advantages and convenience, it is necessary to recognize their potential negative effects. When used in excess, computers can have catastrophic impacts on our mental and general health. 

From sleep deprivation to anxiety, depression, and mental exhaustion, the seductive and hypnotic attraction of computer screens can lead to serious health issues. Too much of computer use can lead not only to physical strains but to social isolation as well. As adults get sucked into the immersive virtual world, they become distant to real relationships and conversations in the people around them. 

Therefore, it is vital to recognize the scientific effects computers have on human beings. It is crucial to understand the importance of monitoring the amount of time we are using computers and limiting it. We should also make sure our lives are balanced and prioritize time for other activities such as physical exercise, family, and work. 

It is time to spread awareness among our community about the potential dangers of overusing computers, so that our collective health is not at risk. 

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
