I had been friends with Jane for years but our relationship had always been somewhat quiet. We went to the same high school and even shared a few classes, but other than that we didn't have much of a connection.

One day I decided to take a chance and invited her over to my house after school. I thought if I could get her laughing, it would help us break the silence and get to know each other.

I immediately went to work and started telling jokes. I had to concentrate to keep a straight face, but Jane laughed out loud at every one. I kept making joke after joke and by the end of the night we had both gone through an entire pack of tissues we used to wipe away tears of laughter.

As we both calmed down, I realized that laughter had brought us a lot closer. We were both able to release all of the awkwardness and just enjoy each other's company. From that day on, no matter what else happened in our lives, we could always count on being able to make each other laugh.
