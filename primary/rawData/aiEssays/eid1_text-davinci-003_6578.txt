Dear Editor,

I am writing to speak my opinion on the effect computers have had on our lives. There is no doubt that computers have become an integral part of our lives since their introduction into the home in the mid-70s. But have the effects been positive or negative?

In my opinion, computers have had a mostly positive influence on our lives. Computers have made it easier to work, learn, and be entertained. We have access to a vast array of information, and the ability to communicate with people around the world. There are also numerous applications such as word processing and financial software that make managing our lives much easier.

On the flip side, there are a few negative aspects to consider. For example, increased dependency on technology has led to a decrease in critical thinking skills. We rely on calculators and computers to perform simple mathematical problems, erasing the necessity of learning how to do them ourselves. Excessive time spent online can lead to an unhealthy lifestyle. Yet, these effects can be mitigated if used responsibly.

In summary, I believe that the advantages of computer usage outweigh the disadvantages. With the increased capability of computer technology, we can look forward to improved efficiency in virtually all aspects of our lives. So, I urge you to join me in embracing the power of technology.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
