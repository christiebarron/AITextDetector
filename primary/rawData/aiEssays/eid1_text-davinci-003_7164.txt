The setting of “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski is integral to the story of the cyclist and their journey. The title alone suggests the challenge they are about to accept. The journey takes place in the city, and the cyclist is experienced and use to the hardships of riding a bike through the city streets. Everywhere they look are issues that can make their ride difficult. Traffic, pedestrians, and specific road features can all impede their progress and make it difficult to maintain the pace they were looking for.

The cyclist faces numerous physical challenges throughout the story. On the road there is detritus, debris, and obstructions that can impact their ride. There are also gradients to contend with, which can slow down the cyclist’s progress or even slow them to a complete stop if they are not prepared.

Despite the challenges, the cyclist finds a way to motor on and meet their goal. This courage
