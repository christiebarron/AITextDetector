The Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One of the most difficult problems was the architectural design of the building and the surrounding cityscape. When the Empire State Building was designed in 1929, the plan was to include a mooring mast at the top of the building for dirigibles to moor. However, the building lacked the necessary height and wind resistance to create a secure mooring for the air ships. Additionally, the surrounding cityscape was too small and congested, with too much untamed wind from the nearby rivers, to provide the stability and support a mooring mast would require.

The advent of the commercial dirigible industry only further complicated the matter. Given that these airships were far larger and heavier than their military predecessors, they were unable to maneuver around the cityscape easily. Moreover, the potential risk associated with a large dirigible docking at the top of an eighty-six-story building caused the engineers and investors much concern. There were also the practical problems of ascending and descending from the mast, in addition to logistical concerns such as how to refuel and restock food and supplies at the top of such a high structure.

The solution the engineers found was ingenious and revealed a number of technical and engineering achievements. The engineers lengthened the mooring mast by adding six steel cables that extended from the top of the Empire State Building and were anchored to the ground. This created more stability for the
