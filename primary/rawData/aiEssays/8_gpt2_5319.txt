One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I saw him playing, I thought he was pretty funny. There's nothing funny about him - he's an interesting guy. It would have been great to actually play as him by making him laugh. I found it very funny seeing him try to be funny."

This week I attended a show by Moxie Marlins on the BBC Radio 2 Today programme.

After listening to the clip, it seemed like I could hear the comedian - who is not listed on the programme but only known for "Talking Funny" - taking issue with a joke he wrote about my dad, about the need for me to have a go at it.

The joke came on the program with the help of his dad, who spoke to me about my situation.

"This one really bothers me," she said. "A joke that can be laughed at by other adults is kind of gross. I don't know that it can be done, but it makes it funnier.

"What I did was make a joke about my dad being a little shy about it. He'd have a line of dialogue about how he's trying to be funny by being pretty serious about it.

"He is a really shy person. He likes to play along, so I let him play at me, thinking, 'I am funny when I play with him'."

There's no suggestion owns the jokes are being used to harass me
