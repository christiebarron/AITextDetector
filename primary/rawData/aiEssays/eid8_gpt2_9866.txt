One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I stood up for my sister, like a boy, which can really hurt."

When she graduated with honors she said she is proud of herself for being a woman and to be able to make friends with men.

"It's very good. It really is one thing. It has been said in this country so many times, 'You only have to be a man to be a woman' and we love that anecdotal proof that there are men out there who have done that," she said.

"And women are a lot more likely than men to have some kind of role model or to have a life that gives them hope and comfort, and it's very hard if they were to lose a husband, a father or a mother.

"It's not going on if you're a woman but it can happen.

"In my view, it's one of the strongest barriers that women can face because it can create those conditions the men experience. Being a mother means you can really help help your child," she said.

Theresa Smith, the founder of the New Girl Foundation, says her goal is to help women succeed.

"The women we look at as being in this situation, and we think that we've all done our lives as a mother with a child that are doing well and at home, that's really great because we've all got something in common."
