In order to understand the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock, it is important to first discuss the engineering challenges that the building's designers had to surmount. The Empire State Building, famously located in New York City, was designed by architect William F. Lamb in 1930 to be the world's tallest and most luxurious skyscraper. At the time, the building was seen as a daring feat of engineering—and it was widely recognized that it would be impossible for dirigibles to dock there due to the building's immense height of 1,454 feet (443 meters).

The main obstacle to allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was the fact that the building was equipped with a series of steel mooring masts. These mooring masts were designed to act as an anchor for large zeppelins, enabling them to dock safely. As explained in Marcia Amidon Lüsted's The Mooring Mast, the mooring masts were constructed with the assumption that the masts themselves would absorb the shock of the airship as it attempted to latch onto the building—essentially acting as a safety cushion. However, the mooring masts could not be installed until the building itself had reached its full height—a process which took several months. Consequently, the mooring masts were not available until the building reached its full height in April 1931, and by that point the
