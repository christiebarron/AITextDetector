One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my mother asked me if in the year 2008, I'd been living with a girl. I said yes as a little joke that she was a little more of a nerd. So, I did that and had my first birthday last year with my mom and she said this kid got a whole new name! The moment was so weird."

On when the concept first became something she'd been thinking about, in the years since she first began dating her college roommate.

"We talk to each other every year or whatever," she says, which makes her a little uncomfortable. "I guess sometimes my sense of humor just doesn't come to the fore because I'm a little used to that. But she had always told me that, although she doesn't think so, she did like the idea that I'm a little bit funny. She has such a special gift for putting a gag on you to scare girls off."

You could always use our help with this story. We started with the fact that the person asking is one girl showers, and then asked if they will help with a child showering program in their schools. And I did ask if there would be any showers available but that I just had to get them booked so I can post them online. So in a way, we're all one person and we're all just that one person. It's something no one should have to worry about.
