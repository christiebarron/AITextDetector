I remember this one time when I was visiting my local library. I had about an hour to spend there and I was excited to find something new. As soon as I entered the library, I noticed that the shelves were not so well organised and things weren't in their place. I felt a bit frustrated, but I noticed the library attendant who looked flustered. I asked her if she needed help and she said yes and told me she was way behind her schedule. I didn't have a lot of time so I decided to be patient and help her out. 

I started sorting out the books on the shelves and I was understanding of the fact that it may not be organised perfectly as it would take more time than what I had. I worked with her for about 40 minutes and by the time I was done, the library attendant was feeling more relaxed and appreciative. She thanked me for my help and I felt good that I was able to be patient and help her out. It taught me a valuable lesson in understanding that things may not be perfect and we should be patient with them.
