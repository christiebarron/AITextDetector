It all started when I first met Martin. A seemingly shy guy, he seemed like the perfect kind of person to become friends with. I wanted to get to know him better, but our conversations seemed to revolve around mundane topics like classes and the weather. Nothing that was going to really bring us closer.

That is, until one fateful day when I decided to ask him a really silly question, just to try to lighten the mood. That’s when things began to change. I asked him, “If you could be any kind of animal, what would it be?” Instead of giving me a serious answer, he looked up at me with a mischievous glint in his eye and said, “A chicken nugget!”

We both started to laugh. It was the kind of laugh that can only be shared between two people who truly know each other. It was a laugh that only comes after weeks of getting to know a person and discovering all the little things that make them unique.

Since then, our friendship has only grown. And funnily enough, if I ask him the same animal question now, he still always answers the same way, with the perfect timing of an old friend.
