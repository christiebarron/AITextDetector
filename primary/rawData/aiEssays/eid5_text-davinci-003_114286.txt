Narciso Rodriguez's memoir 'From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives' is a collection of poems and essays that explore his life through a variety of vivid lenses. The mood of the memoir is one of reflection and nostalgia. The sense of nostalgia is created by his reminiscing of childhood memories, his dialogue on the importance of family, and his poignant description of his search for home. 

The memoir is strongly rooted in Rodriguez’s upbringing in Newark, NJ, as he describes traversing the city's streets “searching for misshapen new homes,” and reflecting on the people, culture and languages of the city he is from. By taking us on an exploration of his memories and experiences, Rodriguez creates a mood of nostalgia. Through his words, he transports us back to his memories of high school, his visits to relatives in Cuba, and his trek “done in communitas” with his friends in the city. These memories create a warmth and camaraderie, as his notes of exploration feel as if he is leading us on a journey alongside him. 

Family is a major focal point of Rodriguez’s work and is at the center of the nostalgia and reflection found throughout the memoir.
