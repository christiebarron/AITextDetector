The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because the novel is so great when it isn't used as a guide to the world, but it's an essential part of an anthology. The idea of "not telling a tale," as it's called in the novel, is always fascinating to read and one that has no boundaries, and it goes beyond the bounds of the fiction genre to offer much deeper and more complex insight into the human condition.

A series that explores the complexities of human nature from a literary, cultural, intellectual, and ethical standpoint is probably the best anthology to date. The authors themselves have the most impact on the process of finding new voices and writers to share their life stories with, but there is a lot of interesting material to explore within this anthology. "Summer Hibiscus is also the perfect place to start reading the collection from which it was adapted and adapted to become the core of the anthology," inundated.com readers may add to the list.

Winter Hibiscus is available for purchase from Amazon at Amazon.com, Barnes & Noble, Amazon.com, Barnes & Noble e-books, Barnes & Noble Nook ebooks via ePub, EDA and Kindle.
