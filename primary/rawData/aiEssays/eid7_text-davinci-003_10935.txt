I was recently in an airport trying to buy a flight ticket with my credit card. I was feeling anxious because my flight was leaving soon and the person at the counter seemed to be taking forever to process the payment. I could feel my patience wearing thin, but I managed to take a step back, take a few deep breaths, and remember to remain calm and patient. 

The employee apologized for the delay, explaining that the system was malfunctioning and it was taking an unusually long time to approve the payment. As she continued to work, I offered her words of reassurance and understanding, assuring her that there was no need to rush. After a few more minutes of waiting, my payment was finally approved and I could board my flight. 

In that moment, I was proud of myself for recognizing the situation and managing to remain patient and understanding even when I was feeling so anxious.
