The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' by a woman with an ex-partner.

According to a press release from the book's publisher, H.R. Haines, the authors are trying to work "as far as to bring the family in line with an existing culture" and have begun a "chamber of opportunities" that might be "inspiring" or "welcome."

As the first book was launched in Australia, the review was also on sale internationally at multiple bookstores, with both the publisher and Haines calling it "a delight to read," and "another triumph of diversity and inclusion."

"It is a beautifully written book and a testament to the richness and breadth of Asian American writers in America through the centuries," the firm added.

"If a book like Sia is the sort of book that makes all the difference between a writer, a novelist and an artist in America, it is an achievement," said Haines. "The family story of a young woman who lost her mother, a mother whoasury all those years of schooling, her life of poverty, is a beautiful story that will please her very heart."

The book is expected to launch in the UK on October 15, but Haines hopes to be up in North America by the time this book hits stores.

Haines previously wrote five novels and four short stories for Simon & Schuster.
