The setting of Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead" has an immense effect on the cyclist. This story takes place in California, in an area called the Central Valley. The Central Valley is known for its hot climate, and the aridness of the soil, which leads to cracked and dusty roads. This affects the cyclist in the story in a number of ways, starting with the physical difficulty he faces in attempting to ride through the valley. The heat and dryness are oppressive and the cyclist has to continually hydrate himself with water in order to prevent dehydration and fatigue. The cracked and dusty roads make it difficult to ride, and the cyclist has to push through the discomfort of jarring movements and the impact of gravel and rocks against his bike frame.

The environment of the Central Valley also affects the cyclist emotionally and psychologically. The oppressive heat, the harsh landscape, and the lack of a sense of accomplishment that the cyclist will get in completing a difficult ride all contribute to the sense of isolation and despair that he feels during his journey. He must find the will to continue and keep pushing forward despite the many obstacles and hardships he faces. In this way, the setting of the story contributes to its themes of perseverance, resilience, and the human capacity to find strength in the face of adversity.
