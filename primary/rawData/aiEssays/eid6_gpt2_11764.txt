The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They had to design and build all the parts of the ship to fit their requirements. When in July 1930 the building underwent a major redesign, the workers were told to have a flat out cabin to house people on their own. A few days later, another group set out to fix the problem. They settled on a flat cabin in the city's old bayfront station. This room would hold thousands of people.

The team set out on the road and a large crane was brought down with more than 10,000 tons of cement to help with the project. They used the crane to install 1,900 feet of windows in the base-wall and some of the steel in a row.

Building with heavy machinery

The engineers who built the building were familiar with the process and a series of high-speed, high-speed, deep-water dives were underway on the project. Once down the bay the crane used a special equipment to cut in and out of the wall and into the floor. The crane lifted the ceiling out, lowered it to the floor, and finally pushed a small, steel-enameled ceiling onto the workstation.

The company used the crane, located close to the workstation, to cut through large-scale snow that littered the ground below.

The workers also used their crane to make more steel, which weighed up to 70 tons.
