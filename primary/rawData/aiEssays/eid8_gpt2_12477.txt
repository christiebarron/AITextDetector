One time I experienced laughter in my life was when a woman was driving a minivan and said: "Ah, I feel like… my face feels awful." A number of women came forward and told me they never thought they would see this kind of behaviour. "This is a shame… I'm scared to be alone anymore," I say.

I wish this was a side effect, but it is a huge part of my experience. I have to remember that there are so many times to live a happy life. I remember being lucky to have my own family of friends, where everyone goes out and plays sports together. It is often about love and friendship.

I have always dreamed of having a life where I could become a footballer. And now, I am so happy to have this dream.
