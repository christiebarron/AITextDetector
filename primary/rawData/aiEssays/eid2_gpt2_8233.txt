I believe that censorship of materials in libraries may be a way of increasing the amount they do available to the public in a way, without the need for it," adds James. "I hope that people can get along without having to read or see such books. People feel safe, the people who need to read and the people who can read and the many millions of people who live and work in China without ever giving up their personal privacy."

The report by the Chinese government is not the first time that China has been in a state of political and technical chaos, with the country's civil war raging as far back as 1997.

The Beijing-led Communist party has long been accused of being too big for it and its leadership is gunman-like.

The most recent military takeover came after a string of incidents. In 1995, the communist party staged its second purge of communists in its country â€” an operation which led to the death of a handful of senior officials accused of having been complicit in the purge.

The country has since been rocked by China-backed anti-government protests, political disputes, and a series of violent clashes with its military.
