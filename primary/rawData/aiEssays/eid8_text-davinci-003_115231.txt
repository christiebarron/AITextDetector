My sister and I have always had a special bond. We have a kind of understanding between one another, a connection that has grown deeper over the years. We are best friends, which always seems to bring us to a special place of joy. 

One particular day stands out in my mind. We were sitting in the living room, chatting and laughing, when I decided to do something totally unexpected: I started telling jokes!

My sister practically rolled on the floor, laughing uncontrollably. I was taken aback by her response, yet I was also so relieved because I was worried that she would think my jokes were not funny. Her reaction was a great source of relief for me; it meant that our bond was strong and that we could still do the silly things that we know make us laugh. 

So what started as an innocent attempt to make her laugh, turned into a moment that I will never forget. We kept laughing and going back to old jokes, making up stories, and laughing again. It was a moment of pure happiness and fun, one that I will always cherish.
