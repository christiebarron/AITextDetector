Dear editor,

As technology advances, there is no denying that computers have become a part of our lives in some way, shape, or form. Although computers can be extremely useful, there are potential negative effects they have on people. 

When it comes to free time, computers can have a huge impact on how people spend it. It has become increasingly common for people to endlessly scroll through their smartphones or for hours at a time playing mindless video games. Hours of this sort of activity cuts into time people would otherwise be spending with friends and family, as well as engaging in physical activity, or using their time to pursue their interests. 

Furthermore, computers can lead to increased stress levels. For example, students often feel a sense of urgency to keep up with their classmates via technology. This can result in inadequate amounts of sleep in addition to endless hours in front of a computer screen. 

For all these reasons, it is important to remember the potential negative effects that computers can have on people, and take action to limit screen time. I encourage everyone to limit their time spent on a computer, and make sure to take breaks and engage in meaningful activities.

Sincerely, 
[Your name
