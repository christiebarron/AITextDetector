I had just started at my new job, and I was feeling pretty overwhelmed. All day, I had done a bunch of paperwork and tasks, and the only thing that was keeping me from curling up in a corner was the few funny conversations with my co-workers I had here and there. One of my coworkers in particular, Felix, always had some sort of joke or funny comment to make, and it made the day go by so much faster.

One day, Felix and I were talking about how difficult the work was, and I started ranting about the paperwork. After a few minutes, Felix just cracked up and said "Hey, don't worry about it. Life can't be all work and no play!" We both laughed, and I felt like a huge weight had been lifted. We could talk through our troubles and still remain on good terms.

Since then, Felix and I have been great friends. Whenever I'm feeling overwhelmed or down, I always know I can count on him to make me laugh and help me out. Laughter really does make all the difference.
