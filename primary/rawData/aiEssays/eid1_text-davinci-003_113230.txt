Dear Editor,

Computers are playing an increasingly important role in our everyday lives - and many people have begun to ask the question: What effect do computers have on our society? In my opinion, computers have had a generally positive influence both personally and professionally.

On a personal level, computers have enabled us to stay deeply connected with family and friends even when we’re far away. With services such as Skype and video chat, people can stay in touch quickly and easily, providing an invaluable way to remain close with both loved ones and long-distance acquaintances. Additionally, computers now provide us with the ability to access research, news and entertainment with unprecedented ease and speed. This gives individuals an incredible power to educate themselves and get informed in ways that weren’t possible before.

Professionally, computers have had an undeniable impact on the job market. By streamlining certain processes and automating tedious tasks, computers have opened up a wealth of new career opportunities. We can now do sophisticated analyses with data and create brand-new roles in the field of computer programming, creating jobs and bolstering the economy.

Overall, computers have provided us with an immense number of benefits that everyday citizens can reap. I urge everyone to keep exploring the ways that computers can positively affect our lives.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
