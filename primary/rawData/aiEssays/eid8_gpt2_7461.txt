One time I experienced laughter in my life was when a colleague was talking about how a woman named Marla wanted to learn a foreign language.

You see, we speak with each other and it's not uncommon to share a desire. I've never been much for spontaneity. We both love to do things our own way with each other, but there's always a need for spontaneity.

Let's get started. We want to know about your experience as a female, and we want to have that experience expressed for us. What do you think? Do you feel your gender as a woman helps your gender as a man? Would you be happy to share your experiences with us? Let us know which of these ideas or methods inspires your gender as a man.

Please share your experiences and be included in a discussion on the site

We've heard a lot of these things. This is an opportunity too easy, so be honest and share how you can experience it. Your gender as a man is a great way to start a conversation about gender equality and equality of opportunity.
