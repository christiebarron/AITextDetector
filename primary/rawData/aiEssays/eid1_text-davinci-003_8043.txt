The idea of allowing dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building is a fascinating one and the construction of the ocean liner mooring mast was a complex and daring endeavor. With the potential for regular dirigible flights between New York and Europe, it seemed an undertaking worth pursuing yet there were a host of obstacles that stood in the intervening years. 

The first challenge was engineering limitations. The mast needed to be both strong and safe. Its base had to firmly attach to the building and hold the weight of the dirigible and any others waiting to dock. To ensure the wind didn't push against the mooring mast, it would have to be designed to bend, dispersing large gusts. The mass of the mast also had to be taken into account, as any extra weight could strain the integrity of the building.

The second obstacle was weather-related. Winds had to be monitored 24-hours a day to ensure that airplanes and dirigibles would be able to safely dock and take off. Any sudden gales meant a delay in the process, for any flight operators had to ensure the safety of their passengers. Furthermore, visibility from the top of the mast was incredibly limited, meaning the operator and pilot of the dirigible had to be more competent than usual.

The third obstacle was the cost of constructing the mast. Because of its height, the construction project was a Herculean endeavor in and of itself. Not only did engineers think of
