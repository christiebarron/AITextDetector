In From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso Rodriguez has crafted a distinct mood that captures the beauty of home and family in a unique way.

The memoir begins with travel as Rodriguez makes his way from New York to the Dominican Republic to visit his family. He depicts the journey as being both exciting and comforting; we are excited to explore and discover the beauty of his homeland, but the familiarities also make us feel at home. This sowing of comfort is just the start of the mood throughout this memoir.

When he arrives at his family's home, Rodriguez lovingly describes the experiences, cultures, and sensations of his large Dominican family, who offer him a sense of deeper understanding and joy. We experience the warmth of the home that can only come from collective love and togetherness. This builds an attractive atmosphere that blurs the lines between familial obligations and freedom from themâ€”a space of unparalleled acceptance and celebration.

The feeling of community continues to blossom as Rodriguez explores the landmarks of the Dominican Republic. The sounds of Kompa and Bachata, the smells of Puerto Plata's Food Fest, the vibrancy of Santo Domingo's Plaza de la Cultura; Rodriguez brings each scene to life and creates a fascinating atmosphere.
