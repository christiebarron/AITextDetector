Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. Some are simple and easy to apply, while some are very challenging to use and use effectively depending on the terrain.

One of the biggest questions is how do you balance this balance to maximize impact from all the impacts? If your rider is on a tight side or with a strong side grip, then the setting needs to be fairly straight from start to finish (and also from start to finish) in order to work well with the cycling surface, and to create good contact to keep them on-balance.

To get the best balance between impacts, it's important to be fairly confident about each hit type during the ride in your chosen setting.

For example, in the saddle, you want to allow maximum drag. If your rider is riding high on a single leg, they will have no balance issues when going around corners at the finish line, but will have to do some cross-stopping as they cross off the side of the line in the middle of a corner when they step, so they should be able to use a little effort up front but not lose balance. In the saddle, you want to protect your grip against the impacts.

Some factors that determine how a rider moves through the final kilometres and can play a major role in the ride-going characteristics of a rider are the speed of the rider, their own speed and body position, the overall condition of your body
