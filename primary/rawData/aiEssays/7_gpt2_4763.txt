An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was a boy at a nursery for my first child. My mother was giving a birth to his child and I asked, would I want to be a surgeon because of my weight? It was not fair to me that doctors had my weight in spite of how they looked. So how could I support my poor and neglected child while they weren't doing work when they could do it? After my parents had moved to a more modest location (about 15 minutes away from my home), I started to make plans to begin my residency program. I received an email from my GP that I would be getting an ultrasound in October of that year, which was the day I got. I read the email and decided that in my spare time alone I was going to do some basic, practical, and necessary things before I made these choices and I didn't want to be distracted. Then, a few months later, the ultrasound hit the doorstep along with five of my friends from our home in Los Angeles... my kids would go for one of these days and they would each ask the doctor for a change in dress, because their parents were too busy caring for him to make his appointment, and the doctors would then tell me I'd have to go back down. I was so happy and relieved. My family took care of me. I am truly grateful."
