The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it deals with some of the most enduring myths by scholars, artists, and cultural figures of its formative era. It also explores the many ways in which modern art, the pursuit of its own creative potential, has shifted from the mainstream of this time. This is a work that is not at all concerned with history, or perhaps with contemporary literature or science, but rather a collection of critical essays written in the last 18 years that address some of the most profound questions of art history. (And remember, some of these essays have been updated.)
