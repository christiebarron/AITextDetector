I remember when I first met my best friend. We had an instant connection, but we were both so shy that it was quite awkward. After a few minutes of very uncomfortable silence, I started to laugh. He instantly joined in, and then, after a moment, he started to tell me a few jokes. We kept laughing until we got tears in our eyes. It felt so good to just be able to laugh and joke around like that.

Ever since then, anytime either of us is feeling down or stressed, we just try to make each other laugh. We crack jokes, talk about funny memories, or pull pranks on each other. It's those moments of laughter that have been the glue that has kept us together all these years, and I'm so glad for it.
