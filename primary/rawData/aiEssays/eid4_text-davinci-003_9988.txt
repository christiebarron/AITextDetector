The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho conveys a message of hope and renewal. The protagonist, Rafe, has failed an important test and is feeling discouraged. The image of the hibiscus blooming in the spring serves as a reminder that many things in life come and go in cycles and that Rafe has the opportunity to try again. The image of the geese returning also invokes feelings of hope and assurance that a new season and new possibilities are on the horizon. By ending the story with this hopeful message, Ho imparts that Rafe - and all readers - should never give up, even when faced with seeming insurmountable obstacles.
