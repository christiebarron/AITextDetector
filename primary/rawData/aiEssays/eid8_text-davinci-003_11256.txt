I had a friend, let's call him Mike. We first met in high school, and became really close. We both had a great sense of humor, and often laughed together. 

One time, we decided to go to a comedy club. I knew it would be a night to remember. The stand-up comedians that night were all spot-on with their sense of humour. We especially loved one of the comedians who told a joke about his summer vacation and it had everyone in the audience rolling around with laughter. 

Afterwards, Mike and I were in tears from laughing so hard. We tried to head home, but were still laughing uncontrollably and people around us were giving us strange looks. We couldn't help but share the funniest moments of the night and, by the time we got home, I was sure my cheeks would hurt for days. 

To this day, Mike and I look back to that night and have a good laugh. Laughter definitely brought us closer together and even created some of our most unforgettable memories.
