Computers have many effects on people. If there was a good reason that my mom bought a house with so many people in it, then I wouldn't be here today. But my family's life was always one of excitement and wonder. Why would I ever have a hard time getting a job when every time the economy is doing exactly what it can do that I can make so much sense of it?

So while we're at it, how did you go from having to live in the city of Baltimore to making one Lieutenant-Commander in the Marines?

The American military is one of the wealthiest and most dedicated in the world. In fact, the most expensive American military equipment is the Navy. The best officers in the military in the United States receive more than $11 billion of bonuses in an average year. The Marine Corps, which has nearly 5,000 of them on this list, is a testament to this.

The other main factor on which the military can be more successful is technological advances. If you look at the past few years there has actually been a substantial uptick in the use of unmanned systems.
