The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it also reveals how those of us who read some of the more esoteric books about witchcraft can find a deeper connection to the book that makes it a bit harder to get hold of: this is the connection for so many who read Winter Hibiscus, but they didn't know it as well as we do.

When Winter Hibiscus launches its Christmas Sale, the book goes up quickly; it's the most popular holiday story-book of all time, with an estimated $20 billion in sales. (You can get it at select stores or online; my family gets it every year at the publisher's bookstores.)

Winter Hibiscus won't hit its 100 million word sales target until early 2014; but its initial release is expected this September.
