The cyclist is riding along a road which is old, rough, and not well-traveled. This suggests that it is a rural area, which has likely gone through quite a few years of disrepair. This impacts the cyclist in several ways.

Firstly, the cyclist is presented with an increased risk of accidents due to the roughness of the road. The cyclist must be constantly vigilant in order to avoid potholes, divots, and rocks that could cause an accident. This makes the cycling experience more dangerous but also more exciting for those looking for an off-road adventure. 

The lack of other travelers on the road provides the cyclist with a sense of freedom and solitude. The cyclist has the entire road to himself and can ride undisturbed, enjoying the sights and sounds of the rural landscape. This also helps the cyclist to focus on the terrain and be more mindful of potential hazards.

Finally, the unkempt nature of the road encourages the cyclist to take extra caution. The cyclist must pay extra attention in order to anticipate what will be coming up in the terrain so they can prepare for it and avoid any dangerous surprises.
