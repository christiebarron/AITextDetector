The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. For one thing, building materials like copper were scarce. By the 1860s, U.S. imports were growing quickly, and the British built up the capital from England. This led some of the British builders to develop the Empire State Building as an off-shore warehouse. In 1837, the British government created the Imperial Building Service. Imperial Building Service was the first of a new type of power plant to be built outside of the U.S., on the east coast of Virginia. The building was called "The Washington Building."

The construction of the Washington Building would come to an abrupt end in 1837 when a steam-powered "Gale Light Railway" went up in the centerbound lanes of the Imperial Building. The train left the southside lane with its cargo, and headed east on Highway 24 toward the center of the building, and eventually stopped along the same thoroughfare. That train, with its 50,000 residents, moved two lanes of traffic. The cars were stopped for "reasonable distance" during the journey.

By the time the train pulled out of its berth and out of the station, a crowd of workers had formed at the Capitol. They cheered and told the construction workers the union had won. But at that point consequently, the train stopped for the first time in months. The building was finished in 1839, and was named "The Washington Building."
