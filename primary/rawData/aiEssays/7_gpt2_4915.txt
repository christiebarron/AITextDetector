An example of a time someone in my life was patient was in a local hospital, and she got treated for a heart attack. I was devastated. I had spent the rest of my life in therapy and therapy, and now she was doing well, in a healthy manner. We have been looking for some time for what was going on and who was doing what to help us, and for what it could be to help her go through this much. She also took care not to get sick, and she was able to continue through the treatment until I was able to leave.

I've been trying to keep her on track for a long time with my work, and she is well on her way. I have been waiting for this moment for something truly special to happen with that young lady. I really want to say thank you so much to everybody who helped us so often, and the people who have helped. Thank you also to our friends in the medical community, and everyone involved in our efforts to keep our family and friends safe.
