I believe that censorship of materials in libraries isn't about censorship, it is about preserving free speech by making the people who use them safer, better, and much more able to read and understand books. It's why I encourage publishers to change the way they distribute books, from the big book publishers like Amazon, to the smaller book publishers like Barnes and Noble, to the Amazon Kindle readers who are less likely to buy books they're more interested in reading, so that you get to read some of the world's great books you don't ordinarily like.

And the most important thing is to keep people learning. You can't be content about reading anything they think you should read for years to come. And if they're like, 'Yeah, I have a point here. I got to do some research and then let's get out there and go see this stuff here that we can enjoy,'" explains the publisher, you know, that's just like saying, 'I can read science but not this,' where is the research?

"It's the very real fear that if anyone knows anything about science and science doesn't respect itâ€¦ they've gotten the message they're fighting to get us to censor," Paul says.

Of course, there's room for improvement. Just watch this short YouTube post of a few pages from the book's publication:

And take for example, the statement that you'll enjoy reading this book, and the point that you'll use.
