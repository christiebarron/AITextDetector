In this age of technology, computers have become an integral part of our everyday lives. Almost everything we do in the modern world involves technology in some way. This has caused us to rely upon computers more and more, but this reliance has had some profound effects on us.

The primary effect computers have had on people is the way they have changed our communication. Email and messaging services have made it easier and faster to communicate with friends and family, but they have also caused us to become more distant with one another. Itâ€™s much easier to sit behind a computer screen and type a message than it is to have direct face-to-face interaction. This reliance on computers to communicate has caused a decrease in interpersonal communication.

Furthermore, computers have had a negative effect on our physical health. Excessive exposure to computer screens can lead to fatigue, eye strain, and headaches. The way computers have changed the way we work can also lead to an increase in sedentary lifestyles and even depression.

Finally, computers have had a great impact on our mental health. Although they provide us with a great deal of knowledge, they can also lead to an over-reliance on technology and a decrease in our natural problem solving ability.

Overall, I believe that computers have had both a positive and a negative impact on people. While they have certainly made our lives easier in many ways, we should also be aware of the potential dangers
