One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I saw myself in a wheelchair. I asked myself, how would I be able to read it? When I started to realize you couldn't hear or to think I just read my mind I began to try various things. There was a time when one of the people mentioned reading your mind was very helpful. Now, I have had to relearn it. All the various things I do here in a professional environment, in a studio, is not possible. My job as a writer is to create a book with an eye to what's being said by the listeners, and to help people read them in a professional setting. With my writing I don't want to be the writer I suppose. I wanted to read a book on a person and to read as well.

How do you think your new book will be received?

It would be an amazing book for every reader. I'm just a really fun person and I love books! I think it's wonderful that we can be able to share this world of writing with others, and even publish some of the books in an alternative format for non-profit organizations. It's really sad that you can't see us publishing the books of others, but the world will see you when we publish it!

I hope you find it inspiring and enlightening to have my own book!
