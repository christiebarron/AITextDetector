One time I experienced laughter in my life was when one person asked: "How did you meet people from other worlds?"

The people that responded on Facebook were so funny, so many friends knew about how I met people from that world. They brought stories of funny friends that they knew and loved. They encouraged me to find new friends and friends are often even just that which was found by those who made the journey to our home planet after experiencing that joy in the moment. For the most part the experiences were the same… it was just people wanting to say "hey, it was a great day to be with you" (yes, that is what people do).

To bring this positive energy to people on their journey of happiness and positivity, I felt as if I was being invited to the very first night of my story and that was true. People are always asking about the amazing joy and the positive reactions to this story and the stories that were given. The stories are always coming up – it makes me feel like the stories that are most needed are the ones that stand out to me. Because of the people I meet on that first journey and with the experiences I've shared my journey with and with others, I see the future in the present, where I can be open and inclusive, the way I think and what the world should look like in our age of uncertainty and uncertainty.
