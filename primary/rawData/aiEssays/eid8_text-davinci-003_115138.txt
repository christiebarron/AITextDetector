I remember it like it was yesterday. I was locked in a heated argument with my brother over which skateboard design was superior: his classic 70s board or my modern one. Neither of us were willing to back down, and the argument started getting a bit too serious.

Then my Mom stepped in with a spark of laughter. She suggested we each have a skate-off – seeing whose board worked the best. A little amused, my brother and I looked at each other and burst out laughing.

The lightening of the mood was just what we needed. With that laughter, the tension dissolved and we were able to come to a compromise. We went outside and each tried out each other's board. To my surprise, I found I enjoyed my brother's classic 70s board just as much as my modern one!

At that moment, I realized the power of laughter. It was the perfect cap to this skirmish – transforming the situation from something aggravating into something fun. Now, when we find ourselves in a similar situation, we always take a moment to share a laugh and break the tension. And that's how I found out laughter really is the shortest distance between two people.
