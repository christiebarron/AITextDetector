The setting of 'Rough Road Ahead' by Joe Kurmaski affects the cyclist in a variety of ways. The cyclist is attempting to traverse a practically vertical incline up a steep mountain road. The gains of a few feet of elevation are quickly offset by equal losses of elevation due to the deep ruts and potholes. As a result, the cyclist is forced to push harder on each pedal stroke in order to maintain a given momentum, pushing them near the limits of their own physical endurance.

The terrain of the road exacerbates the cyclist’s situation by slowing their progress with each bump, dip, and rut in their path. The narrow width of the road forces the cyclist to tangle with the surrounding fauna, dodging biting bugs or native wildlife, such as lizards and longhorn sheep, while attempting to maintain steadiness.

In addition to the road conditions, the afternoon heat can serve to impede the cyclist’s progress. The sun beats down relentlessly, and the cyclist is put to the test by sweltering temperatures. The thin air of the mountain, by contrast, may aid in decreasing fatigue, but its impact is often offset by the forced exertion of climbing a steep road like this one.

The cyclist’s experience with the setting of 'Rough Road Ahead' tests the body and mind alike. The mix of terrain and environment serves to challenge their will to continue forward and their physical capability to
