The setting in Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead" plays a vital role in advancing the story and evoking an emotional response from the reader. The setting is explicitly described as a mountainous terrain located in Southern California, which affect the cyclist in the story in a great many ways. Perhaps most significantly, the setting’s steep inclines and sharp corners require the cyclist to battle the road’s physical conditions, as well as maintain control of his bike. Furthermore, the rugged intensity of the land contributes to an atmosphere of great uncertainty. Even before the cyclist has the opportunity to meet the robbers, there is an existential sense of dread that builds as the cyclist’s tires struggle against the rocky terrain. 

The setting is also distinctly personal, as the cyclist had grown up near the same land and is familiar with its wild beauty. His past may be affecting his current journey, as the nostalgia of home may be masking the true danger lurking ahead. His familiarity with the landscape also lends an expert touch that allows him to maneuver the dire terrain with ease, a skill that ultimately results in his successful escape from the robbers.

Overall, the setting of this story has an incredibly powerful influence on the cyclist’s journey. The rugged and unpredictable mountains and roads not only serve to provide a sense of physical danger, but also a personal, emotional connection that affects his decisions and ability to survive.
