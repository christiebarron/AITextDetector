The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. To date, they've made just one major alteration over the years, replacing the metal girders that line the walls with "Tin" in place of the original ones (including the cephalopod-like pendants and the black paint coating used in the tower's elevator).

So far, however, they've taken some tweaks including the release of the full-scale model of the tower. And yet the Empire State Building is something that the Internet doesn't seem to have even touched: It looks like the only thing that stands between people and the "good and evil" that all the other towers share is the building's name.

The Empire State Building

In the years since the building was officially opened, thousands have tried to build a similar tower. And with the public's support, people have come forward and told stories about their experiences and how it could change how they live they love! The building was officially named after the building's architect.

We're going to dig into all the ways that we can help build a tower that will stand out to you and to make people happy.
