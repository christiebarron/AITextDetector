An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a 6-year old from my own year. In February 2008, she saw the person with cerebral palsy with her daughter and her son, who was in the same family. She thought it was fine with this child to have to share with him something of their own. After hearing that the person was in a hospital, her symptoms had recolved and she was very upset about that. This child seemed to be living with a really troubled family. Then again, when I moved into my apartment, as an apartment complex in East Hampton, the family I lived with in West Oakland and so on, it was too close. It had a lot of problems: a lot of family members were absent. There were some things where it was hard for people to see. Her family was very worried about her; they knew she would leave. That person was so angry. They had a lot of difficulties with her. Then this young girl's father was an associate with that person, David. She says, "Why did he leave me?" Her mother, who was not the best friend, she told her, "Why didn't he go? He had to go." Now that she had the kids, and that time she had some problems with my younger ones and this kid knew her and we talked a long time.

How do you deal with a very small amount of time, a family you only have so much time?
