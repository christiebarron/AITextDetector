I believe that censorship of materials in libraries and online communities and in the government that encourages speech online through these social networks may increase the likelihood that political content from a given source will be propagated via e-mail or social media.

When a political activity generates material by a network of people who can both communicate with each other and disseminate information in all its generality, and can in principle share an opinion and provide information, in both local and international forums, that is neither harmful nor corrupt, I believe that online censorship will increase the likelihood that that material will be propagated, disseminated, and disseminated to the widest possible audience. Such censorship and dissemination is clearly in the public interest, and the authorities responsible for such legislation should be held to account to ensure that information cannot be misused to advance their political purposes.
