No, I do not believe that materials, such as books, music, movies and magazines must be removed from the shelves of libraries if they are found offensive. In fact, it is not fair to judge a book by its cover, or to try to impose a single view on a wide range of people. It is extremely important to allow freedom of expression, encourage diversity, and gain knowledge and information from different perspectives. 

Censoring books, music, movies and magazines threatens freedom of speech and restricts access to important information. In addition, censoring limits cultural discourse and denies individuals the opportunity to have a balanced view on controversial topics. It should be the responsibility of parents to determine what material their children have access to. By removing books, music, movies and magazines from the shelves, it could potentially deny access to important information or perspectives that someone may find valuable.

Moreover, much of the media considered "objectionable" in several local communities has been the same material that has sparked careful thought and discussion in other areas of the country. Instead of banning materials that may be seen as controversial or offensive, libraries should work to create access to materials from multiple perspectives and points of view. 

In conclusion, censorship of books, music, movies, and magazines in libraries should not take place as it restricts access to important information and freedom of speech. Libraries should remain unbiased to remain community hubs for individual thought and respect for intellectual diversity.
