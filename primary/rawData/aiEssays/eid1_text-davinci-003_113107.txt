To the Editor:

As technology advances, computers have become an integral part of modern life. Whether it be for work or play, more and more people are relying on computers to get their tasks done. While computers bring convenience and efficiency to our lives, they can also have an undesired effect on people.

Computer use can lead to a decrease in physical activity. Our sedentary lifestyle can have long-term negative health impacts. Spending excessive amounts of time in front of the computer can also lead to strain on our eyes and mental fatigue from staring at a bright screen. Not only can these issues eventually become a health problem, but they can also lead to an overall decrease in productivity.

In addition to health considerations, computer use can lead to an increased risk of cybercrime. Whether it be banking or retail shopping, people are vulnerable to scams, identity theft, and online fraud. These risks can have serious and long-lasting effects.

However, with increased awareness of the risks, people can safely use computers and enjoy the convenience and productivity they bring. Balance is important. We should always be mindful of hosting screen-free days and moderating computer time.

I urge the readers to assess their computer use to ensure that it does not have any unnecessary detrimental effects.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
