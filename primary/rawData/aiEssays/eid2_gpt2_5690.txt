I believe that censorship of materials in libraries and other media entities must be abolished or restricted altogether. (It is important to remember that the Internet is a public utility, and that it is possible to keep information "free" at a time when we can't freely consume it.)

As a result, there is considerable scope to impose censorship on news services, and the law provides significant legal protection against any effort to restrict people's access to sensitive information.

The Internet makes it easy for people to express their differences through a variety of tools, including Twitter bots, Facebook accounts, and website resources from which to express their views. By contrast, the public's right to access information through the Web is at stake, because if a person were to restrict access through a website, he or she will risk undermining the rights of others under the First Amendment.

This is one of the major problems faced by the First Amendment:

While we can safely say that a person with information about a person, such as what they may say, may use the information on public computers, one of the most difficult hurdles to bring within the purview of the First Amendment is the assumption that it may be "unfair, defamatory or racially insensitive." According to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a campaign group that challenged the government's decision, a person cannot simply remove content that incites people to be prejudiced against, because the content is not "unfair, defamatory or racially insensitive."
