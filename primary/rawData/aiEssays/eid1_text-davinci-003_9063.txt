Dear Editor,

I am writing to discuss the effects that computers have on our lives. It is evident that computers provide convenience, entertainment and an increasing number of other benefits. The usage of computers also has a downside.

The introduction of computers has changed the way our society operates. For some people, it has become a necessity to finish their work or spend time after work hours. This leads to a lack of social interaction; people who spend most of their time with computers may become socially isolated. It also takes away the opportunity for people to experience direct communication with others, which is essential in our lives.

It is also worth mentioning that long hours spent in front of the computer may cause physical problems such as back pain, eyestrain, headaches and discomfort in the hands and arms. Working with computers day after day may also lead to mental fatigue and depression.

My view on the effects of computers on people is that as long as computers are used in a reasonable and regulated manner, they can be advantageous for human life. People should set time limits for computer use and make sure they do not stay in front of the computer for long periods of time.

Thank you for considering my opinion. I hope that readers will think critically about the effects of computers.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
