In the poem “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, the features of the setting affect the cyclist by limiting the cyclist’s ability to traverse the harsh terrain. In the poem, the cyclist is faced with a “rough road” that is blocked by trees, has blind curves, and is strewn with fallen limbs. These features of the setting directly impede the cyclist’s progress.

The presence of trees along the road impacts the cyclist’s route because the trees block the road and create a physical barrier. As the cyclist must take a path around the tree, their journey is lengthened. This can result in untold danger, as the cyclist must take a low light or an unknown route, which could potentially increase their chances of being injured.

The blind curves make the cyclist’s journey more treacherous because they can’t anticipate what hazards may lay ahead. This can result in the cyclist having to make sudden, unexpected changes in direction or speed, increasing the chance of an accident. In addition, the branches that are strewn across the road cause the cyclist to come to a sudden stop as they make their way around the fallen limbs. This can lead to a potential crash and can be especially dangerous if the cyclist is traveling at a high speed.

These features of the setting thus severely challenge the cyclist’s ability to traverse the rough road ahead, and increase the potential danger associated with
