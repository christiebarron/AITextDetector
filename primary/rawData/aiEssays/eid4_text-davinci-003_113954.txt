The author is using this poetic symbolism to talk about her own feelings of trying to pass an English test. While the poem talks about the hibiscus, which will blossom in the spring, the author metaphorically ties the blooming of the hibiscus to her own hopes of passing the English test, symbolizing that if the hibiscus blooms, so can she.
