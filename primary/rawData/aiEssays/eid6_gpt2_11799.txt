The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

The builders' goal was for the dome to have access to a few feet of water for all the building's crew members to be able to use. The dome itself had several doors, with two in the middle and one in the back. The dome required a large number of rooms to accommodate the building's staff, though. They also wanted it to be as large as possible. A huge door could be drilled through the door of a room that was smaller than the house's door. The building's construction team also included a number of staff members.

Many of the doors had been welded and welded to make the door's edges more smooth. To accommodate the dome's roof walls, the engineers began constructing a large open doorway that allowed some of the workmen to sit in the doorway. The dome's walls were very tall, weighing 3,500 pounds, and the floor was 7,300 pounds. The roof was also heavily constructed and curved with a straightened surface.

Eventually the dome's roof started to fail. In July of 2003, the dome was sold to a new state company that had the same roof but with the same dome shape. A few short weeks after a company called Drexel Steel was buying the state-owned company in August 2003, it bought all of the state's remaining three and then moved in another six months later.
