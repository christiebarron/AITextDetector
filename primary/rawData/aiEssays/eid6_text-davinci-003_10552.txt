The building of the Empire State Building presented a unique challenge for the design engineers, in that they needed to provide a docking station for dirigibles. Dirigibles, or airships, were a popular form of travel in the early 20th century, and the building provided a perfect platform for them to dock at the top of the building. However, the engineers faced various obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

The first obstacle was the size of the dirigibles. In order for the airships to effectively dock at the top of the building, the engineers had to make sure that the transport was not too large for the platform. According to 'The Mooring Mast' by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the engineers designed the mast to be 180 feet above the ground and to have a platform 136 feet wide and 50 feet long. This platform was to be strong enough to support the weight of the dirigibles, while not being too large to overpower the actual building.

The second obstacle was the designs of the airships, which could differ greatly in terms of their loading systems and measurements. This caused the engineers to make sure that the platform’s design would be universal and adaptable to any size or shape of dirigible. In order to do so, they designed the platform with a curved ramp that was suitable for a variety of loading systems. Additionally, they included a circular rail, or "ring rail", that allowed for a secure
