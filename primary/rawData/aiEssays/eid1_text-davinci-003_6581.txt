Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have had on people in recent years. In my opinion, the widespread availability of computers and the internet has been incredibly beneficial to our society.

First, computers allow us to store and access an unlimited amount of information. We can now access books, recipes, art, music, and much more, from any internet-connected device. This has revolutionized the way people learn, communicate, and create. Not only is this technology convenient and efficient, it has opened up great opportunities for those who are unable to access physical libraries or expensive universities. 

Second, computers have strengthened our economy and job market. By turning manual labor into digital labor, companies can reduce costs and optimize their production. This has increased the availability of jobs for people around the world. The internet has also created a platform for small businesses to flourish and gain access to a larger consumer base.

Finally, the emergence of online communities has been a powerful force for connecting people with shared interests. We now have an unprecedented ability to collaborate, discuss, and debate over numerous social and political issues that were previously difficult to address. 

In conclusion, computers have brought about great progress in our society. They have allowed us to access new resources, power our economy, and connect with each other on a tremendous scale. Thus, I urge your readers to appreciate and embrace the effects of computer technology. 

Sincerely
