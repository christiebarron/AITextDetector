I remember the exact moment when my best friend and I first started laughing together. We had just begun our freshman year of high school and we were sitting in the lunch room. A joke was made, and I'm not sure whose, but we both busted out laughing.

We looked at each other in shock. We had both previously felt awkward around each other, two new kids in a school of thousands, but that moment changed it all. We suddenly felt so comfortable together, like we had known each other our entire lives. We couldn't stop laughing; it felt like every sentence we uttered was funnier than the last.

We were both relieved, like a weight had been lifted. It was a relief to find someone who made us feel so at home in our new school. We laughed so hard that day, and for many days after, that we quickly became inseparable.

Laughter was the glue that held us together through all the growing pains of high school. Each joke, each time we made each other laugh, gave us a deeper appreciation for our friendship and relationship. Looking back on it now, I still get a warm feeling inside at the memory of our first shared laughter.
