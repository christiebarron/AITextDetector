I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is not only wrong, but that it is also morally unacceptable," he told CNN.

Censorship laws in most states allow for the removal of information found embarrassing. Last year, after the FBI and civil rights groups were accused of being overly lenient on people like the ACLU who complained about police use of their office phone records, the Florida legislature decided not to enforce the right to use a cell phone, and it passed a bill known as the "Bribery Protection Act."

This comes as law enforcement in other states have reported more arrests for "cyberviolence" than for violent crime.

However, the ACLU is not the only organization which has been vocal in its opposition to censorship of information. Its lawyer, James Stiles, took to Twitter.

@jamesstiles This is one of the ways the Trump administration's censorship policies are being used — James Stiles (@James_Stiles) April 15, 2017

@jamesstiles the law is actually an attempt to make it look like internet censorship is more likely to take place for the people who don't want the info than the law enforcement. https://t.co/zg8QnXY2hhZ https://t.co/cVqZv3jrRQ7 pic.twitter.com/yWrG3q6fRy — James Stiles (@James_Stiles
