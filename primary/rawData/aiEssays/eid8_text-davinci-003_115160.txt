I was walking down the street with my friend when we both saw something funny. It was a man riding a scooter in the rain, wearing a bright, yellow raincoat. We couldnâ€™t help but start laughing. Our laughter was so contagious that soon, seemingly everyone around us started laughing too!

As we passed by the man, he stopped and smiled at us, in spite of the rain. I waved to him and thanked him for being so entertaining and sparking our laughter. He said he was glad to have done his part in helping to lighten up our day.

My friend and I walked away with big smiles on our faces, feeling like everything was right in the world. It felt like our laughter had bridged a gap between us and the stranger on the scooter, making us all feel connected on that rainy day.
