The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

It was not until the end of the first World War that aircraft could be placed in a hangar and fly in the direction the intended craft intended to land.

In July 1918 the first of them was taken straight from the American factory.

The A.K.A. A.B.M.E.N. was constructed on the site of the unfinished U.S. House of Commons building at the end of World War II.

The next step was to remove the propane engine from the plane, as part of a pilot-controlled operation.

The project involved the construction of three different aircraft: U-235 (a P-51 Mustang); A-10 Thunderbolt, the largest of these by air force size at that time, and a G-4G Lightning II trainer.

The only aerodynamic modifications included a special stabiliser to reduce weight.

The plane was then used for transport to the North Pacific, where it continued to be used after the war.

The A.K.A.A.B.M.E.N. had to be moved back to the site.
