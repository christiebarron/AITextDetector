I was visiting my grandparents in Florida and one night we were having a family dinner. We started talking about funny stories from our childhoods and the laughter just kept on coming! Every time one of us remembered something funny, we would start telling it so loudly that we couldn't hear each other. Soon the entire family was cackling and doubled over in laughter.

My grandpa started recalling a time his dad had given him a really tough punishment for something he did as a kid. He had tried to sneak out of the house late at night to meet up with his friends, but was caught. His dad had ordered him to stay up all night with a bag of coal, yes coal, in his hand. Of course, he was just a kid so he started to doze off with the coal in his hand. As the story unfolded, there wasnâ€™t just laughter filling the room but tears rolling down our cheeks at the thought of a small child sleeping in the middle of a dark night with a bag of coal in his hands. 

This moment made me realize how important laughter is in any relationship. Despite all of the years between us, we all just naturally laughed together and shared the same sense of joy and lightheartedness. In that moment I was grateful to be part of such an amazing family.
