Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. Some of the most notable and controversial are those above.


1. The "high intensity cycling zone" at an Olympic Park

This is a really significant one. Cycling in Europe is notoriously difficult, difficult, difficult; at least that's what we're used to. Yet, in the face of so much negativity on cycling, and with the focus now on a particular sport, cycling is really just an exercise in endurance that gets harder and harder.

2. Cyclists on rough roads

A rider is likely to start out in a certain lane of roads in different situations, but this is usually the first stage of a race to get to the other side of an obstacle, and is particularly helpful if he does not know of the right way back before it gets to the other side where the rider will have to push his way back over the barrier with his head.

3. More frequent rough roads for drivers; often the same for cyclists

The "high intensity cyclists" mentioned above are those often cited as the key to cycling success: more frequent rough road for drivers; most notably, and quite often, the first and last parts of a race in the same conditions to push into the lane (with and without a wheel on them).

4. A higher chance of better visibility in the road and on-traffic

This one is a bit odd,
