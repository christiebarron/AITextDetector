Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people and to persuade readers to agree with me. As we have all witnessed, the role of computers in our society has become increasingly important. Computers have become an essential tool in our daily lives, streamlining administrative work and improving communication amongst individuals and organizations.

However, it is also important to recognize the potential side-effects of computers. It has been statistically shown that the overuse of computers has led to physical negative effects, such as computer vision syndrome, carpal tunnel syndrome, and musculoskeletal disorders, as well as mental effects, like depression and stress.

Furthermore, computers are affecting our interpersonal relationships. Social media, in particular, has been shown to lead to social isolation, as individuals increasingly substitute in-person interaction with virtual communication. Therefore, it is important that we understand the impact computers have on the people and take measures to mitigate the risks associated with it.

At the same time, we cannot underestimate the capabilities of computers and the numerous advantages they offer. The power of computers helps make information and resources accessible to everyone and has been a great help in improving efficiency and driving innovation.
