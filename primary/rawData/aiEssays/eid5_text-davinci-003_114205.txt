The memoir centers around the concept of ‘home’, both in its physical and spiritual sense - and this is something that guides the mood of the entire work.

The memoir is filled with a sense of nostalgia - as Narciso recounts his family and childhood memories, it’s clear that the concept of ‘home’ brings him comfort and joy. As he travels to new cities and begins to build a career, he also brings with him the memories of his family home and his early life.
