In the short story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, the setting is a crucial element that shapes the experience of the cyclist as he rides through the mountain pass. The setting creates a sense of adversity and danger for the cyclist that the reader can feel through Kurmaski’s attention to detail.

The steep and mountainous context of the pass creates a feeling of vulnerability and fragility for the cyclist as he traverses it. The narrow and winding path gives the impression that the cyclist is insignificant and overwhelmed by the vastness of his environment. The lack of an accompanying guard and need to constantly look and react to the terrain give the reader a sense of uncertainty, an obstacle that the cyclist must confront and push through to reach the end.

The weather also adds to the sense of danger for the cyclist. Wind, rain, and fog accompany the cyclist and, combined with the narrow pathways, create a feeling of dread as the cyclist navigates his way through. The lack of visibility and instability of the fog can be felt as the cyclist makes his way through the mountains.

Kurmaski’s attention to the setting and its role in the cyclist’s journey helps to portray the sense of resilience and determination of the cyclist as he pushes forward in his journey. These environmental factors make the experience of the cyclist all the more visceral and its effects on the cyclist accessible to the reader. The setting features amplify the cyclist
