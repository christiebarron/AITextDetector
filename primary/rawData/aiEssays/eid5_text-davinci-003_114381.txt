Narciso Rodriguez's memoir From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives is an intimate and touching portrayal of a life enriched by memories of home. In it, Rodriguez recounts stories of his Cuban-immigrant family's journey from their homeland to the United States and the various homes in which they resided throughout this period. Much of the memoir is infused with a sense of nostalgia, as Rodriguez reflects on the various places and settings that he and his family have left behind.

From the outset, Rodriguez's thoughtful and vivid descriptions of these places—from vivid descriptions of Casa Blanca, Cuba, to the family's new home in Manhattan—engender a sense of both longing and joy. Memories of the "nostalgic tang of plantains frying in coconut oil" in his father's kitchen are contrasted with moments of discovery in the boisterous bohemian subculture of the Lower East Side. Such a level of detail serves to transport the reader into Rodriguez's vivid memories and instill a strong sense of nostalgia and reflective longing.

Throughout the memoir, it is clear that Rodriguez's writing is underpinned by a strong sense of identity and belonging—despite the various places he has lived, being "from home" remains an important part of his identity. This evocative memoir captures this feeling perfectly—Rodriguez's unique voice lays bare his sense of home and belonging, and this is further highlighted by his reflections on each of the places he has lived.
