I was feeling especially frustrated on the morning of my friend's wedding. I had been up since the early hours of the morning preparing her hair and makeup. Even though we had planned for extra time prior to the ceremony, we were still running late.

Despite the fact that I had not slept very well the night before, I remained calm and patient. I told my friend that it was important to take the time we needed and to not rush through anything. I offered some encouraging words, explaining that everything would turn out beautiful no matter how much time had passed.

We managed to get ready just in time for the ceremony, with a few last minute touch-ups needing to be done. Even though I was tired and ready for a nap, I was still able to keep a smile on my face and celebrate the occasion with everyone else. Throughout this entire experience I was patient and understanding even in the most stressful of situations.
