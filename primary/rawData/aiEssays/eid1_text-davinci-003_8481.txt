I recently went on a trip to visit my grandparents. Since I had not seen them in a long time, I was so excited to finally spend some quality time with them. However, when I arrived at my destination, I realized that the airlines had lost my luggage and I had nothing to wear during my entire stay.

At first I was devastated. Not only was I embarrassed, I felt helpless too. I wanted to leave right away and the thought of having to spend the rest of my holiday without my belongings was unbearable. 

But then my grandparents were very patient and understanding. They told me not to worry and they spent the day shopping for clothes for me. They even went out of their way to find clothes that I really liked – which was great because they didn’t have to do that. They even paid for all of the clothes. 

Their kindness and patience really had a calming effect on me. I was so grateful that they were so patient with me in this difficult situation. In the end, I was able to enjoy the rest of my stay and the time I spent with my grandparents was truly special.
