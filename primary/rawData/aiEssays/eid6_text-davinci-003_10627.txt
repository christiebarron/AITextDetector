The Empire State Building was an accomplishment of modern engineering, achieving both architectural feats and technological advancements. A unique feature of the building’s construction was its ability to both accommodate ground vehicles and airships, such as dirigibles. However, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock were substantial.
 
In “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the scaling issue of allowing dirigibles to dock within the structure of the Empire State Building was discussed. A major issue was that the deck built specifically for dirigibles, the 86th floor, was not high enough for larger airships to moor and maneuver, a factor that posed a significant challenge in ensuring the safety of these vehicles and the people inside them. Additionally, the deck’s weight, which was estimated to be more than 1000 tons, was too heavy for the building’s steel supports and needed to be drastically reduced. 

The architects of the Empire State Building also had to work around the strong winds that occurred due to the building’s extreme height. Wind speeds on the upper floors could reach up to 110 mph, posing a danger to any pilot and passengers attempting to maneuver in such extreme weather. This prompted the builders to install an electric motor at the 86th floor deck to help pull airships in and out during strong winds. The motor was connected to lines connected to the moor
