The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The state building, it turns out, was built on public land and was an exclusive property of the governor. If a visitor were to cross the bridge from one side to another and walk with it over the steps, the resulting vibration could have caused serious dislocation of the pedestrian.

The state building owners, under certain conditions, were able to change their mindset and change course in the matter.

"The engineers came up with a set of rules," says Michael A. Gorman, a retired engineer who served as a consultant to the building when he led the architectural commission that built the Empire State Building. "They wanted the bridge elevated to the right height so there was a possibility that a pedestrian could be out of sight when they were in position to cross the bridge and get away from it."

By the early 1980s, Gorman and his staff had completed several drafts of the design that required much less time and much more cost than they were used to. The final draft, which was completed on time, was designed, designed and developed to allow for better mobility for pedestrians and bicyclists and help reduce vibrations in the crossing area.

One of the most visible aspects of the original construction plan was building a second "cabin" that would have allowed people to stop in the middle of the bridge. Although the original goal was for pedestrians to walk over side streets, and the
