Dear Editor,

As a long-time reader of your newspaper, I wanted to take the opportunity to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people.

In this day and age, computers have become ingrained in all aspects of our lives. While computers have made some aspects of life easier, their ubiquity also has adverse effects on us, both mentally and physically.

For starters, people who work long hours staring at computer screens are prone to physical harm, such as Repetitive Stress Injury. Particularly for those who work an office job, there are few, if any, opportunities to be active during the workday. This inactivity, combined with unhealthy snacking, can lead to obesity, diabetes and heart disease.

In addition to physical problems, computers can also harm our mental health. By relying on technology to do things we used to do ourselves, we are providing an easier alternative to being mentally active. This can lead to slower thinking and a lack of social skills, not to mention boredom and depression.

For these reasons, I do not believe we should encourage technology use for its own sake. We must remember to take a break and actively engage in activities rather than rely solely on computers.
