One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was talking about my daughter's birthday. A lot of people think it's because her hair color was a mystery, she wasn't wearing pink, because she had a black bra and a tan shirt," says Ewan, 21, who was with her daughter when she accidentally was shot in the stomach during their visit to the hospital.

Ewan's uncle, David King, 33, an entrepreneur who runs a furniture stores, says the fact that people assume her hair color is the mystery has never stopped him.

"In my humble opinion, if she does it correctly, she'll be fine. I told a friend that people don't really know. I don't think they do what it says."
