Minfong Ho ends Winter Hibiscus with this statement to emphasize the changing nature of life and the importance of hope and resilience in facing and overcoming obstacles. The narrator, Ying-Ying, has been struggling to take a difficult geometry test and has been feeling very overwhelmed. By ending the story with the promise of new hope and a new chance to take the test in the springtime, Ho is suggesting that difficulties can eventually be overcome with enough determination and perseverance. The imagery of springtime – the melting snow, the returning geese, and the budding hibiscus – all signify a time of renewal, a new season of possibility and growth.
