Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my opinion on the effects that computers have on people. After decades of growth in technology, I have come to the conclusion that computers can have both positive and negative effects â€“ it all depends on the user.

On the one hand, the irresponsible use of computers can lead to a wide range of problems including cyberbullying and over-exposure to digital media. People should be aware of the potential dangers associated with computers and use them with caution.

At the same time, computers can be a great resource when used responsibly. With just a few clicks, people are able to access a wealth of information, including educational resources, online shopping, and a wide selection of entertainment. Furthermore, computers provide countless opportunities for remote learning, working, and networking.

In conclusion, there is no doubt that computers have had an immense impact on our lives. While it is important to understand the negative effects of irresponsible internet use, it is also essential to recognize the potential benefits of technology. With the right attitude and precautions, computers can empower people to make meaningful progress and advancements.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
