The construction of the Empire State Building meant that builders were tasked with creating the world's tallest building, and so it is no surprise that they considered utilizing a means of docking dirigibles to the structure. Dirigibles were a relatively new form of transportation, and their usage and docking posed unique obstacles for the Empire State Building architects and builders.

The main challenge in allowing dirigibles to dock- especially a large one, such as a zeppelin– was the fact that they required a mooring mast, which was a tall, thin mast with a steady base, suspended rope basket, and a metal rod for the dirigible to loop around. Especially for the Empire State Building, the mast needed to be able to withstand high wind speeds due to the building's tall stature.

Despite the numerous challenges, the Empire State Building engineers set out to create the world’s first mooring mast. The mast they designed consisted of a steel tower base that was many stories tall located in the base of the building. They also incorporated cables and guy wires to give the mast stability and strength against the winds, and incorporated an electromagnet which allowed the dirigible to come to a safe stop and keep it in place.

The mooring mast and the Empire State Building's height also presented challenges in regards to air traffic control. With the building being so tall and the dirigible traffic to be expected, engineers worked hard to come up with an air
