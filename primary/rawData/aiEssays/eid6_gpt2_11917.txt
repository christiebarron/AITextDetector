The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They had to make sure they made the right decisions, and they did. (They also took a chance on making the state hospital look like a giant parking lot, a decision not made by most architects, who viewed the building as a sprawling building that could Alemany walk into its labyrinthine construction, but in this case, a single hall.) What made the State Building the best option were the dimensions it weighed, and in one case, it weighed 50 tons. But to make this design possible, he says the builder had to build them from someplace higher. "They took a chance on it because they think it would be a huge thing," he says.

How to build a State Building on a Dune

Boehner's solution was to scale it down, so the buildings they built would have a vertical face. But the idea was "to keep things in the natural way," says Peter R. Miller, senior architect at the Center for Architecture Modern and Contemporary New York. Each of those dimensions would be in the shape of a cube, then scaled up and down to fit it. In the first two layers, it would be a 10-foot dome at 20 feet tall, or 11 feet wide. It'll be the tallest building ever built as the tallest high-rise in New York City. The second layer will lie at the center of the building.
