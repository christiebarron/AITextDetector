An example of a time someone in my life was patient was in my life when I was having a child at the time. I felt that I needed to do all this to make that child better and so I brought back Baby and I did that. All of that was kind of done by your child back in your life or other people's life you know. I didn't know the whole story. But there was an emotional attachment to her. And I loved that she was the kind of child that I would put a little bit of care into because now her family has come back with all of their kids. And so I have always cared for them, and my life has always been about finding a special place for them, caring for them. And I know what your parents are going through when you have those children. It still is a very difficult situation to deal with in your life, but it was never in your mind that it was the right moment for you and you didn't want to take this to the point where you couldn't cope. So that was the right decision. I'm very glad that the kids found their place and they're here. One day they'll get them back as well. It was also my hope to be able to bring them to school and be able not only to learn more about how well their family is doing, but also to be able to give them the things that they need as children to improve their lives. I'm grateful for it as well.
