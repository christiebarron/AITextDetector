The Empire State Building had grand ambitions from the outset – it was designed to be the tallest building in the world and included the novel concept of allowing dirigibles to dock at its soaring mast. But the building’s architects and engineers faced a number of unexpected obstacles when it came to making this idea a reality. This essay explores the challenges they had to overcome, as detailed in Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s The Mooring Mast.

As construction of the Empire State Building began in the late 1920s, the idea of using the building mast as a mooring port for dirigibles seemed both innovative and practical. The top of the building was even designed with an area specifically set aside for the disembarkation of passengers to the ground. However, the challenge of weatherproofing the area presented an unexpected problem. Severe winds and storms at that height made it very difficult to keep the area closed and enclosed. As a result, numerous adjustments had to be made to the design of the enclosure to make it suitable for docking.

Perhaps the most significant obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the fact that the mooring mast had to be big and strong enough to handle the immense weight of the aircraft. This meant that the mast had to be constructed with heavy steel and strong cables to keep it stable and secure, complicating the design of the mast and increasing the cost of the project. Also, to avoid the aircraft’
