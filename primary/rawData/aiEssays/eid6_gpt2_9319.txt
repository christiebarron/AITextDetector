The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. (The British Government would later agree to a similar restriction on the use of the building's exterior as the Emperor's house on London's North End.) The National Library of London had already had plans to dock on purpose on behalf of the Empire State, so how could it not do so by the use of an airship to dock planes?

Another problem also faced by the new skyscrapers was one of the few features of a military-type building that can be placed in space that does not fall within the confines of the Empire State Building. Even though military buildings are so advanced within the limits of the existing structure, they do not have the capability to take off on a space-based approach as is evident at the New York General Hospital. The new subway system of the United States, for example is a military, not a commercial one; it is a space project, but its requirements are different than the requirements of the existing world-building scheme.

A Military-Type Building Is a Space-Based

Another issue that faced designers and architects alike at the time of the creation of the Empire State Building was the lack of space between spaces that could support life and a human being. A military base may be large enough to support life, but it is not necessarily large enough to comfortably accommodate a nonhuman creature. The reason was that a large, spacious space required massive energy structures to
