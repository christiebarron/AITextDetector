An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my late father, he was having an epileptic seizure at the same time. It was then that my mind and body changed as a result. I was also thinking he had a disease called Alzheimer's, and he had a very big tumour which they were trying to kill off at the time. So it was a real blessing when Dad told me where to look and what to say. I loved playing with all the kids who were being treated at hospitals!

Trying to keep his dad's memories the same, I was able to get away with every other thing I did for him - from getting him over to a psychologist and an endocrinologist and the psychologist was super good, he was fantastic and I was lucky. However I do have a fondness for those who are close to his. Having a close friend from his last life and an old friend from his last life has made me realise how special he is, he is the best friend I ever knew. Even though his whole life has been so incredibly stressful and I am always finding the most comforting things in life that I can do to his day.

What did you do for him when you asked him out in 2004?

T.O.I.I would have to have a conversation with him and I will tell you that I never wanted to get that chance. I remember being asked by Mr Brown what could have got him into this situation...
