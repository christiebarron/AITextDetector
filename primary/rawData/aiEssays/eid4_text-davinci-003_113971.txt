This statement serves as a powerful metaphor for resilience and the narrator's desire to never give up, no matter the hardships that may arise along the way. By tying the narrator's

desire to succeed to the natural cycle of the winter hibiscus and the return of the snow geese, the author emphasizes the idea that no matter how difficult life may seem at present, spring will eventually return and bring with it new opportunities. This is meant to be an inspirational message to the reader that no matter how daunting the future may seem, no matter how many tests they may fail, they should never give up hope.
