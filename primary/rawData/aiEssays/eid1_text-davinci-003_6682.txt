Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. It is clear that using computers on a daily basis has become an integral part of life for many individuals. Computers have revolutionized how we communicate, access information, and complete tasks.

The use of computers has proven to be beneficial in a number of ways. Technological advances in computers have allowed people to become more informed, efficient, and innovative. Through computers, individuals can access a greater variety of knowledge and resources. Despite these advantages, there is some debate about the effects computers have on people.

However, computers can be detrimental to some individuals. Too much time spent on the computer can lead to various physical and mental health issues such as headaches, vision problems, neck and back pain, and even depression. Computers can also contribute to a sedentary lifestyle and discourage people from being active and engaging in outdoor activities. 

For this reason, I believe that computers should be used in moderation. We should still appreciate the advantages that come with computers but try to maintain a healthy balance between them and other activities, lest we experience any adverse effects.

I urge you to reach out to your readers to promote this same message and encourage people to be conscious of how much time they spend in front of a screen. 

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely, 

[Name]
