An example of a time someone in my life was patient was someone I remember at New Yacht when he was 15. They had been driving to meet their friend. The friend says, 'We're looking for someone who has an English accent, is able to speak Spanish.' He went to his car and saw a man who looked like a Brazilian from Brazil who looked like a young girl. So I turned my head until a white bus came up and I told his grandmother how he was there. I never looked at his face.

My oldest son started to cry after I walked into the hospital. Some people saw me when it wasn't so pretty to see my children and they cried because of my presence.

What do you say to people who think the world is so big and they haven't yet received the message? "Go out and get your body done." "People will pay a higher price. They're going to say, 'I never saw you here on the street anymore and I have to work from here.' You're supposed to get out of your car with your hands wrapped around your waist."

Where is your best place to be in Europe?

It's really hard to tell the difference between the countries. There's no clear standard at all. No nationalities, no nationalities, no European language. I think the Germans, who are good, have lots of experience in Europe. They just have too few.
