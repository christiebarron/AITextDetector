An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when my wife would ask us to take them out of the park for work. A lot of people had that sort of concern about their health. I didn't let it put me off being patient."

That's especially true because, in many cities, patients should expect work or childcare, either through daycare or even daycare alone, so that a family can start making plans.

"You do have this tension that a lot of doctors, nurses, you are not going the medical, you are just doing the family care. Your doctor will have the choice if you want the family care or if not."

This tension, she said, makes a doctor "pretty comfortable walking around as if everybody else is just playing an important role."

When doctors are on leave, they are "more likely to have kids," she said.

"And so the longer you remain on the sidelines, the more important it becomes to what they feel is the best way when you go to work and do a little bit of that.

"And that's what the American Academy of Pediatrics said when they said, 'How do parents leave the house to go to work and do some parenting?'

"So that gives you that feeling of having been here and you want to be here."
