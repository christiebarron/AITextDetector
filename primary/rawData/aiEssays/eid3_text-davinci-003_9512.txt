The features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski's 'Rough Road Ahead' play an important role in shaping the experience of the cyclist. The foreboding environment, comprised of a "somber and tense silence" and dim, twilight skies, suggests the cyclist is entering unfamiliar territory. In this foreign setting, the cyclist is aware and conscious of the danger that looms ahead.

The backdrop of wilderness brings further uneasiness to the cyclist's experience. With the only source of light coming from the reflection of the moon and stars, and wildlife noises coming from all directions, the cyclist has no sense of control or assurance that he will make it to his destination. The deeply rooted darkness of the setting creates a sense of the unknown and a fear of the unknown.

The weather is also a feature of the setting that impacts the cyclist's experience. While the cyclist has been on rough roads "countless times before," the rain and snow that have come at the same time create a feeling of adversity. The inability to distinguish what is ahead of him due to a heavy, blinding snowfall, creates an added sense of fear about going forward with the journey.

The sense of urgency in this setting is palpable, as the cyclist is caught between wanting to get to his destination and knowing that the rough road ahead may be too dangerous to cross. This fear of the unknown and lack of control that the cyclist faces drives the overarching theme of courage and perseverance.
