The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is to tell the story of how she was born in Nigeria and what she did.


The full-length book is due out in June 2017

In the new volume, Toni brings up an international issue of the magazine's weekly magazine, a topic of fascination that "will be brought not only to the attention of world leaders but also of our families and to celebrities such as Michelle Obama, Beyonc√© and Lady Gaga."

In another chapter, Toni visits her former friend and former boss, David O'Reilly, a prominent Nigerian economist who has worked at Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank. She then details her background in the past and how she came to the decision to get involved in the real estate market.

Toni is also asked about her time at Goldman Sachs. She says she had a one-hour interview with O'Reilly as a student in 1989, but they did not make any "clarifications and assurances" about her work, although the Goldman bankers would often make it clear that they only spoke their minds during an interview. Later she remembers that she had a meeting with O'Reilly's boss, Alan Kay.


Toni says that she's seen so many people like him, including the president of Goldman Sachs, but she says most are "dying of their souls".
