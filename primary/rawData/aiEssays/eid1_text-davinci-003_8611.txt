I had been dating my now wife for a few months, and my friends were starting to wonder if things were getting serious. My best friend took it upon himself to invite us out for dinner and drinks to find out for himself. We had a great time until we went to leave, when laughed suddenly erupted from our direction. 

Turns out, unbeknownst to us, my best friend had changed the bill in our favor, and asked the waitress to pretend that the total price was much higher. We were laughing so hard about the look of shock on our faces (and hers!), as we had expected a much larger sum to pay.

The night ended well and nearly six months later we were engaged and married a year after that. That night of laughter will always be a great reminder for me of the love, fun, and admiration my wife and I shared.
