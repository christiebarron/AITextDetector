One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I saw The Man from U.N. Millennium. I was sitting next to a huge wall in an apartment and the words "GOD IS OUTPUT" read on it and I saw a person who was quite different from what one would often see. His face was quite big and he was quite funny and witty. I tried to smile when he walked past me, but it did not work. I was able to get a bit sad and sad for a while, but eventually I just let go of it and left. This is not to say there aren't different comedians in this world, the same shows, the same personalities, the same people. Just see what I wrote about this guy in the comments below and let me know what you think.
