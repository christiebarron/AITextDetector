The construction of the Empire State Building in 1931 was a remarkable achievement that still stands today as a testament of human ingenuity. Although the building was primarily designed for occupancy by people, there was also a provision for the docking of dirigibles, or airships. Constructing the Empire State Building to safely accept the docking of these massive ships posed a serious challenge to the building’s engineers and architects. 

The principal challenge was that airships had never docked on a skyscraper before. The logistics of how a compliant, secure mooring mast should be designed and built were unknown. Additionally, the Empire State Building was a particularly challenging structure to dock an airships from. Its tall and slender design, coupled with its 102 stories, posed an obstacle for the airships which were accustomed to wide-open vistas and landing two stories above the ground.

To develop a successful mooring mast for the Empire State Building, the designers turned to a concept known as a “saddle,” which was designed to be able to support the tremendous weight of an airship. The mast was then fitted with two sets of reinforced steel cables which were designed to offer support and flexibility as the airship was docked and undocked. 

The Empire State Building’s mooring mast was also designed with the unique needs of airships in mind. These included the need for a secure docking configuration, one that was free from up and
