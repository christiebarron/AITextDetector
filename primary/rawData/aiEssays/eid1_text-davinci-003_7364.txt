In Joe Kurmaski's story, "Rough Road Ahead," the cyclist's experience is heavily affected by the setting. The journey begins on a dirt road with wind and heat that leave both the cyclist and his bike in a miserable state. The long, winding dirt path is portrayed as a challenge in itself to the cyclist, with every mile on the journey adding to the cyclist's difficulty. The wind and heat combine to make the environment oppressive and uncomfortable enough that it affects the cyclist's mindset and his performance.

The setting's inherent dangers further limit the cyclist's abilities; deep potholes and ruts in the road provide an additional hazard to the cyclist's journey. These holes can cause the cyclist to fall, tire out the bike, or require more effort to break around them. The setting's features, combined with the cyclist's inexperience in handling the rough terrain, impede his progress.

The story ends with the cyclist nearing the end of his journey. This is indicative of the setting's affect on him; despite its challenges, the cyclist is able to make it to his destination. However, the cycle alone is near broken and barely able to stay in one piece. The setting cripples the cyclist's progress while also requiring that he push through its challenges, testing his strength and perseverance. Thus, the combination of the setting and the cyclist's own personal journey come together for a unique experience that could only be found in Kurmaski's story.
