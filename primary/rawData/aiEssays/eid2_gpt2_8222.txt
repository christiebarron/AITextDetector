I believe that censorship of materials in libraries or their publication is a violation of the First Amendmentias and an attempt to force library owners to censor books."

For any books or information contained in the library library system, an additionalEarly Warning Sign will appear at the end of the box, or you can send an email to library staff to make the library aware of this warning. The notice then will alert staff of the potential "dangerous to learning materials" they may be exposing, along with an email address and address listing their library's policy.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns about the law or information to which you would like to report to Library mutated, please let us know here. If you are having a question or a commentenger regarding the** policy and guidelines, please contact our staff here.

What are your opinions on books and information being censored?
