The line represents the protagonist's hope and optimism for the future. She has been through a difficult winter, being separated from her family and struggling to learn a language and culture that is different from her own. By ending the story with this line, the protagonist is suggesting that, come spring, things will be different. The snows will melt, the geese will return, and the hibiscus will bud. Similarly, the protagonist will take the test again, perhaps with more confidence and knowledge than before. In this way, the ending of the story implies that the protagonist is ready to move on and that she is open to new experiences and opportunities.
