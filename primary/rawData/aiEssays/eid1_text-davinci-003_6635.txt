Dear Editor,

I'm writing to express my opinion on the effects of computers on people's lives. Computers are an essential part of life in the 21st century and are becoming increasingly important in our day to day lives.

At times, computers can have a very positive effect on people's lives. They can reduce work stress, increase efficiency, and make it easier to stay organized and connected. Computers also give us access to a wealth of information, and can be helpful in the classroom to aid in learning.

However, there are also some negative effects of computers as well. People can become overly dependent on computers, and too much screen time is linked to a number of health issues. The rapid advancement of technology can also lead to job displacement and a widening income inequality gap.

It is important to recognize both the positive and negative of our technological advancements. We must find a balance between taking advantage of the benefits of computers and technology, while also making conscious efforts to limit negative impacts.

I hope that my readers take into account both the positive and negative effects of computers and technology, and use them responsibly.

Sincerely,
 
[Your Name]
