The narrator of the poem is expressing the belief that whatever challenge or struggle they are facing, they are able to overcome it. They are hopeful that once the winter is over and the hibiscus blooms again, they will be in a better position to take the test again. The narrator does not specify what the test is, but their belief in their ability to eventually face and pass it inspires them to end the poem on a positive note.
