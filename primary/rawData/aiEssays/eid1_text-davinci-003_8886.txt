At the time of writing, I'm actively trying to learn Spanish. But I'm by no means an expert yet and I often find myself making embarrassingly silly mistakes. A couple of weeks ago, while my partner and I were at a café with some Spanish friends, I accidentally mispronounced something which made them burst into laughter. 

Although the mispronunciation had been mortifyingly embarrassing to me, I had to laugh along with them good-naturedly because I could see how amused they were. Before long it felt like the whole café was filled with our musically jovial laughter.

Rather than feeling like a spectacle, I instead laughed with my Spanish friends, exchanging silly anecdotes from my own language experience and feeling supported in my attempt to learn the language. In the end, we all became even better friends from it and I even felt more comfortable with speaking Spanish in their presence. From then on, every time I started to feel embarrassed for making a mistake, we would all just burst into laughter - a much better alternative than sulking in shame. 

For me, laughter has been the shortest distance between two people, and that evening spent laughing was definitely one to remember.
