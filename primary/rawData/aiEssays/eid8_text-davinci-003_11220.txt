"I remember it like it was yesterday. I was sitting on the couch with my girl of six months, and we were having a pretty intense conversation. We had been talking about our plans for the future together when we both got a little bit overwhelmed. All of a sudden, I started laughing. She looked at me, surprised, and then she started to laugh, too. 

It wasn't a polite little chuckle, either. We cackled and laughed until our sides hurt and tears rolled down our faces. People say laughter is the best medicine, and it sure felt that way in that moment. Laughter released all the tension and stress we were feeling and brought us together. 

In fact, we went from talking about our future to talking about our favorite cartoons and comedies in the blink of an eye. We made jokes and shared memories until the night was through, and I felt so lucky to have found someone who could make me laugh like that. 

At the end of the night, we shared a quiet moment, and both of us felt like whatever we had been going through before was left behind. In that one moment, we had lifted our fears and shared a pure connection that could only be made through laughter."
