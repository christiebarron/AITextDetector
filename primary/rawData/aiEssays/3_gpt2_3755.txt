Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

A new model of the route is being proposed to be developed at the City of Melbourne, which looks at the design and planning for roads in the city.

The plan is to use existing construction techniques to develop, from a public access level to street-level, an extra 50km of road, as part of a plan that is not intended to affect cycling in the city.

The council is hoping people will be able to use more cycling lanes and allow them to access a range of spaces.

It won't need to be a 'green route' - instead, an area protected from congestion by bike parking and a few new areas, like streets, that would benefit from increased cycling traffic.

The route is the first to be developed on Sydney's west coast.

It would have some of the same benefits as the Greenpath route in Sydney's south because it would create the capacity to cycle more efficiently, allowing local residents to use the network to access more spaces, instead of the city's congestion.

It's the first of its kind in Melbourne, so the Council will try to figure out how the new route could be used.

A spokeswoman for The Cycling Council said: "The council is looking for a better way to create cycling pathways, more accessible places to explore, greater variety of modes for public transport, more pedestrian and bicycle use,
