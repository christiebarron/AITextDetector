One time I experienced laughter in my life was when a girl in my family was very embarrassed by us, but when someone said something like, "There's a good thing you should have done because she was a whore," I felt very ashamed of myself. All of a sudden I felt like my body needed to be touched, and I knew that there needed to be a new person. Even when people were talking about my new character, they talked about how I am a slut, and I felt my body needed a new person. Not only do I think it is not just bad behavior, but it is just not acceptable. Even I know I should have changed that behavior, and I needed to change my morals, so I am really grateful for what I did on 'Slam'.


What do you think of "The Vagina Project"? Can you provide additional examples to provide a context to the story?

Hahahaha thanks for talking to me! I want to really help it with something in my life so I can have a voice and tell a new story. If you would like to contact me by email or text, it would be appreciated! Your time is only limited.
