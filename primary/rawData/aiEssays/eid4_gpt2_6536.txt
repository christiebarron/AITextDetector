The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it goes beyond the notion that something has fallen off a cliff. In fact, it's quite possibly the most beautiful book written about spring yet. "It feels like a new season starting," says Steven Corman, who published and edited the book, and is now at Yale School of Art. "We are building on the love of the book and not just on the original concept of the book. Winter Hibiscus isn't a new book, it was never written without the original outline, but we have been doing it a lot since the end of [the second] season, and that is part of the story."

Corman's approach — and what the books are saying in a way that he didn't expect — was to capture a moment of insight; what he calls "the old summer season," which saw us fall from grace. You can read about that here.

The series is the story of three adults, all struggling together against the elements at one time or another, and all of them have trouble finding something they love, but ultimately become loyal to each other at this point. Winter Hibiscus will be the first story about that kind of love and commitment as it takes shape around us.
