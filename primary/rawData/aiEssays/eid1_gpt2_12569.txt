Computers have many effects on people. They increase our ability to communicate faster and more efficiently, and our brains are capable of communicating more rapidly and more efficiently, because they increase the amount of information that we receive, and our brain stores that information. When you have the ability to build computers to do these things better, it will be almost like you can create an airplane with the information that you had when you invented them. That's the kind of technology that's going to revolutionize the way we work."

On the impact of AI in the workplace

Cortana has noticed that many of her students have been struggling to figure out why AI is so prevalent so rapidlyâ€”that is, how it's affecting their jobs. "They often don't have a lot of tools to help them, and there's a lot of problems, but as they get more jungly in their job search, they'll get more problems," she says.

In order to make that happen the students have to be willing to deal with AI. "Cortana says, 'This is a big problem, but you can't really control it without the data coming out, and the software's too complex and complex to learn from. You can't use it as a kind of tool; you need to figure out something, like building a computer.' But that's hard to do, because it's so complex that it cannot be used just 'as a tool for debugging,' " she says.
