The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is also to show his "very good sense of humour", said the author."While the lyrics speak for itself, he's also very funny. He writes quite well from the opening verse."

"I have never written a book that is so entertaining, yet so written. I do understand why you guys may dislike it, but at least there's more in the book," he added.

Speaking to a BBC Panorama reporter last night, Smith said: "I never thought I'd write for anyone but myself."

Smith, who is studying literature at the University of Southern Ireland, is famous for his work with the classic folklorists Lillith and his first novel: "Sketch," published in the 1940s as The Children's Book, and published by Bantam Books Ltd.
