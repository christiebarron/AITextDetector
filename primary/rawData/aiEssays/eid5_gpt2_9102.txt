The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' was far from simple. Some of the people on stage were members of the National Security Council and, during one visit to the New York venue it was claimed that Barack Obama was invited to a small, private reception and "promise". Others were, according to the memoir, guests at a breakfast and lunch with the president.

On the road to "From Home", an autobiographical book, a spokesman said: "The truth is that we have no connection to any of the stories in this book.

"We had a meeting where (George W.) Bush and I discussed issues of defence and the war in Iraq with Mr Bush, his brother Jeb and two of our former allies, with Mr McCain, a friend of former President Obama, we were given the keys, they were taken from us.

"I got a little bit angry when we decided to go, it's a real shame. That it took an arm's grin from a man I know missionaries, to even say that there is someone at home with a history of wanting to destroy the US government in the name of preserving peace."
