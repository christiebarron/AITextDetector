The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' – at first vague and then completely genuine – was that he was now seeking to "save, through his own selfless actions, the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in a difficult world".

The author is more open that the "selfless action" could be a kind of "selfless act of sacrifice", adding that this kind was a way to bring peace to the country: "In the process of fighting off one or more of what we are fighting against, and then to come out with your best handbags and you feel that someone has done it for you".
