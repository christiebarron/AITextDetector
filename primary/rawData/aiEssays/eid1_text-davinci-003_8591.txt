I remember the time I was on a long flight overseas. Our plane was delayed for hours, and I was surrounded by disgruntled passengers who were all complaining about the wait. Everyone was getting agitated, but I decided to stay cool and keep my spirits up. I joked around with the passengers around me and tried to stay positive. I knew that getting angry wasn’t going to do anything but make the situation worse. 

In the end, the pilot announced our plane was ready to go and I was ready to get to my destination. I was relieved, and so were the other passengers around me. We all had a laugh and it felt like the wait wasn’t so bad after all. Being patient paid off, and I managed to keep my cool throughout the entire experience.
