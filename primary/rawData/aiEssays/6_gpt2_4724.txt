The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. For many years, there was still talk of putting an unmanned drone on the building to help reduce the amount of debris that would remain after the crane collapsed.

"All of a sudden a drone-like thing could hit the ceiling and block up all the materials for making a really great work of the Empire State," said Andrew E. Tullio, a contractor who is based in Portland, Ore. As a result, a number of engineers in both states had been struggling to figure out how to use the unmanned technology that would be so difficult to use using commercial unmanned vehicles.

And those discussions were quickly derailed by the demise of a major development project in California that involved a self-parking drone. That project was abandoned when the Los Angeles Times reported that the California Department of Transportation had declined to issue a permit for a drone to remove debris from a major highway.
