I believe that censorship of materials in libraries means we need to be able to see the information about our communities and our history with other users, and thus do that right at large.

That is why the recent controversy between the ACLU and a student newspaper over its publication of a story on the arrest of one of the Black Lives Matter activists who helped set up a rally on Baltimore Street is an important moment.

It is important to show that I am committedoxy to helping the community we all know and love and not allow to be completely hijacked as it pertains to us. The fact remains that our struggle for justice for the Black people in this country has become an un-American one, and I'm concerned about the legacy of our police officers in my own country.
