Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. The road is narrow and wide for cyclists. The terrain is very flat, especially as the route changes and there are steep slopes, so the rider might find it difficult to balance a strong climb. But in a low-traffic zone, it would become easier for the rider to manage the steep terrain. It's important to know that 'Rough Road Ahead' does not guarantee a stable, stable ride-up. If a situation exists, it may not allow the rider to safely take the road when the road is narrow and/or has narrow corners.

The "Rough Road Ahead" has few advantages. There are some small road features that make riding the road a little better. For example, the bike's seat may allow the rider to sit and stand in a flat or angled position while at road speeds. If the rider holds the seat long enough, the seat will allow a smoother ride on the bike. However, if the rider moves rapidly, he or she may put his or her way in front of another person but need to control the speed he or she is going. The difference between a "Rough Road Ahead" and a "normal driving situation" is often a little less than zero: it is likely that a road user's ability to maintain a level riding position will be compromised if the rider is too tall and, therefore, will fail to engage in reasonable self-control
