Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. It is evident that computers have become an essential part of our lives in the 21st century. They provide us with a convenient way to access information, communicate with people from around the world, and entertain ourselves in our spare time. However, they also have the potential to cause problems for some people and can, in some cases, have a negative impact on our lives.

Recent research has shown that people who are exposed to too much computer use are more likely to suffer from health issues such as poor eyesight, neck and back pain, and high levels of stress. Additionally, people who spend too much time on their computers can also experience social isolation and depression. This is because they become so immersed in their virtual life that they forget about their real life and become disconnected from the people around them.

Therefore, it is important for us to take measures to reduce the negative effects of computer usage. We should strive to find a healthy balance between using our computers and engaging in physical activities and spending time with our friends and family. Moreover, we should be mindful of the amount of time that we spend in front of the screen,
