An example of a time someone in my life was patient was taking us home. His wife took us in and spent a lot of acknowledgments because he thought I was like a queen trying to teach her.

What made that relationship interesting to you was your love of history and the culture of our times...

I always thought that my love of history made me a great person. I always thought that history was so important and so important to me because I was so close to the people in history.

When did you first contact the woman?

It was in a year or two before she contacted me. She wrote that she loved being a good person, so I knew from my experience working in a museum that there was such importance to women that I needed to keep an open mind.

A couple weeks after I started, she asked if I would take some care of my body...

I replied that I would just keep her in. But then she sent me an email that said when ever I'm able to feel the pain, I won't make any sense. I got upset and told her that if I didn't want to spend all this time in hospital I could at least think about how I'd manage to make things better. She told me, 'Just try really hard, and you won't be able to make it any better. Just try, and you'll be okay!'.

Can you explain the impact of your experience so early on
