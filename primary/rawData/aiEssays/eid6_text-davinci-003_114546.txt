When the Empire State Building was being built in the 1930s, one of its most anticipated features was the ability for dirigibles to dock at the top. Despite the enthusiasm by the public, the project was ridden with numerous obstacles that needed to be overcome to make this feat a reality. 

One of the main issues was the lack of a suitable structure to safely anchor the dirigibles. Though the roof of the building was intended to be used as the docking platform, its construction had not taken into consideration potential effects of strong winds. This was shown to be a critical issue since dirigibles were extremely vulnerable to any sudden gusts of wind and could cause serious damages if their tethers were to suddenly snap. To combat this, an apparatus known as the Mooring Mast needed to be designed and installed. This structure had mounted poles near the center of the roof that could securely latch onto the ship's mooring lines. 

But even with the mast in place, other problems remained. For one, the mooring lines needed to be strong enough to support the weight of the dirigible without breaking. This proved to be an immense challenge, as measurements had to be taken into account regarding the tension between the mooring line and the mast, while also calculating the stresses incurred by the movements of the dirigible. Due to this, the architects were forced to design a special cable that would be able to hold the ship while also not being too brittle
