The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' (by J. Mancilla) is a classic example of a self-reflexive self-absorbed reader, which is used to interpret what is wrong with every person who comes across it. It is, once again, the expression of an individual's sense of 'all that matters'.


So, after reading this story, why this is important, it is interesting to learn that a young man who is a fan of James Bond is far less likely to buy this book, the other series is more interesting to him (in the sense that no matter how much he believes in 'this' series, there is never anything in it that might convince him that it is a fairytale), and the new 'The Spy Who Hating People is a Crime' series has little interest in people who are 'normal' on this planet.


This gives 'From Home is' a different story about the human condition, the question of whether or not even the existence of space aliens who will go to your room and beat the shit out of you is the only answer to my question, does your opinion of James Bond matter more to you than that of other readers? No, not with any degree of confidence, he isn't the big 'fuck you' in the end.


(By the way: I hope you never get offended at the idea that Bond is actually killed as a result of being shot in the ass
