It was a sunny day and my friend Marc and I had gone out for lunch. We had just finished eating and started talking when I noticed something funny. I had accidentally ended a sentence with the same phrase that Marc had begun his sentence with. 

We both burst out laughing at the coincidental wording and for the next few minutes it was hard to move the conversation forward without one of us dissolving into more laughter. The silly coincidence seemed to bring us just that much closer together. 

Even though there wasn't anything particularly funny going on around us, it was amazing how easy it was to access laughter â€“ together. That shared laughter definitely strengthened the friendship.
