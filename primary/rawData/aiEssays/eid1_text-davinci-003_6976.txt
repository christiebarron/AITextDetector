When discussing library censorship, it is important to recognize that there is a vast difference between removing content that is potentially offensive and blocking access to it for everyone. Libraries strive to provide access to all viewpoints and opinions, and this does not necessarily have to include exposing patrons to content they find offensive. 

At the same time, libraries have a responsibility to their community to ensure the materials available align with the values they uphold. This means that any content which is deemed to conflict with the library’s values should be evaluated and a decision made as to whether or not it should be made available. This evaluation needs to take into account both the library’s values as well as the community’s opinion and can be done in a respectful manner. 

When certain materials are found to be potentially offensive, there needs to be a discussion as to how to handle them. While some may argue for their complete removal, this is a decision not to be taken lightly as it does limit the availability of information. A more reasonable approach may be to place them in a restricted area of the library. This allows the library to be inclusive of all sorts of information without compromising the values it upholds.

Ultimately, libraries play a central role in allowing people access to all sorts of knowledge and information and this is something that should be taken seriously. When censorship is discussed in the context of libraries, it should be handled delicately and with the community’s values in mind
