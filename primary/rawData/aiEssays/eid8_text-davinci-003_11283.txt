I remember the first time I met my future husband. We had been talking online for months, but had never had the chance to meet in person. Finally, the day arrived, and we had our first date in a coffee shop. 

When I first saw him walk in, I was smitten. We ordered our drinks, and the conversation came easy. After a few minutes, I told him a funny story from my childhood. I was expecting him to at least smile, but instead he burst out laughing. Before I knew it, we were both in hysterics, laughing over silly things and catching our breath. 

That was the moment I knew that he was the one. The moment the laughter struck us I knew that this was genuine connection, something I’d been searching for. 

Years later, the laughter has continued to bring us closer each day. As time passes, it feels as if we return to that coffee shop, and can find again the spark that lit the fire between us. 

Laughter bonds us quicker than anything else. It’s the simplest way to communicate how much we care for one another, and it always brings us closer together. I’m so blessed to have someone in my life that I can share in the laughter, and it’s a reminder of how far we’ve come.
