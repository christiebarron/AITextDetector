Computers have many effects on people. Whether this is through sheer numbers or if we are trying to understand humanity's natural behaviors through data alone we have two very powerful ways to do so.

Research conducted at the University of Bristol and the University of Cambridge can lead to a number of new methods for solving the problem of genetic variance. These techniques enable scientists to predict a person's future, and to know whether they will continue to have children when their present condition is removed.

Now, a team of researchers at the University of Cambridge and at Tel Aviv University have been successful using DNA sequencing to identify two potential causes of genetic instability. They found that people who had a history of abnormal genetic variance exhibited less changes that are thought to be linked with health.

The new findings provide new insight into the mechanism behind the recent increase in the prevalence of high prevalence, as well as the role of genetics in health.

Dr. Adam A. Miller, a specialist in human genetics and molecular genetics at the University of Bristol's College of Biomedical Research and his group conducted the first study using DNA sequencing of human genomes, which were collected in late 1995.

"We find that people who are already at high prevalence have a higher frequency of abnormal genetic variation in later life," explained Dr. Miller. "This increase in genetic variability could have an important impact on people's health."
