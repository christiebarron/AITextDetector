Dear [Editor],

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have had on people throughout the years. Having been around for decades, computers have drastically changed and advanced how people share and consume information.

From online education to online budgeting, computers provide the tools to make learning and completing tasks more convenient and accessible. Students can attend virtual classes to obtain their education, and stay-at-home parents can use budgetary software to manage their resources. Computers also help to unify people by allowing for conversations over the internet with loved ones, friends, and colleagues.

Some may argue that computers can be a distraction or a threat to our safety, but I believe the good far outweighs the bad. Children can use the internet safely with the implementation of parental controls, and computer devices have safeguards and encryption to protect our personal data.

In conclusion, computers have allowed us to have access to a wealth of information, and it has also brought us closer together. I hope that readers will recognize the positive sides of computers instead of the negatives, and use computers to their advantage.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
