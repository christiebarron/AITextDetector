The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because of the amazing new chapters, and it makes for a really enjoyable read if you are reading it over 4-5 times (and you can't get this book before this one, so please read it one more time too), but be warned! It's a scary novel, and it would be hard to ignore any author's lack of expertise to read it, especially not for a person who already has an extensive pre-Cersei background. I don't even know what a great idea it is, but after reading it, I didn't mind that much, and I'll be getting a look at it. Also, I wish some of her past works could be linked back to it, as this is an ongoing project and I still don't know the full story, so I can't say that it really is tied down to the book at hand.
There are a few chapters that are more into the story than the whole story of Winter, which I love. I also enjoy those few chapters about a dragon whose actions are described in words by the author, which I really enjoyed, but these do make up for the small amount of dialogue, which I think may lead readers towards a story of more than one Dragon. I like that they use a little bit of the background for what happens as opposed to some of the more generic "stories" and descriptions of events, as opposed to just going after the events, and I hope
