Computers have many effects on people. The biggest ones are the ones that control them as they grow up, and most of them affect the way the minds develop.

So, if you can create something like a computer using words from our past and write one of your own, then you could use it and not lose an entire decade of intellectual labor. The idea is that I could create a computer that is written in words and not be a computer anymore. What would you do then? How would you explain it to someone who used to be a hard-core computer operator and has learned to build those computers. He could also learn to read computer books, and write the same letter, which would probably save his entire life. And he could learn to talk a lot of new languages, which would make him able to work at any computer and have a ton of fun. There's nothing wrong with this. But if I want to have many computers with one word written, would I really want to make them all a single system? Not at all.

It would just be a few hundred computers but a huge number of human brains working together and trying to communicate with each other.
