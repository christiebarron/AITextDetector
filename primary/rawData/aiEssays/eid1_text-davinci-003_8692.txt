I remember it like it was yesterday. My best friend had just broken up with his longtime girlfriend and was feeling pretty down. So I decided to take him out to grab a bite to eat and a few rounds of drinks to cheer him up.

We were just having a casual conversation over dinner when something he said made me chuckle. Then as if it was contagious, he started to laugh too! We were both laughing so hard that the other customers in the restaurant started to turn and look. 

Eventually, the laughter passed but the feeling of joy and kinship remained. In that moment, we both realized that we could still be friends despite the breakup, that we could still rely on each other. That feeling of joy and connection was unforgettable and we still talk about it to this day.
