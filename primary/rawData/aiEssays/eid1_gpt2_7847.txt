Computers have many effects on people. A study by Yale researchers found that young Americans who read have greater emotional distress for reading when stressed than older generations of white Americans whose grandparents read and said they were "faster in reading" and who have longer lives, compared to white non-Americans, are more likely to have depression. And the relationship between high academic achievement and depression is also stronger among blacks, who are more likely than whites to report it, compared to white non-Hispanic blacks.

All this is good news for the American public. Even to those who have read a lot about depression, the studies have been generally negative because they show little or no relationship. And research shows that it can happen. The Centers for Disease Control has put more money into prevention programs against depression than you'd expect to find the CDC's own figures.

But the best advice we can give is to look for ways to help people who aren't having any good things to do (see How to make people like you less depressing). That, of course, may not be a cure, but it has probably helped some people who are not having the things we want to accomplish.
