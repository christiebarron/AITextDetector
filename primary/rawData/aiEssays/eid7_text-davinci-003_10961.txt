I recently ran into a situation where I had to practice being patient. I had noticed my mailbox at my apartment building had been damaged and had been like that for some time now. After weeks of waiting, I decided to call the property manager to see if they could take a look at it and get it fixed. 

The property manager was quite busy. I was asked if I could wait a few days before they looked at it. I was a bit frustration, but I knew I couldn't rush them; instead of getting angry, I remained polite and told them I would wait. 

A week later, I got a call from the property manager telling me they were ready to look at it. They explained that they were very busy and therefore the mailbox couldn't be fixed immediately. I was understanding and told them I understood. 

Finally, a few days later the property manager came and fixed up my mailbox. I was very happy and grateful that it was finally fixed. This experience taught me that being patient can pay off in the end. It showed me that sometimes you have to be patient and wait before being able to get something done.
