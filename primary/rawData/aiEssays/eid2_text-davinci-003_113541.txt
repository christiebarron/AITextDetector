As libraries continue to face censorship head-on, it is important that we look at the issue from a realistic perspective. Despite many librarians’ attempts to limit opposition, upholding the right of patrons to access extraneous materials is the most important priority. 

It is true that some works, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, can be seen as offensive to some people or groups of people. But censoring these materials based on the subjective agreement of any particular group goes against the basic principles of inclusivity which our libraries champion. More broadly, censoring certain materials can be seen as an effort to suppress the exchange of ideas and valuable knowledge. It is essential that librarians make the effort to protect patrons’ freedom of access and not impose predetermined boundaries of what can or cannot be read, heard, or seen. 

It may be argued that libraries are in part responsible for preserving the cultural values of a given society, though it should not be their primary objective. While libraries should by no means be compelled to carry materials if they are inappropriate for public consumption, it is essential that they avoid labeling materials according to their own personal or moral values. 

Instead, libraries should provide patrons with information about the works in question as well as the responsible use of those works. This allows for an open discussion of topics and opinions rather than a complete removal of certain materials from their shelves. Libraries should be a place of learning and exploration
