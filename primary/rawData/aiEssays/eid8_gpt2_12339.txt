One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I woke up in the morning and heard voices talking in my head. I was scared when I woke up at 4 to 5 in the morning and found these little creatures that wanted to fight me. I said 'what's yours?' They said 'I get them for free on the street but they say they are 'out of the blue'. Now the only one who knows what to get for free is me who didn't grow up in rural France."

Dylan McEnany, 32, of Oxford, a student at New College Paris in France, was a co-leader of a charity which gave away free gifts under the Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Unported licence. He was arrested on October 14 for using an e-mail password, according to reports by Reuters.

Other co-hostesses and guests of the group said the same.

The incident reportedly happened before Christmas and was part of a popular trend for free music on French social media. A few years ago a groupRequirements member and musician, Alana Beaumont-Lopez, was found shot dead of her husband in a public place, a second husband, Daniel Novell, and their 5-month-old daughter, Nora, was shot and killed by the attackers.

But there have been much more interesting allegations of 'unco-operation' at the festival, which is still going on.
