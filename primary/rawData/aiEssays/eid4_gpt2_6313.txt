The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it begins with an anecdote about a fellow traveler, his friend and father-in-law from the south-east who is a part of a group with the intent of trying to win a job in America. In the book the pair are a group formed when Mr. Pippin was murdered. The group consists of six small men with a single purpose, all of whom are a part of the group of people living around these parts. One man is a farmer, the other is a bus driver, and the next is a journalist. One man wants to write about the fate of an old man who was killed in the field. Mr. Pippin's friend is an Englishman from south Florida and a man with the aim of obtaining money from a farmer in Louisiana; he is determined to find them. One of the men, who believes to be an English woman, takes Ms. Pippin's information. He is shocked because he says he has no idea if he had not spoken to a woman before. He tells her that he has asked her and that his wife is already there when he goes out. He meets up with Mrs. Pippin and gives her the name of that TILE of the day. At the same time he has come from the west and knows that he has a job to do and wants to meet her. Mrs. Pippin says she knows Mr. T. T. P.
