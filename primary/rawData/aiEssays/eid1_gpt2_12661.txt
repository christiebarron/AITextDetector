Computers have many effects on people. They help to control our brain, reduce aggression, build our capacity to cope more efficiently and to cope when the environment demands it. Computers have also influenced, or enabled us, to act independently of one another and to be more adaptive. In the long term this has led to an increase in the cognitive demands of humans and the consequent increase in the potential for human behaviours. We have observed that, due to the effects of this technology, we perform more complex behaviours, with fewer consequences for the group. Our results suggest that a more complex environment may well contribute to the development of the human brain. It was also found that a more complex environment may benefit individuals. We are now trying to answer one of our questions â€“ how important is the more complex one?

What would you say about the implications of this finding on cognitive neuroscience?

The question remains important but now we want to see how complex, the more complex one, may change our behaviours. This study adds a new dimension to our understanding of human behaviour. As people enter different cultures, we tend to focus on cultural interactions and on the complex way in which they are expressed or how people interact, not so much with the environment in which we live. The more complex our environment, the greater the changes people make and the longer the time in between, and the longer we haveaptic capacity to generate our behaviours. This means that when we think about interacting with others, we often get
