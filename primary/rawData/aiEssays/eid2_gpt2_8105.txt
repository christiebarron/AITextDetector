I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a violation of the First Amendment because for one, the material is critical, and one has the right to a free and fair exchange of ideas," Schuchat said.

In the case of the "Judeo-Christian" books, Schuchat said the publisher offered $100,000 to hold up the books and if anyone found them, he said he could sue. But, he said, the publisher chose to keep the books and offered them at the same price for a few years, a claim the city eventually settled out of court.

City of Rochester spokesman Paul Schuyler said there were two legal issues.

"We believe in the First Amendment. That the right is not being restricted," Schuyler said.

When asked if he would support a $100,000 settlement with the city, Schuyler said no, with no comment.

Briefings on court papers in the case were also not available.

Judeo-Christian publisher Robert Lewis is facing three counts of disorderly conduct in connection to claims against him for giving the materials to a local library.
