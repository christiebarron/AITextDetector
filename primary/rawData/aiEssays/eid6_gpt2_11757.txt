From the beginning of the 20th century, space began to enter public consciousness when the United States became the first country in the developed world to allow dirigibles. A major hurdle for new spaces to allow an autonomous approach was the lack of clear regulation.

An early and notable example of the benefits of a flying vehicle was the Boeing 757. It could have been built in many ways and it could have flown in multiple ways; it could have been launched by the fighter planes of World War I at high speed, or0100 miles per hour over distant landings at sea. Both have to be done. In a single flying vehicle, that was already a relatively small feat.

But not with a flying vehicle. Like the airplane's engines. Pilots typically operate two engines every 3 to 4 seconds as the airplane moves off course to land. The main thrust that the airplane uses at cruising speed and acceleration is the speed of sound. All of this power comes from propellers.
