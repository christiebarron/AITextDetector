The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho serves both as an optimistic look forward and a reminder: Life is resilient and the cycle of birth and death is ever-continuing. The story is about a hardworking immigrant student who works to pass a difficult science test. Although she does not pass the test, she is still hopeful and determined as she acknowledges that there is always the possibility of trying again. The ending of the story suggests this potential for a second chance, a time 'when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding', or when more life flourishes in the spring. It is ultimately a hopeful reminder that new, fresh beginnings will come, no matter the outcome.
