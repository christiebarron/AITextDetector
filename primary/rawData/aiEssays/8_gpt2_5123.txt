One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my son was just 1 years old. It was from him that I learned this has to be a real gift that will last a lifetime and be one of the most important moments ever. He used to say it in my childhood that when we're playing the guitar he would whisper something to me all the time. I can still hear it. It was like a blessing. My son even made a recording on it. He would write a song and play me that song just when he was a child. It would grow with me, never slowing down. Sometimes I really wanted to hear it in order to feel it in his brain. We would go to a local concert a few years, see some of these kids playing. He would say that he would try something different to learn. Sometimes it didn't feel right. Sometimes it was just wrong, so Ithread it so that it kept being correct and not in my head. Because I can't help myself with this, I just try to ignore it. And sometimes, there will be little clues where I might have missed it.

Is this a personal experience or a work product?

You can listen to the whole album at no charge, however this album offers a sense of the life being lived by one human being. For that reason I think it stands out for where it came from that has to do with how you approach your work.

It's not about that.
