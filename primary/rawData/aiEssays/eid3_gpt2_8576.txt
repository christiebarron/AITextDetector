Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. But not surprisingly, it's one of those things that should probably only ever be done on bicycles (if it is possible; you wouldn't know that from a glance).

The new bike-only mode, introduced for the upcoming season (and which will be available next year) can be easily skipped if you are trying just to get on a racebike. Or if you find yourself running into a cyclist with a bike that doesn't want to ride it but still goes out, then you can go through the entire series of 'Rough Road Ahead'. If you don't get on that bike, or if you decide to ride on a racebike, then it'll probably be harder on you than it would be on ordinary touring bikes like the F1 MotoGP bike.

And, of course, it also costs money. The best way to ensure you don't ride on a racebike is to buy a second-hand 'Rough Road Ahead' bike (we're in for a surprise if you've got one already). So if you're looking for a great way to run on a bike (even if it is not fully formed), use this page to get it in.

Some more information on the bike-only mode.

As before, the bike-only mode is a slightly different type of mode than the full-fledged 'Rough Road Ahead' mode.
