I was out with my close friends the other day and we headed to a local restaurant. It was a laid-back kind of setting and we settled in for a spot of lunch and conversation. As the meal progressed, we started talking about our childhood memories and soon enough, the conversation had become uproarious.

I remembered the things we used to do, like hide away and play pranks on each other, and pretty soon, we were all in stiches as we recounted our mischievous adventures.

The conversation was so intense, the waitresses started to join in, and before long we were all laughing so hard that tears were streaming down our faces.

It was one of the best feelings I've ever experienced; it felt like we were all soulmates, bonded together in a moment of contagious joy.

Laughter is so powerful, so powerful and so transformative. It can travel between people like nothing else can, and it's definitely a magical thing. Without it, I don't think our friendship would be as strong as it is.
