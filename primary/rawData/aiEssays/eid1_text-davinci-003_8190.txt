The “Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted provides a vivid reminder of the attempts of the engineers of the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock during the early 1930s. Before the first flights of airships, the idea of incorporating a mooring mast into the Empire State Building design was seen as an ambitious feat of engineering. Nevertheless, the ambitious engineers persevered and were met with a variety of obstacles in their efforts to create a comfortable docking space for dirigibles. 

The first challenge that engineers faced was the tight turn that both the dirigible and the mooring mast had to facilitate. In order for an airship to turn and dock properly, the mooring mast had to be capable of turning as well. This created a precarious situation in which the mooring mast was not securely connected, and was thus prone to sudden jerking movements during the docking process. As a result, engineers had to develop a means to enable the mast to withstand the pull of the dirigible. This was eventually accomplished by evolving the mooring mast to a series of retractable arms that, when extended, created a cushioning effect as the airship got closer.

The engineers also had to find a way to anchor the dirigible securely. Since there was always a risk of the airship being tugged by strong winds, the engineers had to come up with a strong and secure anchoring system
