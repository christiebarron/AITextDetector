The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. During the Second World War, the Navy, which had been worried about losing its supply of dirigibles to Germany, began using a laser device known as "The Star-Spangled Banner," which allowed for use by warships and aircraft, but that the craft was only launched under official supervision. Despite this, in 1935, the Army Ordnance Corps began testing some lasers equipped with the Star-Spangled Banner.

However, soon after the Second World War with the United States in the war against Nazi Germany, it became clear that if a laser was to be used for making a dirigible, it had to be controlled by a specially trained pilot. While the design team at the Royal Military College in Cambridge had spent years constructing and designing the first lasers used by the Royal Aircraft Establishment on the Continent, that particular laser required much more time and money. By 1940, this proved not to be the case with the aircraft's first and only laser, the Laser-X. The Navy took its first laser prototype in 1940, called the Laser-X-17, and designed a laser that could be used by aircraft to fly low over the aircraft and not hit objects with the craft's main propeller. But with a crew of more than 50 men in 1938, the Laser-X-17 was unable to deliver this capability. Ultimately, the Naval Research Laboratory, one of the main sources of Laser-
