The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They often had to make big changes to the design or even lose the option of turning off the built-in mode to play the game.

The Imperial buildings were relatively small at one time and were generally made of marble. Eventually, the building itself was completely covered with marble, but more than an inch of it was still needed. This left little room for an engine to run.

This was the first major decision that led to the collapse of the Empire State Building: the design of the original Empire State building was based upon the structure's layout after the Great War. In many ways, it is a representation of the final plan.

However, with the collapse of the Empire State Building, more of the original plan had fallen apart. Even though the Empire State Building had a huge building covered with marble and its roof was covered with marble, it still had relatively small portions of the Empire State building. In the early years of building, the Empire State Building did not look very attractive in some cases.
