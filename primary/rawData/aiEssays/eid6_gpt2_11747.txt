The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

"We are looking to do it all right but we also have to deal with other parts of the city," said George Washington, then President Bill Clinton's first secretary of state; today he told Congress in an announcement of construction at the end of the year that the Empire State Building would not be built unless Congress approved a similar authorization. "Anywhere that the people of Rhode Island have no other choice is a catastrophe for us."

But when the state legislature passed the first bill on Sept. 22, the State Department sent a letter to the state in December that outlined the state's plans to put dirigibles into play. In it, it cited transportation improvements the company wanted, including a subway that could divert traffic through the Empire State Building. It also said that government officials needed to go back to work on building a bridge. So in September, Obama signed into law two provisions related to building dirigibles.

On Dec. 9, Obama said the Empire State Building should be built after the completion of the Interstate 94 bridge on Interstate 5. In November, he created a special task force to look into building the subway and other rail corridors with a group that had worked to create a more efficient way to operate the bridge and could move its passengers in to the city by mid-September or early 2014.

The project would be financed as much as $821 million,
