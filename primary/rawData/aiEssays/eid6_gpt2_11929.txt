The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One was a prohibition against public displays of the word "government," as they were meant to be placed in the center of the building and not anywhere within 20 feet of it. The second was an act to cut off the government's commercial operation to build airplanes. There were problems with the way the government operated in the war and it was up to the builders to address them (and the builders did, since they were well aware that the war had taken place within 20 miles of the city center and they had built an airliner there to stop it). This was probably a good idea, given that the two big commercial airliners had been launched in September.

The third obstacle was to allow all commercial and passenger planes onto the building. While it was a big idea, it did seem like a little too dangerous to the existing buildings. The first part of the construction was to allow pilots to fly between the two main landing pads at about the same time as the building was built, making it virtually impossible for any pilots to start an airplane, because by then they would have been going faster and faster between landing pads. But the designers decided against it because of the airbag's effect, which reduced the flight time because of what was supposed to be a high rise. The two building pads came together and when the designers finally realized it had to be placed where things would be at this point, they were too close
