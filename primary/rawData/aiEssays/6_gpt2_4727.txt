The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They required them to put a roof over the windows. While these had limitations, they also had drawbacks. The roof often caused traffic jam and increased accidents, and could also have been dangerous.

In an attempt to ensure this, the Empire State Building's two steel cottages were built in 1918, and were originally used for an exhibition on metal work at the National Gallery. They were to include a steel railing that was to be mounted on the exterior of the cottages, along with a horizontal platform, at a height of 40 feet in 1918. But they were not built for the exhibition.

According to the American Iron Works' inspector general, the concrete was never required to build the cottages.

But those working on the original steel cottages were forced to pay extra for the installation of the new steel cottages, at the bidding of local builders in the early 1920s.

In 1942, the World War II German government allowed steel cottages designed to house more vehicles to be shipped from the city of Aachen, Germany, even though that city was not under the control of the Reich. (See Empire State Building for a detailed description of this issue). By 1942, after a second strike by the workers, the New York City government decided to allow steel cottages designed to house more vehicles to be shipped from Aachen.
