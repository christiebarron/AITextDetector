When I was in high school, I was assigned a group project that was due in three weeks. The project required each of us to take on a specific task, and the project would require a lot of collaboration. Being the leader of the project, I was the one who organized our meetings and set deadlines for everyone.

The first two weeks of the project went relatively smoothly and the majority of our work was complete. However, as the deadline approached, one of my group members was falling behind. Although the other members of the group were getting frustrated and eager to move on, I remained patient.

I sat down with the group member, listened attentively to any issues he was facing, and brainstormed possible solutions with him. I helped him manage his workload better and gave him words of encouragement. This strategy allowed him to finish his task in time and complete the project.

The experience taught me that as a leader, it is important to remain patient with others.
