I felt like the room was spinning, and I was trying to find a way out of my awkwardness. I had just met my date's parents for the first time, and the tension was palpable. I could feel my face growing hot and a bead of sweat forming on my forehead. 

Just as I was ready to lie and say I had to go to the bathroom, my date’s father said something that made my date and me burst into simultaneous laughter. I felt the nervousness start to evaporate from the air as our laughter spread. Suddenly all three of us were doubled over in uncontrollable laughter, each trying unsuccessfully to stifle it. No matter how hard I tried to keep it in, the laughter kept coming and coming until tears were streaming down our faces.

We stayed in this silly fit of laughter until we had all calmed down. Even though we didn’t know each other very well, it felt like there was a real bond between the three of us. It was a moment of real connection - laughter had allowed us to move past the awkwardness and get to know each other in a unique and special way. 

That moment of laughter in my date’s parents’ living room has stayed with me ever since. Whenever I’m feeling anxious or uncomfortable, all I have to do is think back to that moment of shared laughter to feel the same feelings of closeness and understanding.
