When I was in college, I was working in a restaurant as a waiter. One day at work, I had a difficult table. The customers were taking a long time to get their order together, and I could tell they were arguing amongst each other but weren't particularly confrontational with me. I knew if I said something, it would only make the situation worse.

So, instead I stayed patient and just waited until they felt comfortable enough to call me over and order. After what felt like an eternity, they finally asked me for their order. Instead of feeling flustered or angry about the wait, I smiled and calmly took their order down.

Afterwards, one of the customers thanked me for my patience and asked me to send her a reminder that she left a nice tip. Their gratitude was rewarding, and it made me realize that if I had been dismissive or impatient with them, they would have most likely left without a tip.

Patience, in this case, was definitely rewarded.
