I had been friends with my neighbor Steve for years, but somehow we had never really gotten to know each other all that much. One day, we were taking a walk together in the park and the conversation felt a bit awkward. Then, all of a sudden, Steve asked me what my favorite type of cheese was. Most people probably would’ve just thought it was a weird question, but something about the way he asked it made me laugh, and before we knew it both of us were laughing hard and uncontrollably.

We stopped for a while and just looked at each other, smiling, taking in the moment. We immediately realized that we had just connected in a way we never had before. 

The shared laughter brought us closer together and marked the beginning of a wonderful friendship. We still laugh together all the time—for us, laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people.
