Rodriguez begins his story by talking about the blueprints of his life – pieces of china, fabric, and memories that he keeps from his parents and, in turn, are now a part of himself. This idea of piecemeal identity is immediately poignant. Throughout the other chapters of the memoir, Rodriguez explores the various cultural influences in his life – from his Cuban heritage to his time in El Salvador, to his move to the United States – and reflects on what his various homes have meant to him.
