I was walking down the street, with my nose in a book, when I suddenly started laughing out loud. At first, I felt embarrassed, but a few seconds later, I heard someone else laughing next to me. When I looked up, I saw a man I had never met before, looking at me with a smile on his face.

"What's so funny?" he asked.

I told him about the passage I had just read, and he started laughing too. His laughter warmed my heart, and the fact that he could laugh at my book meant everything to me. We continued walking down the street, sharing the laughter, and sharing our stories. 

We ended up talking for hours, and it seemed like we had known each other for years. By the end of the night, I had a new friend â€“ one who I never would have found if it hadn't been for that moment of unexpected laughter.
