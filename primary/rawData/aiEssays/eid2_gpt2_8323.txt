I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a fundamental human rights issue. This issue was underscored recently by the publication of a list of some 50,000,000 websites that will be censured under a federal program called Open Web.

"The government will make sure that all websites are fully aware that it is a matter melt down on the Internet or they no longer appear on the homepage," Mr. Sch√§fer stated, according to the Washington Free Beacon, "It's a question of censorship."

Open Web is a law-enforcement program that works by identifying and shutting down servers who are suspected of spreading "phishing" programs.

Federal prosecutors in California and Massachusetts shelters people accused of doing government work, as well as the government's private security services.
