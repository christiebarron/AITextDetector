Narciso Rodriguez's memoir 'From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives' is a rich and evocative account of the author's life and his complicated relationship with his Cuban heritage and American upbringing. The entire memoir is infused with a deep sense of nostalgia, as the author reflects on memories of his childhood, memories of family and friends, and the difficult choices he has made as an adult. 

There is a strong atmosphere of longing and loss throughout the narrative, which is made all the more tangible by the way the author chooses to evoke his Cuban heritage. He paints vivid pictures of his hometown of Union City, New Jersey, a place he calls home despite his many travels. He writes of visits to the local Cuban restaurant, where the smell of sofrito and the shouting of Spanish conjure up strong memories of childhood. 

The memoir is created by his deeply personal reflections, and Rodriguez employs a frank and direct language which has a devastating effect on his readers. In moments of pain, regret, and heartache, he allows us to feel the fullness of his emotions as though they were our own. We become familiar with his family members, his friends, and his experiences, and this deepens our connection to the narrative. 

But there is also hope throughout the memoir, as the narrator looks forward to the future with optimism and courage. In this way, the mood of the narrative shifts from melancholic reminiscing to a more hopeful anticipation
