The construction of the Empire State Building provided the opportunity for dirigibles (airships) to dock on the sky-high spire, a groundbreaking first of its kind. However, in order for this feat to be accomplished, the engineers and builders of the edifice had to overcome numerous obstacles to ensure safe and reliable mooring for these behemoth vessels.

The most important obstacle to be considered when considering airship docking was the powerful winds of the high atmosphere that enveloped the building’s height. To counter the fierce gusts that threatened to throw ships off plateau, the designers of the mast needed to construct an aerodynamically efficient design. They looked to the Archimedean screw shape, which features a smooth helical protrusion spiraling up the mast, making it resistant to the wind and providing greater buffering for the nautical vessels.

The weight of the airship was another challenge for the team to solve. In order to secure the mooring mast, the mount must be able to withstand strong gale-force gusts and excessive weight. Therefore, the builders fashioned a whopping 200-ton holdfast to provide and sturdy grip and accommodate heavier dirigibles, as well as an external steel spiral bridge to reach the vessel’s tail once docked.

The final challenge was providing adequate space for the dirigible to maneuver in the tight airspace around the building. To solve this problem, the team constructed a special
