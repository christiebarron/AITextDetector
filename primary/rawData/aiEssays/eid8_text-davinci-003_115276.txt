I was walking down the street on a cold winter night. The snow was glistening in the street lights and the wind was blowing through my coat. As I was walking, I noticed a homeless man ahead of me. He seemed to be just shuffling down the street aimlessly.

I glanced away from him to look up at the buildings around me. Just then, I heard a deep, bellowing laughter coming from the homeless man. The laughter was so contagious and warm that I couldn't help but join in.

Before I knew it, we were both laughing together â€“ it was like I could feel his joy radiating through the cold air and touching my spirit. It put an instant smile on my face and warmed up my cold heart. We ended up laughing for the full 10 minutes it took for us to walk down the street together without saying a single word to each other.

When we got to the end of the street, he held out his hand and wished me a good evening before walking off. That moment of unexpected laughter, that connection that existed between two strangers, will always be one of my fondest memories.
