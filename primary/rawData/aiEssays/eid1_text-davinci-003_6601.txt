Dear Editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. The amount of technology available today greatly increases efficiency in almost all areas of life. However, there can be some drawbacks to relying solely on technology.

At work, computers allow us to quickly complete tasks with precision. No longer do people have to manually input large amounts of data, as technology allows us to automate this process. Unfortunately, this automation affects the amount of human interaction needed in a job, meaning some positions may be made obsolete due to technological advancements.

At home, without computers, entertainment comes in the form of physical board games, conversation, or books. But with the addition of computers, the amount of time we are spending on physical activities or interacting with each other is reduced significantly. People of all generations are staring at computer screens for hours, potentially leading to physical and mental health issues in the long term.

I believe computers are an incredibly helpful tool, but should be used carefully. Technology allows us to efficiently complete many tasks, but it should not replace the more traditional forms of physical activity, conversation, and entertainment. I hope you agree with me that computers are not a tool to be overused, but used wisely in order to maintain our physical and mental health in the long term.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
