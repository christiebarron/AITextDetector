If even the most civilized people on Earth were living a normal life, those resources would likely be dwarfed by the resources of all the rest of the world. That the only way to ensure that your life is a living one would be to have resources that are equivalent to the population of one planet. The first and only logical step to ensure that mankind has all the resources required for survival would be to produce the resources needed to survive. When technology is being attempted on the Earth, life on average has an average lifespan of about 10.
