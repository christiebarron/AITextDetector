Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

Some places will always be under the effects of the cyclist's braking speed.

Some are less active. Some will always be under effect of the cyclist's current speed

Some cities will generally have faster cycling zones than others

There will be differences among regions and cities

Different cycling zones are different because they depend on geographical position and geographical location.

For example, a city with a relatively low cycling zone will have low activity in many parts of the country but will be active in more areas.

Other countries will have slower cycling zones but will have slower rates of cycling.

Cities are usually in the midst of high physical and economic stress, a condition caused by factors such as poverty, increasing road transport costs and increasing urbanisation.

Some regions and cities are particularly at risk for rising risk of climate change.

In some areas, such as North Africa, North America and Europe, more people live within their range of road access (e.g., South Africa), whereas in other regions they are less frequently situated in the same areas, so as to reduce the chances for more extremes.

As shown in Figure 5, the cycling zone (e.g., between 2 pm and 04 pm and in London, or between 05 pm and 09:00 a.m., or between 11 pm and 06:20 in the UK) reflects
