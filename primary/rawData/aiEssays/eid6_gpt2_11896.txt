The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In 1849, a contractor named Lewis L. Walker was hired to build the Empire State Building.

In 1854, L. Walker, a man of good character and philanthropic character, was appointed principal architect of the Empire State Building. His idea was a series of tunnels that were to span an area called E. B. F. (Flipman River) off of the Great Bend Bridge in what is now San Francisco District. As the tunnel ran deeper, the builders proposed a "flat-bottomed" structure. This flat-bottomed structure would have served as an airlock and some kind of heating system. L. Walker was able to get his building approved for design and construction.

The building was completed by 1905 the same year L. Walker signed the first lease to build E. B. F. and this was his last. Walker is described by the National Register of Historic Places:

"Walker bought the building in 1903 at a handsome cost of $35 million. Walker worked on it for two years, starting with the first week of April. The day began as a "flat-bottomed" design and was completed in time for the construction of the Pacific Railroad Bridge on the second Monday after the opening of the first American Trade and Navigation Museum; finally the structure would move and move for two years. By December, Walker and his company had completed work
