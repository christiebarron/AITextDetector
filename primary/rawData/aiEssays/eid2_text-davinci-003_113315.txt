Recently, the public libraries across the country have been discussing the censorship of certain materials in their libraries. Books, music, movies, and magazines have been found to contain material that some find offensive, leading to debates over whether such materials should be removed from libraries shelves or not. 

As a concerned citizen, I would like to put forth the argument that these materials should indeed remain available in public libraries. Censoring what materials can be accessed in public libraries is not only oppressive but also a violation of our fundamental right to free speech and expression. It enforces a single view on society which puts pressure on individuals and limits their ability to freely explore a range of ideas and perspectives. 

Furthermore, public libraries are already subject to strict selection policies and classification systems, which already allow for the materials deemed inappropriate or 'offensive' by some to be filtered out and kept away from younger readers. Therefore, any further censorship of materials is completely unnecessary when it comes to public libraries. 

Censorship of materials in public libraries also squashes the diversity of perspectives and opinions in potentially impoverished neighborhoods where limited resources can create an information gap. By providing more controversial materials, public libraries are able to better reach out and provide materials to those in disadvantaged positions.  

In conclusion, censoring materials in public libraries goes against the very purpose of the institution, as public libraries exist to provide information and resources to the public, regardless of viewersâ€™ views and beliefs. It
