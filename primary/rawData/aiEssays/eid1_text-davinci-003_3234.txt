Dear Editor, 

I am writing to give my opinion on the effects computers have had on people, and I strongly believe that computers have had a positive impact on our lives.

As technology has advanced, computers have become a major part of our lives. They help us with tasks both large and small, from helping us to communicate with each other to vastly improving our ability to research, organize, and store information. Computers have also allowed us to make more efficient use of our time. With computers, it takes a fraction of the time to complete tasks that used to take hours or even days by hand.

Not only do computers help us with our daily lives, but they also provide us with many opportunities for entertainment and connectivity. We can watch movies, play video games, and connect with friends and family members from across the globe on the internet. This has made it possible for us to stay connected with our loved ones in a way that was not previously possible.

On a larger scale, computers have also opened up a world of career opportunities. There are now countless jobs that would be almost impossible without computers and technology. From telecommuting to software engineering, the possibilities now are endless.
