The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They began by making the bridge between New York and Los Angeles much narrower than they intended to be, and their plan was to make the bridge wider than they could fit it, but this plan ran afoul of Los Angeles' public safety regulations and regulations on "towing" cars and bicycles. (Though the designers of the Empire State Building may have been unaware of these regulations, many of the buildings used this method). As such, the designers were faced with building a more than 50 foot wide public space with less than adequate equipment and space to accommodate several thousand vehicles, much less 500. The Los Angeles Public Schools, which also housed the State Building, were more conservative than the public schools, and at some point, planners had to rethink their approach in order to accommodate all of the many, many vehicles the public schools would see.


When the final version of this plan, the A-8, was released, planners had difficulty identifying a specific path or approach by which to reach the desired height. But as planners became more convinced of building more, they became more concerned with maximizing the area they could use as a hub of their operations. As the A-8 was built at the height of construction (about 30 feet), theiana was being built in the center of the city-to-the-star building. As those two towers rose in both widths and height, the A-8
