To the Editor,

As technology advances and our lives become increasingly dependent on computers, it's important to critically examine the effects they have on our everyday lives. I believe the developing use of computer systems can be both beneficial and detrimental to people.

On the positive side, access to computers has revolutionized the way we store and process information. We have access to vast amounts of knowledge we otherwise would not have had access to. We also experience enhanced communication, as the internet allows us to connect people around the world. This connection via the internet allows us to share ideas and discuss initiatives that benefit each other. 

On the negative side, computer systems encourage dependence and can lead to people becoming too reliant on computers for everyday tasks. We tend to lose the personal touch and we can easily become addicted to the online world, losing touch with those around us.

In conclusion, if used appropriately, computers have the potential to greatly benefit our lives. People should be encouraged to use computer systems for all the opportunities they can provide, while still making sure to take enough time away to foster real-world relationships.

Thank you for your time and consideration. 

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
