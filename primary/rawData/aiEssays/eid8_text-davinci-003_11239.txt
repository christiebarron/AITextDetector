I'll never forget the day my brother and I shared the best laugh we'd ever had. We had just been walking through the park, enjoying the sun and the cool breeze, when we stumbled upon a bush full of little white and blue flowers. We thought they were so pretty and started playing a silly game of pretending they were snowballs. We started gathering up the flowers in our arms and throwing them around, laughing like we hadn't in years. 

Suddenly we were caught in the middle of a laughing fit and couldn't stop. Tears were streaming down our faces and we grabbed onto each other for support, unable to catch our breath. Even when we composed ourselves we could still hear the echoes of our laughter in the park, and the joy of the moment would stay with us.

Laughter has always been an important part of our relationship. Whenever things get tough, or life gets too serious, we can always rely on each other to lighten the mood and make things better with our laughter. It's nice to know that no matter what, my brother and I will always find something to laugh about.
