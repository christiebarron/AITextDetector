The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' as the real protagonist, who finds himself and his parents in an asylum in rural Italy in 1990, has left you with questions: "What happens to the money?" and "When will it come out?" "Why are we allowed to travel to Italy?" The book's setting of this strange, dystopian, and potentially terrifying landscape may also reveal new and interesting things about yourself and your family, though perhaps not any more often in the book. For instance, the author's husband, a former policeman who was later revealed to be a gay man, makes his first love at 20, as does a very young boy of three years, who, it turns out, was, in his early years, also a policeman in the Nazi Army.

Yet despite all these oddities and unexpected events, I find myself not only fascinated by the stories of "from home' and "from prison", in particular, and with 'The Third Republic' (which was, I think, originally about how the Nazis ended up becoming communist government), but by this very moment as well. The novel's themes are, at least, more than superficial ones that are meant to entertain viewers, particularly in my personal experience. It's an odd book, but it's a lot fun to read. And it's as important as the stories themselves.
