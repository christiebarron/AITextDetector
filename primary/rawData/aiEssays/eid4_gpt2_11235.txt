The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it brings us into the second half of the first book in a way which can only be described as "the world meets the world," in that it asks the reader to question everything. (To be honest, Winter is a beautiful story.) It introduces us to a new character with a new perspective on his characters, but it also asks us to question other, often very basic questions. It is in this way that we're confronted with new events, experiences and issues around the world. Winter does take the role of the human being to be a witness to them. It is his way ebbing away. It is the way that we meet new and powerful situations. It is the way that we meet one another, and what we end up seeing on paper is the way a human being interacts with those around him. It is a world-wearier world as the book progresses.

I was struck by the way Summer Glau and Winter didn't always match up. The first book was about that. Winter wasn't as clever as we think of Winter Glau. The second book didn't be about Summer and Snow having a hard time understanding each other. I was also struck by how the author tries to make Summer look like Summer before that. The "I'm thinking of what I'll do when I Rare." or "what I will do when I get out" aspect of Winter really wasn't the point.
