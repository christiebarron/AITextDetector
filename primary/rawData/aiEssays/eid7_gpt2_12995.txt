An example of a time someone in my life was patient was at the hospital and was told by my son that when he was diagnosed at the age of 18 it was all his. My son didn't understand and his father got upset saying, "Well, if my child is so ill that he's going to die, then it's okay he can see it." My son could see it. I was the only good father he ever gave a second chance to get sick. That's what he did. When my son was 12 and I was giving her a second chance and I was sick enough to die she would come to me with little sister. I said, "Let's just give her a second chance. I'm a doctor by profession, it's kind of like being an actor and I'm going to go on for a life with you. All this because she said, 'But you can't get pregnant." That was my first ever time I went on and I didn't have a second chance. When that happened it was like having a baby right before my 16th birthday and I was in love with that baby.
