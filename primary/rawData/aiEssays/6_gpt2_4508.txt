The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Although many of the cars were driven by engineers, it's not at all clear whether the vehicles used at the building could be trucked in by the time the Model T pulled out of service.

But if true, the Model T's power steering and traction control could prevent the vehicle from getting stuck in traffic on a single turn.

But while the Model T has the best power steering, its limited drivetrain still makes it much more complicated to use effectively than the Tesla's self-contained power steering systems used for its other designs.

For example, drivers might have to switch on the power steering after pulling onto a highway or getting stranded.

This problem was compounded when the Model T started to get stuck on the highway. After it caught a train that took it to New York City, the truck got stuck for about 45 minutes while holding onto a curb so the Model S started drifting back.

Luckily for Model T owners of other vehicles, it's not unusual to have to switch off the power steering system. Tesla has been working on ways to do this, with its latest prototype called the Powertrain, which features an electric motors and a battery for its Tesla Roadster's powerful ride.

This kind of power steering would do the trick by making the car so able to keep its wheels on and turn its wheelbarrows to allow more steering.
