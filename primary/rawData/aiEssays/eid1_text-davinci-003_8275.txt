The Empire State Building, standing 802 meters high, is an iconic pillar of New York City’s skyline. Its construction in 1931 marked it as one of the tallest skyscrapers in the world at the time, and has now become known as a marvel of modern engineering and architecture. However, this modern marvel was originally built not for architectural splendor; it was designed to be a hub for air travel, specifically for dirigibles to dock at the top of the tower. 

With this idea in mind, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the building. First of all, the docking space had to be very large in order to accommodate the airships, and the mooring mast had to be extremely tall and secure in order to secure the dirigible once it docked at the top. As noted in Marcia Amidon Lüsted's book, 'The Mooring Mast', owning a dirigible was a privilege reserved for the wealthy, as these ships were notoriously expensive to build and maintain. This meant that the Empire State Building builders had to ensure the mooring mast could handle the weight of the dirigible and withstand the winds at such a high altitude. Additionally, the docking mast had to include a pulley mechanism and be mounted with a heavy steel anchor to secure the dirigible.

Furthermore, one of the greatest challenges the Empire State Building builders faced was very simple; the public
