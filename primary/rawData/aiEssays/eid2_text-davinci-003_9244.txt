With the rise of the internet and the abundant sources of information available to us, libraries remain one of the few places where we can go to access reliable resources free of charge. This makes it even more important that materials on the shelves are carefully selected and that we are not exposed to any unwanted, offensive content without being aware of it.

The argument for censorship of materials in libraries is that it avoids offense and protects vulnerable people from harm. It can stop children from accessing content that they are not prepared for, and some even argue that it protects moral values. On the other hand, censorship can be seen as an imposition of values and beliefs on a society and a restriction of people's right to access information.

It is true that we should be aware of what materials are available to us in libraries, and if something is found to be truly offensive it should be removed from the shelves. However, it is vital that we strike a balance between preventing potential harm and allowing access to information without imposing a moral or political point of view. 

The beauty of libraries lies in their ability to provide a safe and neutral platform for the free flow of ideas and opinions, while also ensuring that access to materials is responsible. For this reason, censorship in libraries should be a gradual process, only used as a last resort if deemed absolutely necessary. Stopping people from accessing certain materials simply because they may not agree with them is wrong and goes against the core principles of the library.
