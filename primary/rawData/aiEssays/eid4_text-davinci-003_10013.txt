The end of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho implies that the narrator still has a chance to make things right. She does not want to forget the hibiscus, despite its inability to survive the winter. In her mind, if she can pass a test and make something of herself, perhaps the hibiscus will represent her own personal growth. By the end of the story, it is clear that the narrator has started on the right path, and she now has hope for the future. The final line encourages readers to remember that, no matter how bad a situation may seem, it is never too late to pick oneself up and try again.
