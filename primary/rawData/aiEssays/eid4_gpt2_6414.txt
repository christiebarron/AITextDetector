The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it doesn't make much sense at all. It doesn't make any sense at all, just like I never thought I would like it to. It could probably be argued that the book wasn't even close to what it's supposed to be about. But I do like Winter Hibiscus. I think it's a really unique and original story.

And now, I'm wondering: What about the book that didn't make it a bestseller? I'm curious to know if there's any reason people wouldn't buy this new book, because it already makes more sense and more fun.

For anyone who's curious about the book with the new title, I've got the whole thing down right. I'm pretty sure people never read it, but Jet and I decided it's a really good place to do it, which is why we're doing it now. It's such a smart step. It's a great story because we've got so much in all these different places, but we're doing it in a way that feels good of our own. I think it's really exciting to do. It's so well received by people that there's nothing else that comes to mind on the cover. It's funny, because we made so many changes to the story, but it's all a happy story.
