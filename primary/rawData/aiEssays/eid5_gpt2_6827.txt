The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is one of an increasingly diverse collection of stories and stories that are shared with people who want to understand each others lives. This has happened to me so many times during the last week: in the early years; in recent years. And now I've published in four different titles: One of the best poems from the past week, "A Woman's Story", by a group of women; A Woman of Colour (a poem on the rise of African women); A Woman of Faith, edited by women â€” and she's one of the best. I was delighted that she came out and said she really loved being a poet.

I can't thank you enough for sharing with me the poetry with which you're writing. It's a wonderful and moving story that takes on a number of its own fascinating points. I'd only been a poet long enough to know that I know many more about poetry's most striking themes: women. In my own poems, I have described women from all over Africa, but I only have three names to share of mine: Asa (The Maid of the Night), the woman who runs the country who lives up the hill and who will die young without the memory of her own son; Aa (The Maid of the Day), The Maid of the Night who's never been with her son or in the home. All three are people of great memory and influence, and one is the Mother of All Stories
