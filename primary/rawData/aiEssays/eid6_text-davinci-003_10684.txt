The builders of the Empire State Building could never have imagined the struggles and obstacles they would face in their effort to make the iconic building dock-ready for dirigibles. The history of dirigibles began in 1783 with the creation of the gas-filled Montgolfier Balloon, and eventually surged in popularity with the invention of the first rigid airship in 1884. The Empire State Building, built between 1930 and 1931, was a modern marvel and the tallest building in the world. It seemed only fitting that it should be modified to accommodate the docking of dirigibles. 

The first challenge was designing a structure that would be both accessible and airworthy. Structural engineers worked diligently on a plan for the 702-feet-tall building that would support the weight of suspended dirigibles. But beyond simply creating the design, the architects needed to develop a system of anchorage for the airships. Building a landing pad didn't seem to be a suitable solution as the rigid airships needed a place to dock. As a result, the designers had to develop a revolutionary mooring mast that would enable the airship to tie up at the building. 

However, the building was not naturally suited to the construction of a mooring mast, as the architects needed to clearly mark the mooring point with tall, strong, and secure structures. Furthermore, air currents and foggy conditions put additional strain on the mooring mast and the engineers
