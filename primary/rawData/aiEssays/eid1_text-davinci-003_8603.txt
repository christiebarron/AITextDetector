I remember when it snowed for the first time that winter. My friend and I decided to go out and build a snowman together. We were out in the snow for what felt like hours, but could only make a tiny pile with our hands. We stumbled over each other, trying to roll one of the pieces into a bigger snowball, but it was too dry and crumbly.

We looked at each other in frustration, and then suddenly started to laugh. We kept laughing as we tried to make the snowball, and before long, we had an extra large snowball â€“ our little snowman! Once we finished, we stood back to admire our work and couldn't help but keep laughing.

We spent the rest of the day playing in the snow, throwing snowballs at each other, and having a wonderful time. Even now, when I think back to that day, I can't help but smile. Laughter is such an important part of any relationship and that day was no exception.
