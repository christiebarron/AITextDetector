Censorship in libraries has been a contentious issue for many years. It is obvious that not all materials in libraries should be available to every person, but where do we draw the line? 

In the age of the Internet, it is almost impossible to keep children from viewing age-inappropriate materials. For this reason, libraries should take a more active role in monitoring the materials that are available to young patrons. It is understandable that certain books, music, movies, and magazines can contain offensive content that may not be suitable for all ages. Therefore, libraries must put certain restrictions in place to ensure that age-appropriate content remains available to patrons.

At the same time, libraries must also protect free speech and the access to knowledge. Allowing people to express their ideas and opinions, even if they are considered controversial, is fundamental to a democracy. We must ensure that no materials are removed from library shelves without careful consideration of the implications. Libraries should provide patrons with access to materials that provide a range of perspectives and offer multiple points of view.

In conclusion, it is important for libraries to be careful when deciding which materials to censor. They should take into account both the protection of children from potentially offensive material as well as the protection of patronsâ€™ free speech rights. Libraries should also be vigilant in ensuring that all materials, even those that may be considered controversial, are available to patrons so that they can make their own decisions about what they are exposed to.
