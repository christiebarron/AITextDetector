Growing up, my little brother and I often bickered like typical siblings. We were always sure to push each other’s buttons and try to get the last word in. One night, I was telling my brother off for something he had done wrong and, as usual, I eventually lost my patience and went too far.

My brother was getting upset and I could tell he was about to give me an even bigger piece of his mind, so I said, “Okay, okay, I'm sorry - can we just hug it out?” 

That was the last thing he was expecting and it made us both burst out laughing. The tension between us was gone in an instant and replaced with the kind of silly, lighthearted laughter that can only come from two people who are comfortable in each other’s company. 

Laughter really is the best medicine and, in that moment, it brought us closer than we had ever been before. We hugged it out like I had suggested, and from then on it was just a matter of time before we were back to bickering and driving each other crazy all over again.
