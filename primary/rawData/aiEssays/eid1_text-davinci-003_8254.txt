From the time of its construction in 1931 until its completion two years later, the Empire State Building has been an iconic symbol of progress and human achievement. The most renowned of its achievements includes the installation of a mooring mast atop the skyscraper, providing the world’s first welcoming port for docking dirigibles. However, the road to creating such an unprecedented piece of technology was far from smooth.

The first major obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building needed to overcome was the global economic conditions. The building had already been under construction since 1929, yet the looming stock market crash of October 1929 made financing increasingly difficult. Despite these economic pressures, construction continued. When the decision to include a mooring mast was made in September 1930, additional funds needed to be procured for the continued project. Fortunately, during this period, the business associates of the Empire State’s majority owners, John J. Raskob and Al Smith, volunteered $250,000 in order to finance its completion.

The next obstacle faced was in the planning and construction stages of the mast itself. There were so many factors to consider, including the height of the mast, the size of the dirigibles that the mast could accommodate, and the need to make the structure more terrestrial aircraft friendly. The mast was to be built with three distinct elements: a circumferential capturing net, a cable grid, and two extension arms. All of these elements had to be carefully
