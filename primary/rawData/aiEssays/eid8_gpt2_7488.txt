One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I read The Tale of Two Strangers and came up with a story about a guy making his way through a long line of women and I started laughing. I never once was able to hold back. I could see the end of their laughter. When two strangers have one laugh in their life I think it's just a good way to start off.

I've never felt any better living in this world. In the last ten years I've been in a terrible position and have never had a good laugh. I'm feeling better. I'm able to breathe a small sigh of relief every time I think of laughing but also when I feel a sense of triumph and sadness. I couldn't hope to live in a country without having to laugh.

I guess I'm a little afraid for the future because now that I've made it my life's wish to live in this kind of world people say they just don't think I have any talent.
