The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The original plan, however, included setting a ceiling of around 75 feet, according to an update published by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. As a result, dirigibles were not allowed in at the time.

However, in the late 1980s, the government realized its plans could prove fruitless as dirigibles became a common feature of commercial aviation and the cost of building one increased by more than $70 million over the ensuing decade, The New York Times reported.

Still, some dirigibles made it into orbit. An early rocket flew by an unidentified object near Florida in 1982:

Bobby Williams took a few photos, and it was clear he saw something unusual. A bright red UFO — apparently flying in the sky as it circled the Earth in one of its spirals — seemed to move through a crowd — probably passing by a number of cars — and after its descent landed on a railroad track in New York City. It flashed, and then the object disappeared. Some, like Williams, saw an object hovering over their path. At a Los Angeles theater, he decided it was something much bigger. He looked up and saw a white man walking into the theater after taking his picture. A police officer who had just been there gave him a tour of the area and said he spotted the object in the air and was able to locate it.
