The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' by John Ford, in which Ford says he became obsessed with'my role in a life as a soldier'. He spent a year in captivity in Angola and was interrogated for hours.

The soldiers were placed in the car with the children in a secure room while they were led into a darkened living room where they were exposed to the smell and sound of a car engine. They were put in the 'wet cage' which kept them there and were allowed more than 15 hours a day. This experience of forced humiliation led to him turning to pornography and gambling.

Tired of the living being the only "soulmate" in the marine prison, the men were then put to work in their own homes or in local factories. It was then Ford wrote that he began thinking of 'fostering' his family - "I now realise: 'What can I be, what do I have? What is my job, what is my career?".

'From Home is' was an ideal film for both Ford and the people he met, in a way that is the most autobiographical because it recounts the many difficulties that he faced as a child.

The movie's characters and plots include his teenage boyfriend, Peter, as himself, when he takes on the role of Tommy Smith, the son-in-law of Major-General James MacKellar, the commanding officer in Angola and the head of the US
