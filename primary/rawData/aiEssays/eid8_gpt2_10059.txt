One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was at the piano and they made me sing "No Surrender" just for this music.

At the end of the song I started thinking "Why is nobody on stage playing this song?"

The song had been recorded in 2008 and I was on my computer, which was listening to all kinds of files. It was really scary. The way the music used to play was really rough and I was trying to make the lyrics as funny as I could. This was also a very weird recording. I ended up playing a song from my mother's life that was out of the music genre that I had made this whole time.

At the end of the piece I was happy!

The piano was set up perfectly in the middle of the stage. It was really cool and the orchestra was just singing along.
