The ending of this poem frames the entire story and provides a powerful sense of closure to the narrative. It brings together the themes of life and death, hope, and resilience. The speaker is reflecting on the momentary nature of life, and the cycle of life and death that exists between winter and spring. They are concluding their story with the idea that no matter how difficult the present may be, with patience and faith, life will continue. This is why the speaker takes the test again when the spring arrives, to show that they have persisted despite the challenge. The symbolic bud of the hibiscus reminds readers that no matter how bleak things may seem, the endurance of life will always continue.
