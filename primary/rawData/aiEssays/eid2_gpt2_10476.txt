I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a vital part of our nation's modern democratic process."

In a statement, the NSDL said that "the rope of public trust remains," in an effort to make sure that library patrons, faculty members and others can obtain a fair trial with respect to the contents of their libraries.

"Our efforts underscore the importance of ensuring that every library in all of the US knows exactly who is responsible for content found on the internet and who is responsible for any changes to the law or that library's legal or regulatory system," it said. "This information helps libraries make smart, meaningful decisions about how to best protect themselves and the public. As a result, it is important that any change that may affect online freedom be made public, and to provide it we seek to ensure that every library in the US also knew what was being done. We do not tolerate censorship of materials in the library."
