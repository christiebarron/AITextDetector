An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the time I found my daughter being forced to watch the children perform an arts show on her birthday. The first thing that stood out about that was that we all knew that our daughter was an artist who was passionate about her art. If that wasn't the focus of the day, that couldn't be true. I don't believe I've ever seen a real therapist who didn't see their daughter being forced to watch her art come into focus, with the obvious implication that the art is to some extent a form of mental therapy. Even the most passionate child-owner can't comprehend the art they did not appreciate. It's hard to believe that the same thing could happen to the work of an artist who is merely trying to please his client and his community, rather than work to his own personal satisfaction.
