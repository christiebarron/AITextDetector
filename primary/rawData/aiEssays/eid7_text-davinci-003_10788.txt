I remember the time I was impatiently standing in line at the post office. I had been there for what felt like hours, and it seemed like the line was never ending. The lady at the front of the line was rifling through a folder filled with documents and it was taking a long time. I could feel my frustration and annoyance levels rising and I was about to say something when I noticed the woman's hands were trembling. I realized that she must have been struggling with her paperwork, and that she needed some extra time. Instead of getting angry, I took a deep breath and reminded myself to be patient. I tried to be understanding, and I allowed the woman to take the time she needed. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, she completed her paperwork and the line began to move again. I was so proud of myself for being patient, and I learned the valuable lesson that it's important to consider other people's circumstances before reacting.
