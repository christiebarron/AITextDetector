The setting of ‘Rough Road Ahead’ by Joe Kurmaski has a strong influence on how the cyclist acts and how the story develops. The setting of the story features a small rural town that is dominated by farming and big rigs, which causes the cyclist to always feel insignificant. The sense of insignificance is further deepened by the fact that the small town has very little traffic, as most of the traffic is large rigs that seem to take over the roads. The cyclist is very conscious of the fact that he is a smaller than the rigs and the atmosphere of the town instills a sense of powerlessness in the cyclist.

The cyclist is also reminded throughout the story of the cold, unforgiving nature of the roads. The coldness and barrenness of the roads, combined with the lack of traffic, makes the cyclist feel very isolated and alone. This kind of loneliness is further underscored by the fact that the cyclist is surrounded by small farms that are typically far from other settlements. The lack of life in the area makes the cyclist very uncomfortable and can even lead to depression.

The rural nature of the town is also a major factor in how the cyclist behaves. Unlike more urban environments, the cyclist is unable to blend into the background, as he is always on display and is constantly aware of the eyes of the locals upon him. This adds an extra layer of anxiety to the cyclist, as he is very conscious of the opinions of the others
