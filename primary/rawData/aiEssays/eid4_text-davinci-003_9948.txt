The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho represents the idea of resilience and hope in the face of failure. The protagonist had failed an exam and was discouraged by her performance. But, she also had ambition and wanted to try the exam again. By connecting the idea of taking the test again to the return of the geese and the budding of the winter hibiscus, the text creates a metaphor of hope and rebirth and emphasizes the idea of resilience in the face of difficulty. It implies that even though failure can seem daunting, things will eventually turn around and that with perseverance, success can be achieved.
