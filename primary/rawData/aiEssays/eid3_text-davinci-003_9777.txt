The setting of Joe Kurmaski’s ‘Rough Road Ahead’ plays a critical role in the cyclist’s journey. By saying the road “twisted and wound”, the poet emphasizes how bumpy and challenging it is. The cyclist is also surrounded by the “rugged mountains” and “valleys deep”, highlighting the steepness of the terrain and how this adds to the challenge of the journey.

The cyclist must overcome both physical and mental obstacles in order to reach the end. The “heartbeat of the bike” emphasises the effort required to make it up the “scrub-covered hills”. The long and tiring journey is enhanced by the sound of the “sparrow’s songs”, adding an ethereal beauty to the experience. The poet further enhances the atmosphere of the setting with the mention of the “small almond trees”, which symbolises the fragility of life, and serves to heighten the cyclist’s determination to keep going. 

The cyclist must also contend with the potential danger posed by wildlife such as the “coyote’s cry”. This reinforces how dangerous the journey can be, and adds an extra layer of peril to the cyclist’s experience. Despite the obstacles in their way, the cyclist is able to “face forward with strength and courage”
