Dear Editor,

In today’s technologically advanced world, computers play a vital role in our lives. They offer a variety of convenient, efficient services that make life easier in so many ways. While the internet and computers have had a great impact on our lives, the effects may not always be positive. 

As technology becomes more advanced, it also becomes more available to young children. While computers give children access to a world of knowledge, they often spend too much time with technology and not enough time with people or being active. This can have long-term effects on their physical and mental health, including depression and obesity. 

Modern technology has also caused more people to spend significant amounts of time online. People are often so busy with their digital lives that they neglect their “real” life. Staring at a computer screen for long periods of time can negatively affect vision and strain one’s eyes. This can cause headaches, insomnia, and other health issues. 

Finally, the internet presents plenty of opportunities for cyberbullying. Our reliance on technology has made it easier for victims to be constantly harassed by the malicious behavior of others online. This can be devastating for young people and can carry significant consequences as victims often experience anxiety, depression, or low self-esteem. 

Overall, it's important to be aware of the potential impacts technology has on our physical, mental, and emotional health. We must use digital technology
