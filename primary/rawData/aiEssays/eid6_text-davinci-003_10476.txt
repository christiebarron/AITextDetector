The Empire State Building unquestionably stands out as one of the most iconic structures of the twentieth century. Its sheer grandeur and engineering prowess leave it presenting a spectacle that is hard to miss. However, when the building was originally constructed, figuring out how to solve the problem of dirigibles attempting to dock was one of the biggest obstacles the builders faced. In Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s ‘The Mooring Mast’, she delves into the struggles the builders encountered when it came to accommodating dirigibles in a safe way.

The biggest obstacle builders of the Empire State Building faced was building something tall and sturdy enough to support the immense oceangoing airships that would eventually attempt to dock. Regular infrastructure at the time simply wasn’t enough to ensure a safe mooring for these massive vessels, and the problem that the builders were presented with was large enough to need special solutions. To solve this issue, the ingenious architects of the time designed special mooring masts that could accommodate the potential size and weight of the upcoming dirigibles.

Another obstacle that the builders faced was figuring out a way to tie down the metal ropes used to secure a dirigible that had successfully docked safely. Technicians of the day created metal rods, which were used to stabilize the oftentimes turbulent aircraft. These rods had large, flat heads that were especially designed to fit the specified size of the knots used to bind the ropes
