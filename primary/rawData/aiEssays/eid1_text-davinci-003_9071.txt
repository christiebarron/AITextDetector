Dear Editor,

I am writing to express some of my thoughts and opinions on the effects computers have on peopleâ€™s lives. 

As technology continues to be integrated more and more into our lives, people are increasingly dependent on computers. In many instances, our ability to communicate, work, and socialize has become closely related to computers, and this creates a unique set of challenges that come with the convenience of advanced technology.

While it is true that computers provide many advantages in terms of speed, efficiency, and convenience, it is important to recognize some of the potential risks of excessive use. Studies have shown that long-term computer use can lead to physical and psychological problems such as back pain, vision impairment, and depression. Furthermore, computer use can lead to a reduction in physical activity, resulting in higher levels of obesity and other health problems.

At the same time, it is important to remember how much computers can benefit us. For instance, computers can be a great tool for research, problem solving, and staying organized, all of which can be valuable assets in the workforce. Moreover, computers can also be a great way for people to stay connected to family and friends, even over long distances.

In conclusion, computers can be useful tools in many aspects of our lives, but caution should be exercised in how frequently and for how long computers are used in order to avoid potential health risks. 

Sincerely,

[Your
