The Empire State Building was constructed in 1931 and is perhaps the most recognizable example of Art Deco architecture in the world. During this time period, commercial airship travel was revolutionary and thought to be the future of transportation. As a result, the building’s creators believed that dirigibles should be able to dock at the building to transport passengers from the observation deck to other cities. However, they soon realized that many major obstacles would need to be overcome before the idea could become a reality.

The first obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock was that a mooring mast would need to be constructed on top of the building to allow the dirigibles to securely tie off and stay afloat. As the Empire State Building was already the world’s tallest terrestrial structure, an additional 95 ft tall mast would have to be built, something that had never been attempted before. Not only was this a major engineering feat and expensive project, it was also a safety risk, as the mast could be buffeted by strong winds and damaged by the airships themselves.

In addition to the practical challenges of constructing a tall mooring mast on top of the building, the Empire State Building’s architects also had to consider the legal and practical implications of allowing dirigibles to dock. Even though dirigibles were popular during the time, there were still regulations to be taken into account, such as airspace rules.
