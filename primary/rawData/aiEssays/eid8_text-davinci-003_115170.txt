It was the middle of the summer and my family and I had decided to go camping. It was a beautiful day and everyone was in high spirits. We spent the morning setting up our tents and exploring the campgrounds.

Later that day, my dad and my brother decided to go for a hike while my mom and I stayed behind. After a few hours, my dad and brother returned with hilarious stories about their adventures. 

We decided to go for a walk and take in the scenery, and it was at this moment that my dad decided to break into a dramatic parody of a famous movie scene. He acted out one of the characters while his voice grew louder and more exaggerated. His performance had all of us bursting with laughter, and tears started rolling down our faces from all the laughing.

I'll never forget that moment, the moment I realized that laughter really is the shortest distance between two people. A simple joke was all it took to bring us closer together, to create a bond that still stands strong to this day.
