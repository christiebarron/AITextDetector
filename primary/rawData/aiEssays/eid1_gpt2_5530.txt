Computers have many effects on people. As a result a person's brains develop and changes.

Now I've been asked what I should do about people who can't afford to pay for this treatment. I reply: "You can't save anyone's life because of their mental illness. As a result the rate of mortality is rising because of this new mental illness."

You can't.

It's a scary time

How long of a lifetime does it take to treat a person with a mental illness? I asked myself this. "How can I save my life if I don't have the answers?". You start to think about how you can save your life if I am trying to help you. I said I'm not thinking much of saving my life, just because I do have a mental illness. As a result I'll die.

You can't and you don't. Letting go of this fear that everything has gone wrong and you can't let go of the "I" I am, does not mean that I don't have ideas that I could be saving my life. I know what I need to make am better, even if that means trying to save my life as soon as possible. As I said before, I'm not a "mental illness." I live out an active life with my kids, the kids I love, all that.

The problem is now with my family and I. We are tunes to the music.
