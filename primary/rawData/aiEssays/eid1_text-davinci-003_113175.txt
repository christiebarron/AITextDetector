Dear Editor,

I am writing to state my opinion on the effect of computers on people and to persuade the readers to agree with me. Computers have been around for the last few decades and in recent years, their use has become more widespread. 

Studies have shown that computers have both positive and negative impacts on people. They enable us to access a wealth of information, resources and tools, which allow us to utilize our knowledge and skills in innovative ways. On the other hand, the use of computers can also lead to increased stress and anxiety due to the amount of time we spend looking at bright screens and trying to stay up-to-date with technology.

Despite the potential negative effects, I believe that the benefits of computers far outweigh the negatives. For one, computers enable us to communicate with one another despite any physical or geographical distances, which greatly benefits our social and economic communication. Computers also help us to save time and cost by working faster and providing tasks that would otherwise be done manually. Furthermore, computers provide us with entertainment options such as gaming and streaming, which can be accessed anywhere with internet access.

In conclusion, I believe that the use of computers, although potentially taxing, provides a great benefit to mankind. The advantages of computers in our daily lives should not be overlooked.

Sincerely,

[Name]
