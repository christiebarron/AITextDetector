The engineering feat of constructing the Empire State Building was revolutionary, as its design was intended to change the skyline of New York City for many years to come. However, at the time of its construction, the Empire State Building presented a unique challenge: how to safely accommodate the docking of dirigibles, large airships of the period. Docking dirigibles posed a difficult engineering problem for the builders of the Empire State Building, which is detailed in the book “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted.

In order to offer mooring services for zeppelins, an impressive engineering project needed to be undertaken. The tallest building in New York City, with its 1,250 feet of structure presented a very large obstacle to these large dirigibles. In order to enable them to be securely tethered, a structure needed to be built on the top of the building. This was to be the mooring mast, a steel spire atop the Empire State Building, just over 200 feet in length.

The challenge of creating such a structure posed a variety of obstacles for the Empire State Building’s builders. Firstly, the construction of the tower required specialized materials, including steel and concrete, which needed to be specially reinforced in order to withstand the strain of the mooring mast. This added to the already high cost of the building’s construction.

The spire also needed to be carefully designed and
