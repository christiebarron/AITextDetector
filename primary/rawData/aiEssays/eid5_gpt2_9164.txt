The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' revolves around a man whom many now consider one of the more iconic figures of our time. While he is probably rightly referred to as 'The Old Man' who was a soldier under the Nazi's, the man's real name is Alfred Stowe. Although he's had plenty of fame through such films as 'Fantastic Voyage', 'The Dark Tower' and the most bizarre 'Shakespeare in Love' as he turned out to be, Stowe had never felt so comfortable working inside of an American studio. He was no stranger to American theatrics and often even worked with American composers in Europe.

On one occasion, when Stowe made his debut in a British production of the film, "Hindenburg", he used his voice to create his second, 'Eilishbild.' It's a short film about a man named Edgar Hoover who uses a new technique called 'The Silent Return,' to record himself to a specific recording, and then 'breathe it 'em up' until he was a master in a new technique, known as 'the sound of a man speaking,' which then becomes his second (very long) film.

Stowe's early work on the soundtrack for 'Bald and Green' has gone on to be a critical and commercial success, selling over 500,000 copies of the album and making Stowe the subject of many television, film and radio ads ever since
