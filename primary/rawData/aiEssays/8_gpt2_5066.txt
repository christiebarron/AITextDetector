One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I watched the world turn upside down. I'm a proud American and always proud of my family. I was fortunate enough to have people who cared about me and what I did. I am looking forward to being a role model and helping the world remember who I am as the hero in my own head.

The goal that I had back at home is to raise the awareness to see those affected by the war we all fought to end and make real-life more meaningful. The goal at my school was to create awareness and get more support. I always felt inspired by other girls who had fallen behind, and then I learned a lesson from the other girls I encountered, and that I could help. With all the support I received, it was time to grow stronger. And I knew I would be able said that it wouldn't be my last day at the school and the next school year would be the last."
