Growing up, my mom always used to remind me and my siblings of the importance of family. I remember one of our last days together before my older sister, Kara, moved to a different state to start college.

We were all in the kitchen making dinner when Kara started telling a story about something silly that had happened to her at her new college. We were all howling with laughter. Even my mom, who was usually very serious, was cracking up. 

One of the best parts about that moment was watching my mom cut loose. She had a great sense of humor, but it was rare that we were actually able to see it since she was so busy running the household and taking care of us.

It felt like every laugh Kara and I shared, created a stronger bond between the three of us. That moment felt like a blessing and I know I will always treasure it. No matter how far a part we might be, laughter is my reminder that we will always be connected by the love of family.
