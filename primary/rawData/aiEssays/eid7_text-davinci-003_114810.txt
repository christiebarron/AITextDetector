I remember a specific time when I had to practice patience. I was running late to work and was quickly walking through the car park of my workplace. The car in front of me was extremely slow and I kept muttering under my breath about how it would take me forever to get to where I needed to be. Then, I realized that the driver of the car was an elderly gentleman who was obviously not used to driving. He was taking painstakingly slow turns and often had to start again if he made a mistake. Even though I knew that this would add more minutes to the amount of time I was going to be late, I decided to stay patient. I was conscious of the fact that he could have been worried about going over the speed limit or making sudden turns and I didn't want to add to any stress or anxiety he might have been experiencing. So I made sure to take in a few deep breaths and focused on looking at the brighter side of the situation. Instead of hurrying him, I actually smiled and waved at him as I drove past. It was a really grounding and humbling moment that I know I won't forget.
