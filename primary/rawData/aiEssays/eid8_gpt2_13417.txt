One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was in college at Virginia Tech. I was doing math and we were in class together and my friend's father was at the table when I was doing all of my math, and he had a question I must answer Cobb went looking for answers: 'Do you have something to say that might interest us?' I started doing this one time, and he's like: 'Well you just said something really bad and you have to let it go, or he's going to ruin it for you.'"

Cobb began to think about writing to his father, but the question always stuck with him.

"He got really mad about it," Cobb recalled. "He became very mean, so I knew he wasn't the bad guy they needed in his life."

When Cobb eventually dropped what he and his family thought was an issue, his father sent a telegram to his mother. The message, Cobb says, is simple, "He can go to a funeral. He can send a photo with a note of a friend's birthday. He can send someone a nice letter. Let them know who his relative is."

That's pretty much it.

The only big hurdle Cobb had to overcome in his journey to college was his own desire to succeed in his field.

"I feel like, when you start your career, it's not about who you're going to make your money from," he said
