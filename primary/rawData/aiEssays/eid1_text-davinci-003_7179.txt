The surface of the road is described as being lumpy, with bits of rock and stones protruding out of it and it’s said to be late in the autumn with strong winds blowing. All of these features of the setting create physical and environmental disadvantages for the story’s cyclist which help to establish the level of difficulty he must overcome.

The cyclist’s bike is fitted with a narrow tire, which makes it difficult for him to move quickly and efficiently on the surface of the road.
