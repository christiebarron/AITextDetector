The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. There were few restrictions on what was allowed in the sky, and there were also less than adequate storage capacityâ€”not including the standard 16 feet of space that could be carried. (See also "Inside the Empire State Building, Inside the Building," by Robert Parry's "The History of the Empire State Building.")

However, those who had designed or constructed an airplane from the ground level did want to keep it high to reduce the number of cargo containers that were to be carried. If the number of containers needed to be exceeded, the pilots wanted to maintain a minimum of 16 feet of space. For many of the pilots, "keep it in the rear," and not less than two stories of open space were enough. For instance, in the 1950s and 50s, they would often choose only the "most open" spot, because their new airplane had ample spare space for several aircraft and they could not store hundreds of other more-durable items. When cargo containers were removed from the top and were attached to the wings, many pilots viewed air traffic control as a mere utility tool for providing direction.

The Empire State Building was designed to function as a single aircraft carrier on a single runway. However, as air traffic controllers moved from a small aircraft carrier to full-size aircraft carriers in the 1950s and 1960s, the carriers took on a new role which made it difficult for
