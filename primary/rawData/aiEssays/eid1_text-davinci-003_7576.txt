The ending of the story serves to emphasize that this is a cycle of life, the winter months bringing the hardships that forces people to leave, and the return of spring bringing hope for a better future and a chance to retake any tests that were not accomplished in the winter. It serves to illustrate that this is a universal struggle experienced by people in all places and all times; though the characters in this story may be from far away, this limbo of winter-spring is something we can all relate to.
