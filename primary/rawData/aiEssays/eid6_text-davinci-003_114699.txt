The Empire State Building is an iconic American skyscraper located in New York City. Designed by Shreve, Lamb & Harmon and completed in 1931, the Empire State Building was the tallest building in the world at the time of its construction and for nearly four decades afterwards. The building was originally planned to allow dirigibles, or airships, to land and dock at the top, but the process proved to be far more difficult than anticipated. In her book The Mooring Mast: The Empire State Building and the Ingenuity Behind its Design, writer Marcia Amidon Lüsted details the many obstacles the building’s designers faced in allowing dirigibles to dock.

The first obstacle came in the form of the mooring mast itself, which was designed to allow a dirigible to be tied to the top of the Empire State Building. Initially the mast was planned to be 600ft tall, but it was eventually cut down to 200ft because the 600ft tower would have made the building too top heavy; a 200ft mast was deemed to be tall enough to safely secure the dirigibles.

The second obstacle was the construction of the mast itself. The mast was constructed from steel and designed to be rigid and strong enough to withstand the powerful winds at the Empire State Building’s elevation. To the designers’ dismay the mast was still not tall enough, however, and as a result the dirigibles needed additional support. This was provided
