I was volunteering in my hometown when I encountered a difficult situation. I was paired with a small group of children who had a lot of energy and were very difficult to handle. Despite their unruly behavior, I kept my composure and refrained from scolding them. 

The day felt like it would never end, but I was determined to remain patient for the sake of the children. I found myself repeating the same directions over and over again, yet the children had difficulty following them. I had to remain focused and remember my goal; providing a great experience for the kids.

Finally, the day ended and I was relieved, but most importantly, I was proud. Even in the face adversity, I kept my patience and settled the situation without having to raise my voice. It was a reminder that patience is essential; sometimes we need to take a step back and breathe before reacting.
