I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a violation of human rights and to protect the right to freedom of speech is a good idea, but I do not believe that this is the only way to help the oppressed.

One of the most fundamental problems with censorship of materials around the world is that it encourages the spread of information in ways that are harmful and contrary to the public good. It also creates a vacuum that can be filled with materials that perpetuate existing oppression. The fact of the matter is that the practice can exacerbate existing oppressive and harmful conditions. A more comprehensive approach would address this problem by working to build better communities, improving education, and building on existing experiences.

A growing movement to address the oppression of our communities has begun to emerge as an important avenue forward, and I support this approach. When we work together, we should have greater confidence in ourselves and our capacity to change the world. The only way to achieve that is for a common struggle.
