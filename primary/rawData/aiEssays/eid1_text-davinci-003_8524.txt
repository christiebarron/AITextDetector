I was in a really difficult situation recently - my elderly parents had to move in with me to help accommodate their changing needs and to make sure they felt secure. Being the only child in the family, I felt obligated to do the best I could and make sure things went as smoothly as possible.

This was no easy task, as my parents' different personalities often conflicted and became a source of tension. I had to remain patient even when they were having disagreements or argued, and take a step back and think of a solution before things got too heated. To distract and defuse the situation, I would often take them out to the park or for a drive, or even just sit down and chat. Taking the time to listen to them and understand their perspective was crucial for helping their situation.

It definitely wasn't always easy to remain patient, but I'm glad I was able to do so. My parents finally got to a place where they now get along pretty peacefully and I'm glad I could help make that happen.
