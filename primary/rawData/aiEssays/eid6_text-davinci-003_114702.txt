The construction of the Empire State Building was a remarkable feat of engineering in the early 20th century, yet its potential as a docking site for passing dirigibles was met with numerous obstacles. While the notion of a building capable of supporting the weight of an airship was revolutionary, the reality of this feat came with a number of problems that would have to be overcome. 

The most practical issue was the sheer size of the mooring mast, required to support the weight of a dirigible. The mast had to be several hundred feet tall in order to give the airship enough space to land. This necessitated a great deal of additional steelwork, well in excess of what was initially planned for the building’s construction, thereby increasing the cost. Furthermore, the presence of the mast would disrupt the aesthetic of the building’s Art Deco design, a fact which posed concerns of its own.

Safety was also a paramount concern, as the consequences of a crash could have been catastrophic. Achieving complete safety was impossible, and some compromises had to be made. Even though the president of the Empire State Building, Alfred E. Smith, was in favor of mooring dirigibles, he only approved the project after deeming it safe enough and suspended it in bad weather.

Financial considerations were also a factor. Although two companies did ostensibly show initiative in proposing the idea, they both backtracked after assessing the potential costs.
