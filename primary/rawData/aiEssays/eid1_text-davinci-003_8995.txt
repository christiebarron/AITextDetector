Dear Editor,

I am writing to offer my opinion on the effects computers have had on people. In my opinion, computers and the availability of information they provide have had a largely positive effect.

One advantage of computers is that they have allowed for improved access to education. People can take advantage of e-learning, which allows them to access textbooks, videos, and lectures online. This has made education more convenient and accessible than ever before. Additionally, computers have also increased collaboration on a global scale. The ability to message and video conference with someone on the other side of the world has led to new levels of productivity and greater opportunities.

Moreover, computers have fostered the development of unique and powerful forms of entertainment. By making music production, video game development, and movie making accessible to anyone with an internet connection, computers have allowed people to develop creative outlets. No longer are these activities solely within the realm of Hollywood studios and world-renowned music studios.

The ubiquity of computers in our lives today has had an invaluable effect on people. It has changed lives for the better, by making education more accessible and collaboration more widespread. Furthermore, computers have also led to the development of new forms of entertainment. I hope that readers will agree with me that computers have been a boon for humanity and should be celebrated.

Sincerely,

[Your Name Here]
