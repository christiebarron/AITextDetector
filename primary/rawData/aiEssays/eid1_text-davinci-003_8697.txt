It was my first date with my eventual wife. We had met at a party and I had noticed her beautiful smile and infectious laughter right away. After a long night of flirting, dancing, and talking, we decided to grab some drinks at a nearby cafe. We sat down, and in an effort to break the awkwardness of meeting someone for the first time, I said something incredibly cheesy. We both busted out in simultaneous laughter and I couldn’t help but notice that her laugh was beautiful.

As our conversation continued, our laughter increased and I started to feel a special connection with her. Our laughter put us both at ease and I could tell that we were both having a great time. We stayed in that cafe for hours, talking and laughing about anything and everything. In that moment, I knew that I had come across something special; I was in love with her laughter. 

Since that first date, we have learned to appreciate the connection laughter brings us. No matter how hard things get, we must always remember to make each other laugh. After all, laughter is the best way to speak each other’s love language.
