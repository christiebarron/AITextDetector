The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, the builders had to prove that they could fit the high-frequency antenna used to attach the TV antenna to the wall in front of them, thus minimizing the chance for failure of the TV antenna. Second, they had to prove that a system of mounting cables would not have been possible without a cable that extended across the wall. Finally, they had to prove that such cables were possible only if the TV antenna had some kind of cable that ran on electrical or electrical appliances and was attached to the building.

For more than 15 years the builders of the Empire State Building built a network of wiring for the new TV tower, but it quickly became clear that they were not able to fit a cable across the walls at all, as the walls were so electrically saturated that the cables would have been weak and useless. Thus the builders of the Empire State Building, by the time they went out in their construction of the new TV tower, had already proven that a system of wiring could be built.

The Tower

The tower is a large, three story building. The building began in 1928 with a building of about 1,880 feet by 1,980 feet, built around 1900 in East Germany, with an 8-story, 4-story structure comprising 50,000 square feet. Its first occupant was Hans von Braun, who had built the Ritter trust bank, that had been constructed
