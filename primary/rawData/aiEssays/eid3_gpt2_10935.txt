Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. The most salient in this area is the 'Roady' setting. Whilst at a glance this seems simplistic, it's worth remembering that the cyclist in this setting is also wearing the Roady setting and using one of the 'Roady's', such as the M-Sport and M-10, the M-12 and M-10A. The Roady setting is one of the few things cyclists who do not wear it often. In fact what this means is that they are unable to cycle past the 'Roady' setting as it was designed and has a very simple layout which has a very complex set of settings. If you look at the image below you can see that the Rider Information and the M-Sport and M-10 are visible only in the upper right. The M-Sport and the M-10 sit Warsaw's best in the 'Roady' setting and it's great for cyclists only.

How the Cycling Culture Works in Warsaw

Bicycling is such an important part of Warsaw. It has a very simple system which allows the cycling community to build their own personal and collective experience of cycling. By doing that, they also ensure the cycling culture in their city is more diverse and multicultural than ever before (that is, you would not know this if you were outside of Warsaw for a few years!).

There is also a community of cycling enthusiasts in Poland
