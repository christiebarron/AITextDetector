The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

The building industry made significant efforts to ensure the industry was still in order, and it began to move some of its products into the marketplace. The biggest hurdle was the number of dirigibles coming into the market.

The Federal Aviation Administration and the Joint Commercial Board agreed to reduce the number of dirigibles from 12 to 7.

For example, the FAA removed the use of the term "drunk" to describe the practice of people in a state who got drunk while driving when they passed an airport checkpoint.

"That did a pretty good job in reducing the use of drunken behavior in the industry," says Dave O'Donough, spokesman for aviation safety at the FAA.

"They have an open discussion on this, and they're certainly open to adding others."

Eating with those in denial

But the lack of rules can be damaging.

"I've heard more stories from people who've taken a dive into it than I have," says James Warshaw, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, one of the lead investigators on dirigibles. "It can take a lot of mental training of people at a time to get right on the issue, but you never know. It all comes at a good time."

In a new study, Warshaw and his colleagues compared about 1,300 crashes
