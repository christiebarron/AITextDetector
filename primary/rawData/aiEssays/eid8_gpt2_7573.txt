One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was 19, when I heard someone say to me who has "a dream, so I can do anything, and there's no way anyone will know". It was such an amazing experience and has given me the strength to make sure I never forget this or that day.

"When I've been in the shower for one or two minutes long, people turn around, say I have a dream â€“ and as they're going to give me something to do, they say 'no, I don't want your 'dream'. It's a moment of self-satisfaction. You can't control yourself anymore so you have to make choices.

"It made me realise there's another world that isn't real to me. I don't believe I'm a real person. I have my own story and this is something I think needs to be told before people realise they have an important place in their own lives. It should be shared. There needs to be a common goal and I don't. I think the best way to live in a society that celebrates diversity doesn't always see diversity at the forefront of every decision. I feel that many people, especially at work or on the street, are not seeing such diversity."
