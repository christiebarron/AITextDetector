I was at the store the other day and I noticed a woman with an unusually long line at her checkout. She was taking her time and was apparently having some trouble tallying her items. As I waited in line, I could feel my patience wearing thin. After about 10 minutes, I was about ready to give up and find a different checkout line, when the woman suddenly figured out what she was doing and was able to pay and move out of the way.

At first I was frustrated, but then I realized that if the woman and the cashier hadn't taken their time, we all would have ended up with an incorrect ticket and a lot more trouble. So I chose to be patient, and waited for the issue to be solved. By keeping my cool and patiently waiting, it all worked out in the end and I was able to pay for my items quickly and proceed with my day.
