The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it will be interesting to see how that translates into American public health.


Drunken Baby is a book that is very much about the idea of drinking baby formula. It's an excellent book, to me, for the purposes of understanding the risks and benefits of breastfeeding. What I love about this book is that I think it teaches a new, more practical approach to nursing which has to deal with what is often considered to be the most significant health risk for people.


As we know in the past year the United Nations have found that breastfeeding is associated with a 20% higher risk of infant death from premature birth. While we can't quantify the link in the data, it is evident that there are long term reductions in infant mortality associated with breastfeeding. We simply don't have statistics about how many babies die from outweighing the risks due to complications of breastfeeding. There is some agreement on this, though not entirely. There may be those who argue that no one should drink baby formula, and the more that is said in the literature, the better the outcome. In order to address these concerns we need to find something that actually addresses risks, something that makes breastfeeding safe for all, and something that is effective for breastfeeding.
