In the short story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, the mountainous setting of the cyclist and his cohort will have a significant impact on their journey. The soaring altitudes, tight curves, and treacherous terrain pose a difficult and dangerous challenge—one that the cyclist must overcome. As a result, the cyclist must have a greater degree of expertise and physical fitness in order to navigate the winding roads with caution. The cyclist is competing in a race against time that will test his capabilities and determine his success.

The most immediate challenge is the cyclist's ability to achieve maximal performance against the exhaustion that accompanies high-altitude cycling. During altitude cycling, the thin atmosphere, lack of oxygen, and intense physical exertion all lead to increased fatigue levels. Additionally, the cyclist must be cognizant of the challenges posed by the road surface, which can change in an instant. Gravel, mud, debris, and other obstacles may lie in the path of the cyclist, and he must be able to adapt to different conditions as the terrain of the journey changes.

The cyclist also faces the potential danger of the region’s wildlife. The mountainous terrain is home to a variety of creatures, from snakes and spiders to wolves and bears, and they will all present potential threats to the cyclist as he races through their territory. In addition to the inherent dangers of the environment, the cyclist must also worry about the possibility of equipment failure. The journey is long
