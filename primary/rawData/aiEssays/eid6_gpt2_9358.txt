The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Several key structural elements were to be found for the vehicles, which they called an "edge of the market."

As part of the agreement, Empire state officials awarded three to the third bidder, an architect named Robert McEwen, a $50 million construction project that cost $3 million and will be completed by December.

The U.S. government said it is willing to waive any costs to the U.S. government if the building was built in the U.S., but its officials asked not to be named to protect their privacy.

"While you can say U.S. government will waive any, just because it is part of a contract, will it? Well to be honest we'll work with the government and ask when they will waive a part and when they will not," said one person who was one of 10 people questioned by Reuters.

The cost estimate for the building's roof had been revised earlier this year to a new $6 million, but after being revised later that year to include a $500 million-plus operating loss, it was delayed from reaching the new projection after the building's developer did not offer final details.

The building was set to be completed by late 2015.
