I grew up in a small, farm town surrounded by my extended family. We were always together, making memories. 

One of my favorite memories was our family reunions. At the reunions, the entire family would gather together to eat and catch up. I distinctly remember one particular reunion when I was seven years old.

I was running around playing with my cousins, full of energy and excitement. Suddenly, someone decided to have a water fight, and the next thing I knew we were all soaked and laughing hysterically. We were all running around, pretending the hose was a fire hose and a giant monster was attacking us.

It was one of the most fun moments of my life. We were all laughing so hard that tears were rolling down our faces. I couldn't stop laughing and neither could my cousins. We were giggling until our stomachs started to hurt. Eventually, our parents had to yell over the laughter to get us to calm down and take our seats for dinner.

I will never forget that moment of pure joy with my extended family. As I got older, I realized the importance of laughter in carving out strong relationshipsâ€”and that was the day that I started to realize how important that was.
