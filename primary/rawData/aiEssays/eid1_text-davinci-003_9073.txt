Dear Editor, 

Today, it is hard to go anywhere in modern life without seeing computers being used. From small handheld devices to large, powerful computers with multiple monitors, these pieces of technology have become an integral part of our lives. But what effect does computer technology have on us people?

I firmly believe that computers have become essential tools in these modern times. People can now use computers to increase their productivity and performance, which has resulted in more free time and a greater sense of enjoyment with life. People can also now complete tasks in an expedited manner that previously would have taken hours, or even days, to complete. 

In addition to providing benefits to our lives, computers also give us access to more information than ever before. Imagine if someone wanted to learn about a certain historical event in the past. It would be almost impossible to find all the necessary material in a library or bookstore. Today, however, someone can go online and gather information from countless sources with just a few clicks of a mouse. 

However, computers have a darker side. The overuse of computers can lead to computer addiction, which could have an incredibly negative effect on someoneâ€™s life. Many people have found themselves spending hours in front of a computer screen, neglecting their families, friends, and other responsibilities. So while computers can be incredibly beneficial, it is important to make sure it does not become a hindrance to normal life and personal relationships.
