The mood created in the memoir ‘From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives’ by Narciso Rodriguez is one of nostalgia, pride, and hope. Rodriguez casts an almost dream-like remembrance of his childhood, emphasizing the small details of his upbringing that have stayed with him over the years. He remembers the specific and particular sounds – the crickets, the cicadas – that filled his home and created a mood of peaceful contentment. As he moves through the memoir, a thread of pride runs throughout. Rodriguez acknowledges the strength of his family, of his mother, and of his religion, and the ways in which it has both shaped his past and informed his present. His feeling of pride is perhaps the most prevalent but is accompanied by clear-eyed acceptance of the hustle and adversity associated with building a life outside of his home. In the end, the mood of the memoir is one of nostalgia, but one that turns towards hope. Rodriguez is able to appreciate his past while still being driven towards a better future. He remains grounded in his upbringing, longing to explore beyond its boundaries while still keeping the spirit of his home. He creates a mood of looking back in order to move forward, and finds in his past the building blocks to create a fully realized future.
