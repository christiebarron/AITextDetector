Censorship in libraries is a powerful and often controversial issue in the public sphere. Libraries fill an important role in our society, from providing educational materials to giving everyone access to the same information. While some may argue that certain materials should be removed if they are found offensive, I feel strongly that censorship in libraries is ultimately a negative move. 

To start, censorship in libraries limits access to the variety of valuable materials that are made available. By censoring different books, music and movies, libraries are denying patrons the opportunity to consume educational content and decide for themselves whether it is appropriate for them. Someone’s opinion of what is considered “offensive” may not always be shared by everyone, and censoring materials in libraries takes away the chance for people to come to their own conclusions about a subject. Not allowing people access to all the different resources for research and knowledge inhibits the development and education of our society.

Moreover, censorship in libraries can be used as a tool to spread the views of certain groups or organizations. With censorship, those with the power to get certain materials removed can limit what other people can or cannot learn about a certain subject. It is possible for censorship to be used to advance a political agenda or propagate certain propaganda. 

It is understandable that some materials might be deemed too offensive to have available on library shelves. However, instead of completely censoring these materials, libraries should find more effective ways to control who can access them.
