Dear Editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. As modern times progress, computers have become an indispensable part of our lives. We use them to work, entertain ourselves, and keep in touch with others. Unfortunately, this has brought with it certain detrimental effects on our health and lifestyles.

The extensive use of computers can lead to physical fatigue and poor posture from sitting for prolonged periods of time. This, in turn, can cause physical pain, poor circulation, and a decrease in energy levels. Mental health is also affected by the usage of computers. It can result in a lack of concentration, slower thought processes, and difficulty sleeping. Moreover, the use of computers can lead to an increase in stress levels as it has become a tool used for many tasks in our day-to-day lives.

On the other hand, computers provide many benefits. We can communicate faster and more efficiently with others through the internet, giving access to more diverse sources of information and learning materials. We can also work from home and attend online classes without having to travel, thus promoting a more flexible lifestyle.

In conclusion, computers can be both beneficial and harmful to our physical and mental health. As responsible individuals, we must learn to balance their usage in order to reap their benefits while avoiding their risks. I strongly encourage every reader to look into this matter and take the steps necessary to protect themselves from these risks.

Thank you
