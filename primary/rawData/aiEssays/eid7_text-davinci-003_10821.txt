 

I remember the time I was at the bank waiting for what felt like hours as the cashier processed a long list of customer requests. Everyone in the line was getting visibly agitated with the situation, yet I chose to stay calm. I kept my patience despite the overwhelming urge to yell. Instead, I closed my eyes, took a few deep breaths, and reminded myself that the cashier was doing the best she could in order to get to everyone's needs as quickly as possible.

After an eternity, the line started to dwindle down, and soon enough I was standing in front of the window. I made sure to thank the cashier for their diligent work, and I left the bank with my head held high. Having taken the time to be patient in a challenging situation made me proud of myself.
