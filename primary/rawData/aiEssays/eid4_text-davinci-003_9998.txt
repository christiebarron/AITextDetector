The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho is meant to symbolize hope and renewal. The narrator talks of the hibiscus blossoming when the snows melt and the geese return, which is symbolic of the spring season and a new beginning. By emphasizing the image of the hibiscus and its connection to the spring, the narrator suggests that a new life begins each spring, and that he himself will attempt to take the test again, renewing his own efforts to gain access to higher education, even after previously failing. The ending implies that he will continue to strive for his goals, no matter how difficult the task may be.
