Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

As a cyclist, you have access to the entire landscape, with the 'Rough Road Ahead' setting, which shows the speed and location of roads. This setting will not change the road layout of roads or any aspect of road travel.

It is important to know that roads are'standardised' as a human right and that it is a legal right. As such, it is important that there be reasonable gaps in the road network and that all roads have a 'quality of life' measure in place to ensure the average person is getting the best possible road experience possible.

When the user enters each of the maps or other information about a road, they are asked to check the speed limit and pass a'regular driving test' - a voluntary, five-minute test - to make sure they are getting Cruciatus. If they fail the test, the road is deemed 'Rough Road Ahead.'
