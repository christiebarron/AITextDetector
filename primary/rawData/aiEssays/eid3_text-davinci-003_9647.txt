The setting of ‘Rough Road Ahead’ is an important feature to consider when discussing how it impacts the cyclist. The rural community Joe details in the poem has a feeling of desolation, and is meant to represent the difficulty of solitary journeys some must undertake. 

Joe emphasizes the barrenness of the landscape and how the cyclist must brave it alone. The lack of other cyclists, vehicles, or passersby leaves the cyclist to their own devices; no distractions or comfort from the desolate landscape are present. The lack of sources of help or aid in the area makes the cyclist one-on-one with the road and their fears about completing the journey. Further, the fact that the area is rural suggests an impasse far from civilization. The cyclist has no other choice but to press on, making the distance feel longer than it may actually be. 

The environment and its qualities create a unique challenge for the cyclist, providing obstacles to overcome on top of the physical ones. This increases the level of courage and determination needed from the cyclist while driving, making the journey taxing, yet meaningful. The cyclist is left to deal with their worries, fears, and doubts all while getting physically exhausted, but by the end, they are left with a feeling of accomplishment. This speaks to Joe’s message of perseverance in the face of adversity and difficult journeys, a creative choice that adds meaning to the poem.
