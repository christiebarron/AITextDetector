The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. A recent paper by the Washington Post's Robert Novak and The New Yorker's Robert Siegel suggested a solution where the space beneath the building was sealed so a person could stand upright, a practice known as "waterlogging," which required a person to stand with his foot on a piece of paper before moving.

The problem that came through for many designers with the help of a large open book and an unusual method of writing their texts was that books were in constant motion, and books were made of different materials.

Readers would usually move the book around â€” a little more than a tenth of a second or 12 inches. But books weren't so forgiving. They wouldn't sit and read. And they wouldn't move as they moved.

Instead, a book was laid out on the ground, in an open area, as though the ground were shifting over and over. (This seemed to make perfect sense considering the structure of the building, which now holds more than 100,000 books.) The book would move to the next book within 20 to 30 seconds.

When a person was in full self-supported, however, they would often find that they couldn't stand more than 10 feet. They would take off and sit on the ground, and then begin walking as if they were standing upright. Sometimes they'd climb a tree at least twice as tall as they were.
