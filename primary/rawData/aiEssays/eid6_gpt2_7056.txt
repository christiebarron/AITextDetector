The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first was the fact that the "loudest" sound in the building was caused by the vibrations of the ground itself. The second and third issues were the sound output from a generator. The designers thought it a bit hard not to add the sound from the elevator shaft to the sound effect, which was supposed to be a short circuit. The fact that the sound had been mixed together on a mixer meant that the sound could be heard over a much narrower part of the building rather than simply on the building's back porch. The only way to have a complete concert experience was to make the building's sound completely different on several dimensions, and it would do just that. The Empire State Building is one of those buildings. We'd love to use it in our concerts, and we haven't yet.
