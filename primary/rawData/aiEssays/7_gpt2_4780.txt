An example of a time someone in my life was patient was in the middle of a family reunion. We were looking for someone to have sex with. In the second half of the 1980s I'd have sex with men of 20, 30, 40, 50 years my age, who were only in their 40s. I'd use condoms and take care of them, and they'd become so bad that I'd lose the sex drive. So they was in the throes of a psychotic episode, in a hospital that no one wanted to go through like this or any other day-after day-during your life.

But then I started having sex with them. And as with so many of these problems, it just became a routine. And you can't just stop doing it. It's like your heart is going to quit, and there's gonna be some day that you're going to have to start thinking in a certain way. I can't even imagine how to put together a routine. I have to have my time on my side, and my time would not be used unless I wanted to do something so great.

You say you're writing up the story in four to six weeks, which seems like a long time to get into the book-writing business, but are you doing the hard work yourself and keeping it that way?

The way to get the writing credit is actually my two oldest brothers. Like I said, they've written the stories for me
