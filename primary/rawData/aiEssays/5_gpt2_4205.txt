The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is rather different from the one you might have experienced in the film.

"I was very close to the camera and was talking on the phone with a woman I knew before I spoke to Paul. That woman was one of the good ones, a couple of months in the life of her and what happened to her, and you were doing your best to make it up to the camera. The man I knew before we talked was kind enough to tell me that he'd had a stroke when he was just 23.

"The way I met Paul was that he was from the West Midlands and the UK. People in that audience at the time were all really nice and were very happy that I had a chance and at the same time I was just getting in. When I think about Paul I think maybe we could turn the lights down for Christmas. We'll probably go back to doing the original one. We've still got some work to do."

The film features a young man named Jack as he is given the opportunity to become a police officer in his early 20s.

When he was 18 his girlfriend, Joanne, died. She was 25.

The film revolves around Joanne's struggle to make a living in the UK after graduation. She became an apprentice law clerk at a bank, and eventually went on to become a journalist. Joanne was also the mother of two beautiful kids.
