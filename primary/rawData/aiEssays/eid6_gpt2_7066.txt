The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Some have argued that by incorporating one or more of the original design elements into a building or building block they are setting a precedent that will only go so far. In particular, some have described them as "trash" to build.

The most obvious problem is that one might believe that those building blocks are the original. But that cannot be taken with any confidence. One thing is clear, however: a dirigible with a pilot could be built â€” by any means necessary. For example, the pilot must have experience aboard the dirigible, and must have been with the Empire State building when the first dirigible was built. With the FAA's proposal, these are required for the pilot, and the FAA had already approved the pilot's flight test, but the pilot's last full day on the flight test had already been determined. Similarly, a dirigible built by NASA could be built aboard the International Space Station.

One of the most important aspects of the proposed policy is that the FAA do not permit the installation of dirigibles. The only restrictions, caucuses and rules, are listed in the document, but not in the FAA guidance. For more on the documents, see the chart below.

How the FAA Will Allow the Development of a dirigible

At this point, a potential viewer probably has no idea what to make of the FAA guidance. The question then becomes
