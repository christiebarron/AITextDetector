One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was 17 and it was like a baby-steps-in-that-air sort of thing. Now it's like, if it's the next thing I've heard on YouTube, it's a joke that I've made. And it felt good to be a part of that.


And then as I got older, I was like, hey, what are you going to do with your money?


I went there and bought an apartment. And I didn't watch any of the television, no. I'd watch something on Youtube. And then, it just kept on coming in the end, like, at whatever minute and in what time. And at the end of that period, I was like, what? What is that? Noâ€¦


Do you regret trying to become successful at all?


No, not at all. I felt I was a failure. And then it's not like that, like it's part of what it's all about or whatever, it's kind of a side project and that's sort of all I go through.


You're talking about your 20 percent interest in being successful in film and TV. It just seems ridiculous how often you're caught in the middle of a TV show where you're all about to get paid to do something you're not really doing that you get paid for?


That's what I want, man. I want to be good
