I recently went on a vacation to a foreign country. I knew that my experience was going to be different because of the language barrier, different customs and unfamiliar surroundings. I did my best to read up on the language and culture so that I could avoid any missteps. 

This made it so that I knew what to expect, but it still took some getting used to. On my first night, I went out to dinner with a few new friends and quickly ran into a language problem when I tried to order food. I could understand the language but couldn't speak it. Everyone at the table was trying to help me figure out what to order, but it was a struggle. 

Instead of getting frustrated with the lack of progress, I stayed patient. I knew that having the patience to overcome this small difficulty would ultimately allow me to have a better experience and enjoy the culture more. I took the time to slowly sift through the menu and ask questions in broken English and finally I was able to get my food order straight. 

In the end, my patience payed off. When my food arrived, it was clear that I had made the right choice. This was one of the best meals I had on my trip and it was all thanks to me taking the time to be patient.
