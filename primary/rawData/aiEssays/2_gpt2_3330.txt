I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is, after all, constitutionally protected, because "freedom of expression is essential to the democratic system and to the rule of law." The Bill gives all people the freedom to organize a people's group. This Bill is not censorship or censorship of speech, but of course a censorship of information.

The Bill of Rights was written to protect all. I am speaking of the Bill of Rights and not anti- polity. It states that all "the rights of the people of the United States, with or without exception, shall not be infringed." And you ought to realize this Bill was written before anyone even knew you had the Bill of Rights. This Bill was written after you had learned. You never knew it existed. Now the Bill of Rights is on the agenda.

Do you support the use of surveillance of people or to harass people?

No. I don't think the use of surveillance or harassment of people is that bad. It is just that I want government to be allowed to use anything it wants. And I want people to put their safety first. I think that it is essential that those decisions happen for the community to have, that those people make decisions based onOGR. That is precisely what I want. And there are an awful lot of folks who oppose that. I don't.

Is the Bill of Rights based on right and wrong if you can't fight for the laws?

Yes.
