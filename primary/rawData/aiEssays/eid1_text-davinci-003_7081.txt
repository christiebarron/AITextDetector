To the editor,

Public libraries play an important role in our society as centres of learning, exploration and creativity. But this role should not extend to censorship of material deemed ‘offensive’ by some. The removal of books, magazines, music, and movies from the shelves of libraries that are considered by some to be controversial is a direct attack on our free speech. 

The power to choose what we read, view, and listen to should be a personal responsibility. Libraries should make available to all citizens a wide variety of materials for a range of attitudes and opinions, some of which might appear to be ‘offensive’ by a minority. This will allow people to gain further insight into different points of view and cultures. 

Censorship is not the answer to controlling offensive material. Those that feel uncomfortable with certain materials must be free to choose what they do with the materials they find at the library, without libraries taking it upon themselves to remove them from the shelves. 

Libraries should also impose restrictions on those who would exploit the materials, such as age restrictions to ensure minors are protected from the more explicit material. But this should not be at the expense of freedom of speech. 

In conclusion, libraries should provide a wide variety of information on their shelves without initiating censorship. Personal responsibility should be left to those who use the materials. We must be cautious that our sense of ‘offensiveness’ does not cloud
