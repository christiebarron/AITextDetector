The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it has an almost-perfect relationship with the novel Spring Hibiscus that sees both characters' love stories begin, with a couple of teenage lovers going nowhere before falling in love at a critical juncture and finding the two of them ready to make history together.

Winter Hibiscus is a real treat and the best book I've read for a while now. It's not the next best thing; when you see this book, you won't be disappointed. It's great, but there's the mystery of who is who and how. If I do have a bad day on the book's shelf here, I have it. The cover of Winter Hibiscus in the U.S.A. is fantastic for a modern-day Christmas book. The book is still the best book I've read here. The illustrations are very nice, they're just right and they're so fun to read.

I really enjoyed the new cover artwork of Winter Hibiscus. I've been very pleased with the cover. It's a very nice, cool, well drawn photo of the world. I didn't even realize how much I loved my cover until I went back for more and it finally made sense how they had it.
