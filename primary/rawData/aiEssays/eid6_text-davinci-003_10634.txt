The construction of the Empire State Building in New York City in 1931 presented an interesting challenge â€“ that of providing a mooring mast for dirigibles to dock. Although the initial plan of the building included a dock for zeppelins, the engineers had to contend with several obstacles before they arrived at a viable solution.

The first major obstacle was the location of the docking mast. It needed to be positioned in such a way that the airships would have time to slow down and line up properly for docking, but it could not interfere with the high-traffic airspace around the building. The designers settled on the eastern side of the skyscraper so that the dirigibles approaching from the harbor would have ample time to decelerate and align with the mast once they were close to the building, and rather than being in the way of other planes and airships, they would be in an isolated part of the city. 

The second obstacle was the strength of the mast itself. It had to be rigid enough to retain the cable used to draw in the airships, and strong enough to withstand the fluctuations of the current, yet light enough that it didn't overly impede the plane's course. The engineers eventually determined that a steel mast was the best solution, since it was strong enough to do the job, yet thin enough to be lightweight. They also designed the mast to have a taper shape, which allowed the cable to be pulled up more easily and quickly
