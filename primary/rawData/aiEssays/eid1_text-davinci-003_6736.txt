Dear Editor:

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. In a world that is increasingly becoming reliant on technology, it is essential to evaluate the implications that come along with computer use, both positive and negative. 

The primary benefit of computers is convenience. They have made it easier to stay connected, to access information, and to manage time. The use of computers has made it possible to work and study from home. This is especially essential during the coronavirus pandemic, as it reduces the risk of infection due to decreased contact with people and surfaces. 

Unfortunately, there are also negative effects associated with computers. People can become overly reliant on them, developing unhealthy habits that detach them from social interaction, the environment, and activities that could be beneficial to physical and mental health. There is also an increased risk of data breaches, as well as emotional distress from long hours of use. 

For these reasons, we must be mindful of how we use computers. While computers are an important part of modern society, it is essential to use them responsibly and in moderation. We must strive for a balance between the convenience of technology and living our lives in a healthy and mindful way.
 
I hope you share my viewpoint and work with us to make sure that computer use does not come at the expense of our health and well-being.

Sincerely, 
[Name]
