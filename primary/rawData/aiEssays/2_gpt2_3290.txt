I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is counterproductive, and the government should not censor and silence books," he said in a statement posted on ROK's Twitter account.

Another student at the library, who asked not to be named, said she learned about the anti-censorship law in September. "It is against the law and I don't like it," she said.

"This seems like a big step forward in their attempt to make books and ideas safe for reading," said Yashin Boushka, 22, who has used the online platform Rok to post his own information on the issue.

"I found many different books and books that were censored and sometimes even that were in the library, which is very surprising because there's always a debate among the critics of censorship. But I didn't think that they were trying to make books safe for reading."

But in a statement to reporters earlier this month, the ROK said it will hold discussions with students about future policies on censorship of "sensitive academic journals." It didn't immediately recall when the consultation on banning books began, nor did it elaborate on when those discussions could take place.

A copy of a letter signed by 13 writers from the ROK's "deep concerns" committee says some of those who had been removed from editing the paper said they wanted to be notified ahead of the consultation. The letter also says that some books made copies of the draft before an editor.
