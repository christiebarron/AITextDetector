In Joe Kurmaski's short story "Rough Road Ahead," the setting affects the cyclist, Marcus, in several distinct ways. For one, the terrain of the road on which he is riding has a number of obstacles, including potholes, frost heaves, and fallen trees. The natural condition of the road impedes his progress and also makes it difficult for him to maintain his balance.

Additionally, the weather also plays an important role in this story. Marcus has to confront strong winds and rain, which make the road slick and the visibility poor. This makes it harder for him to see the obstacles, and also increases the chances of an accident.

The surrounding environment is equally as important. Marcus is riding along a desolate road with noone else around to offer help or companionship. This loneliness and lack of support increases his feelings of vulnerability and insecurity, which are already heightened by the treacherous conditions of the road.

All of these features of the setting contribute to the difficult journey that Marcus is undertaking. Although he manages to persevere in the end, the obstacles created by the setting ultimately make it hard for Marcus to reach his destination.
