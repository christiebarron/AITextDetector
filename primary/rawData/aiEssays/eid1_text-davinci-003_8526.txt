I was at the supermarket one day, and the cashier was really slow. Every customer before me had huge carts overflowing with groceries, so I expected to be waiting a while. As the cashier scanned item after item, I could tell they were getting overwhelmed, but I chose to stay patient. 

I watched as person after person made remarks and complained about the long wait, but I reminded myself that everyone was having a tough time and that the cashier was doing the best he or she could. Each time the cashier thanked me for being patient, I felt my patience and understanding rewarded. 

When my turn came, the cashier had worked through the line and was processing purchases much more quickly. Even in the face of inconveniences, I felt proud of myself for staying patient and not joining in with the complaints.
