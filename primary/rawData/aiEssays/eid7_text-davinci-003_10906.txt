I remember once when I was at the store and the line-up at the check-out counter was incredibly long. Everyone was frustratedn and some people started to get angry. Even though I was getting frustrated too, I just took a deep breath and stayed patient. I reminded myself that there was nothing I could do to change the situation and the best thing to do was to be patient.

I waited in line for what felt like forever, but I kept my frustrations in check and stayed quiet. Even though I could see people around me complaining and arguing, I kept my cool and waited patiently. 

Finally, I made it to the front of the line and was able to quickly check out. I was relieved and grateful that I had been patient and had handled the situation with composure.
