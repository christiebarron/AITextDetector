As I stood in line for tickets to the movies with my best friend, we ended up joking about the way the man ahead of us was dressed. We laughed as we threw out ideas of what he was planning to watch, coming up with outrageous possibilities.

After we got our tickets, we grabbed some popcorn and made our way to the theater. We didn't notice the man behind us until he politely asked if he could join us. Of course, we said yes and found out that he was the man we had been making fun of earlier. 

Before we knew it, we were all laughing together about the way we had been kidding around. It felt like all of us closing the gap between us and the shared moments of laughter that had formed a truly unique connection. 

In that moment, it was all of us embracing our own silliness in what had to have been one of the most unexpected meetings between strangers who had bonded through laughter. I knew then that laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people.
