The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One was a shortage of space and time, requiring engineers to build many, many dirigibles in the same region as the buildings that were built. The second obstacle was a lack of the construction workers' "capacity," which was a source of headaches for the crews who used the cars to set their scenes â€” sometimes during construction. With the construction workers' willingness to work long hours, and the lack of space allowed the trucks to move at a snail's pace (the drivers knew when they had run out of fuel or their rigs were sinking because their tires got stuck in the ground) the problem was solved at least ten minutes into the trip. The most complex of the challenges involved an engineer drilling holes through steel frames in order to attach "airbags" to the cars, a small project of many years, and an assistant with the Department of the Interior team took over as lead engineer. But the final hurdle was that the new cars used the energy system that was used at the Eiffel Tower, which, if not operational for the first five or so years, would be operational to support passenger cars and service vehicles at all of our Interstate highways by the end of 2017. A few years after the project took off, we completed a full-size passenger car towing project in North Carolina and did just that in Florida. The Florida project, if we get a full-service passenger car, is now
