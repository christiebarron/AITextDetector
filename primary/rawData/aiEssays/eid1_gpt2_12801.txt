Computers have many effects on people. The effect of a computer on others is a bit different, but as it gets more sophisticated, the effects don't stop at individual PCs, but spread into the wider population, which could ultimately have an impact on the quality of a job.

Achieving a specific level of effectiveness can be a challenge for both the researcher and the employer, but ultimately the benefits outweigh the costs. If the same research methods are applied to all types of work done on humans, then there is a positive trade-off between the cost of effective research and the overall cost of the technology, which is often called diminishing returns. It takes a while for most of the research in computer science to become effective, but it's likely to take only a few years before those who have come after it have a chance to find great value on their own.
