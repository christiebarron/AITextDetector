The specific features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead" have a profound effect on the cyclist's experience. Not only does the cyclist have to contend with a physically demanding uphill climb, they also have to navigate around large potholes, steep bends, and other obstacles such as fallen branches.

On the other hand, the deteriorating condition of the road serves as a reminder of the difficulty of the task ahead. As the cyclist progresses further in their journey, they become evermore aware of their hardships, and the physical and mental toll it is taking on them.
