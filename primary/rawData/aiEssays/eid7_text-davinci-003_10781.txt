I was grocery shopping the other day, my basket full of items. Just as I was checking out, the woman in front of me had several items that were not scanning properly. I noticed the cashier was getting a bit frustrated, but I remained patient.

Rather than getting angry or raising my voice, I waited calmly as the woman and cashier tried to resolve the issue. The cashier was able to eventually figure out the problem, and I could finally check out.

I was glad to have the opportunity to practice patience, and I was proud of myself for being able to stay composed even when the situation was stressful. It felt good to have the patience to get through difficult moments.
