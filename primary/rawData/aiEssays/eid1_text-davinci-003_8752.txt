I’ll never forget the day my boyfriend, John, and I went on a date to the local carnival. We spent the whole day walking around, trying a few different rides, and eating tons of sugar-covered funnel cake.

As our date was winding down, we walked over to the fortune-telling booth. As soon as John stepped up in front of the psychic, he started to laugh uncontrollably. It started slowly, as a light giggle, but quickly turned into a roar that the entire carnival could hear. 

At first, I was embarrassed—it felt like everyone was judging us! But then, I heard a few other amusement seekers joining in and felt a bit relieved. After that, I couldn’t help but join in. It felt like John and I were in our own private world of giggles. 

Finally, after several minutes, we managed to pull ourselves together and the psychic gave John a personalized fortune. As he read it aloud, we both laughed even harder until there were tears streaming down our faces.

The entire circumstance was ridiculous, but the moment was special. I knew then, that laughter would always bring us closer together.
