The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The most significant issue they faced was the design of the building which was not originally built for the purpose of docking airships. According to the book The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, “the idea of airships hovering and docking atop the world's tallest building—the Empire State Building—was revolutionary.” The design of the building had to be modified to accommodate the large airships, which brought with it a number of engineering challenges.

Most importantly, the top of the building had to be made much stronger in order to support the weight of airship mooring lines and airship passengers. Lüsted states that “to make the roof suitable for airship docking, two steel mooring masts were erected some 500 feet above ground level.” These masts allowed airships to attach to the roof without damaging it, and also provided an anchor for the mooring lines, allowing the airships to remain securely attached to the top of the building. 

In addition to alterations to the building itself, the airship engineers also had to account for the strong updrafts created by the building’s surrounding skyscrapers. These updrafts had the potential to blow the airships away from the building or even cause them to crash. To overcome this issue, engineers installed a system
