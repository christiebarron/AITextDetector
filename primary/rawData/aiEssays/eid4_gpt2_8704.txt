The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it tells us that the characters are in danger. All of these things are told to make them feel safer. My take is if you can say that Winter Hibiscus can't really do anything, you can't really believe it.


As that story starts I wanted to do a "safe, funny" film with a little humor that doesn't make enemies. I'd love to see a movie directed by one of my favorite directors, or I think the best way to do it is to make it funny. We do that every once in a while, we make a comedy. That'll be why I gave this film a shot that's always funny.
