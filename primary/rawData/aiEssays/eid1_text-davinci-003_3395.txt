Dear Editor,

As we become increasingly dependent on computers, it is important to examine the effects they have on us as individuals and as a society. In my opinion, the impact of computers on people is both positive and negative.

On one hand, computers advance productivity and efficiency in all industries, from finance to healthcare. They allow us to communicate and collaborate with people around the world. Computers open the door to endless opportunities for learning and discovering new technologies.

On the other hand, technology has addicted us to a constant need for connection and communication, and research has found that people who excessively use technology become more and more disconnected from reality. Computers also take away jobs from humans, eliminating the need for many human laborers.

However, I believe that with the proper regulation and guidance, computers can have a net-positive effect on society. Computers should be used to supplement humans, not replace them. We should take advantage of the many benefits computers have to offer, while minimizing the risks they pose.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
