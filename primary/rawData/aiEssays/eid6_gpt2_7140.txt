The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In his defense, Lucas said the design of the two-storey structure should have required the building's top to sit on a flat roof, not on a base. Such a design, he argues, "is what the building was designed to work with."

He said builders had no choice but to "look at other buildings across the country like [The Red House] and think about how you should take away the center of gravity in this building or that building." He later noted that the first floor design was not designed to go beyond the lower level when building the Empire State Complex was constructed.

Despite the lack of a common, common ground, "the building we were facing is probably one of the few which we've had successfully," he said, "where the original purpose would have been to hang over the top of the building for a show and show on the side."

He then added, "And we've had many shows and the building now has the ability to allow some people who would work there to hang to it for a show and go down to the side." Such use of space on the second story would not have allowed for greater seating or greater ventilation, but "there are still plenty of other spaces that don't need to be used."

During production on the show, there were no planned changes to the building's design â€” a major feature that Lucas claimed
