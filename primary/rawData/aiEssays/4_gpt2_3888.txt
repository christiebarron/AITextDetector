The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because the writing is not quite right. Winter Hibiscus is more concerned with a plot that involves several different characters and I think that could have been improved upon to make it look something more coherent and more dramatic.

It's not all bad but I do feel like there are some flaws in some parts of the book that seem to have crept into the writing, such as the use of the dragon in particular. The whole book is too far gone and I was not anticipating that.

The first book Winter Hibiscus was released was a big hit. I think even though there are plenty of things in it that you find fascinating, it's also been quite a little bit of a disappointment.

That being said, I also feel that the end of Winter Hibiscus and the end of the series should have been better. Winter Hibiscus is a real good book and it wasn't all terrible from one book to the next, but I think the book was better done with fewer elements.

I can't really comment on the writing on the show but I really enjoyed the show.

I did like that I didn't have a big focus on the world of Azeroth. The first book was actually a lot of fun to spend time with and I just wanted to say that I think there's an audience for the series and that the show needs to be in more time with that. Winter Hib
