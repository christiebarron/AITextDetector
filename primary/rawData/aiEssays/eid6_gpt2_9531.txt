The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. When the building was finished in 1933, two other new-builders, William L. Blythe Jr. and Carl A. Aulin, began building aircraft. During the 1930s, more than 300 dirigibles were built. These were housed inside the buildings, or in the airframe under an aeropower's roof canopy. The new aeropowers were not meant to take off, but were instead intended to keep them from flying off, as would occasionally happen in construction-related accidents. It was the third time in some of the aircraft parts that it had been done, but it did the job with the highest efficiency possible and had proven the best solution.

Aulin and F.A. Johnson began doing the same thing when they built the E.E. Kennedy aircraft two years later. When the first two aircraft were to be built, the A4 was the most expensive to build in the United States. The cost of a new aircraft was less than $5,000 apiece while they took time and the design was very different than the Kennedy or C-5's of the '60s.

While an American airplane was Tilea-style, this design was intended to sit on some sort of floating floor or roof. With the height of any flying object to a few hundred feet, this would allow it to stand and move freely. The idea was
