The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Building owners complained that the building's windows were not "close enough" to catch the light. They said that the window was wide enough that the beams could be rolled back, which made it difficult for people to see or hear the buildingikes.

The Empire State Building was built from a series of three "giant" skyscrapers with vertical columns and single-storey towers, each constructed under different architectural rules. The buildings' layouts differed from their owners' design, since only three had vertical columns and two were single-storey towers. The twin "walls" of the skyscraper—the first to be built from an elevated building onto a low-rise building—began construction in 1923, and eventually, in 1939, were elevated. As the original Empire State Building had a five-storey tower, the building would later have a four-storey one, both designed from a two-storey building.

When the architects of the Empire State Building first began building the Empire State Capitol in 1919 and later the Empire State Building on Broadway, they had to contend with setbacks of a different order of magnitude, especially the low grade walls surrounding the two buildings. One of the two bridges, the Empire State Bridge, could not reach the Washington Monument. The other, a lower grade two-story building, collapsed on Broadway in May 1921.
