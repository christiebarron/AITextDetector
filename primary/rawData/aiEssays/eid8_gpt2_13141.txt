One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was about 20. I got angry in front of my mother, saying that my brother and I had killed my brother's mother, to my great surprise, just the whole school was laughing at me and I thought that if I did not get them, not only would there be no other kids, but even their relatives and teachers would not be around, or anything like that. So it was funny. So, the next time we were out in the field or at school we made these silly plans. The school was running around saying, 'We were talking about something. We should have gone home later and the teacher would tell teachers, 'We went home. And we killed her.' So we got angry and said that they would never learn the rest of us.' And I told my family, "I told them I am not going to tell them, I'm just going to keep this secret until the next time we see each other." So I was still on the outside looking out at the ocean and there are many things I do now which I don't remember doing in my entire childhood. You have to ask yourself, is it any wonder these things have taken so long?"
