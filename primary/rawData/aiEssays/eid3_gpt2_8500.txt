Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. From high-frequency vibration to low-frequency vibration (typically, less than 1 Hz (Hz) per second (PV) from high-quality headphones), the 'Rough Road Ahead' setting on a driver's smartphone can create a driver's impression of a cyclist when it comes to the speed and braking.

A driver must make use of the driving experience to make a smart driving decision and, in turn, need to find a way of keeping up. A driver must always give the right amount of 'good driving' if they want the road to be safer from motor cycling.

Most common driving characteristics

Speed or braking

Fully functional tyres

Puncture marks

Bicycle collisions

Noise or noise at corners

Noise is a significant contributing factor to motor cycling speed. A range of road conditions with low or moderate impacts of sound make bicycle collision a high risk to motorists.

A study published in the British Chemical Society recently investigated the impact of noise and speed of collision, and found that it was inversely related to road characteristics such as brake speed.

It found that low-impact collisions with cyclists, compared to speeds of other road users was associated with poor cyclist safety, and increased risk of crashes.
 Similarly, the risk of collisions between cyclists in general and drivers in particular was associated with a stronger likelihood of a collision
