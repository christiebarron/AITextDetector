One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I thought, How does this thing get on so quickly? And how would you react to my reaction? "

We're talking about an extremely quick reaction. A bit of a short-winded reaction that you will feel as a person that you have no experience of before being introduced to things the old-fashioned way. If you've ever had a "normal person" do that at any time you'll love your reaction. After all there is no time limit on this feeling. But for most people this is their normal life experience. They are on their way to enjoying life that allows them to enjoy life they otherwise cannot enjoy.

And as more and more people become comfortable with things like this I'm guessing that all they're feeling will be a bit longer. And this is probably because of the nature of the medium, where you have your emotions out of focus and with no focus. If you're having a quick reaction you won't necessarily feel well with the world now, because after all there is no time limit.

Here on this blog I am more than happy to share my experience of being introduced to things that make me feel at home. I love things I haven't been exposed to in many years.

I don't have to say that I feel good if it seems like my mind would go blank or not have that clear view. I'm certainly fine with everything and I am happy with what I enjoy
