The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock, which had become popular in the early 1930s. At a height of 1,500 feet, the Empire State Building was a massive skyscraper, towering over the Manhattan skyline like never before. It quickly earned the nickname of the “Eighth Wonder of the World” and was the largest skyscraper of its time, making it a major beacon for airship travel.

At first, the idea seemed like a no-brainer and the plans to install a mooring mast to accommodate the dirigibles seemed straightforward. The mooring mast, however, presented numerous challenges that the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome. The most significant of these issues was the size of the mast – the mast had to be a minimum of 200 feet in height, which was significantly higher than any other mast before it. On top of that, it had to be exceptionally strong and stable to withstand the winds passing by at such a great height.

The engineers and architects solved this problem by designing a steel frame with a steel cable stretched between its sides. Alternately known as the “keystone stay”, this solution was strong and stable and provided a good anchor for the mooring mast. Additionally, it allowed the mast to withstand any torsional forces due to the winds. The mast itself was constructed out of steal and wrought iron and was designed to sway
