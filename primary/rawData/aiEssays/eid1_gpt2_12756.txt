Computers have many effects on people. This has nothing to do with performance, but with the right hardware the user experience increases exponentially.

But even if a computer was built for real-time, all machines can be built for these kinds of data. All of the data involved in a typical website or application is going to be very easy and simple to download and use. But all of that does not equal a complete internet experience.

As computer scientist Chris Suller once said to me: "Imagine if it were true that every single page of your book is going to be written by yourself, or by anybody elseâ€¦ In fact, you could write your own book, and it would be much more easily accessible than we are now.

"The great irony here is, is that in all the research around the world, we are actually just scratching the surface.

Now, while some of you may not understand the huge advantage of getting paid to write your own book, here you go.

A few good points:

The biggest advantage to computer science is that the information you draw on the internet is always accessible by a simple one keystroke on a keypad.

Even when we do this for a period of time, the "digital infrastructure" that makes a website great is often very complicated to understand. It may be that a user has to take a long time to read your book and can't make the internet easy for him or her
