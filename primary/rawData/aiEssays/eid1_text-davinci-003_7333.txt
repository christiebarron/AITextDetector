In the story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in various ways. The most significant feature of the setting is the rough roads, which cause problems for the cyclist as he travels along them. The cyclist has to struggle to make it through ruts, loose dirt, sand, and rocks which causes the bicycle to become covered in mud. Additionally, the cyclist faces strong winds that make it difficult for him to stay upright and require him to pedal harder.

The setting also affects the cyclist mentally. As the cyclist continues along the road, his thoughts become increasingly negative, with his doubts increasing about whether he can make it to the end of the journey. He finds himself tiring gradually and becoming more and more exhausted, which leads to further negative self-talk. He even finds himself questioning why he had started his journey in the first place.

Finally, the weather affects the cyclist physically. Although the day appears to be sunny, the cyclist is subjected to temperature changes that affect his performance. One moment he can be too hot, and the next he can be cold and sweaty. These fluctuations, combined with the rough terrain, tire out the cyclist, and the end of the journey cannot come soon enough for him.

All in all, the features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead” heavily affect the cyclist in terms of his physical condition, his mentality, and his overall performance
