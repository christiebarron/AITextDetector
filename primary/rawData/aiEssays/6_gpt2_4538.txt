The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They were building a "super" highway that would eventually pass through New York and Brooklyn on the Hudson River, a massive project that would benefit everyone in the area: businesses, people, visitors, and citizens.

But the Empire State Building's current design was to feature an entire skyscraper directly under a city center. On that roof—and it was the first of several such plans—it was envisioned as a great architectural challenge. As soon as developers realized that the towers were to be built on the same ground as two other buildings that had already been constructed in San Francisco, they turned to some innovative possibilities — they would go out of their way to construct towers on top of the existing structure. And they put them above the buildings of the other buildings on the ground in such a way that the buildings above wouldn't disturb or even harm those of the surrounding buildings.

Their plan would include three towers, each 6.5-foot tall: a two-story (7-kilometre) mixed-use hotel with a parking garage and a two-story (5.5-kilometre) detached office. There would also be a rooftop lounge near the building, the first location for a high-tech digital cinema or digital imaging system. They estimated there would be about 10 million square feet of park space, and that they would need a new parking lot — as much as 25
