The setting of Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead" has a critical impact on the cyclist's experience. 

The most important feature of the setting is the terrain itself. The mountainous terrain of the road ahead of the cyclist is described as a difficult climb, with tight turns and steep hills. The cyclist was already tired from previous but harsher efforts and is now faced with the challenge of navigating the rough and winding roads ahead of them. The terrain exerts a further challenge to the cyclist, which presents both physical and mental difficulty.

The other environment feature is the weather. It is raining, adding additional difficulty to the already trying road conditions. This makes previously difficult turns even tighter, as the tyres have less grip on the wet surface. Furthermore, the rain adds an additional challenge to the cyclist's physical workload, as they must work to keep their speed while avoiding sliding on the wet road.

These features of the setting, the terrain and the weather, both combine to make the journey ahead of the cyclist incredibly tough. The conditions of the road and the weather make it challenging to maintain speed and direction, and the hills present large physical and mental barriers to the cyclist. This combination of terrain and weather affects the cyclist's experience on the road, forcing them to confront the challenge ahead and push their own boundaries.
