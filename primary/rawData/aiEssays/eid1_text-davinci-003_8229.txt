Throughout history, ambitious projects have been completed with a common goal in mind – to break new boundaries and reach new heights – literally and figuratively. One such project, the construction of the Empire State Building, was no exception. Completed in May of 1931, the Empire State Building could have been the first ever structure in New York City to have an airship dock on its roof. However, the plan to place an airship dock was met with many obstacles as the builders sought to achieve a challenging feat.

One of the major obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building roof was the complex engineering the designers had to create. For the most part, it was decided that the dock would have to be a steel structure, due to the risk of an airship exceeding the expected landing weight. This meant that the designers would have to come up with a structure strong enough to hold fast an airship hovering above the city. The steel structure of the dock itself was an expensive undertaking and, with the overall construction already costing more money than expected, the designers had wrestle with the decision to include it or scrap the plan altogether.

Furthermore, to create a safe place for docking the airships, the designers had to come up with a system of masts on the roof, which could act as the spots for the dirigible to tie off. However, these mooring masts had to be lightweight yet strong enough in order to resist the wind when the
