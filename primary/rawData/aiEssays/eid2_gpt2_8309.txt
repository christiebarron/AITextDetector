I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is an issue because certain kinds of material that are protected under the Copyright Act, which include materials protected by copyright law, is being used or that are threatened by censorship. The legal interpretation is often left to the courts, so there is a need to balance those needs. It takes an extraordinary number of jurisdictions with a strong interest in the law to make sure that the interests of the public benefit from the protected materials. In the case of public library materials, and there is no right to suppress them, we are left with no other explanation to why that may be the case.

That's where we are not dealing with free speech. We are dealing with a law where speech has the right to get where you want to put it and to keep it. We have the right under this law [to put words in the public domain to defend certain features of public property, such as libraries], but also the constitutional right to maintain freedom of expression in the public domain. How those protections will be provided do not become part of libraries' repertoire as long as people are willing to make those kinds of requests.
