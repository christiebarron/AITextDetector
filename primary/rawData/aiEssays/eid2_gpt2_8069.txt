I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is an act against nature as well as a criminal act," he said.

The man and six children were arrested Wednesday in New Hampshire after authorities detained and restrained two people at the home of a woman who had recently passed out following a midnight skate crash. The children were taken to a hospital where their mother, who is also an executive at The Bachelorette, said the man was a "fetus."

"He was a human being, and this is not an accident," the woman said.

The men were apprehended while working in the building where they sat reading the novels, according to a statement from the state department of education.

The girl, who was still asleep in her bed, is not believed to be pregnant because she has been receiving counseling to prevent a miscarriage.
