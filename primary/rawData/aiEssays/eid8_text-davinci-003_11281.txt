I was walking home from work one day and noticed a woman in the park playing Frisbee with her dog. The sun was shining and the sound of laughter filled the air.

I couldn't help but giggle when the Frisbee flew the wrong way and nearly hit the poor woman. She turned around, saw my laughter and smiled. Soon enough, we were both in fits of laughter, and I was left feeling a connection with this stranger.

We continued our conversation, and made jokes about our day and our respective jobs. I couldn't believe how easily we connected, simply by sharing a bit of laughter and open communication. We said our goodbyes, each of us feeling a little bit lighter than when we started.

Laughter is truly an amazing thing. It can take two people from strangers to friends in a matter of minutes, which is what happened with me and that woman in the park.
