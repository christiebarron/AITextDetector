I remember one time when my daughter was having a difficult moment. She was very angry and upset and was expressing this by screaming and even throwing things around the room. I was so worried about her that I wanted to react immediately, but instead I chose to stay patient and understanding.

I took some deep breaths then paused before speaking. I knelt down to her level, looked her in the eye, and calmly asked her if there was anything I could do to help. At first, she was still very angry, but eventually she started to calm down and talk to me.

It turned out that she had been feeling neglected by me because I was getting very busy with work. She felt that I was not giving time to our family. So, instead of getting angry at her, I listened and assured her that I would make time for our family, no matter how busy things got.

Thanks to my patience, I was able to reach out to my daughter and understand what was upsetting her. I realized that while I can get busy with work, it's important to make time for family and show them that I care. I could have reacted with anger and impatience, but instead, I stayed patient and made the situation easier to solve.
