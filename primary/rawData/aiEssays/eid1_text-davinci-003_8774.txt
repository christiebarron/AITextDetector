I was out with my friend, Laura, for a walk around the park. It was a beautiful day, a perfect spring day. We were talking, catching up on life changes since we had last seen each other. As we were walking and talking, I couldn't help but notice how happy she seemed. She was always happy, but it seemed like she was trying to hide it this time. 

I asked her what was going on, and she looked away and chuckled. Thatâ€™s when I knew something was up. She told me she had met someone, and things were going really well. I was so excited for her. I asked for all the details, and as she was about to explain, I could tell she was getting embarrassed. She looked away and started giggling. 

That's when I knew she was really happy. We ended up walking around the park for an hour or so and just laughing and talking about how different our lives were becoming. It was a great time, and the feeling of joy and laughter was contagious. We both knew that as life went on, we'd have some hard times, but we could always just laugh and it made it all feel a little bit better.
