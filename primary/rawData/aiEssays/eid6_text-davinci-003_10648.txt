The Empire State Building was originally designed with an innovative feature that allowed for the docking of dirigibles. While the idea was groundbreaking at the time, the actual steps required to make this idea a reality posed many obstacles for the builders.

The first obstacle the builders faced was the actual design of the building. The plan called for the creation of a mooring mast, a tower structure that is secured to the building that allows dirigibles to attach to it. This mast had to be designed to safely hold the weight of a large dirigible and to securely attach to the building. Furthermore, it had to be able to handle variable wind forces and have a low wind profile so as not to be obtrusive to other traffic. The builders had to go through several different designs before they could create one capable of fulfilling the requirements for dirigible docking.

Another obstacle the builders encountered was the need for specialized personnel to operate the mooring mast. The building of the mast was only half the battle. For a dirigible to dock, the structure had to be able to be operated by specially trained personnel. This personnel needed both engineering knowledge and experience with dirigibles. This was an uncommon skillset at the time, and it was difficult to find the personnel needed to operate the mast.

Finally, the builders of the Empire State Building had to contend with the prevailing attitude towards dirigibles in the early 20th century. Dirigibles had been in
