The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The large, square windows were not allowed.

So, instead of using an air compressor, the builders built a vertical glass condenser and an air conditioner system. Now the condenser collects power to drive the engine and keep the building cool. To use something like this instead of using fuel is wasteful, says the author Thomas Lafferty in Architects & Engineers for 9/11 Truth.

The system would still have the power, but it would no longer be able to run all the components required to keep the building cool. It would need to be powered by external combustion engines.

"That was the problem," says David Goldin, president of 9/11 Truth, which brought up the issue of building the World Trade Center in New York without a single built-in jetliner.

Goldin and other architects discussed the feasibility of using a condenser for cooling. They suggested that an air compressor and liquid cooling could be used to store the power. A more effective solution would be a small solar panel system.

If that worked, they would now be able to build one of the largest and most expensive commercial jetliners in history, and provide "a huge public and commercial base," according to some of the architects.

"The question is, 'What's going to cost you to build a big airplane?' " Goldin says.
