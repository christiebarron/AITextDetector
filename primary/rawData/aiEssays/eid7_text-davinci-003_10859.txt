I remember a time when I was waiting in line at the supermarket and the person in front of me had a lot of items. It was taking a while for them to pay, but I was being patient. I knew that they weren’t trying to cause me any inconvenience, and I wanted to respect their time as much as possible, so I decided to wait. I distracted myself by looking at the items around the store and listening to my favorite podcast.

After what seemed like forever, the person was finally done paying and moved out of the way. I was then able to move up and pay for my items. I made it out of the store before the line got too long.

I know that being patient can be tough in those situations, especially when I’m in a rush, but it’s important. It’s a sign of respect to the other person, and it makes it a more pleasant situation for both of us. I’m glad I was able to show that patience that day.
