Dear [Editor],

As technology continues to rapidly evolve and advance, there is no disputing the time-saving and productivity benefits of computers. However, I believe it is important to examine the potential harmful effects of computers on people.

Relying too heavily on computers can lead to a decline in critical thinking skills, as computers can often do things better and faster than humans. In addition, a lack of human interaction through increased computer dependency can lead to feelings of isolation and depression.

Finally, computers can also cause physical harm if not used properly. Poor posture, eye strain and wrist and neck injuries are all possible consequences of excessive computer use.

Overall, computers can be a valuable resource and help make tasks easier and more efficient. It is, however, important to be mindful of the downsides of excessive computer use and take necessary steps to reduce unwanted effects. I urge your readers to be aware of these possible dangers so as to promote a healthier environment for all.

Sincerely,
 [Your Signature]
