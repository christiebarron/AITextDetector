The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because the reader isn't dealing with his current life and relationships. Instead their story's focus is on him in the real-life world, and how he's interacting with his former lover. I wish they had done enough to let this novel do the talking. It's not as if Hibiscus knows how to play a game like this, but rather he's playing in the real world - and that's the point. I'm sure he's made some assumptions about why he wanted to do this the first time out, and I don't think he can completely understand the reasoning behind it. Either way, Hibiscus gets the feeling that everyone in the book hates him and his work because of it. That's a perfectly ok description of a book written by someone so dedicated to creating a better, more inclusive one.

The book is so good and the characters can all do something about it. They all can.

There are other, good parts too. I really enjoyed reading this as well. I was especially impressed with the writing throughout, which makes a lot of sense considering the author already has a lot of books under his belt. The writing is very well done indeed and has some great storytelling ideas, although, I think it would have to be the worst writing I've ever seen. Some of the ideas are really entertaining and interesting but can still be a bit of a dick move.

Overall, not as
