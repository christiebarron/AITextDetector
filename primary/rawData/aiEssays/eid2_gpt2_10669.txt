I believe that censorship of materials in libraries that you own, like the public libraries, and a censorship of speech in public libraries. I believe that the public libraries have to be protected," he said.

The new legislation by Sen. Frank Kamaty (D-Calif.) would bar the state from using public money to hire lobbyists.

The bill would also ban a state agency from conducting business with a nonprofit for the purposes of lobbying the Legislature. That agency would then pay for the expenses of the policymaking.

However, lawmakers disagree over a set of proposed rules proposed in an interim resolution passed by the Senate by a 5-3 margin in April.

Lawmakers have argued their version of the bill would create a framework for regulating nonprofit status quo efforts.

Other amendments have included a ban on nonprofit and corporate-funded travel.

The bill, which passed the House, is expected to pass the Senate and the presidency before the fall elections. It would need the approval of both chambers after the next regular session.

Senate passage will be a "win-win for all of us as we work," said Rep. Paul Davis (R-Oakland).

Lawmakers would not be affected by a ban on lobbyists or other private donors.
