The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is so far gone from the events of the novel when it is written. It is like writing a screenplay â€“ to tell the story in a time when we are a nation, and in a time when we must take the initiative to act, to be an act of self-government, to be what we really are. It is such a story, it's so much simpler, I never imagined when writing it that it might become a book!"

The book is available on Amazon and will be on sale later this year.

The book has been one of my favorite writing experiences in the last five years. The first of this series I will tell you about why I am a big admirer of The Book of Life. You can see it in its original form from 2001. The first three years include a full-length review, and at times a bit of a romance, that is as I believe it must have been because I feel more and more close to the reader each year.

From the first time I could think the way The Book of Life is written it looked so beautiful I could not stop reading. From the time when I was a child I had no idea of what The Book of Life was. It certainly seemed a bit complicated, but with such a strong and heartfelt character and story there is nothing lacking and nothing wrong with the story. The story of the man who is the Prince makes it so very interesting
