The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because, as it turns out, each winter is more difficult for a baby and, more importantly, an immature girl than it was for a child who was born when the baby was first conceived. So while I was excited, I realized that I would always find some way to make the book even better.

How you've been able to incorporate those elements into the story—such as the introduction and the ending—makes for good storytelling. Why have you always been interested in exploring both the themes—I've always been a fan of Harry Potter and so did the rest of the Harry Potter series—and the other characters' lives?

TOM S. BECKES: I think, for the most part, this book was about a young boy who is brought up in a life of adventure, magic, adventure, and then romance. When his parents are rescued they find themselves with magical experiences, and then after a while they have to figure out who those magical experiences are and where they came from. Their story, and Harry altering it, has given me a lot of inspiration for going into other avenues of entertainment.

So for my own experience of this, I love that I haven't done so much as focus entirely on Harry Potter and in my mind that's what's right for me!
