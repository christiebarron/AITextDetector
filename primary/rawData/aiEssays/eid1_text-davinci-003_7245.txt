In Joe Kurmaski's poem, 'Rough Road Ahead', he paints a vivid picture of a cyclist who is entering a rugged terrain that will challenge them in many ways. The cyclist is aware that the terrain they are entering is anything but comfortable—it is even described as being “like a horror movie.” The poem explores the many features of the setting that the cyclist is warned of, and which ultimately affects the cyclist's experience. 

The air is described as “fierce and raw”—signaling that the cyclist can expect a challenge in their journey. There is also a sense of danger around them, signified by “a whisper in my head like thunder.” This could be meant to signify the cyclist’s fear or doubts about the danger of the journey ahead. 

The landscape is said to be an “unreal labyrinth," creating a sense of confusion and disorientation, making the entire journey seem daunting. As the cyclist rides forward, they pass by “fences that defined me”—a metaphor for external pressures that might be inhibiting them. Likewise, the cyclist is warned of “shadows lurking with intent”—forbidding the cyclist from entering certain areas. 

These various features of the setting—the fierce raw air, the whispered warnings, the bewildering labyrinth, and the fences and shadows--all work together to challenge the cyclist's journey
