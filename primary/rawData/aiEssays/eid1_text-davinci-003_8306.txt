I was recently on vacation in a foreign country. I was running late to catch my train and I was feeling nervous and uncertain. I made it to the station just as I was supposed to board the train, but I realized I'd left my ticket at the hotel. 

The train was already beginning to move and the station attendant was already walking away. I thought for sure there was no way I could get on the train, but to my surprise he stopped and turned around. He calmly stepped back to the gate and allowed me to board while he waited patiently for me to find my ticket. 

He didn't need to do this, but his patience was such a blessing. It was a reminder that there are kind people out there who are willing to go out of their way to help. I am immensely grateful for his patience and understanding.
