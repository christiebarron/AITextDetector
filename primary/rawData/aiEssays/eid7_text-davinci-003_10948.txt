I recently went through a really difficult time in my life and a close family member of mine was extremely helpful and supportive. One particular day when I was feeling really overwhelmed, I called them for support. 

My family member was busy at the moment, and although they wanted to help me they couldn't talk right away. I was feeling really anxious and desperate for support, so I was frustrated at the situation. Rather than getting angry, they stayed calm and patient with me. They kindly reminded me that a quick phone call would not be the end of my challenges, and that if I was patient with myself and the situation I could work out something to help me in the long run. 

I agreed that staying patient was important, and although I was ready for a quick fix in the moment, my family member helped me to be patient and look at the bigger picture. I am very grateful for their support and understanding during this difficult time.
