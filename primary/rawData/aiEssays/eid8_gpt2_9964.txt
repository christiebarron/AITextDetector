One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was sitting at home sitting in my garden staring at the ceiling with the fire, which made a huge noise and made me stop for a moment to make sure I was breathing, because as soon as I sat that voice in my head told me to get up, to get out of my house, because my father died three days after being shot."

She had also seen an older man he knew in his 40s, he had recently left his house. The man who had shot him went on to be buried in rural North Wales, where his body was buried in a ditch.

Ms Jones said: "He (the deceased man) was a good friend of mine. They were brothers and their son had recently left for Northern Ireland to stay with his family.

"Their son had been killed six months before they came and went with him. They would often watch each other at my house, and would take baths as they passed by each other."

The inquest remains open until May 7 2017.
