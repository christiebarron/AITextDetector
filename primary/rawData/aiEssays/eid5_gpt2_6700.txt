The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' was decidedly somber at times, and the writing continued without stopping.

The book's tone was mostly upbeat, with more positive and optimistic characters in every book. There were some brief glimpses of the "real world and a strange future and the 'truths' of history are all for naught" about which others weren't aware. A sense of hopefulness and hope for the times in question were shown.

The book was short and concise through the end of the book - something I have struggled with with for years. But I found it very enjoyable.

As you will see, 'From Home is' is a very enjoyable read for any of us.

I appreciate that it is a book written on some of the stuff that I was taught at a young age. I would suggest to you to think about how to write your own story for yourself, and how you can do it better.

Don't be scared, be grateful. 'The Truth, The Truth-and-Life' is a great book; it provides some positive and hopeful stuff. It's a must read for anyone who's into science fiction.
