I remember it like it was yesterday. I had been living near a park for a few weeks with a neighbor from my apartment complex. We'd chat regularly, but that day we decided to take a walk in the park and have an afternoon of people watching and exchanging stories.

As we walked, we took in all the sights. The sun was shining, the trees were in bloom, and the birds were out in full force, singing their songs to the sky. 

We stopped and watched a couple of kids on bikes, zigzagging around each other, laughing hysterically. We both smiled at their enthusiasm and soon found ourselves laughing right along with them. It wasn't a loud laugh, it was a soft and subtle one, like a blanket that slowly covers you in warmth. 

The sound of our shared laughter felt so natural. We laughed and joked for hours, the sun had already started to set. In that moment we connected on a level deeper than just words. Since that day we have been the best of friends and continue to laugh together. I have to thank those kids on bikes, because without them we would have never found the joy of that shared laughter.
