Dear Editor,

As technology advances, the influence of computers on our lives has been undeniable. Computers have revolutionized our lives and with their great potential and power comes great responsibility.

With computers, the possibilities are endless. They allow us to do work quicker and more efficiently than ever, and they open up a world of possibilities from communicating with colleagues to entertainment and more. With the advent of computers, we can do almost anything we want - research, shop, and even work remotely - and the potential for creativity and collaboration is greater than ever before.

However, computers have their drawbacks. They can be addictive, leading to loss of sleep, concentration, and moderation. Overdependence on computers can lead to physical ailments, such as eye strain, back aches, and headaches. Also, the rise of cyberbullying, online predators, and information theft are constantly looming dangers.

It is clear that computers can bring about both positive and negative effects on society. We must be mindful of the risks associated with computers and use them responsibly. Education surrounding computer use should be encouraged and more resources should be available to assist those dealing with computer addiction.

Thank you for your time and for giving me the opportunity to share my views. 

Sincerely,
[Name]
