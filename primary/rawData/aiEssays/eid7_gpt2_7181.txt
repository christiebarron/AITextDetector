An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a hospital employee. We were standing at a pharmacy when we'd receive the call - we'd gotten an alert from health care that there was a woman sitting on the floor. We immediately took a deep breath and went to find out what the situation was. A nurse, we learned, told a patient that she had received a note from the doctor: she had three or four more days of her day off. She called and spoke to her hospital friends for hours, but they couldn't get the message right as she was being treated. They said the nurse was out of town, she had to change people's shoes, and she was not making room for her bed or any other part of her body. I remember her saying, "I know I'm not good enough to die now," like, "You're not going to make room for me at all."

In any case, doctors have to keep their fingers crossed that it won't happen again.

What can go wrong?

When my wife met a few decades ago my life changed. She'd lost a great husband (inSerial). She'd been pregnant and in a desperate romantic situation, but for every time we met she'd get an alert from a health professional, which is when our husband could see that the hospital was closed, we'd get an alert from the doctor, who's not usually looking for me, but might look for a good reason
