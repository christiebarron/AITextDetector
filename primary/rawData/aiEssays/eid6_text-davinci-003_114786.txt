The Empire State Building, the iconic New York City skyscraper, is famous for its grandeur and for its daring architecture. The building was designed with the capacity to accommodate dirigibles, the giant airships that roamed the skies of the 1930s. However, designing something as ambitious as a mooring mast suitable for a so-called ‘gigantic airy sailing ship’ was not a simple process - the builders of the Empire State Building were confronted with a number of obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. 

The first obstacle was the size of the mooring mast. A mooring mast must be taller than the largest airship that needs to dock there; on top of that, the mast would need to be stable enough to withstand the winds that the airships generate as they are mooring. The mooring mast that the engineers and architects chose for the Empire State Building had to be particularly large, as the airship they wanted to dock there, the USS Los Angeles, was longer than three football fields! 

The second obstacle the designers of the mooring mast faced was accommodating the airships’ need for power. Electricians had to create a powerful, 300 hp motor in the base of the mast that could transfer electricity from the building to the airship. This was a difficult engineering task, as the 300hp motor was able to generate enough electricity to power a small town. Additionally,
