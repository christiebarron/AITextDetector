Dear Editor,

It is widely accepted that computers have had almost unimagined positive effects on the world. From automation of entire industries to cutting edge developments in research and medicine, computers have revolutionized the way we live our lives. But the effects of computers on the people who use them has been largely overlooked.

As an educator, I witness firsthand how technology can detract from healthy social interactions as children spend more and more time isolated from each other in front of screens. Studies have linked an increase in usage of electronics to decreases in physical activity, contributing to unhealthy childhood weight gain and even depression.

The connection of technology to decreased meaningful communication is particularly concerning, setting the stage for a reduction in caring and empathetic relationships throughout life. There are numerous applications that can send a text but don't require a thoughtful and personal response. It's a concerning vision of a future in which meaningful emotional bonds are replaced by convenient, frequently superficial interactions.

This is something that we must be aware of and fight against. Technology can be an incredible tool to enrich our lives but we must remain conscious of the potential hazards and strive to find the necessary balance in its use. My hope is that society will heed this message and
