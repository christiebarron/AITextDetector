Censorship in libraries is an important issue that should be discussed. Libraries are meant to be places of learning and interest where people can gain access to a wide range of materials, but it is not proper for them to contain items that are considered offensive. 

According to the American Library Association, libraries should provide materials and information that reflects the interests, needs, and views of all communities. As long as materials do not include obscenity, they should not be censored. Books, music, movies, and magazines containing material that may be seen as offensive are an important part of our culture and not all readers share the same opinion. Such materials should be made available to provide different perspectives on a variety of topics. 

However, libraries should be aware that some materials can be offensive to certain people and should practice inclusion. Materials should not solely be removed from the shelves because they are considered offensive, but library staff should partner with patrons to identify resources that may contain material seen as offensive and provide alternatives. Libraries should also provide materials that are sensitive to the needs of the community and to different groups. Providing a variety of viewpoints is important for growth and constructive discussion of various topics. 

Censorship in libraries has been highly debated and as the country moves forward to protect diverse voices, libraries should follow suit. Libraries should not censor materials, however they should provide resources to meet the needs of different interests, ages, backgrounds, and cultures without taking away any perspectives
