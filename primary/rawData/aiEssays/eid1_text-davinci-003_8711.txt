As I took the stage to give my first college speech, I could feel my hands shake and my stomach churning. This was terrifying and the butterflies in my stomach were making me even more anxious. I wanted to make a good impression on the students and faculty but I was so nervous I didn't know how I'd manage it.

Then, to my surprise, the audience started to laugh. It was a light-hearted chuckle and it started to ease some of the tension I was feeling. I wasn't sure what was funny but I figured I'd just go along with it. So, I flashed them a sheepish smile and started again.

This time, the audience laughed louder. Suddenly the audience and I were engaged in a light-hearted banter, and I was no longer anxious. I had found myself in a comfortable connection with the audience, one that was more than just talking. The entire experience was a lot of fun, and by the end of it, the entire audience had been laughing and cheering with me!

There is something special about the power of laughter and it's ability to bring us together. Even in the most serious or vulnerable moments, it can be a great unifier. For me, that experience at my college speech was a turning point in my lifeâ€”it showed me the importance of building relationships with others through laughter.
