Dear Editor,

I write to express my opinion about the effects of computers on people.
In this era of digital overload, computers have become a necessary part of our lives. They store our memories, connect us to our friends and family, and are used for work and entertainment. But, with this newfound influx of advanced technology, there are some potentially negative effects computers have on people.

The first is the health effects. Too much computer usage can cause us to become sedentary and neglected, leading to physical and psychological health problems. Eye strain is another common problem from long periods of time in front of a computer screen. We are also exposed to various online threats such as cyberbullying, hacking, and online predators.

The second are the detrimental changes in our behavior. Our sense of community and understanding from personal relationships have dwindled, leaving us feeling lonely and disconnected. Moreover, our attention spans have become shorter and some of us even rely on computers to provide answers instead of thinking for ourselves.

Finally, computers may be taking away jobs from people. Although they are often a source of income, computers make many positions obsolete and make it harder for people to earn wages.

It would be foolish
