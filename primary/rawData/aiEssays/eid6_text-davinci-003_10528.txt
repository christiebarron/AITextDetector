The engineering feat of the Empire State Building was an extraordinary one accomplished by the various builders. From 1931 to 1941, they worked on the building, facing the obstacles and constraints of its height, pre-existing structures and the development of a docking mechanism for an aircraft. The idea of a "mooring mast" to bring dirigibles into the top of the building was one that was both exciting and challenging.

The mooring mast obstacle was particularly daunting for the engineers of the Empire State Building. The idea of having a metal pole that could reach the 3000+ feet of the Empire State Building and hold a dirigible’s weight was considered impossible. The mooring mast needed to reach nearly 200 feet into the sky, and had to be constructed in a way that would keep the aircraft from spinning or slipping in unpredictable winds. To make matters more difficult, the mast could not obstruct the view from the top of the building or the air traffic around it.

The engineers worked to create a potential solution and eventually determined the only way to make the mooring mast a success was to create a track-like system that allowed for the axle of the aircraft to pass through it. The axle would be secured with locking mechanisms that did not compromise the aircraft’s balance in flight. This track-like system was also designed to mount the mast to the building structure using special pins that were installed in the outer wall of the building to keep the mast from
