When my husband and I first started dating, we went to the movies to see our favorite stand up comedian. Now, I've always been a fan of his work, but what I didn't expect was for us to be sitting in the most uncomfortable seats in the entire theatre. 

We started out the night a little awkward and uncomfortable, but as soon as the comedian appeared on stage all of that changed. We were both cracking up to all of his hilarious jokes and by the end of the performance, we were both in stitches. 

When it was time to leave, my cheeks were literally sore from laughing and smiling so much. That experience is something I will never forget, because it was such a pivotal moment in our relationship. 

To this day, we can still share a good laugh like that night and it always brings us back to the beginning of our relationship. Laughter is definitely the shortest distance between us.
