The task of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was a daunting challenge for its builders in the early 20th century. Despite intense public interest and immense engineering and technical obstacles, the dream of large, airships docking at the iconic structure remained an unfulfilled ambition. 

The idea to make the Empire State Building a stop for dirigibles, or airships, first arose in the 1930s, after the building was completed. The thinking was that it could act as a link between New York City and other cities such as Paris, France. The concept was attractive because it would offer a luxurious way of traveling that evoked a sense of romance and adventure. 

The crux of the issue, however, was the technical impossibility of allowing passengers to disembark in a hinge-less dirigible at the promontory of the Empire State Building. As described in Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s book ‘The Mooring Mast’, the challenge was immense. Dirigibles lacked engines that could generate enough force to maneuver themselves against the effects of strong winds, which meant they needed to be moored with a connection to a tall structure. As a result, a mast had to be installed in the middle of the Empire State Building’s crown, about 14 stories above its crown. 

The task of building the mast was not easy. Many engineers questioned whether they could quickly develop a mast that could withstand
