Dear Editor,

Today, more and more people use computers for a variety of reasons, and it's important to understand the impact that technology has on our society. Computers are essential tools that can be used for a variety of tasks, including communication, entertainment, and research. However, there is a downside to this trend.

I believe that the overuse of computers can lead to an increase in sedentary lifestyles and poor physical health. Individuals who spend all their time in front of the computer monitor, tapping away on the keyboard and playing video games may forget how important it is to get outside and get some exercise. Moreover, frequent computer use can lead to sleep deprivation, which can have a detrimental effect on productivity.

On the other hand, computers can also improve peopleâ€™s lives. Computers allow people to communicate with others from all around the world, access information in an instant, and carry out tedious tasks with relative ease. Additionally, many people who cannot afford to attend college or enroll in formal training courses often turn to the internet in order to receive an education.

At the end of the day, computers are here to stay and can be used for both good and bad. We must ensure that we use our computers responsibly and be mindful of their effects on our physical and mental health.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my opinion on the effects of computers on people. 

Sincerely, 
[Your Name
