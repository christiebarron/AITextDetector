An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a man who did not feel like he had an obligation to help someone other than himself. His friends thought he was a bully, but he was a good guy and loved everyone he met. But when someone was suicidal, they believed that if his friends understood his suicidal urges, they and he could talk to them. As the doctor observed, they felt they must not talk to him: "I can hardly believe it." I recall feeling frustrated at her for not communicating with him.

It might seem contradictory since she does not know what he needs or what he expects, and often, when he does need someone, she would say, "You are too drunk to drink right now!" But I have never met one in my life who did not feel his needs and needs were being met. We are not meant to talk about it. Her reaction would be, "So you want help, you must have been drinking for an hour or two. I hope you are understanding your needs. Or as long as it doesn't hurt you, you can talk to them, so long as you understand what is going on."

She would respond, "Yeah, but no one understands my needs. How am I supposed to know how you care about this? It just happens that you know exactly what I care about."

I said that I think I really did understand her needs. And this, my friend, helped me to understand
