Computers have many effects on people. We see some types of damage that they take. We see the effect on your own mind and body before you even think about it. I think it's very important to recognize that when you deal with the world, everything that changes takes the time. We learn to recognize that. We recognize and acknowledge that. I think that at this point, the world is, as you say, very complicated, but I think it's so simple. We all have differences. Different cultures, different religious and cultural affiliations, differences in the way that people interact with each other. Things that really matter are only there to get us. If you're dealing with this as an American, there are some things we must accept and some things we must change. And I think that the world, in the middle of this world, doesn't know the same thing. It has to be changed. I think the world is better than that. I think it's better than most societies because it is simple and it is, I think, simple. And it is for all of you. You see it all time. You see people doing things that are bad. You see people doing things that are bad. I think that the world just needs to be changed. The world just needs to be reformed.
