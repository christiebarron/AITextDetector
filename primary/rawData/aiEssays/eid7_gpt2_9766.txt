An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the time the patient told me that it would be best if he was going to see Dr. David M. Oreskes. Since it took me about 30 minutes to walk to see all of Dr. Oreskes's patients, it took me at least 7 tries before I made it to Dr. Oreskes. Finally I saw Dr. Oreskes at 8:30 because he was the first doctor I had spoken with at and I was going to see him at 11:30.

You can read the comments and comments posted by Dr. Oreskes in the threads here. Dr. Oreskes received a visit at 11:50. I would have heard him say he liked us to talk and did not get into any kind of argument.

"I was glad to see that Dr. Oreskes would always be there. I was glad that when I was at home having fun with my friends we could see each other face to face and not over talk."

"I'm glad he was there and I wish the medical staff were here more to help him"

The doctor and the clinic are both involved in care for patients and care for the community and are involved in building local medical facilities.
