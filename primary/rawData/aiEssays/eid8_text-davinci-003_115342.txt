I will never forget the time my best friend and I laughed so hard it felt like our stomachs were about to burst. We were walking together in the park one summer day, when my friend made a silly remark about something I couldn’t quite recall now. At the time, it seemed like the funniest thing I had ever heard.

We burst out laughing so hard we could barely keep ourselves straight. We laughed for what felt like hours, unable to take our eyes off each other as we kept cracking up. Even when we tried to compose ourselves, it would start up again. I think a passerby even stopped to watch us in our fit of laughter.

After that, we just looked at each other in mutual understanding. It felt like a moment of connection– a feeling that I know I’ll never forget. It was then that I fully understood the power of laughter and its ability to bring us closer together.
