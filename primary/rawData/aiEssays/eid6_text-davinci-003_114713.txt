The project to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building was a highly ambitious undertaking that presented a number of notable engineering challenges for the builders of the iconic structure. The building’s design incorporated a 200-foot mooring mast atop the 102-story edifice, which was required to enable the large airships to securely anchor. 

The idea of allowing dirigibles to dock in New York City was met with both anticipation and trepidation. The prospect of New York City becoming the central hub for transatlantic air transport was exciting, but the engineers carrying out the project needed to ensure that the mooring mast—the anchor for the airships—was designed to exact specifications. Any missteps in the design could prove disastrous.

The sizing of the mooring mast was one of the biggest obstacles that the Empire State Building’s builders faced. At 200-feet, the mast had to be able to withstand the immense pull from a fully loaded dirigible. If it could not support the load, the airship would crash, and the Empire State Building could incur serious winds damages. To ensure the strength of the mooring mast, the builders made sure to incorporate the strongest material available—titanium. It was essential as, unlike steel, titanium had the ability to withstand the extreme temperatures created by airships’ engines. 

Another challenge that the Empire State Building’s builders confronted was the
