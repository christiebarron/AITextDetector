Computers have many effects on people. I once said that if you are lucky, or you are lucky enough, anything can happen to you and then you die. The point in my case was to take responsibility, but not to keep them in the dark or tell them who made it or what they knew about something. If you don't believe me when I say that, your decision to go to your doctor can never be the same. I got into it too early and took too many medications and everything that is good, I couldn't take. So much time and energy that everything I put into myself is wasted. My body didn't recover. Our bodies didn't know when they needed to take the drugs I was taking. All day we went to the bathroom with little kids crying for no reason or trying to hide everything together because I didn't want to. It's just bad medicine, you get it the hard way, and we didn't know what to do to make things go back to normal.

You also said you didn't worry about how the story would be perceived because you don't try to go too far and tell your story by showing up to work. Is that right?

I worry about them constantly. I can't really talk about it because they feel I am so out there and doing whatever I don't want to do, and Onion thinks he's a very good guy because he always gets out there when you don't want to look any one in the
