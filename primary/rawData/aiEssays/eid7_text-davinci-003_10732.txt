I remember one time when I was back in middle school. I had to give a presentation in front of the entire class and I was incredibly nervous. As I was presenting, I completely forgot one of my points and got completely flustered. To make the situation worse, I started to blush and felt like everyone was laughing at me. 

But my teacher, Mrs. Singh, was incredibly patient with me. She waited for me to finish what I had to say and when I pause for too long due to forgetting what I was saying, she stepped in and calmly prompted me on my next point. She continued this every time I got lost and was extremely encouraging and understanding the whole time. 

Mrs. Singh's patience helped me to complete my presentation without completely embarrassing myself, and I am forever grateful for her understanding during that time.
