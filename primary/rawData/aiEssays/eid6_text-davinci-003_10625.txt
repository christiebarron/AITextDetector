The Empire State Building was one of the 20th century’s architectural wonders, yet few know that it faced obstacles when it came to allowing dirigibles to dock. “The Mooring Mast,” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, tells the story of the battle between the forces of technology and engineering against the winds and storms of Mother Nature. It is a tale of achievement that shows that with a “can-do” attitude, anything is possible. 

The challenges of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building were substantial. The building was not designed for the purpose of dirigible docking, therefore the first task was to build a large mast extending out from the top of the building, and create an additional 400-foot mooring anchor at the bottom of the mast. This posed a serious safety concern since the mooring mast was located so high, but engineers determined that the cables holding the mast in place were strong enough to withstand the powerful winds and storms of New York City.

The next obstacle was to create an air-tight lock for the dirigibles to enter. This was done by installing heavily insulated steel doors that could be closed when a ship entered the lock. This would allow the dirigibles to land safely and avoid being blown about. Attached to the mooring mast, an interlock system was installed which allowed the airlock to be opened without having to open the entire
