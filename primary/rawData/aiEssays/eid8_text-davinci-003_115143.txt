I was having lunch with a good friend of mine. We always have a lot of fun together but today was particularly light-hearted. We were chatting about our plans for the weekend and ended up getting into a silly argument about where we should go for dinner. We argued for a few minutes until suddenly, we simultaneously burst out laughing. I mean, it really seemed that funny at the time!

We laughed until our sides hurt and had to wipe away tears of laughter. I looked around the restaurant, embarrassed that we had drawn attention to ourselves. But it was catching! Some of the other patrons were chuckling too and some even joined in.

I’ll never forget that moment and how important it was for our friendship. I’m so thankful that we were able to share in something so special and that laughter is the shortest distance between two people.
