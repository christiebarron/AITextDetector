I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is also necessary in light of the history of digital communication. It will serve to expose and control censorship of the Internet."

In a statement issued by New York Times, Thomas said they would comply with "state laws and regulations that govern the use of digital information in the public interest."

However, the NYT noted the new policy of the Library of Congress forbids all public libraries from receiving federal data that could be turned over to the government to comply with the DMCA. "While this action would be consistent with current law, it does not explicitly provide authorities to allow states that have enacted statutes or policies that restrict access to copyrighted data to determine what data may not be disclosed to the federal government," the newspaper stated.

"The Library of Congress did everything in its power to make sure that a copy of the DMCA would be available when it was made available," New York Times reported.

In the meantime, New York Times called on federal government agencies "to do the right thing, instead of using their own discretion and in public schools and libraries to censor all of our information and free speech, including our books," adding that the "publicity of public health and the public safety at large is central to our work."
