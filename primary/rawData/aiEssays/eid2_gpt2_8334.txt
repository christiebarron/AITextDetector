Not only does this claim make it seem like censorship in libraries does something to counter copyright infringement, it creates a "lack of common ground" in which "there is a lack of any common-sense" regarding whether or not to punish content creators for distributing or distributing them, such as it is with the news that censorship of content is "more censorship". The more we have to explain what this means, the less important it is for us all to know about this important topic.
