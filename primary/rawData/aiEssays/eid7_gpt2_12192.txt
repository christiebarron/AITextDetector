An example of a time someone in my life was patient was seeing me in a hospital for an extended period of time. I was looking at the doctor, which was the same girl she is in. When they came into her room, I saw, in a strange way, a very big and heavy metal penis in my palm. I was struck with a profound sense of loss, of just having come on top of a woman.

And I've done things like this with my doctor, like taking her to have her breast removed. Or that was that. I thought back to my mother, about my mother for three or four years, my friend, at one time or another, where she gave me oral baths to relieve her pain. It took quite some time just to realize that that was true. Of course, I remember it and I think she had some sort of kind of a reaction. So, I remember feeling, as I was trying to figure it out, that I was not just suffering. She was probably quite angry with me as well, because, and I suppose I can't possibly remember what he said and what he said about other people, but I can't help but think that it was part of what she was trying to do and that, perhaps, he got it. Whatever it was, it's kind of a way of thinking about a woman after that trauma in which you get to see something that is very emotional and not one that needs to be dealt with.
