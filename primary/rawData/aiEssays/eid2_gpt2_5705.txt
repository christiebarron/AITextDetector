I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is an important tool, one that many libraries are using every day – whether the book is appropriate for students in the classroom or not – to ensure that it is not the object of any harassment or retaliation.

My experience with censorship on Facebook recently has been very interesting. The community had a few concerns about certain accounts on the site. My concerns are mainly with blocking content that is inappropriate for students, people of color and LGBT people, and in particular if it is not on a large scale, such as political comments, but also for content that I see in large and large scale public spaces and social media and for any material that may be objectionable in other media to the public. It also serves as an important tool for community to avoid negative reactions in the workplace. Although some of these concerns have been addressed in the past, it might not be entirely clear how to ensure that it does not trigger a disproportionate response. That said, one of my previous blog posts was recently about the possibility that some of the censorship may be going much too far.
