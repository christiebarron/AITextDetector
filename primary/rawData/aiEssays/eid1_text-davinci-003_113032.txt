Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my opinion on the impact computers have had on people and why I believe readers should agree with my views.

Today, computer technology is being utilized more than ever. This technology provides countless benefits such as expanding knowledge and entertainment through the internet, providing an avenue for communication, and saving time. On the downside, however, access to wrong information, cyber bullying, and health problems associated with long-term computer use are among the issues.

In my view, the overall effects of computers have been hugely beneficial for humans. They have made life easier and more convenient. People now have more opportunities to further their knowledge and complete tasks that could be difficult or tedious without computers. They are also able to access vast sources of information and communicate with people around the world.

That being said, computers also have their drawbacks. There are potential dangers associated with long-term computer use, including eye strain, carpal tunnel syndrome, and mental degradation due to staring at a screen for long periods.

In conclusion, while computers have their drawbacks, they have been immense assets for individuals and the world. Without computers, the world today would be a very different place. I am confident that readers agree with me that the benefits computers provide far outweigh the negatives.

Sincerely,  [Your Name]
