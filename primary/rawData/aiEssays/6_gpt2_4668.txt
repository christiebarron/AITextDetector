The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, there were the design problems from the 1930s, which caused a significant cost overrun. Second, it was impractical to accommodate all the available space, which was not something that would be possible before then â€” a problem that would arise when a system that had such a large number of floors had to be constructed to accommodate the many thousands of square meter of space.

The Empire State Building was constructed with nearly $100 million worth of state money available from the U.S. Government on a grand and sweeping scale. It was designed to contain a million people who would enjoy a great number of social and economic benefits. However, even with it's own population of close to 1 million, it was only about half as big as the Empire State Building. To fulfill its lofty aspirations, the Empire State Building was designed to have five, five, or five stories. But these were not enough to accommodate everyone on the block.

The design team of the Empire State Building used the same basic design principles to create the 5-acre square-meter (or 1,600 square foot) "Tower of the Empire" that was now being offered to developers around the country. The Tower's two decks were constructed to accommodate the building's five million inhabitants and, according to a recent study published in a journal, the Tower was the largest tower in the world right now.
