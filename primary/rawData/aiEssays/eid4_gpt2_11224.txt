The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it follows, as you continue through the novel after the novel, how you get to the end of the second book:

You know who you love, you have the right to live your life according to the rules of your own mind, if you want it to live, but you cannot give up hope, you cannot make a profit because you love yourself more than any man and yet you keep on saying you love him. You can choose nothing, you can get nothing. You have nothing but your money which nobody else gives to you at any time but to buy a book or buy a thing or some other product.

When you spend this time, it's not like you're getting money with a book. But you do pay for things, you do buy products. And just how the heck is this all possible? You can buy everything, but you can't find any product. You need a way to get more people to buy your stuff, or you need to convince them you're getting what they want. This is the point where you need to try many different products. You can buy some in a few states, some in a few countries, some without a lot of effort, and some to make lots of money, only to get some of it lost.
