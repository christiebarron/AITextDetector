The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first and most obvious, however, was a new design that placed less weight in the back of the vehicle. The more weight you're carrying, the heavier the dirigible is. The dirigible makes the Empire State look larger than it actually is, and is no match for larger military cargo planes and trucks. One of the most difficult obstacles to overcome was the fact that the engine's size meant it would take longer to power the engines. Fortunately for NASA, the aircraft was built and has a full power reserve, meaning that when left to maneuver the airplane, it can take over even with less energy than normal. Another design issue that plagued the dirigibles was the limited amount of fuel allowed for them in the back of the aircraft. The pilots could get the maximum amount of fuel back at any time or they went overboard with fuel. In fact, even the smallest aircraft could fly for a while without any fuel, leaving the aircraft's pilot to drive for hours or days on end before they could recharge. The pilots needed to use only a few litres to get the maximum fuel. The designers tried to replace the gas in the engine as well. Unfortunately for the designers that was not the case. In order to make the aircraft power, the pilots needed to take in more fuel. The pilots actually added another fuel filler into the back of the vehicle to fill it up. Once both planes were powered,
