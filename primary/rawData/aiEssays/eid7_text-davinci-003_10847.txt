I had my first job as a server and it was incredibly overwhelming. I was new to this world and often felt like I couldn’t keep up. I had numerous difficult customers and I was expected to handle them with grace and patience.

One particular day, I had a customer who was extremely demanding and was constantly nitpicking about how I was doing my job. I could feel my patience being tested. However, I kept my cool. I didn’t raise my voice, nor did I lose my temper. I kept my polite and respectful attitude with the customer and explained things to them calmly. 

Eventually, the customer was very pleased with the service and thanked me for being patient and understanding. I felt proud for not losing my temper and was grateful to have been given that opportunity to practice my patience.
