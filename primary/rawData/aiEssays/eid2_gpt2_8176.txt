I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is bad for the public. We have already seen this in France: people went to the news to protest anti-Islam riots which happened before President Hollande's speech. And what about the people whom we were invited to defend in Copenhagen to hold up anti-Islam posters? And I think I'm saying this because we have seen it in Sweden which is very disturbing. We have seen these actions on our streets. They went viral because the message of violence was clearly about an evil person who is destroying and destroying our society by going about our business with impunity. We should not allow those who threaten our democracy the right to protest, even if it means risking being shot (laughs). The anti-Semitism and racism are a fact of life for ordinary people: those of us from the south take that for granted. The way we deal with violence is the same as it has always been: it's not the same. I think we should learn from the whole of the situation.
