The setting of "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski has a major effect on the cyclist as he navigates the many obstacles of his journey. The ruggedness and vastness of the terrain create a sense of isolation and a challenge for the cyclist, emphasizing his interactions with the physical environment as opposed to people. The night sky is described as “awe-inspiring,” and it reflects the great expansiveness of the setting and underscores the cyclist’s loneliness.

The setting also has implications for the cyclist’s safety. The rocky, unpathed roads are difficult to traverse and expose him to potential hazards, and the ever-darkening sky reflects the intensity and danger of the bike ride. The cyclist is aware of his surroundings; he listens intently to the sounds of the environment, pumping his brakes to avoid possible collisions with obstacles. As the night continues, the cyclist prefers to stay on the side of the road in order to avoid any potential oncoming cars.

The physical expansiveness of the setting contributes to the appreciation of the bike ride as he takes in the night sky. The seemingly endless space creates an opportunity for the cyclist to escape from the frenetic urban environment he is familiar with and spend some time with his thoughts. He takes in the beauty of the setting, feeling the wind on his face and enjoying the freedom of the road.
