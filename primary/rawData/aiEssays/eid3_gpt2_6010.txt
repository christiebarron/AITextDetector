Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

Most often there is one major difference between the way you approach the bike as well as whether you want to ride it as hard as you wish on the pavement, or just as hard as you feel in a street corner, and you can still follow it as you wish to it. It may also affect the number of miles that you will take under your power.

The road and road markings have also impacted cyclists over time, with most people choosing not to use the same marking since "It's easier" and "Stay on the road witch", with some even opting to use the same markings only the moment they reached their destination.

Now, it's also important to understand and remember this. If you're a first time road user, you can't always follow the markings on the way, they've changed with time and the road is different.

This can also mean the difference between travelling on the back roads you see in other countries (e.g. Norway), or even the journey over on flat roads in Northern Europe (e.g. Spain).
