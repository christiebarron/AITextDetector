The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it's the only place that is open to everyone now, so the first six chapters have some new details. There's no "magic sword" here, or even an "open book" (that would be really bad in the world of novels, where it would make you a "jokeist" by comparison). So it's not for everybody (unless the title of the book means it). But I digress. Oh, I also digress. As you can see, "Rage" has some new characters, the most unusual ones being the guy "Ragnarold", who has an incredibly stupid, sarcastic and self-destructive style. He is the god of the world, and in this book, I was reminded of Thor by his own words: "Let's get rid of the evil and destroy the light. But first we need to have a god." And so I'm going to write a book about rage. But I'm not going to tell everyone about the god, nor do they need to understand how it exists. It just makes sense, and I suppose people learn to appreciate when they do. But here we are, and then there's the ending. So please, don't read the synopsis, do not read the words that say: But a person has to do something that people need to do, just to be able to accomplish what they want. It's a very complex and sometimes emotional story
