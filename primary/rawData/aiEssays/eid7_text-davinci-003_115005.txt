One time, I was on vacation with my family, and our flight was significantly delayed. I was getting frustrated and my family was also becoming antsy when finally, the flight attendants made an announcement that the flight was beginning boarding.

We moved through security quickly and managed to find our seats right away. Surprisingly, the bins on my side of the plane were already full. I knew that none of us wanted to add to the stress of our already late flight, so I decided to be patient. I asked the flight attendants to help me find a space for our bags and they obliged.

We all managed to complete our boarding and settle in our seats. Throughout the flight, they kept informing us that the turbulence was more than normal, but I kept my cool and remained patient.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, we were able to land. As everyone was getting settled with their things, I used the remaining patient demeanor to help others around me. I offered to help some older folks with their bags, which was the least I could do to try and make up for the long experience of waiting!
