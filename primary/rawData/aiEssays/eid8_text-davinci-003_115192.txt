It was a bitterly cold winter night and my friends and I had been out celebrating. We were wandering through the city streets, bundled up in our winter coats, well past midnight. The air was filled with laughter as we laughed about our silly jokes. The city was asleep, so the only sounds were our laughter and the crunching of the snow under our feet. 

Suddenly, a sound came from behind us. We turned to find a homeless man standing there, watching us with a curious expression on his face. We stopped, frozen in surprise. We had no idea what to do.

The homeless man then started to chuckle softly. He chuckled for a few minutes until finally it was contagious and all of us broke out into laughter. We all laughed so hard that we had tears in our eyes and we were almost in danger of falling over. We laughed until we were exhausted.

The man chuckled again and then said in a gentle voice, “Thank you for the laughter and the warmth. It’s been too long since I heard someone laughing without an ounce of sadness.”

Those few minutes of shared laughter gave us a moment of connection, a bond that couldn’t be broken. In the middle of that cold, lonely winter night, we felt a warmth that made us forget our troubles. That is the power of laughter.
