I remember one time when my siblings and I were stuck in a long line at the store. Everyone around us was grumbling and complaining. I saw some people getting frustrated and starting to yell at the store workers and each other. 

Instead of joining them, I just chose to stay calm and remain patient. I tried not to think about how long the wait was taking but instead just mentally prepared myself for great customer service since I knew that the workers were doing their best with the situation. 

After about 20 minutes, we finally made it to the front of the line, and the worker was incredibly nice and understanding. He even gave us a little extra discount because of our patience. I felt proud that I was able to stay calm and wait it out.
