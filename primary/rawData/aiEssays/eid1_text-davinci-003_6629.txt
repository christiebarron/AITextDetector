 

Dear Editor, 

With the ever-growing advancements in technology, it has become increasingly clear that computers are having a large effect on our lives. While there are many benefits of this shift in technology, there are a few that should give the public pause for thought. 

The use of computers has facilitated many aspects of our daily lives in an unprecedentedly simple way. From shopping online, to using our laptops for work, to connecting with our loved ones, technology has made our journey through life a lot easier. However, too much reliance on this technology can cause us to become socially inept. Spending hours on a computer or with a phone drastically reduces the time we are able to spend with our families and socializing with others in person. Furthermore, developing an emotional or psychological attachment with these devices can seriously impede the development of interpersonal skills, which plays an important role in how we interact with others on a daily basis. 

Due to the ease of access to the Internet, there is also a problem of young people becoming exposed to inappropriate content at an early age. Without the proper censoring in place, children and teenagers may be exposed to explicit content that compromises their innocence. 

Finally, the use of computers has inadvertently increased the amount of cyberbullying that takes place amongst kids and teenagers, as well as adults. In turn, this has caused psychological damage to a lot of people who suffer through these incidents without seeking help.
