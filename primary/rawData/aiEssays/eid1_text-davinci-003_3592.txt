I remember the first time I laughed with someone romantically. It was during a date. We had been seeing each other for months already and had been on multiple dates, but it was only that day that something clicked between us and the environment felt more intimate. 

We had just finished dinner at a small tapas restaurant and were walking back to the car. We had been talking about different topics for a while but I suddenly said something funny—I don’t even remember what it was—and the whole atmosphere changed. We both started laughing out loud and it felt so liberating. Not only did it feel good physically, but it was also emotionally freeing because it meant that we were both enjoying each other’s company. It felt like a natural thing to do, and it felt right. 

Since then, I feel like laughter has been an integral part of our relationship. Whenever we’re going through a difficult situation or an argument, laughter is like a release valve that helps us manage the intensity of the moment and reconnect. It’s amazing how powerful this simple act of sharing laughter can be.
