I recently experienced a moment when I had to be patient. I was helping a relative move to a new home and, despite the fact that I had already taken time off to help, the entire process ended up taking much longer than expected. I could feel myself getting frustrated and exasperated as the hours went by, but I consciously chose to be patient by not voicing my annoyance and instead focusing on the positive parts of the experience.

Being patient paid off in the end. After a very long day of hard work, we were able to get everything moved into the new home. It was exhausting, but at the same time, it was also gratifying to have played a part in helping my relative start their new life in a new home. Now, whenever I'm feeling impatient, I try to remember how successful and satisfying it was to practice being patient and stay positive despite tough circumstances.
