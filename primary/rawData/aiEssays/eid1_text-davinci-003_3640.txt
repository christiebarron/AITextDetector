Dear Editor, 

As we enter deeper into the 21st century, it is becoming increasingly clear that computers are having an ever growing impact on our lives. The debate of this debate rages on, with those of either side convinced of the rightness of their views. I would to share my opinion on the matter.

I firmly believe that computers have a positive effect on our lives. With the help of computers, we can accomplish a whole lot more than ever before, and with a greater degree of accuracy than what was ever possible before. This increased efficiency leads to fulfilling and happy lives, with more time and resources to do what we want. Computers also open the portals of communication and bring people from all over the world together. The world has indeed become a smaller place with the advent of computers.

In addition, computers also enable individuals to enjoy certain luxuries and comforts that were once thought to be out of reach. For instance, computers give us the ability to purchase goods and services securely and quickly from the comfort of our own homes. Therefore, one could say that computers are fostering a more productive and comfortable way of life.

I hope that this opinion has provided you with a different perspective on the effects of computers on our lives. Considering the positive aspects that computers offer, it is clear that computers truly are a blessing for our times.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
