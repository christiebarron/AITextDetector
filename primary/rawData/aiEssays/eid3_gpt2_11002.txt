Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

This is where the cyclist starts off, moving slowly along the road as the distance between them increases. Once the distance was at an extremely high level, the cyclist started to lose his balance.

This is where the cyclist stops the car, and his ability to move will dramatically diminish.

The amount of energy the cyclist uses, and how much power the bike uses to go from a stop to a climb can be extremely significant. You will lose about 10â€“15% of your power between a turn and a climb, which is more than any other factor of the level, but it will also increase the chance of a serious injury.

This will increase by about 25% depending on the cyclist, and the more time between turns the greater the 'tread and climb effect'. The longer it takes to maintain this effect the more likely that the cyclist will experience major head injuries.

How much of a stress can the cyclist take in, and how far they can travel, before they are seriously injured?

The only factors of the climbing level which have an impact upon your ability to control your speed and climb with your body are:

The height of the 'road', but it also has a major effect: A good climber will reach a good mountain top while climbing and lose 90% of his power (with a 100-200mph wind rating);
