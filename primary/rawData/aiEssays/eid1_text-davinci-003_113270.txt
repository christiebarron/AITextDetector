Dear Editor, 

I believe that we have yet to fully understand the effects that computers have on us as a society. Not only have computers become a necessary part of everyday life, but their effects on people are staggering.

In terms of efficiency, computers allow us to store, access, and manipulate information quickly and with very little effort. From school and work projects, to online shopping, to communication, computers have allowed us to become more productive and achieve much more than we could have in the past.

In terms of entertainment, the Internet has created ways for people to enjoy activities from the comfort of their homes. By streaming movies, playing games, or surfing through social media, people have plenty of methods to relax and be entertained. However, too much time on computers can become addictive and can create feelings of isolation in those addicted. 

Finally, computers have an impact on human interaction. Spending too much time on computers at the expense of in-person social contact can lead to feelings of loneliness and hypersensitivity, while other effects, such as the spread of false information, can occur on a wider scale.

In conclusion, I think that computers have changed how people live in both positive and negative ways. Although they have unquestionably improved our lives in multiple areas, it is important to be aware of the consequences of dedicating too much time to them.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
