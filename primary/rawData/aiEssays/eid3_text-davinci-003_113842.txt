The features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead” directly affect the cyclist’s journey. The rising sun indicates that the cyclist has morning momentum, yet the poor condition of the roads suggests that the cyclist has a challenging journey ahead. The vast empty land and flat terrain imply that the cyclist has a long way to go before reaching his destination and that the time spent to get there may be lengthy. The silent stillness of the lonely road also suggests that the cyclist is isolated and separated from the world, mirroring his internal struggle with self-sabotage. 

The potholes and cracks in the road challenge the cyclist’s physical ability to make it to the end of his journey. He has to remain determined and focused on piloting his bike safely over the rough terrain, and this is not an easy task. The winding roads also challenge his mental ability to stay vigilant and persistent to his goal despite the difficulties along the way. 

The heavy black clouds that linger in the sky imply the danger lurking on the cyclist’s path. The uncertain weather is a reminder of the many obstacles he will have to face. He must remain strong and alert in order to stay safe. The cyclist has no choice but to keep pushing forward, no matter what uncertainties may arise along his journey.
