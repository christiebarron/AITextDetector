I will never forget the time a few years ago when I first met my now-husband. We were both at a mutual friend's birthday dinner, and he had caught my eye across the room. I decided to take a risk and approach him and introduce myself. 

We started chatting, and before long, we were sharing our funniest stories. Soon enough, the entire room was filled with our loud, uncontrollable laughter. Everyone around us began to join in until the entire restaurant was rolling with laughter. Even the waiters and waitresses couldn't help but crack a smile at our antics.

The conversation continued to flow, and I felt an invisible connection between the two of us that could only be described as magnetic. Even now, when we reminisce that special time, tears start coming from our eyes from laughing so hard. 

That was the moment I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him, and we're happily married today. I'm so thankful that laughter brought us together that night, and that it continues to be a core part of our relationship.
