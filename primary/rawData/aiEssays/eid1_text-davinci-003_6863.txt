Censorship in libraries has been a long-standing issue for many communities around the world. There are two sides to this debate, and I believe that certain materials should not be removed from library shelves simply because they are deemed offensive or inappropriate. 

Books are an important part of our culture. They serve as a platform for people to express their views and to educate others on various topics. Restricting access to information and literature flies in the face of the fundamental purpose of libraries, which is to provide learning opportunities to all people. Censoring library materials results in limiting our access to knowledge and deprives us of the opportunity to make informed decisions. It has the potential to prevent us from hearing multiple sides of a story and understanding different perspectives, and ultimately keep us in the dark. 

Such censorship also infringes on our freedom of speech and thoughts. Individuals should be allowed to explore and come to their own conclusions about the materials they read. Furthermore, freedom of speech is an essential part of democracy, and in turn, censorship restricts our freedom of expression and ultimately takes away our right to make our own decisions. 

Not only is censorship a violation of our freedom of speech, but it also reinforces double standards. For example, materials that are deemed offensive may include certain books with affirmative stances on minority groups, while authors promoting regressive ideologies remain on shelves. It is ultimately up to the individuals to decide which books are meaningful to them and contribute to their thought
