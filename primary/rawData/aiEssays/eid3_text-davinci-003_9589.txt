In Joe Kurmaski's poem, “Rough Road Ahead”, the cyclist embarks on a treacherous journey that tests their endurance and determination. The poem describes a harrowing journey across an unpredictable and dangerous landscape. The features of the setting create a treacherous and challenging environment for the cyclist which affects their journey in multiple ways.

The rough terrain features steep hills, sharp curves, and deep mud piles that cause the cyclist to work harder to make progress. The cyclist must use constant vigilance, focus, and strength to navigate the terrain effectively as one wrong move could lead to disaster. If they are not careful, the cyclist can get stuck in the mud, slip on an icy patch, or crash into a sharp turn. This makes the journey hazardous and difficult, limiting the cyclist’s speed and putting their safety at risk.

The unpredictable weather also increases the difficulty of the journey. The poem mentions wet, wet snow, which makes the already dangerous terrain even more difficult to traverse. Wind also contributes to the cyclist’s struggle, as gusts can push them off their path, knock them over, or cause them to lose balance. The constant struggle against nature heightens the cyclist’s challenge and increases the difficulty of the journey.
