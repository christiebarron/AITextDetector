Censorship in libraries is a controversial and oft-debated issue that has not elicited a unified stance from librarians and lawmakers alike. While the protection of intellectual freedom is of paramount importance, it is also true that library patrons, especially those who are children and young adults, should not be exposed to offensive or explicit material without the consent of their caretakers.

Movies, books, magazines, and music are some of the most popular resources accessed from community libraries. As such, it is critical to determine what content is deemed appropriate for patrons. Some materials – including films containing explicit sexual content, offensive language, and violence – have been deemed controversial and have sparked debate over whether they should be removed from circulation or restricted to individuals of a certain age.

The censorship of library resources should not be seen as a way to impede free thought and expression but rather to ensure the safety of vulnerable audiences. It is possible to limit the exposure of certain materials to the public without completely eliminating them from library shelves. For example, a library could choose to reserve certain resources for adults or ensure that access to them is granted only through permission from a parent or guardian.

The library should also implement a non-discriminatory selection process when deciding which resources to include. Books, magazines, and music should be chosen based on their value to the community rather than on an individual’s opinion of the materials. Libraries should also strive to differentiate between information and entertainment
