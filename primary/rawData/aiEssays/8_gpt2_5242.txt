One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I became tired and wanted to break the day. This is why laughter can come from multiple sources and when I'm tired and want to break the day, I think it will always be an outlet for me.

Climbing Climbers measurements: This chart provides a few pictures and videos for what's going on during a high altitude and during climbs, to compare it to your own climbing. There are three weights. The first is the heaviest weight that your feet are standing on. The second one is the lighter weight that your legs are. Finally, we have the weight that your legs are working on using your bodyweight, and the third one (the heaviest) is where your bodyweight is on. For this chart, I used my feet, not my feet, as an example of which weight is optimal for you and which one is more comfortable. The more weight you are sitting on you will have more room to work. In order to increase your breathing pressure in the face of the current movement you can use the 'L' on the upper left hand grip point to improve the ability of your feet and feet to move freely.
