I remember when I first met my significant other. We were at a party and didn't even need to introduce ourselves — our eyes met across the room and we knew it was something special. We started talking, and it felt so natural to be around one another. 

After a while, we started telling jokes. We'd both crack up laughing at the same time, as if we were in sync. We even started telling silly jokes to each other that only the two of us would understand.

We laughed so much that night that our sides ached by the time the party was over. Even now, years later, we still find ourselves laughing together at the same moments, no matter how much time passes. 

Laughter has been the thread that binds us together ever since — it has been the way to connect on a deeper level, to remember why we love each other so much, and to continue falling more and more in love every day.
