I still remember that day more than four years ago like it was yesterday. I was walking in the park with my best friend of many years, and he turned to me in the middle of the path with a very serious look on his face. 

I thought I was in deep trouble until he smiled and said: “I want to make a bet with you.” Curious, I asked him what exactly he was proposing. He replied: “I bet you can't make me laugh in the next two minutes.”

At first I thought it was a silly challenge but something in his eyes told me to give it a try. So I did my best, telling him a joke I knew he hadn't heard before and doing my best to make it as funny as I could. 

To my surprise, it worked! After a few seconds of holding back he finally let out a loud laugh, and soon I was laughing just as hard. We ended up walking the rest of the path in fits of hysterical laughter, and it became a fond memory of us. To this day we continue to laugh together and make sure to never forget that moment.
