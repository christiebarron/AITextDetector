The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is a mixture of joy and anger. "People say 'Hey, he just did what they asked, but they should have known that this book is going to set them right', which is true," he said. "But I just knew I was going to write a book about nothing."

When he first started writing it in 2003 he felt he had "taken every book I ever read and spent the money I spent writing a book and writing a book from the ground up." He's even tried it again this time and has decided to release what he calls 'The Greatest Love Letter Ever Written!' in a special, "perfectly clear" way.

"This book is completely honest and it completely gives you the courage to live your life," the author told The Wrap. "I decided to go and do this because I really wanted to. You can't live like that."

Of the two, he admitted he hasn't put the rest into the story yet. "Why should I know now? It'ssectory. I don't want to show everyone anything wrong," he said.

"I wanted to do a good thing," he added, though he hasn't told his fiancee. "I'm sorry I waited for a good thing so long."
