I believe that censorship of materials in libraries and public places will not serve the preservation of freedom of speech."

Maurice Gorton, who founded the Library of Modern Art in 1997, explained that it had been in disarray since the 1990s, and called the ruling "unacceptable and illegal" since it does not ban, harass or censor content.

"Libraries are important places of educational and cultural events because they provide a place for expression on different levels," he told iReporter. "They should not be subject to the suppression of free expression. In some parts of California they banned the content of books and poetry. In others they did the same thing, if you're against the suppression of speech."

He noted a new legal framework that would help ensure that other states have the same rule, stating that libraries have the right to protect their rights on certain grounds.

Gorton also said that he doesn't think California legislation should give any special meaning to the so-called "permit to keep and bear arms", which would allow for the police to carry guns over an entire city. One of the concerns expressed in the case is that if a judge was to accept the decision by an entire City Commission, it would effectively force the closure of a library in California.

"If in fact there are no further steps towards the removal of these things, then that would be a violation of the California Constitution," he said.
