One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was 20 years old in my first semester at Penn. I always imagined the students would be laughing as they had a blast singing about a famous author, and it really didn't make sense.

I remember being so proud of having some of the best comedians back then and even now, I get the feeling they really want people to listen to the comedy before they decide to sing it. It's a cool feeling and I think it's important for us, of course, that we all have a fun laugh, be it in our college dorm room or at a bar. But I'd also like to think that if we were sitting next to a comedian, that we'd like them to smile too.
