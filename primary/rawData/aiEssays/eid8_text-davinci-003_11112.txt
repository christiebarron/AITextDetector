I remember this moment with my best friend so vividly, even now. We were in the middle of grocery shopping, just picking up some items for dinner we were making together. We had turned down the frozen food aisle when we spotted something unusual. There was a giant cardboard cut out of a movie star, and above it was a sign that said, “Shop here for a laugh.” We both had the same thought; this might be too good to pass up.

So we decided to take a closer look, and that’s when we started laughing. The pose on the cut out was hilarious—he was holding an ice cream cone in one hand and a bag of chips in the other. His eyes were wide with surprise, and his mouth was a perfect “O” of shock. It was almost too much. We both could barely contain ourselves as we snorted and giggled our way back up the aisle.

When we finally made it to the end, we just looked at each other, still shaking with laughter. We had laughed so hard that we had tears in our eyes, and our stomachs hurt from the insanity of it all. But it felt good; it was a moment of pure joy that I'll never forget, and it's one of the things that connects us to this day. Laughter really is the shortest distance between two people.
