The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

First was a lack of public funding of the tower. Second was the federal government's refusal to allow the building to take part in a federal "emergency humanitarian" programme known as the Migrant Integration program.

Some of the questions to ask would include:

In what way do we know that people are leaving the buildings?

What is the extent of the housing or job losses caused by the building's installation?

If the residents are displaced and will remain in the building until rescue is called, what might be the extent to which housing is being provided to them?

So, you have these questions:

What is the impact of the building's installation on the building's future housing and employment

How and why did the Department of Housing and Urban Development consider, and rejected, building an emergency shelter for people who will be displaced in the building? Was the decision motivated by a lack of resources or a desire to build a greater use for future dwellings?

Finally, did the Department of Housing and Urban Development have a process in place to notify the affected residents about the installation and provide them with housing assistance?

This is a complex yet incredibly costly matter.

Since we live in a city with much greater housing inequality, the building's location and the number of homes available for rent are a major part of our ability to address the problem
