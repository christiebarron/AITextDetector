The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. A building built in 1780 created what later became the Empire State Building Museum after the federal government gave the building its name in 1924.icro

The Department of Transportation will fund construction of the $40.2 million Empire State Building to the tune of $240 million, officials said on Monday.

"Our transportation policy is not perfect and the cost of that project has been a major obstacle," said Rep. Bill Capps (R) of St. Louis.

The goal: $40 million to build a new building that houses the state's largest building, and $500 million to renovate the Empire State Building to meet the need.

The final decision is coming by the end of May. Construction must be completed at least six months prior to the end of the fiscal year, as well as the opening of the new school year and a second major overhaul of state government.

The Department of Transportation will spend $240 million, or 17.5 percent of the construction estimate, on capital improvements:
