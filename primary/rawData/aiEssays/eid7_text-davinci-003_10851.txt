I once saw a stranger walking down the street struggling with carrying several large bags. I was on my way to a nearby cafe, but seeing the strangers struggle made me pause. Instinctively, I offered my help and the stranger gratefully accepted. We got to the cafe and the stranger bought me a coffee as a thank you for my help.

It turned out he was moving to a new place, and had been walking around for several hours looking for a new apartment. Despite the difficult situation, he was unfailingly kind and patient, thanking me and others who offered him help and information with a big smile.

We talked for a while and I learned that he was very excited about his new start in the city. It made me happy to see someone so enthusiastic even in the face of difficulty. I left the cafe feeling inspired and determined to approach all of life's obstacles with the same level of patience.
