I remember my sister and I were in the backseat of my parents car, giggling together about a joke we had heard. Our laughter was contagious and it quickly spread to my parents as well. My dad, who usually had trouble containing his emotions, burst into laughter, which only made us laugh harder. His contagious laughter was so loud and seemingless that it filled up the car and quickly brought tears to my mom's eyes. As the laughter started to die down, my dad saw his opportunity to make one final joke and my sister and I were sent into a fit of even more laughter. In that moment of shared laughter, I felt a special connection with my family unlike any I had ever experienced before. It felt like we were one, and that nothing could break us. That shared laughter broke open a truly remarkable moment of joy and total unity for my family.
