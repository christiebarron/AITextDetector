Laughter has always been a key part of my relationships with my family. One of my favorite moments was when we were all gathered at the dinner table. We were discussing our plans for the day when my father started to tell a funny story. I watched as my siblings and I exchanged glances and started to giggle. His story was actually not very funny but the fact that he was trying so hard to entertain us with it was.

The laughter soon overwhelmed the table and it seemed that no one could control themselves. We all laughed uncontrollably until tears ran down our faces. Even my father himself couldn’t control his laughter any longer.

Eventually, my mother had to intervene and calm us all down, but the moment will always stay with me. It’s those moments in which laughter is shared that truly speak to the bond of a family.
