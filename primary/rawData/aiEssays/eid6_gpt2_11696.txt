The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The idea of keeping them in the air for extended periods of time would create a dangerous situation, with drones having been deemed a safety risk and many people wondering about the safety of carrying them. On the other hand, this concept ultimately became part of a larger legal argument. It may have been argued that drones should be allowed to dock in space to avoid docking in public for safety reasons. The result was an agreement on a compromise based upon principle of separation between "unnecessary space" and "unnecessary public space".

Many argue that a 'dimming' of space by a drone would not harm humans and would protect humanity, while using drones would be more difficult and expensive. This has raised questions about the legality of the idea which should be reconsidered.

Another issue on both sides of the debate was the practical limitations involved in the technology. The FAA estimated that no more than 3 to 4 terabytes of data would be required to perform a one megabyte of self-contained and accurate surveillance within 4 seconds of the first flight. This was at risk of not being fully functional, since the drones are not capable of monitoring a live person for up to 30 minutes. This problem did not occur, however, for the most part.

The issue arose when drone owners were advised on how to use the latest technologies. The idea of using the smallest bit of data available to each drone is
