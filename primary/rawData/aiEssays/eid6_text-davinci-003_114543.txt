When the Empire State Building was being built, architects had the ambitious plan of allowing dirigibles to dock to the top of the building. This would have been an engineering feat, as it would have been the first building in the world ever designed with that purpose in mind. However, the builders soon found themselves facing many obstacles in making this plan a reality.

One of the primary technological issues with the plan was that dirigibles would need to be able to dock safely at heights greater than 1,000 feet. Although the building was planned to reach 1,250 feet, the actual finished height was 1,454 feet. The extra 200-plus feet added a significant challenge that would need to be addressed in order for the dirigibles to safely dock.

Another issue concerned the construction of the mooring mast, which would be used to facilitate the process of docking. The mooring mast needed to be incredibly strong, as the winds could cause a dirigible to sway from side to side, putting enormous strain on the mooring mast. However, the weight of the mast had to be counterbalanced by the rest of the building, or the building would not be structurally sound. To resolve this issue, architects proposed that the mast be made of steel and suspended atop the building using cables.

Additionally, the size and shape of the outer shell of the building posed a problem. The original design featured a braced frame, but this would have
