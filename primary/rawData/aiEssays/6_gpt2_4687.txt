The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. According to a recent report by the New York Times magazine, the Empire State Building lacked steel plates to mount dummies to the main windows, and most of the doors and windows were set at maximum height to prevent the collapse of the main building window.

The new plan used a new process that allows the building's top and secondary windows to be set in position for the dummies to reach the roof of the building, with the same horizontal orientation on opposite sides. The plan was devised to avoid the collapse of the main building windows, which might have caused the collapse of the two main building windows as they flew toward each other.

The New York Times is reported to have said that a key design flaw was the fact that the main building's windows used only 3-5 millimeters to allow the two windows to stay up in the high-speed traffic flow.

In 2010, the Chinese government launched a massive campaign to protect the Chinese capital, saying the building's windows would protect China's capital against terrorism.

However, a Chinese Nationalist movement has said that the building's windows could also prevent people, particularly elderly people, from leaving the building in groups and at night. The Nationalist People's Liberation Army in its latest manifesto said the building should not be protected.
