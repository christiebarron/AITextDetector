The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it's a way to explain how we feel about the world and the Earth.

There were a lot of things made obvious during the book, like the human connection between Saturn's rings and the Earth. What are these things in the book, and what do we do when talking about the actual universe and the Earth? Also the characters mentioned above, like how Saturn is the center of the world, aren't there in the book. Did there have to be one and also because we had so many questions, I'm sure you'll find these answers later.

I think one last thing that had to be done is for all the people on the planet to gather under one flag. In many ways I think that's part of a lot of the joy of the book. All those characters' names came from their experiences.

I would love to professionallly read up how they feel about Saturn, because I think they need that because Saturn can be part of all of this. Because it's Saturn you can come up with the same sort of ideas, but it's Saturn you may come up with things from the next day's post. And that's part of our philosophy of telling these stories through the human experience and through this book.

Thank you so con people.

Now there's some nice quotes from our interview with James.
