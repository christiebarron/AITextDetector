One time I was shopping and I went to pay for all of my items. As I was paying, I realized that I had forgotten my wallet at home. I was embarrassed and frustrated because I had been shopping for a few hours. 

I mustered up the courage and politely asked the cashier if I could leave my items at the register while I ran home to get my wallet. The cashier could have easily said no, but instead she was very understanding and patient. She let me leave my items at the register and I ran home quickly, grabbing my wallet and coming back to the store. 

The cashier had waited patiently for me and had all of my items ready to go when I arrived. She wished me a good day and I was grateful for her understanding and patience.
