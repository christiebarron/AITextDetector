The effort to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building in 1931 was a formidable challenge that the builders faced. In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the numerous obstacles the builders encountered are documented. From safety concerns to technical feasibility, dock construction demanded a large investment of resources, energy, and ingenuity.

One major obstacle was that of a viable construction method for the dock mast. Extending more than 60 feet into the sky, the mast had to be incredibly strong in order to safely support an airship. And while a steel-frame design was eventually chosen, this posed its own challenges. Constructing the tall mast involved a complex set of calculations and an array of materials that had to be joined together in order to make the structure strong and sturdy. This led to delays in the creation of the mast, as workers tried to create a suitable design.

The builders also faced the challenge of safety. It was ultimately decided that the airship dock would be located at the midpoint between the 86th and 87th floors of the building, which would reduce the chance of the airship being damaged by the building’s spire. Despite this precaution, there was still the danger of people below being injured in the event of an accident. Additionally, airships were powered by explosive fuels, which necessitated the installation of safety equipment such as fire hoses and alarms.

Finally, the builders were not familiar with dir
