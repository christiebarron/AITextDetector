Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. We've described how the new setting will apply to all road markings and will give cyclists a complete understanding and sense of how the effect should be applied.

A few suggestions for how to add this to the system include:

Don't be tempted to start with the new setting if you already have set the bike to ride the normal road markings.

For the 'Aesthetically Challenged' setting, make sure you have the correct wheel spacing set, so your helmet may stay on with the original 'Aesthetically Challenged' wheel.

Make sure that your frame is properly shielded â€“ this means no rear shocks or pedals on your bike, instead riding a single rear wheel in a fixed position to avoid any unintended impacts.

Don't change any of the saddle height limits which means you can use your lower head pedal to get into and out of your bike safely.

You will still need to push on your 'Cabins Down' setting, but you will not have to get off your bicycle.

Finally, you won't need to take into Account the 'Dodge/Ride' setting, but you can adjust how the rider's head rests.
