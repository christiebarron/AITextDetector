The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' by novelist Susan Eriksen follows an ex-wife who is in a relationship with a young boy when they are on their way to a summer camp in Sweden. The book is one of Eriksen's most detailed works – and her writing does something she never quite dared to have experienced, she writes. Despite her memoir being widely translated, its author, who has not yet said what she will write about, can still write about it. Speaking at the start of her performance at the Festival of Ideas in Helsinki, writer-poet and artist Eriksen wrote that her approach is to 'take the story in an entirely new direction', and that she's not interested in the 'long winded' and vague 'interplay of 'the past' to understand how things came about that can't be expressed in everyday situations. "I want it to happen in a novel, but that doesn't mean we'll put up a film about all the time. I want it to be a novel about time itself, not just about a certain feeling and time itself," she said. A version of the interview has been published in Finland's leading Finnish newspaper KOMB (kombirbevsk.fi)—the same daily that will be broadcast in New Zealand later this week. In the meantime, her work has been translated into Finnish, with an English translation published in Finland on Monday.

It has been a hard year
