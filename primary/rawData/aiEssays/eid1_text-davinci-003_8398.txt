I was once in a long line at the bank. It was a very busy day and the line wasn't moving very quickly. I was growing increasingly frustrated, and I had to remind myself to stay patient and calm. I stopped counting how long I had already waited and just found peace in the fact that everyone else was in the same boat as me.

A few people around me were getting anxious and started to complain about how long the wait was taking. I could relate to their frustrations, but I stayed silent and kept my composure. 

Eventually, after about 30 minutes, I finally made it to the teller's window. I thanked them for their patience and left feeling accomplished. Remaining patient, despite the long wait, had paid off in the end.
