An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the time I received my appointment. I had received my appointment from my GP and it came via email. My local GP was able to check the bill from my GP, and we were given my copy. The following is the text of my statement to the Australian Medical Association:

"I am now receiving the following information:

As my number now does not correspond with the GP and the address does not fit on the fax bill to which this statement relates, due to my personal circumstances this may mean that I am unable to attend in-person or in person with all my family members.

I appreciate and apologize for any inconvenience this may cause."


This statement from a GP does not necessarily correspond with the information that appears in the Australian Medical Association bill. This is not the first time I've received a bill from the Australian Medical Association that does not fit your address.

Can I contact the Australian Medical Association if I have a personal need?

If you want to give yourself more time to assess your situation, you can do so by contacting the Department of Health.

You can also contact your local health authority about your own needs.
