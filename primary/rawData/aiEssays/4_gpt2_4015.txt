The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it tells a different story without actually being true.

"This is about a fictional person who, when he came to visit our family in the United States, he began to change in the shape of a ghostly man.

"He was a woman who had a child, but never married, and he was married like a man was married. He was the father of two children; a little girl and another girl's brother. The rest became his kids.

"But the world that he knew was different.

"He had been married to a black woman who was just like him; he had taken his own life for the purpose of marrying her.

"The first time his mind was brought back to reality was when he was walking through the woods with the young girl the younger son took off with.

"In order to stop this transformation, they would have to go and have intercourse with her. And in addition to that, these murders were happening all the time. It would be a nightmare for him, because the other boys would think that he's too weak, so they would act like they don't like him, but the truth is that he didn't even realize that. He didn't know what to do.

"It's going to be a great book for anyone. I really enjoyed watching it. It's one of those books that's never been out of print
