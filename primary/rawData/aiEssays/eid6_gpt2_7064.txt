The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They faced obstacles including having to spend hundreds of millions of dollars researching and building materials for these devices and having to build only what they had, not how they would be used. In order to prevent some of the challenges, the builders in the 1940s and 1950s made special materials that could be used for such a device. Some of these include carbon fiber, glass, metal and wood fiber. But it is not clear if they would have been used in any other building.

To avoid the problem of a black-out at the Pentagon, the DOD built a series of dirigibles to ferry military military personnel from New York City to Los Angeles for the final push into the Pentagon on October 5, 1957.

For a brief period until the 1980s, dirigibles helped military aviation crews take off after an important military operation, including a crucial crash. When the airplanes arrived at New York, they were loaded and flown into a hangar and were then locked up in the cockpit. But when the pilots of the two commercial airplanes returned, all the doors closed and an explosion took place. The explosions would have affected the safety of the entire aircraft as well.

In the 1980s, an explosion on the first flight caused the plane to disappear just before takeoff. Once the pilots of the two planes and the crew of the Cessna 150 were taken off the aircraft together after their return
