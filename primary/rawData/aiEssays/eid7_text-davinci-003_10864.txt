As I was walking through the park, I noticed an elderly woman struggling to carry her groceries back to her car. I could tell she was getting tired and frustrated. Instead of rushing over to help her, I patiently waited. I saw her take a deep breath or two and then continue carrying her groceries. After a few more steps, she finally made it to her car.

I decided to finally approach her and ask if she needed help. To my surprise, she said no. She told me that she needed to remain independent and was thankful for the patience I had shown.

That's when I understood the true power of patience. Instead of trying to rush in and take over, I had given the woman the opportunity to show her true strength. I was proud of her for not letting her struggles get the better of her, and I'm now much better about extending the same patience to others when they're in need.
