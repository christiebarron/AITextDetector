The setting of Joe Kurmaski’s ‘Rough Road Ahead’ has a distinct effect on the cyclist. Features of the environment, such as the surface of the road, the terrain, and the visibility all contribute to the cyclist’s experience. 

The surface of the road is an important factor as it can have a huge impact upon the cyclist's speed and control. When the road is in perfect condition, with smooth and even asphalt, the cyclist can glide quickly and safely with ease. However, in ‘Rough Road Ahead’, the cyclist encounters large stones, wide grates, and gaps between the road's sections. The presence of these impediments decreases the cyclists speed and puts him in potential danger of injuring himself with an uneven landing or misstep. 

The terrain of the landscape also has an effect upon the cyclist. If the road is sloped in favor of the cyclist, he can hit higher speeds. But if the terrain is uneven, then the cyclist may need to exert more energy, causing him to tire more quickly. 

Finally, the altitude and visibility of the road also factor in. If the road is situated at a high altitude, the thinner air may mean the cyclist needs to use more energy to maintain the same speed and performance. At a low altitude, the cyclist could see their pace improve. Similarly, visibility is important as an obscured road can increase the cyclist's risk of a collision
