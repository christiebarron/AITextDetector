One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was in the gym. It was hard to control my laughter, the way I would let my children laugh and to keep silent when other people would be listening to me and say, "You are not laughing at us!", or being like "I am in trouble!". However, as we grew and became closer to our adult children and became our better minds, we stopped the laughter and started telling our children to relax. That was when I felt that the whole world was laughing louder than I had ever witnessed or imagined, we started to be happy and happy, but it was also time to shut up.

So I started a charity group. I started with children to be able to help others in need, and the last thing I want is to shut up with everyone else. A time came to close it by donating your money, and I was like "You are so precious, we could see you again". I had to put my trust back into my children instead of their crying and complaining. It's all part of the process here, it's the story of people who can help.

I didn't feel sad or upset about what happened, it was just emotional. It was just a year ago but then, I woke up with the feeling that everything was okay. I started to realise a lot of people wanted to see us grow up and see the human side of us. So my hope is that, with support, support
