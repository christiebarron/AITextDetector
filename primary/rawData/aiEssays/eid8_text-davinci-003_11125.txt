 

I was telling my friend an outlandish story about the weekend I had spent camping in the woods. We were sitting at a cafe, when suddenly she started to laugh. I had told the story mostly to amuse myself, and had been expecting grimaces, not laughter, so I was surprised.

I was ready to be a little defensive; I wasn’t used to having my stories taken seriously, much less laughed at. But when I saw the glimmer in her eye and the smile on her face, I couldn’t help but start laughing too.

We both laughed until tears streamed from our eyes and the kind waitstaff brought us a glass of water. My friend and I continued trading stories and jokes for the rest of the day, and just like that, I felt like I had known her for ages. 

The connection I made that day was precious and unique. I’ve found that sometimes the most unexpected moments, like when you least expect it, end up being incredibly special. The experience has definitely taught me to jump in with both feet and always embrace a good laugh.
