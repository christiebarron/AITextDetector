 

I once saw a mother in line at the store with her young children who were getting restless and making it difficult for her to shop. As I watched, the mother managed to remain calm and patient even when the kids got rowdy. She talked to them softly, smiled, and tried to calm them down. 

My heart broke as I watched, knowing I would have been frustrated or upset in the same situation. She handled it with such grace and kindness, something I constantly strive to do. I silently praised her for how patient she was in the face of her children's misbehavior. She smiled and thanked me for my understanding when they went peaceably and exited the store. It was a moment Iâ€™ll never forget.
