I remember one time when I was out shopping with my parents and my little brother at the time. We had stayed out for a long time, and when we went to the checkout, my little brother had begun to get fussy. He started whining and crying, and no matter what my parents did, he wouldn’t calm down. 

Everyone in the store was starting to give us dirty looks, and I could feel the tension rising. But instead of getting angry, my parents did something unexpected: they were patient. They talked calmly and gently to my brother, and eventually he calmed down. 

I was really impressed with how patient my parents were in that situation. It showed me that it’s possible to stay calm in stressful situations and that it’s better to stay patient than to get angry. That’s a lesson I’ve tried to keep with me ever since.
