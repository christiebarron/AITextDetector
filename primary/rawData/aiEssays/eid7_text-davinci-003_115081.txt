I recently had the pleasure of working with a young boy on a difficult math problem. He was having a hard time understanding the concept, and after going through a few examples it still wasn't clicking. 

I could have easily been frustrated, but instead I chose to be patient and understanding. So I took a deep breath, put my phone on silent, and chose to stay with him until he had the correct answer. We reviewed the problem several more times and I walked him through it step by step until finally he was able to complete the problem on his own. I could see the look of pride on his face and I knew that he had made a critical breakthrough. 

Patience can be difficult to cultivate, but it can also pay off. It was clear to me from that experience that patience can lead to much greater success in students' education.
