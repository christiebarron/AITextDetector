In Joe Kurmaski's short story, 'Rough Road Ahead', the features of the setting play a key role in the narrative. The setting of a small, rural town is integral in creating the atmosphere of the story as it serves to highlight both the beauty and harshness of the cyclist's situation.

The cyclist is travelling through a small, rural town on a hot summer day, creating a sense of stifling humidity and oppressive heat. The weather provides a nice contrast with the idyllic countryside, emphasizing the feeling of hardship the cyclist is experiencing. The cyclist is also on a dirt road and must climb uphill, further increasing the difficulty of his journey.

The cyclist must also contend with the wild animals living around the town, including howling dogs, bison, and the occasional cougar. The implication of danger conjured up by these wild animals serves to raise the stakes for the cyclist and heightens his sense of risk and trepidation. As such, the story's setting serves to illustrate the cyclist's endurance and bravery in the face of a challenging situation.

The setting of this story is essential in highlighting the cyclist's inner conflict and the physical hardship he is facing. The oppressive heat, the treacherous terrain, and the danger posed by the wild animals all serve to create a dangerous and difficult environment for the cyclist to fight against. This helps to emphasize the cyclist's strength and courage and the inner battle he is facing throughout his journey.
