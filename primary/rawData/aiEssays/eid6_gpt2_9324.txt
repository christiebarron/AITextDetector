The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, the building had no ventilation system, meaning workers were often forced to pull their pipes out every few days.

Second, buildings like the Empire State Building could contain hundreds of gallons of liquid fuel, which could have a corrosive effect on living organisms that could not be protected in the ventilation system. There was a great deal of waste, which made building many apartments a chore.

Third, building structures often involved an underground tunnel which, at all times, was never completely filled. The Empire State Building was filled with water, but this meant that many of the subterranean wells that lined the building could not be lit while the building was under construction, making the buildings nearly unusable.

Fourth, many of the buildings on the East Coast could not contain a single person. For example, the two-story building at 1736 N. Washington is half empty at this hour without any people. No people.
