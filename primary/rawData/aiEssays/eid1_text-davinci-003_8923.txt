Dear Editor,

I am writing in regards to the debates surrounding the effects of computers on people. As technology continues to evolve, computers are becoming an increasingly integral part of our lives. While it is widely accepted that computers offer various benefits, I believe that they can also have a detrimental impact on the way we interact with one another.

When the majority of communication is done digitally, we can lose the joy of interacting with others in person. Studies have found that computer use can lead to depression, anxiety, and loneliness, as we often prioritise the online world over face-to-face interaction. Additionally, viewspapers often rely on the use of computers to share news and opinions, leading to an increase of fake news and biased reporting.

For these reasons, I think itâ€™s important to moderate the use of computers and focus on maintaining meaningful, person-to-person relationships. Digital devices should be used for what they are intended: to be tools that help us stay connected and manage our daily needs, not to dictate our social interactions.

Therefore, I encourage readers to limit their computer use and think twice before assuming the majority of their conversations and activities should take place online. By doing so, we can ensure that computers remain helpful instruments in our daily lives instead of becoming barriers to real-life communication.

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
