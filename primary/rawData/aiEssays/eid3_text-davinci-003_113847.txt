In Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead”, the features of the setting are crucial in connecting the cyclist’s physical journey to his internal, emotional inner-journey.

The physical environment is an obstacle course of challenging terrain. The cyclist is constantly reminded of his arduous journey by his physical surroundings. The steep inclines, the treacherous descents, the rock-filled paths, the punishing sun. All forces, natural or man-made, that the cyclist must confront and endure. 

These features of the environment escalate the cyclist’s inner battle as his body fights the fatigue that accompanies a difficult ride. The dread that grows within the cyclist as the journey progresses mirrors the uncomfortable physical landscape overlooked.

The natural setting of forests, valleys, meadows and streams also provide moments of respite. These moments of peace and serenity offer a reprieve from the continuous internal tug-of-war between will and fatigue. 

Ultimately, the features of the setting add to the overall effect of Kurmaski’s narrative. By providing the cyclist with external elements that challenge both his physical and emotional strength, the reader is able to connect with the protagonist on an intimate level. The cyclist’s struggle is an observable manifestation of his inner turmoil, and it is this juxtaposition that makes “Rough Road Ahead” so meaningful to the reader.
