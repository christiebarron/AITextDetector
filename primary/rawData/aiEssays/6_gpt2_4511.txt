The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. By 1933, construction on two of the Empire State Buildings, Empire State building 1 and Empire State building 2, was over, but still required some form of a laser tag. In 1938, the Empire State's new, three-piston, single-engine, three-person powerplant was opened to private investors, and the two towers were commissioned by the Federal Government of New York with a view to completing their public role. That year, President Dwight D. Eisenhower was awarded the Order of New York City's Distinguished Order of Friendship-First through Admiral Harry S. Eisenhower of the Empire State Building at the dedication ceremony at the United Nations in New York City, and in 1938 he presented the first star, Star of David (above), to the public. Today, the three-piston building sits in its namesake building, just an hour's drive from the Central Park in downtown Manhattan.
