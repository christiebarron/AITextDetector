I remember the time I was backpacking in the mountains and I wasn't prepared for how cold it was going to be. I had no winter gear and it was freezing. Despite the fact that I was freezing, I didn't complain, I was determined to make the most of it. I kept my chin up and kept going.

I stayed positive the entire time, despite the fact that I was getting hypothermia. I was patient throughout the entire hike, and was determined to get to the peak despite the unbearable cold. I kept going forward, not looking back and not making any complaints. 

Finally, after a night of shivering, I made it to the peak. I had never been so cold and exhausted in my life in that moment, but I knew the view was going to be worth it and I was right. The patience that I had been exercising had finally paid off and I had gotten to my goal, and it felt amazing.
