Today, I was in line at the store and there were three cashiers yet only one of them was available. People were getting frustrated and grumbling under their breaths about how long the line was taking. I was growing impatient myself and just hoping to get out of the store ASAP. 

That's when I noticed the cashier. She was so patient with each customer, even though they were demanding and rude. She calmly and politely helped them with whatever they needed. Each customer eventually thanked her before they left the register. 

Seeing this made me realize I should take a page from her book and be more patient with the situation. Instead of getting frustrated and grumbling, I simply waited in line and distracted myself with my phone. 

By the time it was my turn, I was nothing but grateful to her for her patience and kindness. As I thanked her, she gave me a warm smile in reply. I left the store feeling grateful and inspired.
