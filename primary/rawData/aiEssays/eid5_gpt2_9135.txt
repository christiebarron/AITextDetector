The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' by Laura Rundle (I Love You) will cause the young mother to become too vulnerable to be free of her own sense of self, she discovers, and begins to realise that, having come to terms with her own vulnerability, she may be 'the opposite, the good sister'. She discovers that she doesn't even love her mother so much that she is ashamed to admit it.[30]
