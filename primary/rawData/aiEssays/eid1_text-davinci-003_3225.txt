I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have had on people throughout the years. Computers have proven to be both a curse and a blessing. While computers offer many conveniences to people, such as the ability to connect with distant friends, they can also have negative side effects.

When we are glued to our screens, we tend to sacrifice the in-person connections that give us the comfort of human companionship. Research shows that people who spend an exorbitant amount of time on their computers become isolated and unable to engage in meaningful conversations. Without physical interaction and verbal communication, social skills suffer and our ability to connect with others is diminished.

The addiction to technology also has an effect on physical health. Sitting in front of a computer for extended periods of time results in poor posture, lack of physical activity, and even physical fatigue. It is essential for our wellbeing that we get up and move for at least 20 minutes each day.

Computer use can also cause psychological harm, as anxiety and low self-esteem may arise from excessive use of social networks or games. We must remember that there is more to life than the virtual world and set limits for our online activities
