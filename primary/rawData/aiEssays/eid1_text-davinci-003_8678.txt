I lost it the moment my sister walked into the room. She had been away for months, and the second she stepped through the door I couldn't help but let out a huge howl of laughter. She had dyed her normally deep brown hair an eye-catching cherry red, and I wasn't expecting it in the slightest. 

My sister was perplexed at first, but after a few moments she soon realized that I was laughing and she started to chuckle too. I couldn't believe that I hadn't noticed the new hair colour as soon as she arrived, but the surprise had been worth it. That deep, rolling laughter was infectious, and soon the room was filled with the sound of my entire family's joyous howling. 

It's amazing how laughter can bring people together, even when we hadn't seen each other in months. All of the silly moments, gestures, and jokes that shared between us during the reunion were made even better with a few good laughs. Laughter is truly the shortest distance between two people - it's a fast and powerful way to create meaningful connections.
