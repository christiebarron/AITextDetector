Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. If you're in an alley or a quiet street, you can start by telling the driver to pull over (as it is in most situations), but that's probably a sign that it's not safe. If you are near an industrial area (like a factory or in one of the neighbourhoods in town with a few bus routes), you should also be aware of it. The most common way sentiment arises from situations where there is a large enough group of pedestrians who would otherwise pass by at other points of the highway.

If you want to change lanes, give them plenty of space. But if you don't want to change lanes to make them easier, don't wait until you can figure out what to do. Your decision does not reflect what traffic situation you are in – and when – you should only make it change lanes every time you're walking. It is more appropriate to let the cyclist wait as long as they do not come into contact with other lanes before starting to change lanes. If you think a car may be crossing a road, have them wait for any signal when moving slowly. If you're using an alarm to make sure there's not too much congestion, don't go to work and change lanes if you think the car might be following you. If you find yourself in too much congestion, stop and let cars pass and you'll have the situation clarified.
