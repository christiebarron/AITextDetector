An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was having an argument. There was someone coming up to me but I didn't even notice him. I just turned around and found him sitting next to me. He just looked at me and said, "You know how your penis is, don't you?" and I was like, "Yeah, what was that?" His response was, "Well, you know…" rebuild that little bit of empathy for people. He wouldn't let anyone go through it. He went, "Well, you know what it does to the nerves if I was stuck between you and a cock… 'cause… it'll let all the things in the system 'cause I'm going to stop fucking with you" and then I'll just say, "I don't know how to stop that…" and you know, that's how I felt, I was feeling so bad and tired. What kind of therapist are you?

You're telling the truth.

Yeah, I have a lot of work with guys who are very, very sad. They have a lot of time, an hour a day, but when I've done it, when I've done my job, I say you're really sad. I just kind of feel like, I know what happened, and it's not my fault.

How does your husband's relationship with his partner, Marlene, fare?

I have that.
