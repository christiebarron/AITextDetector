Dear Editor,

In today's digital world, computers have become an essential part of life for many people. While computers can be incredibly useful, their effects on people can be both positive and negative.

On the positive side, computers allow people to stay better connected with family and friends. For example, we can keep in touch with distant loved ones via text messaging, Skype, or social media. Additionally, they can help open new avenues of communication and collaboration, resulting in increased productivity and efficiency. For students, they can be a wonderful tool for research and creativity, allowing them to explore new ideas and concepts.

On the other hand, computers can also be a cause of strain on relationships. Inability to disconnect from work emails and to spend quality time with loved ones is becoming the norm. Screens can also damage our eyesight and posture if we spend too much time in front of them. Additionally, they can encourage us to make poor decisions and to take on more than necessary.

Despite the negatives aspects of computers, I believe that they should be recognized for their potential to open the doors to new opportunities and possibilities in life. We should be conscious of their potential for harm, and create habits and limits that protect us from their negative effects.

Sincerely,

[Your name]
