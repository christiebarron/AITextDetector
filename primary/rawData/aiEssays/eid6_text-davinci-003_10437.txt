The prospect of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building seemed like a visionary idea at the time. After all, successfully docking an aircraft at such a high altitude would be an engineering marvel, and would undoubtedly make a statement about the progressiveness of New York City. Unfortunately, what seemed like a great idea at first quickly revealed itself to be an engineering nightmare. Numerous obstacles had to be overcome in order for the dream of a docking mast at the Empire State Building to become a reality. 

The first hurdle was that the building was not designed for mooring dirigibles. Unlike a plane, which needs a large, flat surface on which to land, dirigibles needed mooring masts for stability when docking. This posed serious structural problems, especially since the Empire State Building was not designed to support the additional weight of such a mast. In order to accommodate the docking of dirigibles, several tons of steel had to be installed in order to reinforce the building's structure and support the mast.

The second obstacle was the instability of the air currents near such a high altitude. Dirigibles were highly vulnerable to changes in the wind, which is why low altitude docking masts were the preferred option for most pilots. Docking at the Empire State Building presented a much greater risk due to the higher altitude, as the air was much more unstable. To address this issue, several safety features had to be put in place, such as the
