The Empire State Building was designed with intention to allow dirigibles, or airships, to dock. The construction of the Empire State Building marked a new era of innovation and ambition. In order to make the idea of docking airships a reality, engineers were faced with certain obstacles that had to be overcome.

The primary challenge faced by engineers was the combination of the strength needed to hold up an airship with a lightweight design. The airships of the time were much larger than typical airplanes, and the building needed to be structurally sound enough to safely accommodate them and the winds they brought with them. Therefore, the engineers had to design the building with a narrow mast so it could support the airship as well as additional docking gear while keeping the overall weight of the building as low as possible.

The plans also had to account for the fact the winds around the building could be intense, so the mast and docking mechanism had to be designed to withstand the extra force of the wind. The mast was designed to be a single, long tube of steel that would have two ropes running up from the middle for an airship's hawsers to connect to. In order to support the force of the hawsers, the top of the mast had to be securely attached to the steel beams of the building. Unfortunately, the middle of the building lacked support beams, so creative solutions had to be created to ensure the mast was firmly connected to the building.
