Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people and to persuade your readers to agree with me.

The introduction of computers could be considered both a blessing and a curse. They can make important and tedious tasks easier by providing efficient and speedy work. In addition, there are many educational resources on the internet which offer an array of information to glean knowledge from.

Despite their usefulness, computers can also have a negative side to them. Prolonged exposure to computer screens can cause eyestrain, headaches, and fatigue, for instance. It has also been reported that computer use can lead to a sedentary lifestyle due to the lack of necessary physical movement. Finally, it is argued that increased access to computers has caused a drop in reading skills and attention spans.

There is no denying the helpful nature of computers. However, it is also important to be aware of the potential negative side effects and to take appropriate measures to protect ourselves from them. Therefore, I would urge your readers to use computers responsibly and to be mindful of the effects they can have.

Yours sincerely
