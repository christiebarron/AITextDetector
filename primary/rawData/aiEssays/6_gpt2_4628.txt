The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The builders were interested in making dirigibles suitable for moving, but they lacked the necessary materials. At the time of production, the aircraft had the same specifications and performance as a helicopter, but its weight was significantly lighter. The plan was to use several different types of aircraft, but the cost was far too high. A new design was proposed: the Y-2. The design involved two single-engine F-22 and F-15 bombers. This was done by a single plane design, but the plane's aerodynamic performance was very poor. The planes needed for a flight-testing and production phase were an F-16-T of the F-14, the F-14-R, the F-18-C which was equipped with three engine power plants and two fuselage extensions. The aircraft were not suited to a low-rise plane, either. The designers wanted a combination of different aircraft, and they could not afford to have the same two planes in the same configurations. But they could. Even though the F-14 and F-36 were not available, they could be built independently of one another, if they so desired. By 1961 one aircraft had already been developed and tested. The Y-2 could have a total of 26 single-aisle fighter jets. The main differences were the wingspan, the engine, the wingspan and the weight. Each aircraft had
