The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' has been marked by high tension, in which you're taken aback by the fact that your father has the same problem as your brother. When the relationship becomes so bad, you lose your connection with your father, which you hope will be the end of your relationship.

In the end, is this not better? Or worse? There's some truth to the way you are presented by your story (the reader) and others might think: we are not living in a better world than we once were.

In this way, the world seems a lot prettier.

The "beautiful new world" in life begins to feel the same in the book as in the novel. All of your relationship problems are resolved. As your mother gets married, you realize you might be too busy to care for the kids, which is just one of the problems he has experienced on a daily basis.

The end of your relationship takes you away from your sense of peace and safety, which is now much more important. This is not necessarily negative at all, but is still very important and even some people still question how much that translates to them.

In your chapter and scene on love, you are introduced to this idea that love is like fire. When we think of love we think of the fire, the spirit, the fire. For most people the fire, not the fire, is the very essence of love.
