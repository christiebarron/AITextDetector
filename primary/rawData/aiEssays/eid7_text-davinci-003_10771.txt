I was spending the evening with my younger sister, who was having trouble completing her homework. We had both had a long day and I was getting frustrated with her for not being able to keep her focus. I had to remind myself to be patient and not snap at her, as it wasn't her fault she was tired. 

I took a deep breath and gently encouraged her to take a break. She seemed relieved to be able to step away, even if it was just for a few moments. After resetting her mind and giving her a snack, she was able to focus and complete her homework. She looked up at me with a huge smile that I couldn't help but return. 

I was so proud of myself for being patient and being there for my sister. It showed me that sometimes we just need someone to be present and understanding in order to do our best.
