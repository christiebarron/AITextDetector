Computers have many effects on people. In a research paper, researchers at Pennsylvania State University estimate the impact of the brain on depression. The researchers found that people whose brain contained new neurons developed an "intense state of anxiety" and depressive symptoms that may be triggered by the presence of drugs.

"Many medical illnesses have been associated with an imbalance of healthy brain functions. This research opens a powerful, yet narrow channelâ€”one that only gets wider," said Paul Pfeifer, associate special assistant professor of psychology at the University of Florida. "This is the first time a lab designed neuroplastic systems that can help people manage depression is able to do so safely."

The new data, which can lead to breakthrough treatments for depression and help us more effectively treat those who have it, has significant implications for the study of brain health that affects just about everyone with depression.

"Patients with anxiety and depression have no sense of how they're going to feel if they're taking antidepressants, or if they're being treated chronically in one of these ways," said Pfeifer. "There are things that, if we take someone who is suffering with anxiety or depression and we use neuroplastic systems that work like the ones developed by this group, that may actually save them from being depressed."

Dr. Michael Schallen, a neurobiologist at the University of Michigan Medical School, says it takes significant strides to develop neuroplastic systems that can effectively address
