The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' (2013) was so high that it led Paul Graham to write to him about how much he wanted to write his memoir.

Graham asked: 'Why should I write how we went to university? What was my role as writer at that time?'

The idea was that Graham would be reading a book about his time at an undergraduate university and asking himself the important question: 'Why should I write what I write every day, every week, every summer? Why should I write in a style I'm familiar with and not in a style I can read?' Paul Graham gave both the answers of the self-absorbed author and the answer to the self-made question of how he wrote.

Graham told the Irish Times: 'Writing is something a lot of people do with a lot of energy, something they're very familiar with, and they're really good at not being lost, because they are in the same place.

'But I do not. I am writing. I have never read a book or a magazine or a newspaper just to understand what it was like being in that moment together, to be in that moment feeling that you are living in that place.'

As he wrote, he then felt at sea. He was in Hawaii. He would spend several weeks with his family while he was away and then return to the US.

He never set out for any of the big Hollywood projects
