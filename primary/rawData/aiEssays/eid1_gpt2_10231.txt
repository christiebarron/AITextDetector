Computers have many effects on people. An average of 60% of the people who use the computer at each time in the day experience stress on a daily basis. If you keep a lot of your energy in your computer, those stress events could result in poor mental health.


The researchers at the UCL Centre for Computational and Human Behavior (CAHMD) looked at the brain differences between individuals over time and found that if you were living in a well-developed, productive, and well-adjusted environment compared with the average person (30-to-65% more energy than the average person who lives in households, but only half as much energy), the differences between the two levels of stress would be between 10%.


"The way we understand stress, we understand it from an evolutionary perspective. We're trying to learn about that perspective by studying how our brain processes stress, or learning as we walk around. We're trying to understand how we cope with mental stress, and how that affects us daily," concludes study leader Dr Ravi Krishnamurthy.
