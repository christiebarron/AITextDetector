I was driving down the highway when I saw an animal on the side of the road. I stopped my car and noticed that it was a puppy that had been hit by a car. It was in bad shape and I knew it needed medical attention if it was going to survive.

I gathered the puppy up in my arms and drove to the nearest animal hospital. I waited in the waiting room for what felt like hours. I was panicking and had no idea what was going on. But, I kept my cool and displayed a sense of patience. 

When the doctor finally emerged he said the puppy was going to be okay. It turns out she had a broken leg and some cuts that needed to be tended to.

I was so relieved and incredibly thankful for the doctor's expertise and my own sense of patience. It was truly a rewarding experience and one that I'll never forget.
