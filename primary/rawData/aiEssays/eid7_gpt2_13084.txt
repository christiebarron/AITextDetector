An example of a time someone in my life was patient was two weeks after having been admitted to hospital for the heart attack my husband and I had.


The hospital sent us to our first meeting of the evening on Friday evening to pick up the two of us, but it had no choice but to drop us there. They said that it is not necessary to carry out a routine check. It is absolutely forbidden to do so when the patient has already undergone surgery, especially when he is in medical school.


"There is absolutely no rule against it," I said, as I felt sick.


After that, I decided to go to a friend's home to see what was going on, but I wasn't prepared for how my friend had treated me. He was so annoyed by my attitude of 'do not see the problem' that he then threatened all those who had been with him for four or five hours the day before.


I was told at that time about how my husband felt about this practice. If it had been one of my friends I, my other good friends, or my neighbour could have seen what lay ahead.


"If you see signs of deterioration in the hospital you will not be permitted to go to their house or to their place of worship," I said.


I found out that my husband's friends knew exactly what had happened. I found out this week that our relationship has deteriorated considerably.


He is no longer my best
