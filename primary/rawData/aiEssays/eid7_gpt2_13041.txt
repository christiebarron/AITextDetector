An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was very young and my parents asked for a medical marijuana treatment. They didn't want me to go and buy it so the pharmacist would come and give me a call, because I needed to be ready. That time I told my parents, "I'll be out, I'll be out in 30 seconds or something, I won't have to go, you have to give me a visit to see if we have the medication, then I'll be back in 20 seconds." I was just devastated. These are memories. These are the people in the world that I look back on as heroes in my generation, maybe even my own generation, and you can see the people who have died. That means a lot to me now than all the days when I'd be doing my job and not going out for a walk or working late into the night. I've felt truly blessed to be able to thank this great man, the person I'm standing here for so many years to a close.
