In Joe Kurmaski's short story 'Rough Road Ahead', the setting of Seattle in the late 1990s has a significant impact on the cyclist's journey. The dense city landscape, coupled with the slippery Autumn roads, pose a great challenge to the cyclist.

The geography of Seattle creates a unique set of demands for its cyclists. The hilly terrain with its many winding roads makes cycling a physically demanding activity; the cyclist is constantly having to battle against the terrain to make progress. Even in good weather, the cyclist is likely to be struggling against the inclines, which affect their speed and performance.

The weather in the late 1990s Seattle also influences the cyclist's journey. The Autumn rains make the roads slippery and unpredictable, forcing the cyclist to maintain maximum concentration at all times. The cyclist must also cope with the reduced visibility, making it harder to react quickly to potential obstacles.

Overall, the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' has a difficult and unpredictable journey ahead of them due to the features of the setting. The hilly terrain and the slippery Autumn roads mean the cyclist must constantly adapt and adjust their approach to make progress. The cyclist's skill and determination in the face of these challenges is an impressive feat, and makes it clear that the setting plays a critical part in determining the cyclist's success.
