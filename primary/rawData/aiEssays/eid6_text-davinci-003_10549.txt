The amazing feat of constructing the Empire State Building with its iconic mooring mast was a complex endeavour fraught with obstacles. Despite the grand ambitions to make it a world-famous navigational landmark, the mooring mast was designed to primarily accommodate dirigibles. These large, blimp-like airships had become increasingly popular as a mode of transportation in 1930s New York City, which made the docking mast an attractive and ambitious project.

The first obstacle faced by the builders of the Empire State Building was the location. Constructing a sky-high structure for the mooring of airships seemed an impossible feat as New York City is not geographically well-suited for airship landings. The terrain is full of skyscrapers and other obstructions, making it difficult for airships to find an appropriate space to dock. This created the need for engineers to design a docking mast that would not only safely secure the airships, but also allow them to clear the obstructions in the city.

In addition, the design of the mast needed to be extremely sturdy in order to withstand the force of an airship docking. An airship docking creates a strong downdraft that would easily overwhelm the structure if not properly designed. Building a mooring mast that was up to the task necessitated the use of steel girders which could handle the weight and force of the dirigibles. In order to accommodate the downdraft, an intricate system
