I was on a family vacation with my parents and my siblings, when we had decided to take a road trip. On the way, my brother and I started to playfully compete with each other to see who could make the most outrageous faces out the window. I don't know what made me think of it, but soon both of us were pretending to be various animals and making silly noises. I had just stuck my head out the window and started to "quack" like a duck when I heard my dad start to chuckle. After he had stopped laughing, my mom and sister had joined in as well. Even the driver of the bus was trying not to laugh. I had felt elated with the joy that our laughter spread throughout the bus. 

My brother and I both knew that we had won, and he looked at me and winked, just to let me know that we had accomplished our mission. The drive went by in a flash, but I don't think I could ever forget the sound of my family's laughter that filled that bus. Not only did our laughter bring us closer together in that moment, but it also created an unforgettable bond that still lasts today.
