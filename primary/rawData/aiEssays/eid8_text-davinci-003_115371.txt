I was on my first date with this really cute guy. We had already talked a lot on the phone and the chemistry was definitely there, so I was super excited when he asked me out. 

We decided to go to this outdoor cafe nearby and, as we sat down, the conversation just flowed. We got to talk about our childhoods and some funny stories from the past. I could tell that he was a bit nervous, but we were both feeling so comfortable, we just couldn't stop laughing.

At one point, we were mid-conversation when our table started vibrating. We looked around to see that a leaf blower was parked next to us and the vibrations were coming from it. We just couldn't help but start cracking up. It was such a weird coincidence but I guess it broke the ice cause soon enough the nervousness had disappeared and it was like we had known each other for ages.

After that, the date just flew by and it ended up being one of the best first dates ever. We’ve been together ever since and the laughter stays strong. I guess it’s true what they say: laughter really is the shortest distance between two people!
