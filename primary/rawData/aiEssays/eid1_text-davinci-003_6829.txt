Censorship has long been a hotly contested issue in libraries. Should certain material, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? I believe that the answer is a resounding no.

Rather than removing these materials, libraries should strive to create spaces where everyone – regardless of their beliefs, values, and opinions – can find respectful educational resources and opportunities. Censorship can limit a person’s ability to explore freely, subjugate minority perspectives, and disrupt the intellectual vitality of our societies. 

Censoring materials is a silencing tactic with dangerous implications. It puts decision-making authority in the hands of those who have personal, political, or religious convictions, thus preventing access to challenging ideas. Access to all ideas is essential in order for individuals to better understand the world around them and form educated opinions. When materials are censored, patrons cannot make informed decisions.

Moreover, restricting access to certain materials can undermine our cultural diversity by enforcing majority opinions while suppressing minority perspectives. By promoting censorship, libraries can create a one-size-fits-all model that stifles creative thinking.

Every reader and book comes with a different perspective. Libraries should not seek to erase uncomfortable material but instead provide resources to help patrons interpret information critically and form their own opinions. This could include having librarians available to discuss material and provide context, installing age-restricted material shelves, or organizing community events
