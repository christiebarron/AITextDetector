Narciso Rodriguez’s memoir “From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives” captures the mood of reflection and nostalgia. Through his thoughtful and introspective writing, Rodriguez creates a vivid and powerful mood that allows us to understand the complexities of his life.

The memoir opens on a note of wistful musings about the nature of home and the differences between where we come from and where we end up. Alongside his reflections on home are the stories of Rodriguez’s upbringing, his creative awakening, and the difficulty of being an outsider in the fashion world. Through this, the memoir conveys a sense of there being two sides to the experience of home: that of childhood innocence and the adult reality of carving out a space for oneself.

The prose is characterized by an aching reverence for the past, of lost childhoods and moments of joy that have been forgotten but remain ever present in memory. There is a strong feeling of sentimentality throughout the memoir, but it is tempered by Rodriguez’s practical perspective and his reappraisals of the past from an adult point of view. Even as he recounts painful moments, the mood of the memoir remains one of reflection and understanding rather than bitterness.

In the end, the mood of Rodriguez’s memoir is one of expressing gratitude and understanding for the beauty of home. He captures the light and darkness of his upbringing and stands in awe of the paths he has taken.
