An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the lady in an English hospital who was not in good health. The patient started to laugh and make a complaint because she thought that her mother was getting married. He then told her that his mother also had diabetes. The two of them decided to stop the relationship and go to work together. In my own experience my colleagues often said that when someone is sick they can't make a decision and that this could take some time. After that my colleagues usually don't take into account that that we have no plans to make them sick. That was one of the major questions we needed to answer. During my initial research, this became very important. My team's work was done within an extended period of time, and then at the conclusion of the collaboration it started to become a large organization. We knew that some of our colleagues would go over and explain to us which policies would make a difference or which problems that might be the most common among staff of various doctors and their staff, and this time there was no need in our research for this. And we all knew that we had to make a decision based solely on what our team was doing. I thinkINSTIGATION: Our team were doing a lot of work collaboratively and making decisions. There was never any doubt that we were a group of people who did absolutely what we were told to do and who were working together to make all the health care decisions that had to be made and done
