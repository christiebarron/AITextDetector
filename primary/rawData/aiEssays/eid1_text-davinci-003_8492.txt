I was once on vacation with my family at a highly-rated restaurant. We arrived late and the restaurant was almost entirely full. When we got to the front desk, the host informed us that the wait would be approximately two hours. After hearing this, I was quite disappointed, however I kept my disappointment concealed and chose to remain patient.

I began to distract myself by looking around the restaurant and admiring its interior decor, and by chatting with the people around me. It felt like the two hours dragged on forever, but I remained patient, smiled, and diverted my attention to other tasks.

Finally, after two hours passed, the host seated our party in one of the few remaining tables. I was pleasantly surprised, and relieved that our wait was finally over. Looking back on this experience, I am proud of how patient and understanding I was throughout the entire process.
