An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a girl as she was suffering from a serious illness. My first wife was just a lovely baby. Her second marriage, with his help, became more stable which she managed to get back.

Now in my 20s, I'm 25 and I realise I need to learn more. As with the others, I've got a better understanding and understanding of how to deal with my own feelings and understand when I'm upset or depressed.

We are both here for comfort. We share the same age and different experiences. My life is unique because I'm a single woman at one point and I grew up in the same household.
