Minfong Ho ends Winter Hibiscus with this statement in order to illustrate the difficulty of life for her and her family as immigrants in America and how they must constantly strive to better themselves. It demonstrates that even though the winter may be cold and difficult, they still have hope and look forward to a better future. In this case, that better future involves the passing of an important exam which will lead to better opportunity for herself and her family. The symbolism of the hibiscus blooming in the spring is a metaphor for this hope and how despite the many hardships, spring—and the possibility of a better life—will always come in time.
