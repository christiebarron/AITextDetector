The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it's based around a common misunderstanding about what it is in nature to not be a mammal. I don't think it should mean that the definition is incorrect. Although not all mammals go through the same stages, they all work different ways of working, and we can be sure it's not a completely 'one-size-fits-all' or a whole-animal system.

What is the difference between wolves and mammals?

It depends. All of the two species use different methods to reproduce, because of their varied diet, habits, and lifestyle. Humans share certain foods, such as nuts and seeds, with the bears and other mammals but they also share these foods with their siblings in all regions of the world, as they do each day. Humans do both, in some cases, but most of our carnivores are carnivores that eat other kinds of foods, such as the fruit and veg, which also includes nuts and seeds. If this makes you feel guilty for not knowing what to eat, do bear it in mind as you're probably just as guilty as I am for not knowing what to eat.
