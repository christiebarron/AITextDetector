The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' may be that of an introvert, but what we can see about this will certainly turn out to be a much more serious portrait.

"Many women were afraid to speak out and felt pressured to stay silent about their physical appearance. Their fears were rooted in a love-hate relationship with their inner monotony, and it's easy to see the 'outcast' – the unattractive, unattractive and under-appreciated – in an attempt to regain their femininity. As the novel progresses, it will be the characters who will find out who they really are; they'll discover there are things that can be hidden from them - something they've never been given yet. This book is an intimate look inside a world that, in a way, is meant for a particular time period and place."

The 'Out' has a page count of four.
