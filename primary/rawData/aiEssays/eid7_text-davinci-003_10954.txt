I remember a time when I was very young, and I was at the grocery store with my mom. She was taking her time looking through all the items while I was getting restless. I wanted to go home. 

I started to get really impatient and constantly asked my mom when we were going to leave. She kept ignoring me and I was getting more and more frustrated when finally she turned around and told me to be patient. 

I was about to start arguing with her but instead I took a deep breath and just waited. I knew there was nothing I could do to rush her so I just decided to be patient. 

We eventually finished up and once we were in the car, my mom turned and thanked me for being patient with her. That moment made me realize the importance of being patient and how it's better to be understanding than trying to rush things. That experience taught me the value of patience which I will always carry with me.
