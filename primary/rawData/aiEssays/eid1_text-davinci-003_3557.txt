Censorship in libraries is an important issue that needs to be addressed. Many people believe that items such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. However, I disagree. Libraries should not become a place of censorship and instead should act as a platform for providing educational and informational resources.

Removing items from the shelves limits the availability of knowledge that should be passed on to children and adults alike, and prevents them from learning and exploring different ideas. The issue of censorship is especially concerning when it comes to children, who may never get to experience some of the books, music, movies and magazines that they need to be informed and educated about. For example, certain magazines or novels may be deemed inappropriate because of their level of sophistication or adult themes, but these are items that adults may need to become informed about.

Censorship can also create an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty in the library, and can prevent certain resources from being accessed. Too much censorship can also lead to altered information, as certain words, topics and themes may be entirely edited out. Viewing of certain materials becomes restricted, such as when age limits are implemented in viewing particular movies and books.
