The Empire State Building was a remarkable feat of engineering, built in 1931 with the ambition of setting an example for future skyscrapers. The builders of the building also had the revolutionary idea of giving the building the capacity to dock dirigibles, the airships of the day. However, the idea presented its own set of obstacles that had to be overcome before the dream could be realized.

The first obstacles involved safety and security. As noted in The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, this was uncharted territory—no previous buildings had been constructed to dock airships. On top of that, large airships were difficult to navigate (not to mention navigate safely) and the pilots needed tremendous skill to bring them in for a landing. To ensure the safety and security of persons and property, the building had to be designed in a completely different way than traditional skyscrapers.

A large part of the challenge in the design of the Empire State Building was accommodating the size of the airships. Some of the largest airships of the day could be up to 150 feet tall, which was much higher than the first plan for the building. This meant that the building’s designers had to get creative in order to fit the airships' huge bulk into the spire. They accomplished this by installing a retractable mooring mast at the top of the building, with a receiving mast built into the spire to lock the airship in
