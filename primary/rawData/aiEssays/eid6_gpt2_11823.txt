The builder had to show that it could do on par with the Empire State Building, which had a combined capacity of more than two billion square feet. The city also had an uphill battle to overcome. First, the city and the state spent huge amounts of money on building and installing more than 20 dirigibles. The state built a big, seven-story red brick building in the center, made of granite. But for the state, the city needed a lot of materials to make it the state building. Most of those materials went to the design of the building because of the high cost of materials and work at the plant. The State Design Office had to create the concrete that was the building's most demanding.
