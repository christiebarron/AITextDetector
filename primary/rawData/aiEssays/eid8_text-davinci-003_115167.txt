I was out with my best friend on a sunny Saturday afternoon. We were walking along the beach, trying to find the perfect spot to sit down and enjoy the beautiful day. As we passed by a large rock at the shoreline, out of nowhere, a giant wave came crashing in and swept us both off our feet! We tumbled into the cold water together, and I immediately started to laugh! 

My friend looked back at me, eyes wide with surprise at the sudden rush of water. We both started laughing uncontrollably, as if we were two kids in a playground. The two of us splashed each other, completely forgetting how cold the water was. I don’t know how long it lasted, but the moment felt like a lifetime as we enjoyed the moment together.

The shared laughter created a bond between us that day, it felt as if we were connected in ways that we weren’t before. I’m sure this moment of laughter is something we’ll both never forget.
