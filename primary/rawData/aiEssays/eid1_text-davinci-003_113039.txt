Dear Editor,

I'm writing to express my opinion on the effects of computers and technology on people's lives. In my view, computers and technology are both beneficial and detrimental factors that affect us in a variety of ways.

On the one hand, computers are incredibly useful. They help us to work faster, communicate more effectively, and stay connected with others. We can also use them for entertainment, research, and information gathering. However, computers can also have a detrimental impact on people's lives. Continuous computer use has been linked to negative physical and mental health effects, such as fatigue, depression, and anxiety. There is also the potential for increased risk of cyber-bullying, internet addiction, and social isolation.

For these reasons, I believe it is important to strike a balance between relying on computers and taking necessary precautions to avoid potential physical and mental health problems associated with increased computer use. We need to make sure that our use of technology does not impede our social and physical wellbeing. 

I hope this letter will encourage readers to look more closely at the effects that computers and technology have on people's lives.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
