Dear [Newspaper],

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. As a society, we have come to rely heavily on computers for our day-to-day tasks. While computers undoubtedly have had a positive impact on our lives, they have also posed several challenges to our health and wellbeing.

The first, and perhaps the most obvious, is that computers can have a negative influence on physical health. Eating meals at our desks, too much sitting, and too little in the way of physical activity have all been linked to numerous serious health conditions. Furthermore, screens, even when softer lit, can lead to difficulty sleeping.

The second area of concern is how computers can negatively affect our mental health. The combination of working longer hours, constant distraction, and excessive stimulation can all lead to our wellbeing. Computers often times set high expectations that can become psychologically demanding. Additionally, the distance created by technology can leave us feeling isolated and alone.

Considering these effects, it is important that we consider our computer habits. We should strive to find balance; taking regular breaks, setting boundaries, and ensuring we have a healthy sleep routine. We must also remember that technology is a tool and not a master. It shouldnâ€™t dictate our lives, but rather should help us live better.

By recognizing the potential hazards of computers and taking the necessary steps to address them, I believe we can all benefit from the positive aspects
