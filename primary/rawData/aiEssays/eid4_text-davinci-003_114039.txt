The ending of the poem Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho reflects the poet's belief in resilience and transformation. The narrator speaks of a flower that blossoms in winter, despite the cold, and has faith that they can overcome their fears and doubts and pass their test the next season. This poem is ultimately about hope and the resilience of humanity, and the narrator's ending promise to try again the next spring is a reflection of this theme. We are reminded that despite all of life's struggles, we can persevere and triumph.
