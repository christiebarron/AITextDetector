I had been friends with Nancy for almost a year when the incident occurred. We had a class together in second grade and I remember it like it was yesterday. 

It was lunchtime and the teacher asked us each to bring something to share with the class. Nancy had made a surprise container of macaroni and cheese. Everyone was excited when we opened up the containers and dug in. 

But then out of nowhere, Nancy started laughing and no one knew what we were laughing about. She could hardly contain herself and I thought it was the funniest thing I'd ever seen. She couldn't stop and after a few minutes, I was laughing too.

The teacher asked Nancy what was so funny and all she could do was point at the macaroni and cheese she had brought. When we took a closer look, we realized that Nancy had accidently put dark green leaves in among the macaroni. The teacher and the other students started laughing too. 

We couldn't stop and we laughed and laughed. It was a great moment and I'm sure Nancy will always remember it. That laughter was a moment that brought us closer together and it's something that will stay with me forever.
