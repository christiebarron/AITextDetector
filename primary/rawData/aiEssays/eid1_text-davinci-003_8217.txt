The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock on top of the building. One of the first challenges was engineering the lift mechanisms from the mooring network to the top of the building. The cable network had to be able to support the aircrafts, so it needed to withstand extreme weather conditions and high winds. The cables also needed to be structured in a way that allowed the aircrafts to gently dock into place without damages. 

The design of the mooring mast was another obstacle the builders encountered. It had to be tall enough to provide a steady mooring point for the dirigibles, while also providing enough clearance between the aircraft and the top of the building to prevent collision. In addition, any wind that entered the space between the mast and the dirigible could potentially rock the craft and destabilize the mooring system.

A further engineering challenge was ensuring the structural integrity of the building itself, both for the dirigibles docking at the top and the people inside the lower floors. Given the toll that storms could take on the building, the Empire State Buildingâ€™s foundation had to be designed to withstand the additional strain from the mooring mast. 

The final obstacle was ensuring the safety of the passengers and crew aboard the dirigibles. The initial plan called for passengers taking the elevator up to the 102nd floor and then boarding the airships at the top. This plan,
