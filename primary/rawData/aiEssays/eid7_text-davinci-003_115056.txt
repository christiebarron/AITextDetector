I was at the grocery store recently, and the line was insanely long. I was in a rush since I had to be someplace, but I was trying to remain patient. The line barely seemed to move. After what seemed like forever, I eventually reached the register. But then, the cashier had to take extra time to enter a coupon for the customer in front of me. I was so close to the end of my wait, and yet the line seemed to continue to inch forward ever so slowly. 

I could feel my patience slowly draining away, but I did my best to keep in check. Instead of letting my frustration show, I just silently waited and watched as the customer in front of me and the cashier continued to complete the checkout process. Eventually, the customer finished and I was next. I was able to quickly pay for my items and leave. 

When it was all said and done, I was still running behind schedule, but I was proud of myself for having the discipline to remain patient and not let my frustration show. I was glad that I was able to keep my composure and handle the situation like a mature adult.
