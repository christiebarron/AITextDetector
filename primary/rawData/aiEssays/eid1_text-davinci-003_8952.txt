Dear Editor:

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects of computers on people today. As technology advances, so too does our dependence on computers, yet there is a fine line between useful usage and detrimental effects.

In this digital age, computers have revolutionized how we access information. Instant communication is now possible with the touch of a button, allowing quick access to virtually any person or business we desire to connect with. In the workplace, computers are used to streamline complex tasks and are often hundreds of times more efficient than a human ever could be.

But our reliance on computers is not without its dangers. For example, hours of time can be wasted scrolling through social media sites. Furthermore, computers can lead to unhealthy physical habits due to the overuse of mouse and keyboards.

There is no doubt that computers are proving to be indispensable tools in our lives. But it is important to remember that it is humans who are in control, and without moderation and proper use, computers can cause more harm than good. That is why I encourage readers of your newspaper to make thoughtful decisions when utilizing computers.

Sincerely,

[Your name]
