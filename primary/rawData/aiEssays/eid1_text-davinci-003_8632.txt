I remember the first time I laughed with my best friend. I had known her since elementary school but it was only when we were both starting college that we got seriously close. 

We were walking home from class one day, talking about all the things that had been stressing us out about the semester. We had both registered for a particularly difficult class and it was really getting to us. After about a half-hour of discussing and worrying, we both just kind of stopped and burst into laughter. We thought it was so funny that even when we were facing a challenge, we still found the humor in it.

But that laugh was just the beginning. We found that we could laugh even through the toughest of tests, exams, projects, and classes. We would study together and when one of us needed a break, we would just start cracking jokes about the professor or our assignment. We even found ourselves making fun of our own stressful situations until we were practically in stitches.

I can honestly say that laughter has been a cornerstone of our friendship. Not only has it lightened up our lives in tough times, but it really helps keep us connected. Even if we can't be together in person, a few good laughs on the phone or online helps put a smile on my face and renews my friendship with her. 

I'm grateful for my friendship with her, and I'm especially grateful for the laughter we share.
