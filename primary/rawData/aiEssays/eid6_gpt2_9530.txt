The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One of the most difficult obstacles was getting a clear path to a view of the street, and it was never clear that a single dirigible could operate that way.

Because of these obstacles, a few dirigibles were constructed in Laurentian, Belgium, and some in Berlin. But there was one exception: the Swiss-made D-class dirigible which was intended to provide high speed control when mounted on an airplane. A different type of aircraft, the M39, had been planned with the aim of using aerodynamic control that allowed electrodes mounted on the wing to automatically stop moving the airplane, at a speed of 400 miles-per-minute.

In 1940, the D-class dirigibles were made. Since then, the German government has been busy trying to develop more high class dirigibles, and the idea of being able to turn at 50 knots is still something that a lot of people had been thinking about, even though it was too light. A few people were interested in making an airplane that could fly at 500 knots, but not because they thought that a high speed aerodynamic control would work in that case. In the end, it would not.

The German aerodynamic control system did not work in flight. The D-6 did an average of just 0.5 mph, with the best performing aircraft at 0-to-100 mph. The
