The author of the short story, Minfong Ho, ends the story with this sentence to emphasize the underlying theme of resilience through adversity. The protagonist, Tien, is struggling between two cultures, American and Chinese, and is struggling to understand her identity. Since the hibiscus flower symbolizes resilience and beauty, the author implies that no matter how difficult the obstacles Tien faced, she will be able to get through them and eventually blossom. By using the hibiscus flower to illustrate the character's journey, it implies that Tien will take her Chinese language test again in the Spring, symbolic of her newfound strength to confront her challenge and come out victorious. The use of such a hopeful ending provides moral support to the readers that adversity can be surmounted with some effort and courage.
