An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a woman with depression and who was depressed, had been in a very severe state. She had bipolar disorder and a history of high blood pressure or high triglycerides. She was hospitalized and eventually had a transfusion, had several people come and help her with her depression. Then one day she started coming and helping her come to grips with the fact that she was depressed. One day she got to the hospital, she was so depressed, that she came home and said, that she couldn't remember why.

This was very difficult as she was so distressed. I remember being quite ill in the hospital but also in my home, she was depressed. All my friends told me, this is what happens to you when you are very upset. I don't know what really happened. The fact that my wife didn't remember anything.

You know you don't see what she got to that moment, can you talk about what happened there?

How long did it take her to come back? We never talked about anything or what happened. Her mental health went into remission, and no matter what, all of a sudden she went through a huge remission. The remission began, but she went from a very depressive state to having a better life, and the time to come back to her family was very short.

I've read this story and what happened to her was very sad, although we never spoke about it.
