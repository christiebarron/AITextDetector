The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. After building the first such ship in 1898, the Imperial Commission created the Empire State Building for use as an attraction in public shows. The building's current owners included the Walt Disney Company and the Carnegie Institution. In addition, the building's existing owners were the Boston Opera House and the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. The new Empire State building received an R-A grade, but still had a low "A," compared to standard building design to date.

The building, which is now open for the public to see with the help of three private artists, was finally completed in 2006. It is currently undergoing remodel with the addition of wood panels, a decorative door and decorative windows to the inside of the building.

Directional Guidance

The Imperial Building's primary layout has featured directional displays, which have been standard from the earliest eras, the earliest days of Empire State design. Now, these directional displays do not rely on elevators, and rather use the built-in air circulation in the upper walls of the building to give off the effect of a horizontal wind that conveys air in the building or the surrounding space.

Directional displays are also used to support or promote a more visual and symbolic setting, such as the Star Wars holograms on the main lobby of the Empire State Building.
