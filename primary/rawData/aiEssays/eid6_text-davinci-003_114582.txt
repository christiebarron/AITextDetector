The Empire State Building is well known for its iconic image, but many do not realize that the building was designed with a feature unlike any other – the building was the first skyscraper with a docking station for dirigibles. Although the feature is now a relic of the past, understanding the difficulties that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock provides insight into the nature of the construction process.

The first major obstacle faced by the builders of the Empire State Building was the design of the docking station. The 200-foot slim, cone shaped mooring mast was constructed with an intricate series of cables and pulleys that used tension and counterbalances to control the mooring process. It was a huge engineering feat and because dirigibles had never been moored to a mast of this size before, the builders were unsure of its effectiveness. Also, the mooring mast was located at the top of the building – far from help if something went wrong. Despite these glaring unknowns, the construction teams forged ahead.

Another significant obstacle was the weather. The mooring mast had to be calibrated in right wind conditions, meaning that it had to be perfectly still. If the wind was too strong, the dirigible could be dragged against the mast and destroyed, and the operation had to be canceled. In addition to the weather, there were other environmental factors such as air pollution which could harm the dirigible. During this time
