When I was in college, I had invited my girlfriend to come along with me to a BBQ with my friends. I could tell she was a bit out of her comfort zone. We were all having a great time laughing and joking with one another until a few of my friends began to tease her about being so quiet. At that moment, I had to step in and they saw that I was obviously very serious about her. That's when one of my friends bust out with a joke and just as I was about to get angry, she started to laugh. She had a contagious laugh that made everyone join in and soon enough the entire room was laughing. The tension had been broken! We ended up having a great time that day and it all started with laughter.
