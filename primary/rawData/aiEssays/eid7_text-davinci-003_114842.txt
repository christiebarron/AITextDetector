I was at a restaurant recently, and I was in a hurry because I had a meeting I needed to get to. The waiter was taking a while taking my order and I could feel my patience wearing thin. I was about to express my frustration when I suddenly remembered a lesson my mother had taught me: be patient. So instead of being outwardly frustrated, I acknowledged the waiter's efforts, thanked them and simply asked if they could please hurry up so I could still make it on time. In the end, the waiter left to get my order and I was able to make it to the meeting with time to spare. The experience taught me the importance of remaining patient in difficult situations and it was a lesson I'm sure I will never forget.
