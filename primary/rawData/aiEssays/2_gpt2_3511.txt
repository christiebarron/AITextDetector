I believe that censorship of materials in libraries should be limited only to individuals who can demonstrate their commitment to the cause and defend the rights of others to access them.

Although copyright should not be abolished, I am opposed to the idea of requiring individuals to take legal action to restrict content. The content of a movie or documentary should be clear, compelling and personal. I support legal action to control access to this content, but it is my hope that the government will consider whether this is a constitutional issue and then take it up again.
