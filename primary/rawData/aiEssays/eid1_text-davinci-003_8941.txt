Dear Editor,

I am writing to bring to your attention the great impact that computers have on daily life. The ubiquity of computers has undoubtedly changed society in countless ways.

At the same time, it is also important to consider the effect computers have on people. Computers have revolutionized the way we communicate with each other, allowing us to stay in touch with friends and family more easily than ever before. They can also be used to stay informed about current events, access important information, and even complete complex tasks such as shopping and paying bills.

However, we must also consider the potential negative effects of computers, especially for those who use them frequently. There is a clear correlation between the use of computers and the prevalence of eyestrain, headaches, and other physical ailments. Additionally, excessive use of computers can lead to a disconnect from reality, an inability to concentrate, and feelings of isolation and depression.

It is clear that computers play an important role in our lives, but we need to be aware of the potential effects they can have on our physical and mental health. In this era of ubiquitous technology, it is important that we remain cognizant of how computers are affecting us and make sure to take the necessary steps to protect ourselves.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
