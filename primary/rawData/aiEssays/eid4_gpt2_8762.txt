The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because I want it to end with, "a real-life version of" where my favorite characters become my main characters – not just because there's a reason that I do this.

So, it was a great idea.

Why are you so passionate about this book?

I've been a fan of A Game of Thrones that started with the books that came out with the The Winds of Winter, and now everything that came out with A Game of Thrones is one big and exciting story about the First Wave of the Dragonflight and dragons. One collegiate chapter, that lasted two chapters, was really exciting as a book. To know how excited I am now, it's very exciting to know that people are saying they like it now, as I want to know how passionate they are about it all because I have my own view when it comes down to it.

I know people would say that's not the kind of show I want to know about. The way a guy writes his novels, and the way the characters come out, it's not like we want to talk about all these issues that have to do with men, and what does that say to that? It was a really hard thing to talk about because there's a lot of writers – there are really really, really hard things that you can talk about – that are not in the books, but in fact are really interesting to be involved with.
