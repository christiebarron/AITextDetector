In a society where freedom of speech is valued, censorship in our libraries is an important issue that shouldnâ€™t be ignored. Books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from the shelves if they are found to be offensive.

We must begin by considering the risks that censorship poses to our society. By removing objects they deem offensive, librarians risk stifling important conversations and quelling the diversity of ideas in our communities. Libraries should be bastions of democracy, offering an unrestricted variety of materials and resources to help shape an open dialogue around all forms of thought. Censorship would thus only perpetuate existing prejudices, further marginalizing marginalized groups and snuffing out progressive thought.

We should also note the implications that censorship has on education. With materials gone, students would be deprived of the valuable insight they can gain from accessing and analyzing them. Libraries exist to provide an unbiased learning environment in which all forms of expression can be both respected and discussed. By removing materials from the shelves, librarians would interfere with our education by withholding potentially crucial information from us. 

Ultimately, censorship jeopardizes our right to freedom of speech, avoiding serious conversations needed to foster an accepting and progressive society. Instead of removing objects found to be offensive, librarians should serve as hosts for respectful dialogue and open debate. We should value the right of access to a variety of resources, and as citizens of a democracy, refuse censorship in our libraries.
