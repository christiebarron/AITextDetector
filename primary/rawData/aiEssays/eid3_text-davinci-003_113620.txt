In Joe Kurmaski's short story "Rough Road Ahead," the setting plays a crucial role in affecting the cyclist's experience. The cyclist embarks on a journey through a seemingly unknown area, where the road has deteriorated from its previous state. As the cyclist continues, the condition of the road worsens and the harsh reality of the environment settles in.

The features of the setting have a major impact on the cyclist. The rough terrain and broken road makes the journey difficult, forcing the cyclist to adjust his pace and course. With its boulder-filled ravines and poorly maintained roads, the environment also takes an emotional toll on the cyclist. He is left feeling isolated and exposed - no one is around to lend a hand if he needs help, and he has to rely on his own strength and determination to survive. 

The cyclist is also profoundly affected by the physical elements present in the setting. Rain, wind, and dust are all common features of the environment. These elements affect the cyclist's physical wellbeing, posing a potential safety concern. He is quickly reminded that he is alone and vulnerable in a hostile environment. 

All of these features of the setting contribute to the experience of the cyclist. By facing the harsh reality of the environment, the cyclist is forced to confront his own limitations as he pushes himself further. The setting of "Rough Road Ahead" gives the cyclist an opportunity to prove himself and exercise his will in a way he never thought possible
