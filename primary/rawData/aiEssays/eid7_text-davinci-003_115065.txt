I was patience the other day when I was in the store. I was trying to figure out how to make a purchase in the self-checkout line since I wasn't familiar with how it worked. As the frustration was beginning to build, an elderly woman observing my struggle stepped up to offer me help. Despite how busy she looked, she took her time to kindly walk me through the entire process. 

She didn't rush me, and she answered all my questions patiently. Her demeanor made me feel grateful and calm. This simple act of kindness reminded me of how important it is to remain patient, no matter what the situation may be.
