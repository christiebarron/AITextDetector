I was once in a long line at the grocery store when I was in a hurry to get back home. I was already anxious and out of patience when I heard a young child start to cry. His mother was trying to keep him quiet and calm but he was having none of it. I could tell that she was flustered and embarrassed.

At first, I was ready to throw my hands up and leave the line, but then something amazing happened. Everyone in the line, including myself, started to show understanding and sympathy. The people in front of me offered their snacks to the little boy and those behind me started singing silly songs to distract him. 

Seeing everyone come together and be patient made me remember to take a deep breath and be kind too. By the time we reached the check out, the little boy was calm and happy, and his mother was grateful and relieved. 

Overall, this experience taught me the power of patience and how much kindness it can bring to an otherwise stressful situation.
