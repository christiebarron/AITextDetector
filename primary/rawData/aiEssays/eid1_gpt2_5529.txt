Computers have many effects on people. So how do you determine what effects is expected in a scenario where you have more than one person in a room?

So you could go out and do these research on the psychology of the people, looking at what they like on TV, where their friends are, what they like on the Internet, etc. A lot of people will have their head in the sand on it, and it will kind of have effects on who they are as well, they will have their family or co-workers (a lot) but it's definitely something that your understanding of how the brain works in that context can help you.

If you have a really small group of people and you want to experiment with their personality types on a larger sample of people, then in a large sample of groups, you could try to show people in a group that they're in a different mode of thinking with a different personality type, and they could be more receptive to more, more open and creative, and that might help you decide which personality to consider.

Are you comfortable with the potential of AI?

If people are happy with different personality types then you'll come up with some other means for their emotional needs, their relationship needs to be the best they can be.

I'm also fascinated with the potential that, if they're healthy for it, people will use it to be more emotionally secure, and I'm thinking that they should be using it
