I had just started dating my new girlfriend, and we were both eager to get to know each other better. We decided to take a walk in the park on a sunny Spring day. As we walked, we started to share our favorite jokes. We were both chuckling and laughing so hard that everyone around us was looking at us curiously. 

At one point, I leaned in and whispered a joke directly into her ear. It was something funny that I had heard at work. She responded with a little punch to my arm and a silly growling sound. We both laughed uproariously at how silly we both sounded. 

This new laughter between us felt magical. We continued to laugh and joke throughout our walk. We even made up a few of our own jokes. When we finished our walk, I remember feeling so much lighter and happier than when we had begun it. 

I was so grateful for that moment â€” it was such a powerful reminder that laughter is a key ingredient in the making of any meaningful relationship.
