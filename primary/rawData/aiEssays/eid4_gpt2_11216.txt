The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because of the way in which he manages to use the story's elements with his own personal feelings, so the reader finds himself constantly struggling to believe what he thinks. We already know he never really had any problems with the world, but even then, as it turns out, when he tries to talk back to Snow about something he has never touched, Snow gets very angry in response, and this is the only thing he can control, the reader never being able to see the actual events of our life. That's how we end up in those scenes, because Winter is always trying to make us feel bad or guilty, and at The End of the World he tries to kill you with his own words, so we're never being able to see what he's trying to achieve at all. We'll never be able to actually see what he is trying to accomplish, but you won't have a book that feels at all like that. The end result is that the story ended with a love triangle in the form of a man who had died in cold blood, to which we find ourselves trapped in a story we will never see.

I feel like some of it is simply that a lot of the characters in The End of the World are dead, and there's no reason why it should bother them (or anyone else), as it seems to be an effort made by the authors themselves to give themselves a bit of a push in the process
