I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a fundamental right. At least it is in my opinion in many ways. In our country I find it the most common thing that people do after school. They go down to the libraries, I was there, and they read their children's stories in the library. And this is done by the government and by the schools. And they are so concerned about that," he said, adding, "If you do a story about how to improve children's education, I have a really bad feeling." The book's author is a self-proclaimed feminist.
 Tideey said he will fight censorship on behalf of his book.

The legal challenge, filed in U.S District Court in Chicago early this month, was filed before Cook County Board President Andy D'Alessandro of the Chicago Public Schools. The ACLU of Illinois and the Alliance Legal Services will represent D'Alessandro.

It is now against the law to censor or harm other citizens in response to what D'Alessandro says are "political or religious beliefs related to censorship." While the "right" is a protected right, the "wrong" means censorship for other reasons.

In this case, D'Alessandro said there are no religious reasons for censoring an information story. In addition, the school board will not block a public information presentation that the school can choose to display.
