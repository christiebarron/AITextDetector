As an avid student of free speech, I believe that books, music, movies and magazines should not be removed from the shelves of a library if they are considered offensive by some members of our society. Librarians and other library staff should instead provide a warning regarding the content of any of these materials, if appropriate.

Censorship represents a direct violation of freedom of expression and a diminishment of cultural diversity. Book burning and other forms of censor have a long and storied history in our society, and the results are always damaging to the freedom of the people. Removing books from library shelves or refusing to purchase them, for example, is a form of censorship and often has dire consequences that lead to the loss of valuable human rights, such as access to information and the ability to express one’s own opinions.

Censorship can also have a chilling effect on our society, leading to a less-informed, less creative citizenry.Materials that potentially could be censored in a library, from textbooks to literature, contain valuable ideas, stories, histories and philosophies that would be lost if censored. We should not be so quick to silence other voices from the library in a misguided attempt to shield “normal” or “appropriate” citizens from potentially offensive materials.

That said, providing a warning about potentially controversial or objectionable content is an effective way to protect others from content they may find offensive while still allowing people to access these materials should
