The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock on the building. The idea of docking an airship to the tallest building in the world seemed to be a near impossibility, one that would be filled with unforeseen challenges and dangers. In the novel The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted, the obstacles faced are described in detail.

The first major challenge for the builders of the Empire State Building was its structural soundness. Building an aerial dock onto an existing structure was difficult, and the building had to be thoroughly tested and reinforced to ensure it could withstand the additional weight. It was a daunting challenge, even for the experienced architects and engineers at the time.

The second obstacle was the climate of New York City. Since the building was located so high in the air and was exposed to the elements, it often had to contend with strong winds, freezing temperatures, and snowfall, all of which could make the dock unstable and dangerous to small airships. To ensure the mooring mast could be used safely, the builders had to take extra precautions by installing nets to protect the airships from damaging gusts of winds.

The third challenge faced by the builders was a lack of resources. Assembling the dock and installing the necessary cables and equipment was expensive and required a great deal of time and labor. The builders had to use all their creativity and ingenuity to complete the project within their limited budget and timeframe
