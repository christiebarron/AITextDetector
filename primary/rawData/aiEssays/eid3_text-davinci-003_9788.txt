The features of the setting are essential to the story of "Rough Road Ahead‚Äù by Joe Kurmaski. The story follows a cyclist that is riding up a steep hill. The setting highlights the difficult physical nature of the task, which in turn affects the cyclist's emotions and bravery.

The road is described as an old country road, its surface uneven and pockmarked with shards of rock and gravel. This hazardous terrain is designed to challenge the cyclist and test his chances of success in making it to the top. The cyclist must remain vigilant to avoid the dips and bumps; if he fails to keep his balance he could become injured. The cyclist is also subjected to a continuous stream of wind coming from the top of the hill and swirling around him in turbulent gusts. This wind further complicates the cyclist's task, as it is strong enough to require strength and skill to control the bike.

The rugged setting serves to further emphasize the difficulty of the cyclist's task. The steep incline of the hill, the treacherous rocky road and gusting winds all work together to make the cyclist's journey even more difficult. The cyclist must find the courage and stamina to face these physical and mental obstacles. It is clear that the environment around the cyclist directly affects his journey and has an impact on the story's outcome.
