The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock since the engineering of the building was unlike anything that had come before it. The design of the building had to facilitate the construction of the only public airship docking mast in the world. One of the major challenges the builders faced was designing a foundation that would be strong enough to support the weight of an airship. Since a dirigible was anywhere from five to eight times the weight of an airplane, the architects had to plan an exceptionally sturdy footing that could support the vessel when it landed on the mast.

Another major obstacle was the developing the infrastructure of the mast and supporting it with the building. While the mooring mast itself was a tall steel tower covered with guy wires for support, the attitude of the mast in relation to the building had to be carefully calculated. This was to ensure the mast was level and wouldn't be thrown off balance by the pull of an airship. The mast also required a complex system of cables and pulleys that stretched from the top of the mast to the lower levels of the building, allowing it to be raised and lowered to meet the needs of the plane. 

In addition to the engineering feats, the builders of the Empire State Building had to consider safety requirements. The mast was designed with an interlock system which would give off a warning signal if the airship began to drift too close to the tower, alerting the pilots to pull away
