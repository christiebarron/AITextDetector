In the early 20th century, the construction of the Empire State Building began in New York City with the ambitious plan to incorporate a mooring mast to attract dirigibles and other airships to dock on the buildingâ€™s roof. Despite this forward-thinking proposal, constructing such a structure encountered several obstacles. 

The biggest obstacle both builders and architects faced was convincing the local fire insurance board that it would be safe to have airships dock on the building. Airships had been a relatively new form of transportation and there was a concerning lack of experience in docking them on tall buildings in busy cities like New York. To address this concern, the designers of the mooring mast had to create a system that could safely secure dirigibles to the roof. This challenge also called for them to engineer a structure capable of withstanding and supporting the airships, which was no small feat. 

In addition to structuring a secure mooring mast, the designers also had to make sure that the engine exhaust from the airships would not create a threat for those in the building or those in the area. In light of this, the mast included an exhaust funnel to direct the engines' smoke away from the building. 

Designers also had to resolve the issues of how the dirigibles, passengers and crew would access the roof of the building. The design for the mooring mast included the installation of elevators capable of bringing the passengers
