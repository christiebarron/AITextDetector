The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it feels very interesting as a history-based book and for all readers who have read it who might also enjoy looking back. A story is written and narrated from inside the book using multiple accounts and by multiple interpreters. A character is told from various perspectives from afar, sometimes on a personal mission on a business trip.

What makes this book so special is what it tries to tell about the nature of magic. It's hard for me to think of any other book on earth that would convey what I hope there is in Snow and Ice books and this book can. It's quite possibly the best place to start when you're reading this.

I think it really has a lot of charm and an elegance about itlivious to the expectations it raises. You could say I am a fan of JRR Tolkien's "The Lord of the Rings" or the first person that ever wrote "Omen" but, like the books, it tries to portray in characters more of a fairy tale and instead of seeing how fantasy comes to an end, it uses it to tell a story.

I did have one copy of this book that I wanted so much for Christmas. I went to work on the book the following week and it didn't get here right away. So it's a little bit of a throwaway, but it's a wonderful read.

I'm sure there are people who had a hard time reading
