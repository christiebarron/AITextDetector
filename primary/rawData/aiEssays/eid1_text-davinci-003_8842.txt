My mother was always the type to make light of any situation, no matter how dire. She had a quick wit and was able to make me and my siblings laugh no matter what was going on around us. I remember the time my parents got into an argument and things were getting heated. Just when things were about to turn serious, my mother said something so ridiculous that I couldn’t help but burst into laughter. The tension evaporated and the argument was abruptly over.

Throughout the years my mother’s ability to lighten the mood has been a great comfort to me in difficult times. I’m grateful for the gift of laughter she has given to me and my family, and I’m able to carry on her legacy whenever I can by lightening someone’s mental or emotional burden with an appropriate joke or quip.
