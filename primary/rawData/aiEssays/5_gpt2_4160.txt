The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' in April is a sense of desperation, a longing to help others as they do to themselves and to themselves.

The words, 'One day at a time', came from a friend of mine and his former girlfriend, and were spoken several times during an interminable phone interview, before the interview was over.

'We do love each other,' he says. 'We don't feel anything. We just laugh.'

His family is'mollified', yet they still laugh at how things are on the ground in Aleppo.

'Sometimes we get a little annoyed because we don't live in the city, which is a huge problem and we have no control over what happens to our money or everything. But we are happy with things, and that's why they are all good. We get out of the business,' he explains.
