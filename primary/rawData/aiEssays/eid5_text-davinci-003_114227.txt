Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, "From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives," traces the history of his family from his grandparentsâ€™ generation to his own, beginning in his home town of Barrio, Puerto Rico, and ending in his current home of New York City. Rodriguez paints a vivid picture of the lives of his ancestors through rich detail and vivid imagery, creating a strong sense of the connection between the generations of his family and between his home towns.

The mood of the memoir is one of heritage and reflection. It begins with Rodriguez's great-grandparents, who first came to the United States from Puerto Rico, and chronicles their efforts to create a home away from home. Through these stories of struggle and perseverance, a sense of admiration and respect for his ancestors is created. As the memoir progresses, Rodriguez reflects upon the changes in his home town of Barrio over the years, both in appearance and the people who call it home. The mood of the memoir shifts to one of sadness and nostalgia as he remembers the gradual gentrification of Barrio and the loss of the Puerto Rican culture that once filled its streets.

As the memoir progresses, Rodriguez also reveals the more intimate details of his life, his dreams, and his relationships. Through his stories, Rodriguez conveys a deep emotional connection to his home town, and of his longing to remain connected to it even as his life evolves. This emotional depth creates a mood of love and nostalgia throughout
