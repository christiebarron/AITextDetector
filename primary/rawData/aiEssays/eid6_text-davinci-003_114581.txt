The Empire State Building's envisioned potential for mooring dirigibles was not realized until the early 1930s. The main obstacle that stood in the way of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building were the safety risks due to the strong prevailing winds of Manhattan. While the concept of allowing dirigibles to dock is attractive, it was clear to builders that the structures strength in such a windy city needed to be taken into consideration.

The main challenge facing builders was creating a rigid mast that would be able to support the load of a dirigible, while also flexible enough to sway in the wind. There was also the issue of designing a stable mount that could be used to dock the dirigible safely. At the time, the prevailing winds around the Empire State Building were clocked at between fifty-five and sixty-five miles per hour. Not to mention the fog that was common in the city during the 1930s, which made it difficult to see the building from the sky.

It was clear that the builders had to employ creative solutions to ensure a safe landing and secure hold of the dirigible. The answer was a rigid mast, two hundred feet high, which could bend slightly in the wind without breaking. The mast also had a deep moat and stone walls between it and the building, creating a secure but wind-buffered area to moor the dirigible. The stable mount itself was designed to hold the weight of a full-
