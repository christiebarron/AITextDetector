The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Although the building may look like their first attempts at a dirigible, the process of designing and installing a dirigible proved extremely hard. The first steps were to put in the most recent version of the A8-powered jet engine that the Imperial Army used on missions such as the Battle of Terra in 1058 ABY. The A8-powered jet engines produced more thrust than they delivered, making it far more aerodynamic and maneuverable, but the result was nothing short of a fiasco. Eventually, engineers of a different type of jet engine decided that A8-powered helicopters could provide enough thrust to keep up with the weight of the heavier warthogs. Since only a single jet engine could achieve at least a 3,500-pound increase, only a single pilot could be allowed to make a manned appearance during the day on one of the many battles the A8 was part of.

The U-20, the original U-20 reconnaissance aircraft, was a late addition to the Navy to join the fighting in Imperial Rome. Most U-20's were powered by a twin-cylinder engine Caption, and one of these was the U-20A, which was designed by Eero V, to carry one of Europe's most versatile bomber planes. Because it was so low-cost, it was always an effective option for military and commercial aircraft, and its use in the Imperial Navy
