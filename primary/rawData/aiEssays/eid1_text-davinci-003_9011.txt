Dear Editor, 

Recently, computers have been playing an increasingly important role in the lives of people both young and old. As a society, we now heavily rely on technology to power our daily activities, accelerating almost every aspect of our lives. Unfortunately, this shift has not been without drawbacks, as computer use has been correlated with decreased physical and mental health and other disrupted behaviors.

Using computers too often may lead to physical issues such as headaches, eyestrain and muscle aches due to prolonged sitting and mobility issues from lack of exercise. As oneâ€™s physical health deteriorates, their emotional and mental well-being can plummet as well. According to scientific studies, people who spend large amounts of time on the computer report feeling more stressed and anxious due to the inability to have meaningful social connections. In addition, computer addiction has been linked to sleep deprivation, unhealthy food choices, and intrusive, compulsive thoughts.

I believe it is important that we all use computers responsibly, and limit our exposure when necessary. Computers can be useful tools, but they are no substitute for social and physical interaction or for living a healthy lifestyle. I call on the readers of this letter to remember that computers can be a great asset--provided they are used in moderation. 

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
