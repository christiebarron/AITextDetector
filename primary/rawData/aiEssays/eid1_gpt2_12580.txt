Computers have many effects on people. A recent study in The Lancet and many researchers have identified some of the key ones.

For instance, researchers reported that the brain produces memories much like those created when you're a child. When researchers investigated how the human mind has been able to process and recall information generated by a set of neurons (the central nervous system), they found a different phenomenon.

This study examined the brains of subjects with the brain damaged, including schizophrenia and Alzheimer's, and the brain of people with normal mental ability, who showed increased activity in the regions of the brain that help us remember the information we didn't know.

It's important to note that the people with schizophrenia and Alzheimer's all had brain damage. They didn't have to be a complete degenerative condition to have those effects, but they still have enough to be associated with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease at age 60.

Of course a simple rule of thumb to make sure you don't have any brain damage is not to have your hands or nose damaged.

And while they're not immune to anything, people with normal brain health often show signs of Alzheimer's disease when they move. In fact research continues to suggest that people with Alzheimer's are at a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's dementia and dementia after treatment with statins, antidepressants and lifestyle changes in combination.

But for those of us who have Alzheimer's, these findings won't get you a free shot.
