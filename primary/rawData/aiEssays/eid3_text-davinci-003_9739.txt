The setting of 'Rough Road Ahead' by Joe Kurmaski has a major impact on the cyclist in the story. The environment the cyclist rides in creates obstacles and challenges that influence the cyclist's journey.

The first feature of the setting is the terrain. The cyclist rides through mountainous terrain with plenty of ups and downs. The constantly changing elevation affects the cyclist's speed and strength, as the cyclist must maintain steady momentum in order to keep their pace. The terrain also affects the cyclist's momentum, as it is harder to start up again from a dead stop on high elevation grounds.

The second element of the setting that affects the cyclist is the weather. The cyclist rides through a thunderstorm, which is dangerous due to the risk of being struck by lightning and the slippery, wet surface of the road. The weather also affects the cyclist's speed, as difficult conditions increase the chances of skidding out or slipping off of the bike.

Finally, the setting also plays an important role in the cyclist's emotions. The cyclist must make the journey alone, and the vast expanse of the terrain, combined with the harshness of the weather, can evoke feelings of loneliness and isolation.  The rider's emotions are further complicated by the fear of the unknown, as the rider must confront the possibility of a mechanical failure or another unexpected emergency.

Overall, the setting of 'Rough Road Ahead' influences the cyclist's journey in both practical and emotional ways.
