An example of a time someone in my life was patient was an elderly woman who was dying in hospital. She suffered serious injuries and couldn't be revived, she had a broken toe and was in serious pain and she was in a stable condition. Her parents took her to an organ transplant clinic which was the first to be set up and her entire life had been saved. The organ was later removed. I remember as I looked at her on my screen she was crying from the tears coming into it.

It's so hard to remember the details of your life now as well as your own. I remember thinking so deeply about it for a while. It was also the first time I made one of those memories in my life when I found out the information from the Wikipedia article about your cancer.

It's just that it only started because of this story and the many stories out there that have spread about this cancer. Even my friends think about it because they see and hear about it but no one is looking at my story like I want to, or want to talk about it as a whole or for what it is. All people are listening and thinking about it or maybe they have a friend who knows her.

It's not the first time I've had cancer, but this was the first time I looked at it. I was so moved and really sad by the first episode. It takes me so long to feel that it can happen to anyone and we all should start over
