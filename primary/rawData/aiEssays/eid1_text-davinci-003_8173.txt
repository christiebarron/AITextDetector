The completion of the Empire State Building in 1931 marked a major feat of engineering, one made all the more impressive by the sheer number of obstacles the builders faced. Perhaps one of the biggest of these obstacles was the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. This was an ambitious idea, and required a lot of planning and innovation to successfully bring it to fruition.

The first step in getting the plan off the ground was to determine what would be required in order to support the large ships. Due to the height of the building, the mast that connected the top of the building to the dock had to be strong enough to withstand strong winds and the considerable weight a dirigible would bring with it. To address this issue, a steel frame structure was constructed, as opposed to the wooden mooring mast used in other sites. This steel frame provided the necessary strength and support to the mooring mast.

In addition to the steel frame, a number of other unique features were added to the mooring mast. In order to guide the dirigibles, a light was installed at the end of the mast, flashing a sequential pattern of red and green. This light was given the nickname "The Lighthouse of the Sky", and helped to indicate to dirigibles where to safely moor. Furthermore, a flagpole was attached to the tower and two landing platforms were constructed. To enable the dirigibles to safely dock, water ball
