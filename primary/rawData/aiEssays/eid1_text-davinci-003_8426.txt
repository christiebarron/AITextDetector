I was on a flight to visit my aunt in California and the trip was not going according to plan. Shortly after take off, we had to make an emergency landing due to a mechanical issue. Although everyone (myself included) was obviously frustrated and anxious to reach our destination, nobody on the plane made a single complaint. Instead, everyone chose to be patient and understanding. I was in awe of the people around me for staying so calm in the face of such an unexpected delay.

When we finally touched down, everyone's kind disposition was even more evident. The flight crew worked tirelessly to turn the plane around and get us back in the air quickly. Passengers thanked them for their diligence and many even offered words of encouragement.

This experience has taught me how important it is to remain patient when we come upon difficult and unexpected times in life. Through witnessing the utmost respect the passengers and flight crew showed each other, I now understand why keeping a cool head in the face of a challenge is so important.
