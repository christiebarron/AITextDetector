I am writing to share my opinion on the effects computers have on people today. From my own experience and those of the people around me I believe that computers have a profoundly positive effect on our lives and should be embraced rather than feared.

Computers have made more information available to us than ever before. We can find answers to almost any question within seconds by using search engines such as Google. Working from home has been made a possibility due to the communication power of computers. Individuals can join discussion groups, build online resumes, participate in forums, and apply for jobs with every application now available online. Not only does this make a person's life easier, but it increases the chances of finding the right job.

The many types of entertainment that can be accessed on computers make work and school more bearable by providing much needed relief from our daily lives. With the development of the internet, online videos, music, and streaming services, our world has become a lot more entertaining!

The use of computers can also help us save time. A huge range of tasks can now be completed quickly and efficiently. Shopping, banking, studying, and even applying for jobs can now be done with the click of a mouse. Computers also allow for people to work remotely, which gives them more free time for family and friends.

To conclude, computers have had a major, positive impact on peopleâ€™s lives. I would urge readers to begin
