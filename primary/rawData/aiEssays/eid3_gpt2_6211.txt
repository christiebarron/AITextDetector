Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

One of the most common things to do is to create an ROC environment (for example, in a car's front seats). This is a way of keeping drivers safe at all times.

With these, all the settings are in place and the cycling community can choose to use what they prefer. For example, if your ROC setup comes with a 4:1 layout (not the classic 3:1 layout of 3-8) you could decide to have another option where all the settings are separate. This way you'll have the choice to have what you like.
