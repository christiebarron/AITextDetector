One time, my cousin and I were getting ready to go out for a walk. She was dressed in jeans and a plain white t-shirt and I was in my best dress. She couldn't stop laughing at the contrast between us. I was trying to be serious and dignified, but it was no use when she just kept on snickering at me. 

Eventually I gave up, and we both laughed until tears were streaming down our faces. We couldn't stop, and eventually had to sit on the curb outside her house, still laughing. 

It felt amazing to share a moment like that with my cousin. We had both been feeling a little gloomy that day, but in that moment, we had let all our worries go and just enjoyed spending time together. 

Laughter really is the best medicine, and I'm so thankful I had that moment with my cousin.
