The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho serves to emphasize the power of resilience and hard work. The protagonist, Ai-ling, values her education and dreams of a successful career in the future, in spite of the struggles and hard work required to achieve it. She finds strength in the resilience of the winter hibiscus that she grew under the snow, and the idea that just like the flower, she too will blossom in time. Despite her discouragement for failing some of her tests, she is determined to take them again when the spring comesâ€”just like how the winter hibiscus will be in full bloom when the snow melts and the geese return. The ending provides us with a hopeful glimpse of Ai-ling, overcoming her struggles through hard work to succeed in her future.
