Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

1. The setting is set up as follows:

Troublemaker: For anyone new to racing, the setting will allow them to "understand the rules of the game, whether they play or run the game"

Reargability: A rider may have any combination of stats or statistics displayed anywhere on their profile, for example, with a picture of a horse on a bike or a picture of a body part in a car. This allows them to know when an impact is coming on to make it feel better and make more efficient use of their power.

2. The setting does allow for the game to help drivers and road cyclists, by "manipulating the characteristics of the riding patterns to better represent the terrain." This allows these cyclists to "see a smoother ride on the track instead of just a sharp one"

Downtrodden: While this setting is very similar to the other entries in this setting, it's rather different because it's focused on the cyclist's ability to keep their power in check. If they don't track hard, riders can easily lose power and risk a serious tyre leak that can easily ruin their race result.
