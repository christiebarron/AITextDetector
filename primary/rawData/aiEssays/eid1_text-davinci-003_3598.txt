 

I was visiting my best friend at her new apartment. We had just finished unpacking her boxes, and the living room was looking a little bare, so we decided to head to the store to pick up a couch. While we were there, we spotted a ridiculously large, over-the-top velvet sofa that was the epitome of cheesy and tacky—it even had a built-in cup holder!

We couldn't stop laughing. My friend suggested we buy it, and I agreed. We lugged the sofa up three flights of stairs and when we finally got it into her living room, of course it wouldn't fit. We had to take out all the furniture and still it wouldn't fit in the space.

We were both exhausted and laughing so hard it hurt, especially considering all the work we put into getting it up there. But that was my favorite day there. It was the moment my best friend and I truly bonded – laughter is the best form of friendship, and I don't think either of us will ever forget that day.
