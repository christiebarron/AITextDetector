The problem was that the building industry had seen little to no progress in this area since the mid-80s. Indeed, one of the most influential and successful manufacturers was the Dutch firm, M&P & Co (which also had an empire in the State Building), the most popular and profitable of which was the Prussian Visceral Empire, which was founded by the architect Karl Kugel. The design features and details are very similar to those that are found in Jules Verne's Parisian landscape, but the style has been influenced by several other examples of architecture before.
