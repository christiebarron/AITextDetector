Dear Editor,

As society becomes increasingly dependent on computers, it’s important to evaluate the effects these machines have had on people. After much reflection, I strongly believe that the effects of computers on people are overwhelmingly positive. 

To begin with, computers have resulted in a great many convenience benefits. From organizing home finances to scheduling a doctor’s appointment with the click of a button, people can automate their lives to a great extent. Having access to powerful computers also means that individuals can find information quickly and accurately. Whether someone needs to research a book report or plan a vacation, computers provide an efficient solution for information and task management.

In addition to the convenience factor, computers have also enabled individuals to develop creative skills. With sophisticated software tools such as Adobe Creative Suite, individuals can design artwork, websites, and videos with relative ease. Computers also fuel the field of education; online courses make it possible for people to pursue degrees and certifications like never before. 

Furthermore, computers have created a platform for people to express their ideas and connect with others. Just look at the vast world of social media and blogging that we have today. People around the world have been given the resources to craft and audiences that they could not have received decades ago. 

We should be grateful for all the opportunities computers have provided us. I am confident that readers will recognize the tremendous benefits these machines bring to our lives. 

Sincerely
