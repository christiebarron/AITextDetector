Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho ends with this line to emphasize the idea that the protagonist, Loi, has been successful in understanding and learning new information throughout the winter. This line also symbolizes the idea of resilience; Loi has encountered a difficult challenge, but has ultimately persevered and is now ready to take on an upcoming test. By concluding the poem with the idea of "taking the test again," Minfong Ho is suggesting that Loi is now better prepared and more confident in his abilities.
