Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have had on our lives. In my opinion, computer technology has had a profoundly positive impact on our lives; it has opened up a whole new world of possibilities for communication and entertainment and has provided us with access to limitless amounts of information.

Computer technology has also changed the way in which we conduct business. Companies are able to work faster and more efficiently as they can share files and documents more easily, communicate virtually in real time, and keep their data secure. Furthermore, with the emergence of cloud computing, companies are now able to store their files and documents in a secure and off-site area, allowing for a faster and more efficient retrieval of data.

Computer technology has also revolutionised the way in which we can work and study. The internet has allowed us to access a wealth of information from any location, at any time. In addition, it has enabled us to create our own electronic portfolios, giving us the ability to showcase our work to a wider audience.

In sum, computer technology has improved our lives in a wide variety of ways. Whether it be for working, studying, or entertainment, computer technology has enabled us to do things a lot faster and easier than ever before. I am confident that if you take the time to consider the effects computers have had on our lives, you will agree with me that the positive far outweighs the negative.

Sincerely,
