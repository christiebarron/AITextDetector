I was meeting my friend, Charlie, for lunch. We hadn't seen each other in a while, as he had been busy with work and I with school. I was a little nervous, as it was our first time seeing each other in a while.

As we settled in at the restaurant and started catching up, we soon found ourselves talking about a funny situation that had happened the other day. We both started laughing, and then began to laugh harder and harder. Before long, the entire restaurant was looking at us. We were laughing so hard we couldn't stop.

We kept going until we noticed that the other patrons were getting angry with us for being so loud. We composed ourselves and tried to focus on our food, but the laughter would keep bubbling up every few seconds, so eventually we decided to just give in and continue to laugh.

It was the most fun I had had in a long time, and I couldn't be more thankful that I had chosen to have lunch with my friend. I felt like we had bridged the gap between us with laughter, and I couldn't wait to see him again soon.
