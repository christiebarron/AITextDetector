The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it really does get you to grips with the idea of going from one to ten different kinds of living creatures in a year. In the previous paragraph you could only go from one species of living animal to the next one. The other two types of life were far from that situation. There was no way to create an entirerator's living tree for an entirely different type of life, one that would evolve to become all kinds of creatures instead of merely creatures that lived at different times in different years. How many of us were willing to commit to a new type of life for the first time in our lifetimes, not before our ancestors?

Well the answer is that our evolutionary timeline got progressively better as we changed from one species to another, and, to a lesser extent, the life we became was exponentially better. We made more progress in this direction from the start, but we still had to use the same tools and patterns to improve our lives. There are many other ways to do this right. So we can try to do it right, to the point that we vetoed it in the hope that this would make it a little bit clearer and help people understand more how we can be better than we are.

And, there's something else you can do, too, as well. When you look more closely, you'll be able to see that we're moving beyond just one of the three species of animals of each.
