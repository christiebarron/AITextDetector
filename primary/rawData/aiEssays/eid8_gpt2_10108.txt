One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my dog's mouth wasn't a complete and utter mess after eating the wrong vegetables. There was a point when I began to let go of my dog's mouth. He'd put it on his back as if on a leash, and when I wasn't sure of what was doing my dog, I put another mouth on it and started to eat. I'd be like, "Nope, that wasn't funny." It took two years to find my way around again. It's funny, it's fun, it's my life.

I don't think there will be forever. But hopefully I've kept going on it. I know it's been an awesome experience, but I've always had a good time, always been able to talk to people that I loved and I feel good out there. I hope to continue to go out, enjoy life and keep fighting.
