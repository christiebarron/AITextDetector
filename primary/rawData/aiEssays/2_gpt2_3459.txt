I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a fundamental right and that we should keep that in mind," she says.

What is censorship?

In a world where books are frequently censored and where technology provides more powerful tools for scholars — including research assistants, digital forensics, researchers and investigators — people do the best they can to protect their rights.

"We have to try to look at these people as individuals, who are trying to protect their work due to censorship," she says.

Sara Joplin, director of the National Library System in Baltimore, Baltimore University's (BLU) Access to Intelligence, says what we see in libraries is actually just a way to protect the lives of people who might otherwise not be threatened, including potential victims, family members, and members of loved ones.

But the idea of the books being "closed" makes people feel threatened.

"Some of these people are looking for new books and it's very sad," she says. "I feel like it is being held in a bad space by the censorship of this community."

Joplin says we should be asking the public for their help.

Not everyone sees a difference.

"My experience is that the authors say it's about protecting them because they know it, because they're in communication with their audience," says Carol Sallister, a professor in the department of international literature
