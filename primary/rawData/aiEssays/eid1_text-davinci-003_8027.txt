The construction of the Empire State Building was a monumental achievement in the early 1930s. But its success was not without its obstacles. One such obstacle that the builders faced was how to incorporate allowing dirigibles to dock at the top, as had been originally proposed. This posed a unique engineering challenge, as the original plans for the building called for a tall, narrow tower of steel and nearly a thousand feet in the air, far higher than any structure of its kind had been built before. 

The presence of dirigibles posed another set of problems. The giant airships required a steady supply of electric power to keep their internal lights powered, operate the engines, and provide an external beacon for navigation. It was also necessary to provide a stable mooring system to allow the airships to dock safely. 

The plans for the Empire State Building included a metal spire rising from the top of the building and a mast, known as "The Mooring Mast," rising above the spire for signaling and navigation purposes. This was the only part of the building extended above the approximately one thousand feet of the actual tower. The engineers designed a docking system incorporating a strong web lattice that anchored the top of the round mast to the steel spire, providing the necessary strength to hold the metal frame of a dirigible in place. 

Although the latticework construction and mooring systems provided a reliable way for the airships to dock at the top
