I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is counterproductive to academic freedom and is dangerous," he said, adding that libraries have been known to allow any books to be published under their ownership.

I met with the chairwoman of Public Libraries Victoria in April and asked her about government policies to limit the amount of free material that can be published in their libraries. She said that only certain resources such as social media, education policy and the like can provide material that is suitable for children and that would not be published under those policies. She added that libraries should not allow publishers to put books into their books library, but allow books to be placed in libraries that are open.

Public Library Victoria issued the following statement in support of the change.

"This change is the latest initiative by the government to allow more books to be published under a certain amount of ownership and at the same time make it harder for the people to access material that is not suitable for them," the statement reads.

"The legislation also seeks to put restrictions on authors working in libraries and encourage them to avoid publishing books, books where no restrictions exist and which are not of a book quality not suitable for children."

Some of these books include The Man from Earth, The Lady, the Lady from Earth, Lady of the Mountain and a number of others from the books that are available to young people around the world but are just listed on the books' copyright application.
