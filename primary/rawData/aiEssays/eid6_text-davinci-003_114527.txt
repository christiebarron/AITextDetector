The construction of the Empire State Building attracted many modern marvels, including the potential to dock dirigibles on its roof. However, due to the obstacles its builders faced, dirigibles were never able to dock on the Empire State Building. 

One major obstacle to dirigible docking was the metal structure of the Empire State Building which caused a major issue for the zeppelins’ landing equipment. Large mooring masts would be necessary in order for the dirigibles to land safely and the metal of the Empire State Building would interfere with the radio signals traveling to the masts. When the builders looked for solutions to this issue, they soon discovered that tall freestanding wooden masts would have to be constructed around the Empire State Building in order to create a safe corridor for zeppelins to land. 

In addition to the difficulties posed by the metal structure, there were also issues caused by the height and wind gusts at the top of the Empire State Building. The gusts were so strong that the mooring masts would need to be anchored in order to keep them from being tossed about in the wind. This posed a problem since there were no existing secure anchor points on the building and no way to create them without striking and peeling back the metal plating.

The expense of constructing the mooring masts posed an additional issue for the Empire State Building’s builders. The construction of the mooring
