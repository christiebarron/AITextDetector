I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is the right and required act of a local government and thus a public trust in the integrity of the entire distribution of our information," said D.C. Representative Joseph Crowley, a Democrat and leader of the U.S. House committee on government relations.

The lawsuit, filed by the Public Library of Alexandria, does not say which city libraries are banned or how often them are. But the suit cited numerous recent cases in which the government's legal department and libraries have said they don't enforce a provision of the Library of Congress's Freedom of Information Act.

In a letter sent to the Library Board, the committee said it was "pursuant to section 504 of Pub. L. No. 102-3 (5th Cir. 1983)" that a public libraries association was prohibited from disclosing the public library's data because government efforts have been ineffective "due to the lack of accountability and transparency."

The letter said that because data is private and does not include private information, it has become "unconscionable" and the library must "provide an adequate and transparent access to it that reflects the trust that is created by the right of every citizen to our public libraries."

The letter said that libraries need to know the "credible, well-documented history, and current knowledge of the Library of Congress that supports the library's integrity."
