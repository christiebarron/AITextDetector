I believe that censorship of materials in libraries—both on the online and in print—cannot be limited by the rights of the consumer. The laws I want to enact to ensure that the Internet is free and open for everybody—including the ones I want to enforce through legislation—must therefore recognize that we do not want a monopoly over the content of our websites.

I am personally disappointed that my constituents, journalists, and others who do not believe in the freedom of speech will see a law that is not based on the Internet like the Patriot Act of 2011. I fear that our laws will never be sufficient to address the problem that so many people have experienced. After years of ignoring these issues, I hope Congress will finally begin to step up to the plate with a legislative solution. I intend to stand up to online censors, and if this Congress ever gets serious about the problem of censorship then it will be because of a bill from the House and the Senate that will address the problems that have been created by the First Amendment.
