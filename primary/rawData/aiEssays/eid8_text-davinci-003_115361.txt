Laughter has always been a part of my relationship with my husband, Dave. I remember the first time we went out together shortly after we had started dating. We were in the car, heading back from dinner, and Dave said something that just struck me as the funniest thing ever! I laughed so hard that I could barely keep my eyes open long enough to stay focused on the road. I was crying from laughing so hard, and it felt great. This was the beginning of a long and beautiful tradition of frequent, hearty laughter between us. 

We are both very goofy people and we truly enjoy finding humor in almost any situation. Even when times are tough, we can always make each other laugh and see the positive side of things. Whenever one of us has a good joke, the other can always be counted on to laugh uproariously, even if the joke isn't that clever.

Aside from our jokes and goofiness, our meals and family dinners are often filled with laughter. We both have a natural tendency to make lighthearted comments and infuse humor into any conversation. Even if we are talking about something serious, there is usually plenty of laughter mixed in.

I never thought a relationship could be so filled with laughter until I was fortunate enough to meet Dave. One thing is for certain: in this relationship, laughter is guaranteed!
