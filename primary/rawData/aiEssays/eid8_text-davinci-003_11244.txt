My best friend and I had been inseparable since middle school. We both loved to laugh and joke, so it was only natural that we spent countless afternoons walking around town, making up ridiculous stories and causing all sorts of commotion. I can still remember the day when I decided to take our antics to the next level.

We were strolling down the street when I noticed a large crowd gathered at a nearby restaurant. Always up for an adventure, I pulled my friend in the direction of the masses and we soon found ourselves in the middle of a city-wide pie eating contest. I immediately started to laugh. I couldn't believe the ridiculousness of the situation.

My friend joined in my fit of laughter, and it was then that I noticed the same laughter coming from all around us as well. The entire group of contestants presently cramming Key Lime Pie into their bellies had been infected with our contagious hilarity. We found ourselves soon engulfed by a sea of bodies, all sharing in our good-natured laughter.

It was like we had already won the competition. Everywhere we looked, there were smiling faces, and barrels filled with merriment. As strange as this may seem, it was the community of laughter that we had created without even trying. 

To this day, whenever Iâ€™m feeling down, I think back to this moment and laugh. That moment was a reminder that laughter is truly the shortest distance
