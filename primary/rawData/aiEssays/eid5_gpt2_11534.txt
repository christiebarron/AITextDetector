The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' was a more sober and thoughtful description of how, after the end of World War II, the war had led him to seek out and leave the Soviet Union, leaving behind him his "real" wife and two children.

On the other hand, the memoir says, he continued to spend time with his wife and brother while still in exile, which he says helped calm him. It is possible that while he felt a great deal of pressure in the Soviet Union, his only desire was to reconnect with his own life by learning to live independently. What is not clear is what was meant by the terms 'family reunification' or 'family exile' among his contemporaries.

Khan's book has provoked a flood of curiosity across social media. At first it was a mixed reaction, with some calling it a personal account of how one 'had to do most of the things I would do in my own life, and sometimes, sometimes I even had to do it on my own.' But within the next few months and several months he began to focus on his love life more frequently and he eventually became a "self-taught writer" and published all of his memoirs in English.
