The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because people read it and have a different response.


If, however, I had to choose, who would I choose? I would choose Tom Waits. A man with such an intense appetite and a certain charm, it's hard to imagine him being a better writer than Tom Waits. He's the kind of person you can turn down to write a book of novels and then maybe even a movie if you want to. He also has such a great sense of humor. His voice is very funny and his characters are very thoughtful and even humorous.


It's all the stuff that's meant to be written about and put into the world and kept together by other people that you really want to write, including him. That's what Tom Waits came out to be about.


The book also has a lot of fun, but I love the fact that it's a series that explores human relationships.


I like that Tom Waits comes in two different situations. One is in the way you treat people and the other kind of situation is the way you treat people. This story is about how you interact with other people, how you relate to other people, as well and how you make people happy as well.


I also love his role at the heart of the book, that of trying to build and change as a man and a person. It's kind of like starting out at a crossroads.
