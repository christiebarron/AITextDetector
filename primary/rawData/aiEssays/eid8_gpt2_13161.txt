One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I played an ad hoc version of the song "Don't Stop Me" in which you could shout back ("I'm sorry for all the work I've done, Mr. Dumpster") to one of the guys that sat next to me as he played "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band," from where he got his guitar, which he would play later on during the band's performances in Los Angeles, but never used, in the video game Fallout. The player can simply turn the computer off to make your own voice. Of course I'm not calling anyone into question the use of a guitar or the use of the guitar's power unit, rather it was, "So you just started making people laughâ€¦?" (Which is pretty standard with a guitar, to be honest.) But my best friend would say, "Well, I'm never going to stop laughing at it because then you're never going to feel like you got punched, because then your guitar's not going to make you feel like you can be seen laughing anymore, so you're not going to feel much enjoyment when you laugh at it. So I'm not going to ask everybody, 'Oh it sounds fun,' but do you really do think you want to see me play with your guitar?" And I would respond, "Yeah. I just want to actually make people laugh. So, thank you."
