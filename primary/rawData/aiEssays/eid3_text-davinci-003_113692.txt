In Rough Road Ahead by Joe Kurmaski, the cyclist’s experience is dramatically impacted by the setting of the story. The road the cyclist is traveling on is described as being bumpy, full of potholes, and covered in snow, which makes for a very treacherous ride. The fact that the cyclist is riding on a road that is not well-maintained indicates that the cyclist is likely somewhere rural. This makes it more difficult for the cyclist to get help if something were to happen during the ride, or for the cyclist to find a safe place to stop in order to take a break if the rider gets too tired. In addition, the snow-covered road indicates the presence of cold temperatures, which can be physically draining and make it difficult for the cyclist to maintain a comfortable body temperature. Finally, the fact that the road is winding and full of potholes implies the presence of a significant amount of terrain. Having to make turns and push through the potholes creates additional work for the cyclist’s body, making the ride even harder. In essence, the physical features of the setting make the ride extremely difficult and arduous for the cyclist, which is a major part of the story. The intensity of the ride is a result not only of the cyclist’s determination but also of the setting’s features.
