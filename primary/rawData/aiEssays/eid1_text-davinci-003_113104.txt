Dear Editor,

I am writing to give my opinion on the effects of computers on people and to persuade your readers to agree with me. In my view, computers have had both positive and negative impacts on society.

On one hand, computers have helped to shape the modern world with their far-reaching effects. Computers are often used for tasks such as creating spreadsheets, managing electronic files, and performing calculations. They can also be used to produce complex projects, such as video and audio recordings. Computers have enhanced communication, enabling people to participate in online conversations and interact with individuals from different parts of the globe.

On the other hand, computers may have a detrimental impact on people's physical and mental health. Prolonged use of computers can lead to physical strain, such as eye strain or muscle fatigue. Some people also become addicted to playing computer games, which can lead to psychological issues. Moreover, there are concerns that computers can be used for malicious purposes, such as cyberbullying or stealing personal information.

In conclusion, I believe that computers have both positive and negative effects on people and should be used in moderation. People should take the necessary precautions to protect their physical and mental health while taking advantage of the benefits of computers.

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
