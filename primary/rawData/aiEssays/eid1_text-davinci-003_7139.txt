In Joe Kurmaski's poem, "Rough Road Ahead," the setting in which the cyclist is riding plays an important role in the story's plot. The cyclist is described as crossing over a "long stretch of uncharted land" amidst a "stark desert expanse" with steep terrain and a "valley of rock and sand." The poet's choice of setting and the feature of the environment demonstrate how difficult it is for the cyclist to keep going.

The cyclist's journey is challenging due to the steep, rugged terrain of the environment. Such a landscape tests the rider's strength as it requires them to expend more energy than normal when pushing themselves up hills and then navigating their way down them. The arid desert terrain only adds to the difficult experience, as the lack of water and vegetation can leave the rider feeling dehydrated and exhausted. 

The fact that the cyclist is travelling through a long and "uncharted" stretch of terrain also affects the journey. This implies that the rider is alone, with no one around to assist or encourage them, leaving the cyclist to power on alone in their pursuit. The rugged and uncharted nature of the setting is heightening the difficulty of the journey, forcing the cyclist to confront the mental toughness required to continue and maintain the strength to carry on.

Overall, the features of the setting in the poem, such as the rugged terrain and the ability of the cyclist to be alone, have a significant effect on
