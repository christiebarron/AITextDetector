The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho speaks to the idea of resilience and hope - themes which are prevalent throughout the story. The narrator has just been told she cannot take an important test after her mother's sudden death removed her access to unofficial transportation. She must wait until the springtime when the geese return and the snows have melted away until she can take the test again. In the negativity of the current situation, the narrator hangs on to the hope of returning in the spring with newfound strength and determination to take the test again. The hopefulness of the ending serves to honor her mother's life and legacy and challenge the notion of defeat in the face of overwhelming obstacles.
