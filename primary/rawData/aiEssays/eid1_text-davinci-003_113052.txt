Dear Editor, 

In today's digital age, where technology is becoming increasingly more sophisticated, it is hard to ignore the effects computers have on people. From faster communication options, to more access to knowledge and information, the use of computers has become an integral part of our society.

Although the advantages of computers are indisputable, it is important to remember the potential repercussions, especially in regards to our health. Sitting for long hours in front of a screen, away from the natural environment, is vastly different from living in the real world. It can cause neck pain, back pain, fatigue, and possibly even obesity.

Furthermore, computer use can harm our social relationships. Decades of research suggests that computer use leads to a decline in our ability to express emotions, show empathy, and maintain communication skills. This can lead to isolation, depression, and anxiety.

Finally, too much screen time can be distracting and impair our concentration, particularly among our younger generations. It can be difficult to concentrate and finish tasks that are not high on our concentration scale.

In conclusion, it is important to be mindful of how computers affect us. We should limit our screen time and focus on activities that promote healthy emotional, physical, and mental well-being. With proper management, we can enjoy the benefits of modern technology without risking our health and well-being.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
