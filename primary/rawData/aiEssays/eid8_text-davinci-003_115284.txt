I was walking towards the bus stop with my friend when we spotted a funny-looking sign that had been stuck in a flower bed nearby. We laughed out loud at the ridiculousness of it, and almost instantly, a warm feeling of closeness began to grow between us.

We continued to laugh and joke about the sign until the bus came along. Once we had both boarded, we couldn’t contain ourselves and continued to laugh. The other passengers looked on in amusement and smiles began to blossom around us. 

It felt as though we were all connected in that moment, and the laughter was infectious. By the time we got off the bus, we felt like the best of friends – connected by the laughter that we had shared. 

Laughter is a beautiful thing, and I’m thankful for the moment of joy and connection it created between my friend and I.
