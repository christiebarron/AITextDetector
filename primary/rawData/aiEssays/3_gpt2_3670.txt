Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. The setting uses an old analogue camera that is capable of seeing the road.

One way can be to add a'showing distance', an 'adjusting distance' and an 'opening' to help prevent the bikes crashing. A more important effect using the 'out-of-walls' effect in the settings is the ability to change the angle of travel of the bike and the rate at which the bike travels. This is helpful when you are cycling out of the park and have set the setting and then had the system adjust distance and speed from the beginning of the cycle through the last few days of the ride. In short it is useful to see if the bike is having a problem before setting the distance.

Another option is to set the setting on 'Rough Road Ahead'?

On some bikes this can make things a lot less effective which makes it more desirable to add the option. I prefer the setting in 'Out-of-Walls' as the setting helps you move towards the centre of the track without losing any 'good' way to pass the road. However on a wider set like 'Wintered Roads' which uses a wider range of tyres it can actually be easier to deal with a bit of a challenge (and if you are using a different camera then your road will look a lot smoother).
