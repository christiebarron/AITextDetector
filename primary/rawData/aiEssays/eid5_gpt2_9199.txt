The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is the same as any other of the tales 'My Father, my Mother and the Devil', written by my father. It is a story of the struggles and triumphs of a single man.

'From Home is' is also highly enjoyable and an excellent reminder of the important role that father's life holds in a man's life.

This book has a tremendous chapter on the personal life of the father, 'My Father, me and the Devil', with a chapter about the development of our love, we will never get back to. No one can escape the fate of a father or a mother, but one must be able to live that life to continue in it and in it.
