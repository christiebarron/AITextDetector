The construction of the Empire State Building in the early twentieth century provided New Yorkers with a skyscraper that was unrivaled in its height and grandeur. Despite its size and prominence, the Empire State Building was not built with the intention of hosting dirigibles, or airships, to dock on its top. This construction obstacle was addressed when engineer David M. Hasley proposed the installation of a mooring mast atop the building. Through his ingenious plan, airships could be safely docked on the building and greatly improve air travel to the city.

Though the construction of a mooring mast atop the largest building in the world seemed far-fetched, Hasley and his team of engineers faced the challenge head on. The first obstacle to consider was the height of the mast. Due to its tall stature, Hasley and his team needed to calculate avenues to increase the mast’s upward reach while still implementing measures that would make it safe for dirigibles to dock. To achieve the increased height, an extra platform needed to be built to keep the mooring mast at its desired height. This platform also required a strong structure that could withstand the pressure created by dirigibles docking, and become the “guiding beacon” that airships needed for accurate navigation.

The next obstacle the Hasley and his team faced was in building the mast itself. Due to the fragile and unpredictable structure of the airships, a mechanism was needed that
