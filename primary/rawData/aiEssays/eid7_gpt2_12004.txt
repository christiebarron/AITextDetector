An example of a time someone in my life was patient was Dr. William P. Schmitt, a physician from Pennsylvania who was a partner at the pharmaceutical firm. As a patient he had a question on how to prepare a placebo or a placebo-derived medicine. My primary doctor was concerned because I knew he was going to be making changes to my research for the next 10 years because what was the main thing he wanted me to do and what was in the best interest of the patients?

This patient was an example of how patient safety can be a critical element of innovation in medicine. It could mean it can help develop new drugs in other directions. Our patient had two very specific goals: to better find a cure for depression and so on but also the right method to make sure the therapy in question was going to work. But when he gave up his patient's antidepressant for the day he decided to get the help of our company and help us refine the drug so that, well, we would get what we wanted, and then his first idea, which was to get himself on a course to treat depression, started to pass. So, if the patient is just in trouble he could really kick him out of his job for what should have been a successful treatment. There was some success.

A key thing about all of this is that there are no laws around how pharmaceutical companies, and their companies now, can do this. There are some limits of what a company can do.
