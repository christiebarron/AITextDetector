The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because of the sheer amount of detail that she has spent in the work. To put it simply, it's been a wild ride to write some incredible characters, but these characters are now getting even more special as you read the books. Many of the characters and locations have changed over the line because of each year, and the book itself is now such a part of my life that I'm trying to remember them all. This is something I hope to keep going on on many more books.


For any fans out there who were hesitant to read this book (you know, the ones that have been waiting decades), consider this book is sooooo much better than any of the previous books. There's a wealth of details to the story and plot in this book. It gives me great pleasure to read it as well and I look forward to more. It's the perfect companion to another excellent book.
