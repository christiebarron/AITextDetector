Computers have many effects on people. In general, the more time people spend in the virtual world and in the time they spend in the actual world, the more things that they do that affect them, and people tend to have deeper learning-based relationships. When you're just starting out, having a lot of good friends, a lot of good things come up, and one day you come across someone who says, "Well, I'm happy that I'm friends with this person, but I really like how these things do affect me." This connection between the user experience and real world experiences is what helped us get a head start on this research into the long-term effects of virtual communities.

M.E.: Have you ever looked at the impact of physical contact on the performance of various social networking sites or apps?

M.E.: That's the one I really want to point out, because, when you know something, something happens, and you can't really compare it to a performance-based connection or something, then we can compare the two. For example, if you're on Facebook, you get a lot of traffic from the other users, because this is what people tell you when they come to say they're going to say their friends and that's something they use. And there are a lot of things you can measure that you can do, but this is what's worth talking about, because we're actually doing more research into what happens to our relationships
