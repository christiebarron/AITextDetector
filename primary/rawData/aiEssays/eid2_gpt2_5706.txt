I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a form of slavery, that they should not be treated as property," he wrote in a statement on Saturday.

"I believe that censorship is the most insidious form of censorship, an infringement of the right to a free press, and I believe they should be treated as such."

The letter from the MP said: "This legislation, passed as part of the Better Government Act 2015, provides a further attempt to protect children from these acts.

"I want to commend the Prime Minister's Office for taking decisive action, and for allowing the Government to review its policies."

MPs have called for better controls and an end to legal and political censorship of information.
