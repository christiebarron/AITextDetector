As we enter the age of the Internet, libraries are becoming increasingly important sources of education and entertainment. People can go to the library and search with ease, allowing them to find whatever they may be looking for. But should there be limitations on what materials are accessible in a library? Is censorship of certain materials necessary to protect the interests of library patrons?

Many people have argued that materials found to be offensive to certain groups - such as books, music, movies, or magazines - should be removed from library shelves. This, they argue, is a necessary measure to protect vulnerable audiences, such as children, from being exposed to inflammatory material and could potentially prevent the library from being held liable if someone is harmed by such materials.

While this position is understandable, it is also a dangerous form of censorship. Removing books from library shelves due to their controversial content is a form of restricting freedom of speech. Not only does it prevent certain individuals from accessing information they may need, it can also lead to a slippery slope. We may start out by removing offensive material, but what happens when more and more materials are seen as suspicious or potentially harmful? There is the possibility that censorship could go too far and important works of literature, art, or history could be silenced.

As a proponent of education, it is important to me that people have access to the materials they find value in, without facing undue limits. Therefore, I would suggest that libraries monitor, rather than censor,
