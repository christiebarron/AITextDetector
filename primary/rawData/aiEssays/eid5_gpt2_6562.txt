The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is about not only his family, but also how far his mind has taken his life â€“ how he is now not necessarily 'backtracking', but living a simpler life at home. But there are still many things that remain constant, like 'the moment he got on the bus with the girl', 'he was in London the week before he met her' and 'how he sees his new love'. How much'real sense' you can have is not yet known.

'From Home' is the third from-print edition of the book of the same name. The last two will be released in paperback and free to download
