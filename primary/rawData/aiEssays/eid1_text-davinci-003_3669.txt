Dear Editor,

As technology advances and computer accessibility increases, it is important the public is aware of both the positive and negative effects computers have on people.

On the positive side, computers are incredibly beneficial in education. Students are able to learn more efficiently with computer-based instruction and research skills they will use for the rest of their lives. Additionally, computers are beneficial tools for creating and developing businesses. Businesses can more easily and cost-effectively communicate with customers and clients. Additionally, communication with far away relatives and friends is improved exponentially.

On the other hand, computers may have detrimental outcomes if not used responsibly. Computers are often used by people for hours upon hours. Without breaks our muscles can become sore, our posture may be affected and our concentration may be altered. Computers can also lead to social isolation when used to sidestep real-life relationships. Too much computer use has been linked to anxiety, depression, insomnia, strained eyes, general poor physical health, and other conditions.

It is important that we take precautions to mitigate the impacts computer use can have on our lives. Take regular breaks, ensure proper posture when using them and focus on maintaining healthy relationships with others so we can get the most positive results from using computers.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
