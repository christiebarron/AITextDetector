I remember a time when I was shopping in a crowded store. The lines were long and it was extremely hot in the store. I was feeling overwhelmed and impatient with the wait. 

I noticed the person in front of me had a lot of items to buy, and the cashier was having difficulty scanning each one. I wanted to just sneak in a few items in my cart, so I could check out faster. 

But then I reminded myself to be patient. I took a few deep breaths and tried to stay calm. I realize that we all had to wait our turn, and rushing the process wasn't going to help anyone. 

So I decided to make conversation with the person in front of me. They were having difficulty deciding on a few things in their cart. I helped them sort out their options and choose something. We shared a few laughs while waiting, and it really passed the time. 

The whole experience was more bearable than I expected. By staying patient, I was able to help them with their decision and make the best out of a frustrating situation.
