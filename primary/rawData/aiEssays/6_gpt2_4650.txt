The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The most likely choice was to put them into a box. If the box wasn't so huge as to be safe for a container, they had to keep the lid off, and the workers used hand hold and a few other techniques to make the lid smaller and more easily visible. The designers also had to find something that made a small escape from the box to keep the lights from exploding.

Eventually the plan worked out, but only when the box was nearly finished. Even if the lid had to be built as a box, it still required a few compromises to protect the frame and its surrounding, a huge amount of space and cost on top of what most people would be willing to pay for that freedom.
