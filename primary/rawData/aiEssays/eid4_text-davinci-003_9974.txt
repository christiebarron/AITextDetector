The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho is symbolic of the cycle of life and the hope for a better tomorrow. The winter hibiscus, which faces a seemingly insurmountable challenge in surviving the winter, serves as a metaphor for the protagonist's life. She is facing her own difficult challenges that seem to stand in her way of achieving her goals. By referencing the spring return of the snow, geese, and the hibiscus, Ho suggests that despite any hardships the protagonist may face, a new season awaits her with new possibilities and hope. The protagonist's determination to "take that test again" is a testament to her resilient spirit.
