The memoir From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez creates a very melancholic mood through its thoughtful musings on the various memories and events that have shaped the author’s life. The memoir is vivid, bringing each moment to life with vivid details, but what is most striking about each moment is what is left unspoken. The reader needs to interpret each detail, leaving the mood at the reader’s discretion, but even so, the memoir has an implicitly reflective and somber attitude. 

Throughout the memoir, Rodriguez muses on the influence of his family on his art and life. Through prisms of nostalgia, Rodriguez explores the activities of his childhood and his mother’s interest in style and design. The themes of identity, loss, and yearning for home are intimately explored in Rodriguez’s reflections. Even when discussing his success as a designer, there is no sense of pleasure, simply a measure of distance to each memory and accomplishment. Rodriguez’s exploration of his identity is complicated by the intersection of his Cuban-American upbringing with his present life.

Overall, From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives is a mournful yet intimate look at Rodriguez’s life. He subtly evokes a deeper feeling than the surface details of his story, leaving the reader feeling contemplative and introspective. Rodriguez’s memoir sensitively and quietly captures each moment of his life, creating a melancholic mood
