Dear Editor,

I am writing to articulate my opinion on the impacts of computers on society. Computers have revolutionized the world we live in and continue to do so at an incredibly rapid rate.

On the one hand, computers have enabled people to connect to one another regardless of their location. They have also opened up vast amounts of new opportunities for those who know how to use them correctly. Computers have been used to collect and store data, create interactive technologies, and develop innovative solutions that could not have been imagined before.

On the other hand, I fear that the ever-increasing reliance on computers has had a number of negative effects on people. We are quickly heading towards an era where screen time surpasses time spent with friends and family. As we become more and more immersed in virtual life, our physical health and mental wellbeing have been affected significantly. Other concerns include cyber security and privacy violations caused by hackers and malicious parties.

Ultimately, computers are not inherently bad â€“ but they can be if we are not careful. I encourage all readers to understand the implications of our actions and stop putting our lives on autopilot. Engaging in leisure activities and engaging with the natural world are just as important as spending time in front of a computer. 

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
