Once, when I was a kid, I was really excited to go to a large carnival that had come to our city. I wanted to go on all the rides and buy all the food. However, my parents had other plans. They wanted me to wait in line with them to buy tickets, and said that if there were any tickets left over after they bought theirs, I could get one too. 

At first, I was really upset. I was afraid that all the tickets would run out and that I wouldn't get to go to the fun carnival. However, I decided to be patient and waited in line with my parents. To my surprise, by the time we got to the ticket stand, there were still a few tickets available, and my parents got me one!

I was so happy that I was able to go to the carnival after all, and I was glad that my patience paid off. And, from that experience, I learned that patience is often rewarded - and I'm still grateful for the lesson I learned that day.
