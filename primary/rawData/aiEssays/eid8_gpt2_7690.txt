One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was 20, and thought I had just been attacked by someone who was drunk at a party. I didn't know what would happen and thought I would die of shock. I did something stupid, but it turned out that it was a prank. Something was up for me, that I was only thinking of myself before. At the time, it was a bit shocking and it's definitely not now, but I can go back and see if my life has changed."
