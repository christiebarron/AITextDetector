I remember when my best friend and I first met in college. We were both completely overwhelmed and out of our depth. After all, this was the first time that we were really in charge of our lives and our decisions. 

We had signed up to take the same classes and quickly became inseparable, bonding over our mutual anxiety and inexperience. We did our best to help each other out and relied on humor to lighten the mood and get us through the tough times.

One day, while studying for a particularly difficult exam, we began to get discouraged and felt overwhelmed by the amount of material. We were about to start panicking when my friend stopped and said, “Hey, let’s just take five minutes to forget about all this and just laugh." We laughed so hard, and for so long, that it was one of our most productive study sessions, and we ended up passing the exam with flying colors.

Throughout our college experience, and beyond, laughter has been a key ingredient in our friendship. Whenever we’re overwhelmed, stressed out, or even just bored, laughter always helps us to escape and break the tension. 

Laughter is absolutely essential in any relationship, and I’m so glad that my friend and I both knew that from the start.
