The features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead" play a paramount role in how the cyclist interacts and experiences their journey. In the story, the cyclist is presented with an extremely harsh environment full of hazards and arduous obstacles. The treacherous terrain forces the cyclist to pay close attention to their surroundings and be mindful of every place they pedal their bike. For instance, the cyclist views the “huge ruts” in the path that forces them to take a more stable, slow, and steady approach to traversing the harsh road. The sharp stones that viciously pierce the cyclist's tires and create even more difficulty in overcoming the challenge. All of these features are essential to the growth and progression of the cyclist not only in terms of attaining their end goal of peace but also from the perspective of self-empowerment and understanding their own strength and will in the face of adversity.

The landscape of this setting shapeshifts from harsh to more welcoming as the cyclist progresses on their challenging path. Though initially overwhelmed and preoccupied with navigating difficult obstacles, the cyclist is able to take a breath and enjoy the beauty of the scenery and take in the pleasures of nature. This allows for a deeper connection between the cyclist and their surroundings and serves as an encouraging reminder that no matter what the cyclist faces in life, if they stay true to their course, progress can be made.
