I believe that censorship of materials in libraries and their management can help facilitate access."

There was no immediate comment from Héline or Klaassen.

The online petition calls on the library to remove the content in question. The petition's author, Marie-France Laferciald Héline, called it "deeply repugnant" that public libraries such as the École Nationale do not have full transparency. Laferciald wrote: "In recent years I think we can understand why people refuse to read anything. I think some sort of censorship of free content is not an act of "political correctness." Let's just stick it in public libraries."

The letter states that Klaassen had been reading it at three different institutions in France, for a year, and would like to see it taken. Héline said that she was also reading it from a laptop of her sister and was also aware of many other cases.

The letter states that the information in the petition was not intended as a legal action—for example, the fact that books were to be translated into French would not give any legal claim of infringement. (Le Temps de l'Institut générale does not use any legal or academic text materials, such as books, for its editorial procedures; Klaassen's sister, Marie-France Laferciald Héline, was not consulted on the content of the petition.)
