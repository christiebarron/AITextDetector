Dear Editor,

It is undeniable that computers are a part of our lives both at work and in our homes. As technology advances, computers have become increasingly essential to our lives. However, their impact on our lives may be having adverse effects. 

The rapid growth of computer-based technology has created negative consequences for people of all ages. For example, physical health has been negatively impacted by prolonged computer usage, such as the deepening of nearsightedness, headaches, neck, shoulder and back pain. Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that increased usage of computer devices also has a negative impact on mental health. This can be attributed to reduced levels of physical activity, increased stress, and a decreased attention span. 

In addition, the use of computers also affects communication. Nowadays, due to the use of instant messengers and other on-line programs people are spending more and more time staring at their computers rather than communicating with others face-to-face. This could lead to increased social isolation and depression. 

Ultimately, while computers have revolutionized the world in many ways, they have also brought with them many negative effects. It is essential that we recognize these negative consequences and take steps to reduce them.
