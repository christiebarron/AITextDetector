The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is so positive that I immediately thought the entire place could belong to the book!

There are also some books that I haven't thought about yet, but can't let go of!

The book will be a nice change of pace from there, and I am eagerly awaiting my reviews.

I hope you enjoy reading the book!

A very happy ending! I hope you don't forget to check out the teaser of the new novel soon. But I must admit I didn't buy any of them…

This is a very personal story that does not speak to me personally, but still, I found it hard to live down in a world that I had never seen before…

I would like to thank Toho for producing the Superior Fantasy, the book that really hit my ear so far.

"Lies, lies and shameless tricks" is pretty standard stuff for a romance novel, so I was intrigued to go on the adventure and write of the novel!

A very romantic adventure story where you meet your true love and have to face the consequences your marriage had for her in order to get your marriage back on track is the perfect story to tell…

So… that's it for the next review…
