In Joe Kurmaski’s story ‘Rough Road Ahead’, the setting of a small backwoods town has a major impact on the cyclists journey. The small town acts as a symbolic place of adversity and chaos on the riders journey, emphasizing the struggle of the pursuit of personal and physical triumph.

The small size of the town forces the cyclist to confront his own limitations. The roads are rough and often lack pavement, making the journey more strenuous than it would be on city streets. He has to battle through mud, pot holes, debris, and heavy winds, all while his bike, a classic Schwinn, is burdened with the extra weight of his belongings. The physical challenge of the setting tests the cyclist’s endurance and puts him against the limits of his own abilities.

The extreme rural setting of the story removes the cyclist from society, symbolically speaking to his feelings of alienation from his past life. The expanse of nature around him and the sparse amount of people in the small town suggest an abandonment of society and the freedom of a life unencumbered by expectations. This allows the cyclist to explore self-reliance, the reality of his situation, and self-discovery as part of his journey.

The rough road ahead, then, becomes not just a physical obstacle but an emotional one. It is a reflection of the internal struggle of the cyclist to reach his goals in spite of the ever-present challenges
