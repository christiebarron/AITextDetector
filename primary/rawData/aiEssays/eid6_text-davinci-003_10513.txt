The Empire State Building was a symbol of modern engineering when it opened in 1931, making it one of the most iconic buildings in America and in the world. One of the hallmarks of the building was the addition of a mooring mast, allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. The process of adding this feature to the final design was anything but straightforward, however, and presented various obstacles to making the mooring mast a reality.

The first challenge of incorporating the mooring mast into the building was the sheer technical complexity of the task. Building such a contraption at the top of a skyscraper posed a number of engineering challenges, from creating a sturdy attachment that could withstand strong winds to adding a water-filled reservoir at the top of the mast to cushion the airshipâ€™s landing. Additionally, the design had to take into consideration the dynamic temperature changes and air pressure changes inside the enclosed rear of the mast created by the airship's engines.

The second, and perhaps more daunting, challenge was dealing with public opinion and the Red Tape of the time period. The Empire State Building was already generating a fair amount of controversy, and the idea of a dirigible docking at the top of the towering structure invoked the public's imagination. Despite the public's enthusiasm, the project was met with the red tape and bureaucracy of the New York City government, as well as the U.S. military. When the original plans were
