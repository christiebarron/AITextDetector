I am a mother to four children, two boys and two girls. My kids are full of energy, but they do not always see eye to eye. 

One particular evening, my daughter and eldest son got into a disagreement and the yelling and bickering started. I could feel my temper starting to boil as I could predict this could get out of hand quickly. I took a deep breath and reminded myself to keep my patience.

I calmly walked over to the two of them, taking each of them by the hand, and explained that although it is normal to have disagreements, they needed to find a way to resolve them peacefully. I reiterated that they could take turns talking about how they felt and brainstorm solutions together. 

Before long, the two were speaking calmly and looking for ways they could work it out. With a little nudging and some redirection, I was able to help them patch up the fight without raising my voice. 

It always isn't easy to remain patient when tensions are high, but showing my children how to settle arguments peacefully without escalating the situation was worth it in the end.
