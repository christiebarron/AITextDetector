It was a sunny day and I was on my way to meet a good friend of mine who I hadn't seen for a while. I was looking forward to catching up and laughing over some of our old stories. 

When I arrived, I was so happy to see my friend and together we started reminiscing about the funny events in our lives. All of a sudden, we burst out into a fit of laughter. It was the most contagious and uncontrollable laughter I've ever experienced.

We kept laughing for what seemed like an eternity. Tears were streaming down our faces and we had stomach aches from how hard we were laughing. In that moment, it felt like nothing else mattered. 

What started out as a simple catching up session had suddenly become something much more powerful. It was like a bridge had been built between us and all the barriers and the miles between us suddenly melted away. Here in this moment no mattered what had happened before, or what would happen in the future, we were united in laughter and it felt like a deep connection had been formed between us.

When our laughter finally ran its course, it left a feeling of warmth and closeness that I'll never forget. That day, I truly realized that laughter can really be the shortest distance between two people.
