An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a woman who used to go to nursing school to graduate and then would leave the institution to go back to that, then go on to graduate into acting, but I never understood how he was not. So I thought, 'Hey I have to go back and do my part.' I had to go on that path."

"I would tell you that you can't do that. They need that level of patient care," he added.

But many of the other college graduates told their story, the stories of the people who had made it: the students who graduated at different times, the college workers who were not allowed to enter their careers or become permanent residents until they passed.

Those stories are so heartbreaking to me that I think it would be great to hear what others of my generation told.
