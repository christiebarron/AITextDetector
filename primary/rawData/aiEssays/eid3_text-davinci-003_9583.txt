In "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski, the cyclist is navigating an area of terrain with a number of distinct features. The most noticeable and impactful of these features is the mountainous terrain. The ruggedness of the mountains poses a significant physical challenge to the cyclist. It requires considerable endurance and strength of the cyclist to make it to the top of the inclines and on the downside the steep descent requires great balance and agility while managing the forces of gravity. 

The terrain of the setting is further compounded by the presence of potholes, gravel, and dust that force the cyclist to constantly be on alert and keep their wits about them. Furthermore, due to the poor visibility caused by the sand, dust, and the winding curves of the roads, the cyclist must be extra cautious of any obstacles that may come their way. 

The weather further plays a part in making the route more treacherous.
