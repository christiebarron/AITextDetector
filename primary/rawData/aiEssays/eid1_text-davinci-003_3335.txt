Dear Editor, 

As technology continues to advance, so too does the prevalence of computers. While computers can be incredibly useful for work in various industries, living a more connected and efficient life, and accomplishing mundane tasks, they can also have a worrying effect on peopleâ€™s health and lifestyles. 

People are spending more time than ever in front of their computers. They are addicted to social media, playing video games, and researching random topics. They sit for extended periods of time and are subjecting themselves to a sedentary lifestyle which can have a serious negative impact on their physical and mental health. Studies have shown increased risks of obesity, heart disease, sleep deprivation and depression, among other things. Furthermore, excessive screen time can lead to a lack of concentration and a decrease in communication and interpersonal skills. 

It is important that we understand the effects computers have on our lives and take measures to moderate our use of them. We need to limit our exposure to screens, take more regular breaks, involve ourselves in other activities, and prioritize our offline relationships. 

While computers can be of great assistance, we must remember to use them responsibly and think of the long-term implications of our screen time
