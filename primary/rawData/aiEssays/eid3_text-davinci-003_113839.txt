The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead,” by Joe Kurmaski, have a large influence on the cyclist. The rough road is described as steep, curvy, and littered with rocks and bumps. This creates an element of danger and hazard for the cyclist, as they must navigate the road without falling or suffering an injury. As the cyclist travels further down the route, the setting becomes increasingly difficult and treacherous due to the hostile terrain. The cyclist is forced to navigate turns with careful precision in order to avoid any danger, and concentrate more intensely on their route. 

The rough and rocky road ahead also serves as a symbol of difficulty and challenge. The cyclist must not only overcome the physical obstacles of the route but also the mental challenges, as they must persevere through difficult moments, work hard, and stay focused. They must fight the instinct to give up, stay committed to their goals, and find the strength to stay on course. 

The setting in Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead” is crucial in the cyclist’s journey. The route is difficult and harsh, but this also serves as a supreme test of the cyclist’s strength and determination. The cyclist must dig deep and find the courage to push through even the most challenging of times in order to reach their desired destination.
