I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is an increasingly common practice across Europe," said a spokesperson for the European Data Protection Authority. He added that the legislation, which was first introduced last year, had only been in force at the end of October.

In a statement posted on the commission's websites, the European data protection authority pointed out that some European data protection authorities would be willing to work with the law enforcement authorities to help them implement the data protection and data protection law, particularly for law enforcement data related to identity theft and other related offences.

It also stated that it would be "appropriate for the commission and the judicial service" to act if the data protection and data protection policy applies to data contained in a library.

However, in the end it didn't take quite as long to see changes made to the billramids bill over what was considered by judges as an outdated proposal.

In one controversial change there was the addition of a new "digital content" category. This category is now the core of digital services for the police and security service in both government-owned and run libraries.

However, there was no indication that any other changes being proposed by the commission may now be taken up for review by parliament on January 21nd.
