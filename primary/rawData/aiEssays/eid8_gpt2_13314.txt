One time I experienced laughter in my life was when one of my friends used my story of how an alien woman killed a baby to try and make the world a better place for her children and grandchildren.

A few years ago, I went to the library in order to find a story I really liked. "I am a good child," they told me. "I have two sons and three grandmas. You've already told your own story."

So I turned to Google News and asked the kids if that had something anything I could add to this story. The answer was no. There are many, many reasons your stories might come across but when you find them in the "good child" category, it opens up the "kind of kid," and people who like my stories are always very kind.

If you liked my story and want to read some more, let me know in the comments.
