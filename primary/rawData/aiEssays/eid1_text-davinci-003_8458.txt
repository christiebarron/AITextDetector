I recently had an experience that really showed me how patient I can be. I was the manager of a restaurant and during a busy shift, I noticed an elderly customer attempting to make an order. They were very confused and not sure what they wanted from the menu.

Although I was exhausted and running out of patience after a long shift, I insisted on getting the customer the meal he wanted even if it took a few extra minutes. I kindly asked the customer what he wanted, and assisted him in making his decision. Thankfully, my patience paid off since the customer was delighted with the meal. 

The experience showed me how patient I can be when treating others. I felt proud of myself for having the willpower to be understanding and tolerant to a customer who needed help. That's when I realized how important it is to be patient and show others kindness, no matter how difficult it may seem.
