To The Editor,

As technology continues to evolve, computers and their various components have become an intrinsic part of everyday life. However, not enough attention is given to the potential negative effects they can have on people.

Computer use can lead to physical problems such as eyestrain, headaches, and neck and shoulder pain, especially if the user does not have an ergonomic work station. These symptoms can be exacerbated by long periods of sitting at a computer, often leading to posture issues, difficulty breathing and poor cardiovascular health.

Moreover, people who spend large amounts of time on their computer are more at risk for developing addictive behaviors, such as compulsive gaming or internet addiction. Such computer use can interfere with various aspects of day-to-day life, including school, work, and social relationships.

Finally, computers can lead to psychological problems as well. Excessive use of computers can lead to a decrease in face-to-face interaction with friends and loved ones, resulting in social isolation and feelings of depression.

I understand the importance of technology and the benefits it can provide. However, it is vital that people are aware of the potentially harmful effects it can have. People should adequately monitor their computer use and be cautious not to overexert themselves.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
