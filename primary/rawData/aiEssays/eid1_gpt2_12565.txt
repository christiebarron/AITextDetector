Computers have many effects on people. The computer's processor is constantly growing, the more it can access and manipulate memory. You'll have to turn off the computer if its memory is going to be too much or it's going to slow down or the system will crash and all the sudden you need to run to the bathroom to check if the entire computer is dead or alive (or, as soon as it is, your computer is starting to shut down). At any given moment, a computer's processing power is almost entirely turned off. If a computer is working too long, it has too much RAM, it's slowing down, it gets stuck in certain memory sectors, it's too slow to write data to long periods of time, or it's not ready for a certain task or event, so it's starting to get really cold, and then it comes back alive. You need to turn off its processors right away, as long as the computer will shut down quickly and you remember when the system is supposed to shut down.

It's a pretty common experience to have this happen. You start the computer running at 80 percent of its maximum output power, a lot of its RAM is set aside, and it's trying to run even more things. Your memory chips are all shutting down. You have to
