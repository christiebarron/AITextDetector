The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Their goal was for them to have vertical and horizontally-oriented control panels like those on most buildings. The first step was to have the building's windows and floors curved, rather than the standard curved panels that are commonly used in commercial buildings. The second step, which is more difficult for designers to achieve, was to require two separate, and almost exclusively vertical, windows. The second step required a separate vertical panel for each of the three walls of the building. Building designers were forced to combine two panels (two in each tower), so that only one of each would dock. This required a vertical panel for each tower, and two horizontal panels to house the second tower. The vertical and horizontal panels were designed to stand on horizontal or vertical surfaces and must move in front of the vertical and horizontal panels on the wall of the building. While many engineers would have spent thousands on the design of the horizontal and vertical panels, the majority of engineers would have spent about a third on the design and construction of the horizontal and vertical panels (see the section "Projecting and Architecture of Building Structures"). An early example of such a design involves a building that is partially or totally separated out from the rest of the building by the river. The design of this vertical and horizontal panels includes a second horizontal control panel on one side above the river where the building will be. The vertical, horizontal, and vertical controls are so similar
