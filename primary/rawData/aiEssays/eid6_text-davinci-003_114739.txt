When the construction of the Empire State Building was completed in 1931, the plans for the structure included the provision for a mooring mast positioned exactly 1,050 feet above the Fifth Avenue sidewalk. This mast was intended to be a docking facility for dirigibles, the new form of airship transportation. While the idea was promising, the mast project was met with many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome. 

The first major obstacle faced by the builders of the Empire State Building and its mooring mast was the actual construction of the mast itself. Most of the specific components needed for the construction of the mast were not yet available; the mast was to be shaped like a triangle, which posed a challenge for the architects. Additionally, the mammoth structure needed steel rods extending 200 feet in order to provide the necessary support for the mast and mooring lines. As a result, the team hired Charles Hayward, an engineer with experience constructing mooring masts across Europe, to create a design for the mast.

Furthermore, the actual structure of the Empire State Building posed an interesting problem for dirigibles docking at the mooring mast. While the mooring mast was impressive in size, the roof and spire of the Empire State Building were even higher, creating a risk of collision for the dirigibles trying to dock. Therefore, the architects responsible for the mooring mast also had to devise a clever way to make
