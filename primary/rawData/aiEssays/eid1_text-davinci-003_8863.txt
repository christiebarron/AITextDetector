I was out to lunch with my best friend and we were sharing stories about our week. We had both had some funny moments and were laughing, some louder than others, while we waited for our food. Suddenly, a woman from a nearby table came up and tapped me on the shoulder. Startled, I looked around to see who was touching me. She smiled and said, "I just wanted to thank you for your laughter. It was the happiest sound I've heard in a while. I don't know what's going on between you two, but it's nice to know that it's okay to laugh even in the toughest times." I thanked her, overwhelmed by her kind words. It was then that I realized laughter really is the shortest distance between two people. No matter how much time had gone by since I last saw my best friend, we were able to connect and laugh over the silly stories that had happened to us during the week. Laughter is truly a beautiful thing.
