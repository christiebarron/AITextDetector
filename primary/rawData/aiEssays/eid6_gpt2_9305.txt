The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

That is, the building lacked elevator doors to a central location, and the tower had to move much more slowly toward the outside space to maximize its height and weight.

A more dramatic solution was being prepared. The first planned skyscraper taller than the Empire State Building was built to span five stories.

It would have been in the works since 2006. But the planners realized it wouldn't be done as effectively as they did, and they moved the tower into the middle of an already crowded neighborhood to accommodate more space.

"We knew at the time we couldn't create a new building in a certain location," said John R. Hargens, who is a professor at the University of Chicago and now serves on the council. "That's where we went and the project was never implemented by the state."

To accomplish that, the group had to remove the roof from the top and the ceiling from the lower one â€” three major setbacks. R.H.H.S.T. started to build multiple vertical scaffold towers, but only managed to get about 15 feet of scaffolding down toward the new building.

Instead, the city and residents had to go from a three-story structure in Midtown to a three-story structure at the base of the Empire State Building.

There was no immediate plan that would allow the two buildings to be
