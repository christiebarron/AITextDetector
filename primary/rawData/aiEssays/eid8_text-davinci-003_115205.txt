I was at a party with a group of friends when I saw my crush across the room. It was if our eyes had locked and as I made my way over to him, butterflies started fluttering in my stomach.

We started talking and joking around as we got to know each other better. Before I knew it, we were both laughing hysterically at jokes that probably weren't even funny. Suddenly, everyone else's conversations around us stopped and they started laughing too, but it didn't diminish our laughter at all.

We stayed like that with our eyes locked, laughing until tears rolled down our cheeks. We could barely stop long enough to catch our breaths before we'd start right back up again.

That moment was a turning point in our relationship and I'll never forget it. From that moment, laughter was always a part of our relationship - and that was the best thing ever!
