The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because of that book.

How does it relate to the work of Richard James?


I guess we should at least talk about Richard James. I remember at one point being kind of like a big boy in my twenties. You're always on the phone with him asking me where I've done wrong, and I was always really keen on my performance like, 'I've done wrong, it seems like you're trying to turn me into a better person, but I've got so many problems that I can't even figure out how to fix them.'

His book about Richard James starts about five years after the book is first released. How did you know it didn't make it a hit yet?

We didn't know until shortly after the book was published. After the book was published, our friends that worked on the original did a video interview for the film. We told them that a book like this was going to appeal to so many different audiences, some of which would have been hard to find, but the general audience was going to like our book. It was great. We were excited to do it, but there's more than a little bit of a bit that's different from what people have been used to seeing in the movie and that's good news for us.

Do you believe there is a parallel between James' and Richard's book?

I think it's a very fascinating,
