I remember a time when I was at my job working in the customer service department and a customer was getting extremely frustrated with me. I could tell they were angry because they were raising their voice and cursing at me. 

Despite the customer's dismissive attitude, I stayed calm and patient. I took a deep breath and asked the customer to please explain what the issue was. Once they had finished their rant, I took my time to explain the situation and possible solutions. The customer seemed to be relieved that I was understanding their dilemma and was being so patient. After looking into their case further, I was able to help get them the resolution they were hoping for. 

In the end, the customer thanked me for being so patient, for understanding the situation, and for providing them with a solution. I was happy I was able to get the customer the help they needed and that I was able to remain patient throughout the ordeal.
