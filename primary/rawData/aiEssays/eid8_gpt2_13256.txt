One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I read a piece that I wrote for the National Herald about an American college graduate who wrote that, on his own, "the most important of a college-jobs career is the work of people who are highly paid but still have a lot to teach."

What was he talking about?

What is his background?

He had been a business owner but he ended his business as a real estate developer. He was trying to buy a car and then selling to another couple to start his own business. It didn't work out. He was then going on to become an engineer and then he moved on to a nursing home. In a few weeks, he moved into a tiny apartment that he thought was better than a hotel. Eventually, he found a real estate broker who told him, "If you really wanted to get you into real estate, then you will have to go to this company." Now, his job was to help people learn about real estate and what to do about it where else you could. The real estate industry was huge in 1980 and I remember thinking to myself how many people live in this industry. I was amazed how many people actually worked at this business. It cost me millions of dollars to start and I would be working four shifts. I would be working five full time jobs, which made me feel like I had done my job for free. But they just never showed me what my background was.
