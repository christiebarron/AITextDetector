The setting of 'Rough Road Ahead' by Joe Kurmaski is an important factor in how the cyclist navigates their journey. The landscape can be characterized as unknown, with no signs of civilization. The rugged terrain is filled with steep hills, deep valleys, winding roads, and all types of obstacles in between. 

The lack of signs make the cyclist feel uneasy as they are unsure of the road ahead. They are surrounded by the unknown and their lack of knowledge of the terrain can be unsettling. Therefore, the cyclist finds themselves using courage as their source of strength in order to overcome the physical challenges associated with the unknown road. 

The road itself also poses a physical challenge for the cyclist. The rough terrain is full of unpaved roads and excessive potholes which makes cycling a difficult task. The cyclist must be prepared for any unexpected situations and be prepared to make quick decisions, which can be difficult due to the unfamiliar environment. Another danger lies in potential wildlife which can unexpectedly appear on the road. 

The setting of 'Rough Road Ahead' serves as a metaphor for life, which is full of unexpected turns and obstacles. The cyclist must learn how to manage their fear of the unknown and develop strategies to help them navigate the unexpected. The physical dangers of the landscape serves as a reminder that life can be unpredictable and that bravery is needed to succeed in any sort of journey.
