The Empire State Building is a stunning example of architectural achievement. Built in 1930, it was the first building in the world to have a mooring mast and is the only building in New York City to host a dock for airships, or dirigibles. The construction of this mooring mast presented multiple challenges and obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock safely.  

The first obstacle was structuralâ€”the mooring mast had to be strong enough to hold the enormous weight of a passing dirigible while still being secure in windy conditions. The mooring mast was constructed from steel and very heavy timber beams, eleven feet wide and seventy-five feet tall. In addition, to add extra stability, five cables each weighing three thousand pounds were drawn across the top of the mast in a crisscross fashion. 

The most difficult obstacle, however, was engineering the mooring system that would be used for the dirigibles. This was a very complex process, as the system had to include a long cable that would be dropped from the dirigible when it was approximately one hundred feet from the mooring mast. The cable needed to stretch several hundred feet and have a release hook with which the dirigible could be securely moored. The release hook was attached to a pendant cable that would lower the cable to the ground while simultaneously supporting the dirigible. 

The engineers also had to develop air brakes that the pilots of the
