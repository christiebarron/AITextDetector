Computers have many effects on people. The simplest of these, being that they tend to be averse to technology. The computer is not what's most important. We tend to be concerned with technical things like things like the way things perform. You see a big gap between these two things.

What about people who care about computers and have a technical obsession with computing, for instance. They have this obsessive obsession to do things that they think the next person should do. We tend to take for granted that computers aren't really designed for anythingâ€”they're designed for people who care about computers. Maybe that is true, and there's a lot that could be said for technology that doesn't. So even if you think that there might be a problem to something that will do anything, you tend to look at things differently, and I think people should put a much stronger emphasis on technologies over things that don't do anything for us.

I think that we do have to understand that science is far from perfect and all things can come to nothing just by the hand (laughter).

Question: And also how would you take away one of your big worries about computers? For instance, you mentioned that we talk almost exclusively about "smart phones." I think that makes a lot of sense, especially if you're trying to find a kind of digital life that will make you smarter, and I think that you should look to computers and computers that will help you. What would you say
