The Empire State Building was the first skyscraper built with the intention of allowing dirigibles to dock. This innovative idea, proposed by Empire State Building architect William F Lamb, was unique and presented many obstacles.

The main challenge in allowing dirigibles to dock was the matter of safety. A tall structure like the Empire State Building could easily be damaged by the larger airships, while the dirigibles were also vulnerable to bad weather and other external forces. Lamb proposed the concept of a Mooring Mast, a structure on the 81st floor of the Empire State Building which could be used to secure a large airship. The entire process would begin by having the airship lowering its elevators to a catwalk, where passengers and cargo could be transferred. 

The next challenge involved the matter of supplying Mooring Mast with power. Lamb insisted that it have its own generator and fuel supply as well as its own water tanks and elevator system. This would create a self-sustaining system that could be used for both refueling and docking. He also proposed the additional safety features of two railings, placed at the sides of the mast, to be used for securing the elevators. These safety features had never been used before and were essential for the proper function of the mast.

Another problem faced by the designers was the fact that the Empire State Building never received a formal permit to dock dirigibles due to difficulties in regulations. This caused the entire
