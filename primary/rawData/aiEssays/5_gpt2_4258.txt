The director is currently a volunteer at a community centre in London where he sees the homeless.

The story, 'Born, raised, and educated': living life with no job despite his work in the arts

The man, 30, is a career civilian who has been working two jobs in two different cities, one for a record label and the other by design. In some cities he manages a shop selling jewellery to the public.

The city where he comes from is a centre full of many 'problem boys' he met in his youth. They are both suffering from severe conditions such as Alzheimer's disease who are struggling to get work.

As time passes there is more and more homeless who simply don't want to be homeless. The writer can be forgiven for not having any idea what to do with them, but in the end it became only a matter of time before a number of his homeless friends would get along to a certain degree, and then in a few cases he would have his own house and some money together.

The man says if he is not working enough, "the homelessness will get worse," adding: 'It will start to get worse causally.'

He goes as far as calling himself a 'good person': 'If I was homeless I would have done anything to help.
