Dear Editor, 

As computers become ever more ubiquitous in our lives, it is important to consider the effects they have on our physical, mental, and social well-being. On one hand, the advances in technology allow us to be more productive, efficient, and connected with the world. However, it is also essential to recognize the challenges and risks that come with becoming overly reliant on computers. 

Physical health is particularly vulnerable to computer use; lingering over a computer for hours has been linked to numerous physical ailments like dry eyes, neck and shoulder pain, obesity, and more. In addition, constantly staring at a screen for long periods also increases the risk of developing mental health issues, like depression, anxiety, and distraction.

But there are also deeper changes to our lifestyles. We are becoming overly dependent on technology, with the ability to work online and communicate through text and email, and in many cases, having the internet at our fingertips can lead us to become increasingly isolated from people in our own community and around the world.  

To keep us safe and connected, it is important to be mindful of the time you spend in front of a screen. We should also use computers to become involved in our community and to stay engaged with the people that are closest to us. By making considerations to our computer use, we can help ensure computers contribute to a healthy lifestyle rather than detract from it.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
