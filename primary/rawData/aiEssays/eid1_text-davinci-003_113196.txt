Dear Editor, 

I write to you today to express my opinion on the impact computers have on people, and to persuasively argue why I believe they have positive effects. 

Computers can be beneficial in many ways, such as allowing us to do more advanced work in less time, providing us with global news and information, and offering us countless opportunities to learn new skills. We can also use them to stay connected to friends and family around the world, or to shop online without even stepping out of our homes.

Computers help expand our cultural knowledge and understanding of the world. We can now look up information on regional cuisines, diverse backgrounds, any corner of the planet. It allows us to access resources we would not have access to otherwise, deepening our understanding of a variety of cultures.

Computers can also be educational tools. With the help of computers, students can now teach themselves any topic, from complex engineering concepts to basic arithmetic. With access to computers and the internet, people can build up their knowledge and skills so they can pursue any career they set their minds to, which in turn, can open more doors for wider job opportunities.

Overall, the use of computers have been beneficial both in our personal and professional lives. They give us access to new opportunities, and help us learn new skills. Itâ€™s undeniable that computers are here to stay and can have a positive impact in many ways.
