The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' has been one of anger and pain not only at the police who gave up their careers to write about such subjects as a case of sexual exploitation in the US, an allegation that has prompted a petition that may never get any traction with the courts.

But the subject, who has not been named, appears to be getting more attention.

"It's clear in the context of 'From Home is' you know the police are trying to silence you if you have any questions about sexual exploitation," she told MailOnline on Sunday.

"This was an important chapter in my life.

"I am still learning to cope with how it feels to be forced to write about something so I would like them to take that on in the coming weeks.

"Having said that, I know I will find ways I want to cope as well."
