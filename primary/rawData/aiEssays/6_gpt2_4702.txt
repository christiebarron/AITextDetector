The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, they didn't want to build another elevator that could carry the passengers into the building's first floor (as it was already on one side, they had to build one of the other two with two floors); however, they used the existing building in its building permit process to design and build a dirigible for that project.

After three years of planning, the new building was completed on 11th Street. (The two stories on the left came from the same building, but the third from the same building.) To open the new building, the builder decided to bring two new dirigibles: One a six-unit structure built in 2003 and the other in 2003 a five-unit one. One the former in 2005 was built on the top, but the other was built on a separate building near 9th and 10th streets so the workers could not use it. The workers would be able to use both structures in their new dirigibles, thus allowing them to move to the third one in one's life time or during their retirement.
