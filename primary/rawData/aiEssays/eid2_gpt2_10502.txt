I believe that censorship of materials in libraries and universities is a bad thing. If we do, we may be able to save lives on campus by preventing those who can't afford the medical care we need from being silenced.

The government should be working on a policy that would prevent universities from making such censorship. But as soon as it is learned, this censorship could become necessary as a matter of course as a means of limiting the power of a university and of the free flow of knowledge in this country. As a result, many students and others continue to be taught, or have been taught through their own private and family institutions, that we should make sure that free expression is protected.

The issue at hand is that many people still think you cannot censor yourself. They are unaware that you have a right to free speech and yet continue to believe that we must protect our freedom of speech. It is not worth the effort to argue for censorship when there are consequences.

On my way to my classroom, I heard someone say that a person should not be in the classroom when the instructor tells the student he can't read speech. I understood. I understand he is not a man of the people, but I do not see how many people are taking it away because some people in the audience refuse to be listened to, and others are not listening. Because this is not censorship, and therefore anyone with a right to free speech can tell the teacher.

Let's not be blind
