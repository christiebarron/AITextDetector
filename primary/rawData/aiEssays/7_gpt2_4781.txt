An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a couple years ago when a woman was about to have an open stomach surgery. I told my daughter that she had just had her primary school test results and were curious about my diagnosis, she called me and said if I hadn't gotten them I was just going to have to get a job and live to make ends meet. To my horror, she was still screaming when I told her anything. It was terrifying, and so, so very, very difficult. Eventually, a woman who said things like: "The tests don't give her a diagnosis. It's an open heart operation. I need to have at least one more and she can probably understand that I am having open heart surgery," but so much less. She had a full family that I had left. She really just wanted to live a normal life.

I know that what started as an open heart operation has turned into a long time coming; even as I am still recovering from the surgery. As I say in the introduction I put to you to help guide you along. My goal with this book, so far, has been in helping you connect with your patients who don't know how to get into your practice because they are so traumatized by the surgery that they do not want to be there. These people may never know what surgery is, what they mean by having a hospital open heart in their home, what they will feel like afterward. At heart,
