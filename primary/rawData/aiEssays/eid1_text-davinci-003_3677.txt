Dear Editor,

As technology continues to advance, computers become an integral part of our lives. With their increased usage, it is natural to question the effects that computers can have on people. After careful consideration, I am convinced that computer usage has a number of positive effects on people.

To begin, computers can provide us with efficient access to knowledge. The internet provides us with a vast amount of information that would be inaccessible without the aid of a computer. With this greater access to knowledge, people are able to broaden their understanding of a variety of topics, often at no cost.

Furthermore, computers facilitate communication. With communication software such as Skype and FaceTime, people are able to stay in touch regardless of their physical location.

Finally, computers can help with completing tasks quickly, whether it be an assignment for school or a project for work. Without computers, the task at hand would take much longer to complete.

While those are only a few examples, it is clear that computer usage has a beneficial effect. As technology continues to evolve, computers will become a huge part of our everyday lives. I urge readers to embrace this inevitable advancement and all of the benefits it offers. 

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
