I was recently visiting an art museum with a group of friends. We had planned on spending the entire morning there, but everyone got a little impatient after a few hours. I, on the other hand, was determined to make the most of the experience. I took my time admiring each piece and asked the docents questions along the way. 

After a while, my friends started to get more and more antsy. They were itching to get out of there and move onto our next activity. I assured them I was almost done and to wait just a few moments more. I was adamant about not rushing, and patiently finished my viewing of the artwork. 

Eventually, after seeing everything I wanted to, we left the museum. No one had lost their patience and I was rewarded with an incredibly rich experience. I'm glad I was able to show patience and get the most out of our time there!
