One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was 15," she said.

There was another time she heard a voice that wasn't her: it was an older woman who looked back at her father.

"Everyone's a good family, they're all very nice and polite," she said, speaking after attending the dinner. "She always said 'Good evening my children.' She is so quiet and has a quiet mind."

For them, "I'm so happy they're still alive," said one of the men.

For someone with her background, it's an emotional time because she's always had stories to tell and always wanted to see them realized.

"We all share that hope, and there's a lot of hope and sadness out there," she said.
