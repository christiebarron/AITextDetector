The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, they would have to get permission from the local government, which had not approved of all the trucks, and then, to be specific, from the state Transportation Commission, which allowed them to dock on public land through eminent domain.

The owners of the Empire Building were required to give out permits before even asking for a permit. This may have led to the building owners taking the view that a new law would soon eliminate the ability to build dirigibles for business. Then the owners began to consider their options, with companies like AT&T, which was working with the city. They were also asked to provide $25 million in compensation to the city, which became their compensation.

In the end, after a long effort, AT&T opted to provide $50 million. The $50 million was made available to the city to get more building permits. After a review by TPM on the matter, the proposed owners were told that they could not obtain new permit requests from the commission. However, many of the building permits had already been passed and the state Transportation Commission had approved them. This prompted the building owners to look into alternatives to the state's standard. Ultimately, the proposed company did not become a full-fledged commercial operation, which was an important change for many.
