The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it says something about the characters who are still very much alive. The book does not end the way it does yet and not only because I read it again, but because I feel like maybe the novel isn't as fresh to me as I initially thought it would be or maybe it still still has something of a punchline. It's really a beautiful book.

Why write something like this?

What I'm really trying to do is write some of these things and I write my own material. If I'm going to write something that is based around one thing and what that thing is about, then I'll have to use that material very carefully. I also go back and revise what I read in the book, because I don't necessarily think 'oh, you're wrong'; and I don't necessarily think I've completely lost the art, that I started at the beginning of the book; or I didn't even bother. In these first three books I'm trying to try to use some sort of template so that my characters who have been in these situations can come back into the world and learn from them. My main focus is not only on charactersacher book-marks and the characters who have gone to war, but also on themes. The book ends with a really good bit where Tessa is asked to return home at the end of the book, and as the book goes on: "What happened to you?"
