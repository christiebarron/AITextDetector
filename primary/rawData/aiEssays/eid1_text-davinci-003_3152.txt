Dear Editor,

I am writing to you to share my opinion about the effects computers have on people. There have been a large number of studies that have shown computers can have both negative and positive effects on people.

I believe that computers can be a great tool to help people improve their knowledge and learn new skills. Computers can provide access to a vast library of information, enabling people to learn about a wide range of topics. They can also be used as a platform for collaboration and new ideas. Computers are also highly useful for those who work in the fields of mathematics, science, technology, and engineering; allowing them to accurately manipulate data and think more critically.

However, computers can also be an immense distraction and drain of peopleâ€™s time. People can become overly reliant on computers for information and problem-solving, leading to less creativity and dependence on the machine. They can also lead to an unhealthy sedentary lifestyle, which can cause physical health problems.

It is clear, therefore, that computers can have both positive and negative effects on people. I encourage readers to keep this balance in mind and strive to use computers as an advantageous tool rather than a distraction.

Sincerely,
