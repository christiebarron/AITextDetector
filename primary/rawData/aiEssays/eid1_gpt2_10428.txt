Computers have many effects on people. They can reduce the ability to have the best time, improve efficiency, or, well, have all the benefits. A big one is the social impact, because everyone and everything in the world can have a social impact. And the same thing applies to computers. It's like having a social program. If one of the programs is bad, you are the worst person, then someone else will have their program. So how do you know your computer programs helped you? The same way computers determine whether someone is good or bad and how to react to that, whether it's possible at all to get the results you want within two to three seconds.

RADDATZ: I'm very interested in why the impact of computers was relatively small. You know it really didn't appear or do any impact, in fact, it just vanished. What's happened to everyone of the different types of jobs that's going to come up?

It really doesn't seem that big or as large as I expected, though. It's fascinating
