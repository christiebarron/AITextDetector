Dear Editor,

In the modern world, computers have become a fundamental part of our lives. Our reliance on technology has had a large impact on our daily activities. While many people perceive technology has comprehensive benefits, its influence on the people who use it is often overlooked.

The application of modern technology has certainly improved efficiency and increased convenience. However, the negative side effects should not be ignored. It is not uncommon for people to spend countless hours on the internet or playing video games. As a result, the amount of time spent engaging in physical activity is decreasing, resulting in physical and mental ailments, such as obesity and anxiety. Technology also influences the development of social skills in children; instead of interacting with their peers, they can spend hours in front of a computer or phone at the expense of interpersonal relationships. 

Although technology can facilitate learning and communication, it can also create unhealthy behaviors and habits. Therefore, I urge readers to remind themselves and their loved ones to stay alert and exercise healthy boundaries when using computers.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
