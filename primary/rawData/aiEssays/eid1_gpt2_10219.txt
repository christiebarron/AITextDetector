Computers have many effects on people. While some computer scientists believe that many of the functions and activities in most systems are controlled by complex networks of neurons, many others believe that these networks often function more for other or more specialized functions. This suggests that certain functions are regulated more deeply within these networks and are more affected by the complex communication circuits that control these neurons. It has been shown that the complexity in many biological systems increases with the complexity in one or a few of the neurons. In addition, other neurotransmitters — that is, many neurotransmitters or substances that act in a certain manner with or against other biological systems — are distributed as well. Thus, the functions and processes of neurotransmitters may also affect other systems and systems of brain.

A more recent study (M. Fermina & A. L. Rauke) found that certain types of chemical compounds (particularly amino acids) form structural components of neuronal membranes. These compounds, called microfluidophoregulators, stimulate excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmission and regulate synaptic transmission and processing in a manner that is very important for their biological basis. In this study, both microfluidophoregulators and calcium-rich glutamate-containing glutamate-rich and calcium-poor GABA-ergic systems were studied before, during and after a period of prolonged exposure to glutamate.

In other words, these microfluidophoregulators (and their synapses) regulate various biological processes
