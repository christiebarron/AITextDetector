I remember the first time I met my best friend, Adam.  Everyone in my grade had always talked about him having a great sense of humor, so when he asked me to hang out, I prepared myself for what would undoubtedly be an amusing evening. But what I wasn't expecting was for him to make fun of me almost immediately after I sat down. He kept going on about my hair, my clothes, and the way I talk. I was obviously uncomfortable and taken aback, but then he smiled and said, "It's OK, buddy; I'm kidding!"

I guess that broke the ice, because I suddenly felt relief and wound up laughing at his jokes. When I started to laugh, he laughed even harder, and it felt like we had known each other our whole lives. That's when I figured out something really important: laughter is the best way to build a relationship. 

Since that night, I've been spending more time with Adam, and we've only gotten closer. Even when we're just goofing around, joking and teasing one another, I can feel a connection between us that I haven't felt with many other people in my life. Laughter is totally underrated as a way of getting to know someone, and it's definitely one of the key elements of our friendship.
