When the Empire State Building was completed in 1931, the Construction Company had plans in place to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. This idea was unique and revolutionary at the time, and would greatly increase the fame of the building, as it could plausibly be the first place in the world to allow such an amazing feat. Despite constant advancements in aviation, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles that prevented dirigibles from docking at the top. 

The first obstacle was based on size and safety considerations. Dirigibles at the time were large and unwieldy, and the fact that they moved slowly and were filled with flammable hydrogen gas endangered the passengers. As a result, the construction group did not want to risk endangering the lives of those who worked or visited the building. Furthermore, even when dirigibles were properly secured to the building, the sheer weight of the vehicle put an additional strain on the building structure. This presented a challenge for engineers, as they attempted to figure out how to build a framework and mooring mast that would be strong enough to handle the weight and wind pressure of the dirigibles. 

Another obstacle faced by the builders was the fact that many of the dirigible engineers lacked expertise in the engineering of such a mooring system. At the time, it was still a new concept, and some engineers doubted the wisdom of the project entirely. However, as the Empire
