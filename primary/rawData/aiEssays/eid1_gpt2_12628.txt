Computers have many effects on people. One of the greatest for most of us is that we tend to avoid the environment and our relationships. It's hard to have a long relationship with a computer. With some other people, we're pretty much the only ones around, you know? "But what if, it's not your job and your friends are with you, and when you see them go 'Oh, that person is making stuff'?"

As you mentioned earlier, when we hear people talk about making games, we usually say how important it is to them that they can share experiences with the people involved. But we get a lot of requests about who people connect with through games and games forums, who people learn more about and learn from. And if this is the case for someone, their support in gaming may be very strong and if they are interested in creating a game, then our response is often that they can help.

People who are interested in the game industry and have a great interest in helping other people create a game may feel that they have to do some kind of form of marketing or promotional outreach that includes an offer to get more people involved through the game. And there is an amazing diversity of people in the industry. Most of their people are working in just about every industry - from gaming to comics and games, from gaming to games management, from other disciplines - so some interest is required to have a meaningful interaction.
