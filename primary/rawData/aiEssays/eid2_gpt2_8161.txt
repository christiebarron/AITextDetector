I believe that censorship of materials in libraries isn't a viable solution for the community of scholars, editors and other people dedicated to preserving the tradition of scholarly knowledge. It's not a practical approach which can work as planned.

While we remain committed to the free society of our friends in Cambridge Libraries, there has been little progress at the University for the last 15 years in making the most of a library's space and providing for our most valued contribution to the arts and science. We remain committed to the free society of the students and scholars who love and value their library, and we remain committed to providing it with value in all forms (including open access, free expression and student access).

If you're interested in helping, please become a volunteer for the Cambridge Library's community committee. You can help build a community of dedicated, open and tolerant, open and collaborative individuals, or join our club of volunteers to become a member on any topic and make sure this information is taken care of within the library.

Our committee members, faculty and members of our staff will be able to help and provide input. In addition, every member of Cambridge Library is encouraged to speak at events in the library's community hall. It's the first time we'll feature a Cambridge library staff individual on the committee! Anyone can make a contribution of any kind or activity. However, it is recommended that you read through Cambridge Library's community committee's policy about free content and support of academic freedom.
