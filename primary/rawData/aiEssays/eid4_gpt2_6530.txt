The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because that is where my original intention of writing it was at this moment. At that point I simply couldn't find an excuse to change things.

The way the book is about the life, happiness and love of God, that is, a human being who experiences this reality and not a "reality-telling" character, I didn't know that you could, or should, write in a book in the first place. I didn't really know a lot about what it would bring to be in charge of that world. I knew nothing about the story, and I wanted to put it all in here for you as a companion so you would know what the story really came down to. So on the occasion of this day, I want to take this opportunity to tell you some of about what I hope to do in Winter Hibiscus by way of your help during the review period.

I will begin by revealing some of the main features of the novel. The story started by the hero's defeat of a supernatural entity called an evil god living in the depths of Lake Merrick and living for many generations in the deep of the forest and wilderness. I am actually going to explain what is going on in the book by the way, but the main theme is the relationship of the hero to the god, who was the same as the world it was based on during the time of Joseph Schopenhauer's own vision.
