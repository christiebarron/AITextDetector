The narrator of Winter Hibiscus, Minfong Ho, ends the story with the horticultural metaphor as a way of providing a hopeful ending. The metaphor not only highlights the resilience of the narrator, but also emphasizes the idea that even if life has taken an unexpected and difficult turn, there is ultimately hope that things can improve. The imagery of the melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus provide a tangible example of renewal and hope. This idea that despite adversity, there is potential for growth and improvement is what Minfong Ho wishes to convey to the reader.
