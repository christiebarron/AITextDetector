One time I had planned an outing with my friends months in advance. On the day of the trip, we were all so excited. However, when we arrived at the spot, it had just started raining and the rain was not letting up. Everyone was getting a bit down, as we had all been anticipating the trip for so long.

Rather than getting frustrated, I decided to be patient. I convinced my friends that it would clear up soon, and I urged them to stay patient as well. After an hour or two of waiting, I was proven right - the sky cleared up and we ended up having the best time ever.

My friends were really impressed by my patience, and so was I. I was proud to have kept us focused on having a good time, even when it seemed to be slipping away. From then on, we all learned to take things as they come and remain patient in the face of adversity.
