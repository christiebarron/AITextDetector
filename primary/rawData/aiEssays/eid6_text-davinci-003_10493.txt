The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the iconic building. According to ‘The Mooring Mast’, written by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the main challenges that had to be overcome were the extreme wind conditions at the building’s height, the amount of weight that needed to be supported, and security and safety concerns.

Firstly, the wind conditions at the Empire State Building’s great height made it impossible to securely moor a blimp in place. At such a height, turbulence and strong winds meant that a lightweight airship would be at the mercy of conditions that could cause it to crash. To ensure that a dirigible could be moored safely, a mooring system had to be designed that would be strong enough to withstand the strong wind forces. To this end, the builders designed a system that featured a one hundred ton steel mast, cables that could hold up to four thousand pounds of weight, and a large blimp hangar to house the craft.

The sheer weight of a dirigible also posed a challenge to the builders. At the time, construction materials were not light enough to build an elevated pad that could bear the weight of a fully laden airship. This obstacle was overcome by designing a mooring mast that could be embedded into the structure of the building, and by implementing a counterweight system that would take the weight of the
