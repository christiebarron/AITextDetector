 

I vividly remember the first time I truly laughed with my best friend. I had known them for years, but we had only hung out a few times. We were both awkward kids in middle school, so earlier attempts at hanging out usually involved some small talk, but not much.

But one day, we were both at the same birthday party and had managed to run into one another. We decided to go grab a snack and spontaneously started talking about our weird school experiences. We laughed uncontrollably at the dumb jokes we had heard other people in school say. We compared and shared our own experiences, and how foolish we had felt having listened to those around us.

For the next few hours we just exchanged stories, making jokes and laughing our heads off. I felt so comfortable around them and almost relief that I had finally found someone to laugh with. Eventually, we said our goodbyes and parted ways, but we both knew we had made a connection.

To this day, whenever we meet up, we still share stories and laugh until our sides hurt, and I am grateful we can do this together. I am thankful for the laughter we share, and the many memories we have created.
