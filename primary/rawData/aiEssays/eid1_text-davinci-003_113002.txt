Dear Editor, 

In todayâ€™s ever advancing digital age, computers are having a profound effect on people everywhere. However, the issue of whether this effect is positive or negative is a hotly contested one, and an issue worthy of a more substantial discussion. 

On the one hand; computers have greatly facilitated the learning process by delivering an unprecedented wealth of knowledge that was previously restricted mostly to books. Computers have enabled us to expand our understanding of the world, and have provided us with opportunities to explore realms once thought of as impossible. With the emergence of the computer age, it has become seemingly easier to bridge gaps in language and culture, and to facilitate communication on a global scale. 

On the other hand; computer usage has also lead to many concerning effects on people. Issues such as computer addiction, heightened levels of anxiety, and physical immobility from extended periods of sitting are all serious concerns. Not only are these issues real, but they can lead to very serious consequences such as depression, anxiety, and even death. 

That being said, we must then accept the conclusion that, while computers are a powerful force for good in our world, their usage also has severe and dangerous consequences. For this reason, it is essential that we take the proper steps to ensure that computer usage is kept in check. We must put in place initiatives to limit computer usage in our schools, and increase the awareness of computer addiction in our communities.
