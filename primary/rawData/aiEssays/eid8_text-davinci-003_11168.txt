I remember the first time I met my now-husband. We were in line at our local coffee shop and struck up conversation. I realized we had a lot in common and I was so drawn to him. I remember what set us apart was our shared love of laughter. 

We could meet one another’s gaze, and within seconds laughter would bubble out of us. We would laugh over anecdotes, memories, and memories we hadn’t even formed yet. There was just something there, something that was connecting us in a visceral way.

We kept talking as we walked around the city after we finished our coffees. All the while, we were sharing laughter like it was second nature to us. Eventually, we stumbled upon a field with a great view of the cityscape. We stopped and just enjoyed each other’s company. 

And then, out of nowhere, he started laughing. I couldn’t understand why, and I asked him “What’s so funny?”  His reply was simple and honest: “I’m just so happy that I get to share this moment with you.” 

At that moment I knew that we would be together forever. We had discovered a bond over laughter and it has stood the test of time. To this day, we still find solace in the simple act of sharing a laugh with each other.
