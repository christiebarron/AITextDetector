I believe that censorship of materials in libraries does not mean that people are free to tell different stories and different things.

Here's the message from the BBC:

"[W]hat is happening in the US is not our problem. What has been going on is that we've taken the view that people ought to be able to tell their own stories because that's what they want to hear from us, that they can express themselves in the way they want to."

The Telegraph also took up the issue of "the most popular books of each genre". The headline was, "Read our list of UK national books of 2017", but that seems to just be a bit of misleading headline.

The only way to compare these numbers is with the 2013 edition of the Dictionary of Modern English. Here's the full list of English words with the most frequently used English words, which you can see as well.
