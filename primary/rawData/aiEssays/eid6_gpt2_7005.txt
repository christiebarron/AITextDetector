The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In fact, the building's owners had also objected to an airbag ban, so other buildings around the U.S. were constructed and allowed to carry airbags in place.

By the 1960s, however, no airbags had been built because they could not make it on land. A number of American universities adopted the idea that airbag installations were unnecessary in terms of security. For example, several universities at the Ohio State University in Ohio state universities offered free admission to students under free tuition, no fees or a stipend to residents who met certain criteria. The first academic study on airbag infrastructure at Columbia University in New York (1861) identified a number of issues of interest in airbag design. First, the airbag, for its own purposes, could not be used to catch "smoke and blood" from workers who were exposed to air-conditioners. This, in turn, was contrary to the idea that air-conditioners provide enough protection against air pollution. Second, the air-bag air-bag system became controversial when it became known that it did not actually prevent people breathing by inhaling carbon dioxide at the expense of their heart and lungs. Third, the ventilation equipment could not penetrate the body and was therefore not sufficiently effective. Finally anxiety caused engineers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Potsdam, Germany to develop and demonstrate air-bag systems
