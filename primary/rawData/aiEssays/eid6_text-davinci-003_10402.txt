The construction of the Empire State Building presented a unique challenge to its designers in allowing dirigibles to dock, a feat only accomplished decades after the completion of the iconic building. Many factors, both practical and technical, had to be taken into account and obstacles had to be overcome in order for dirigibles to successfully dock at the peak of the Empire State Building.

The first obstacle to the dirigible docking plan lay in the challenge of having an immense amount of steel and concrete constructed over 1,000 feet in the air. The steel foundations that had to support the mast contained over 10,000 tons of steel and a complex system of bolted and welded beams that had to be set into place followed by the planned mooring mast, all while being exposed to wind gusts of up to 124 mph.

In addition, the unstable air currents due to the building’s height and influence from nearby structures made it difficult for the construction of a secure docking tower for the dirigibles—adding to the immense amount of time, money, and resources invested into the project. The construction of the mooring mast was completed in 1931, but the additional challenge of having it stay still and secure while facing strong wind gusts caused further delays.

Finally, a complex network of tethering lines had to be created to ensure that the dirigibles would remain securely attached to the mast and not risk any further damage. These lines provided an additional layer of security
