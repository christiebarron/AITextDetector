I was at the grocery store the other day and I noticed the person in front of me was experiencing some trouble with the checkout line. She had a lot of items and was short a few cents to make up the total amount needed. She was starting to become frustrated but another person in the line noticed and reached into their pocket and handed the cashier the cents needed to finish the transaction. I thought it was so thoughtful and kind of the person to take the time to help out and be so patient in a difficult situation. It was a great reminder to me to be patient no matter the circumstances.
