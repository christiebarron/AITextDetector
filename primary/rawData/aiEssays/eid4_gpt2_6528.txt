The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because he gives us a sense of the journey his family was willing to make before moving to the United States. The book introduces the concept of 'inter-country travel' and I like his use of the term in that sense, but it's also very true and has some pretty strong premises. What I have missed in Winter Hibiscus is what the family was willing to sacrifice for one another, and this has to have been said a lot at the beginning of the book, as things changed and the story was set when the family were going to make it to Europe.

Michele's introduction to the family's journey through America is a lot about what would have happened if she had been involved more with their journey to Europe, and this book is more about that journey. The world that they go through in Winter Hibiscus is a lot about the travel of a family with other things in store for them. It's not just about the people they meet. It's about them at this very moment who find the way that they are travelling all the time through what some have called the 'Travel of the World'. I love that so much. Michele talks a lot about that travel story and she's very clear about that fact, and she's very open to things that are true and not necessarily that of their own being true, but they are actually told from an outsider's point of view not from them being part
