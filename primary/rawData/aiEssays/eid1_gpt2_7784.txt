Are You Loved by Your Computers?

"My computer doesn't really care if it's my favorite computer, my favorite video game, or my favorite movie, it just knows I love it every single time."

"I spend my days making great friends and taking in amazing experiences and making people happy. It's important you do all these things right after you have a computer in your life as well."

– Michael Egan, CEO and Founder of Kaspersky Lab

Many of these online posts are really helpful advice I have come to learn about how to make my computer love you, and how it's done online, through our friends who also make great friends. They share in our happiness when we find new friends or when we lose our cool when we're out and about, and how many people like and connect to each other and how many people love to talk to people online when we're not on a plane or at a restaurant.
