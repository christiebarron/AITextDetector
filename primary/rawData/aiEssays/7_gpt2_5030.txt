An example of a time someone in my life was patient was I was on the other side of the line of duty, but the only thing that didn't stop me from making it to the team was for me to take the knee.

"We can't forget our moment in the locker room. On the field, we played in the same situation. We have to remember the fight and all that goes into it: We fought for every single piece of equipment, the pads, the pads, the safety, it's all part of the game."

As the New York Giants begin offseason training camp last July, coach Ben McAdoo said it has been difficult for the former Pittsburgh Steelers star to see how his team would be ready for the start of free agency.

"We knew it was going to be a tough summer, but I'm not going to think about it just because we were so much better off going on and being 100 percent where we were," McAdoo said Wednesday. "You want your players to play well, but they don't want to let you down or your team or what have you. We have to work on getting more consistent play. It's going to take some time for us to hit. But hopefully everybody can focus and work hard on making it a big year."
