The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it's a great book to learn. The author has written and directed a couple short short films and this is a great book to understand and relate to. It also comes with an extensive list of characters, stories, and locations. It is also the perfect introduction to this fantastic collection. But what is great about it all is that you will know everything about it all in just a few short months after it's finished. If there was anything you would like to say to those that don't know better, please think about this book. Read The Winter Hibiscus in your whole day by reading it. There are just as many wonderful things out there about it. It should not be missed.
