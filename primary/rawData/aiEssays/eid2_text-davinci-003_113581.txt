Dear Editor, 

In a time when our nation is facing a torrent of issues all vying for our attention, it is important to make sure that our libraries remain places of learning, free of censorship. Yet the question arises â€“ should certain materials be removed from the shelves if found to be offensive?

There is no doubt that some materials may contain offensive language, violence, or images. Yet, by removing them from public libraries we open the door to censorship of ideas that could otherwise be used for educational or developmental purposes. Libraries are places of exploration, and exploration cannot happen without knowledge. We would be doing students and members of our community a disservice by shielding them from learning about the real world.

Without access to materials that might be considered offensive, readers would be deprived of insight into why certain people may feel upset or offended by them. By keeping materials available to study, readers can become more aware of what might cause offense and open channels of meaningful discussion. Libraries should be about education, not censorship.

Censorship, as proven by history, does not lead to better world, but instead leads to a culture of repression and dullness. If we want positive and meaningful change we must recognize the importance of allowing access to diverse opinions to be expressed. We should not limit our society's access to knowledge unless it is deemed absolutely necessary. 

It is for that reason I strongly believe that libraries should not censor certain materials, such as books,
