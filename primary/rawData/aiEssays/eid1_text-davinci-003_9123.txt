Dear Editor,

It is undisputed that computers have become a principal part of our lives. From children who have access to computers in the classroom to adults who need them for their businesses, computers can influence an individual’s life in a big way.

Computers can affect an individual’s health in both a positive and a negative way. To start with, computers make our life more convenient as it can increase our productivity: we can work faster and have more time for leisure activities. With the advancement of technology, children are gaining more access to educational tasks that help them learn faster.

On the other hand, computers can also have an adverse effect on our physical and mental health. Prolonged exposure to the computer screen can lead to problems such as eye strain, carpal tunnel syndrome, and severe headaches. In addition, constant use of computer may even lead to sleep deprivation and other mental health issues. 

The effects of computers on people must not be understated. One should be aware of the risks associated with prolonged use of computers and strive to find ways to limit or balance its use. By making conscious and wise decisions when it comes to using computers, people can lead healthy and productive lives.

I strongly believe that computers should be used responsibly and with moderation. It is my conviction that we can make the most out of computers and still enjoy its benefits, without having to worry about having its detrimental effects on our health.
