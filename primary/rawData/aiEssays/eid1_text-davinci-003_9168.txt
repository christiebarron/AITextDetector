I am writing to voice my opinion on the effects computers have had on people.

We live in an information age where technology is at the forefront of social change. The abundance of computers and the internet have drastically changed the way we communicate, work, and interact with each other. 

First, computers have connected people across the globe and facilitated unprecedented levels of collaboration. We can now work together from different countries and effortlessly share ideas. This has had many positive effects, including more efficient ways of working, global understanding, and faster progress towards achieving our goals.

In addition, computers have allowed limitless access to knowledge. We can take classes, access libraries with hundreds of books, and learn from people from all walks of life. The sheer amount of information available can be daunting, but the effects have been extremely beneficial overall. This has caused a surge in creativity and innovation. 

However, computers also come with some downsides. People often lose track of time on the (internet/social media/etc.); and time spent on the computer should be balanced out with other forms of recreation and physical activity. Additionally, there is an overabundance of content with no regulation, which can be a source of misinformation and misinformation.

Overall, computers have been an incredible asset to developing societies. They have changed the way we think, live, and interact with each other. Nevertheless, their effects should be monitored and regulated, so
