This line at the end of Winter Hibiscus lends a poetic closure to the poem, while at the same time, adding a sense of hope. It implies that even though the speaker has failed a challenging test, they will have the opportunity to try again in the futureâ€”once the winter passes by and the long awaited spring finally arrives. This line invites the reader to imagine a future of growth, optimism, and strength, while also emphasizing the important idea that failure should not be viewed as the end.
