Dear Editor,

I am writing to you today to express my opinion regarding the effects of computers on people. Over the last couple of decades, computers have revolutionized the way we work and have become an integral part of our daily lives. Although this has had its benefits, it can also be argued that computers have had certain negative effects on people's lives.

First and foremost, computers have led to a sedentary lifestyle. People are increasingly spending hours at their computers, meaning that they are not getting enough exercise. This has resulted in a number of health problems, such as obesity and eye strain. It is important that computers are used in moderation and that people are reminded of the importance of taking regular breaks and having some form of physical activity everyday.

Also, computers have made us increasingly dependent on technology. People are relying more and more on computers to get their work done. This has caused a shift away from more traditional ways of completing tasks. For instance, manual typists are becoming a rare breed, as most of us rely on our keyboards and touchscreens to complete most of our written tasks. In addition, more and more people are viewing computers as a substitute for face-to-face interaction.
