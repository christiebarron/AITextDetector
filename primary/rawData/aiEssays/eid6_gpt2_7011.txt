The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first was that they were not designed for the air, so they had to be mounted horizontally with one end moving vertically, as was required after using them in the building of a car on the freeway. This meant that the building also had to have enough room in the frame for a normal dirigible pod to dock, so in this case a standard, flat, straight dirigible was required. The idea was to make the flat-front "frame" to accommodate the extra-frame material, which would allow the pilot to move with his feet or the air, making the building smaller. Once they realized they couldn't have the space for both these types of dirigibles, the designers began experimenting with other materials and designs that would allow for the vertical motion of an aircraft. They created the Aerodynamic Design Project, which proposed an aerodynamic design that would allow the flight speed of an airliner, as well as the pilot to steer or land a landing. In the Aerodynamic Design Project, designers sought to make the pilot perform a maneuver for any single aircraft, so they could have the capability to fly either horizontally or vertically without any interference from the pilot.

This created great controversy. After being rejected by General Electric, they decided to invest the majority of the $4.2 million to develop new materials to support an aerodynamic design. All these new designs were eventually rejected by GE
