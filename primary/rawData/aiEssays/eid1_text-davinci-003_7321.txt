In Joe Kurmaski's 'Rough Road Ahead', the cyclist experiences a host of difficulties as a result of the environment around him. The setting appears to be a very rural, undeveloped area with few roads and trails marked out to ride on. 

The terrain is a major factor here, as it is both steep and dangerous, with loose rocks, mud, and other obstacles that the cyclist must contend with. Furthermore, the lack of hard roads and trails leads to numerous obstacles and hazards. This forces the cyclist to be constantly wary of potential accidents, as well as difficult terrain.

In addition to the terrain, the lack of infrastructure and services in the area also detracts from the cyclist's experience. Not only are there no road markings and no clearly defined paths, but there are also no bike shops or resources in which to repair the cyclist's bike should it become damaged. Furthermore, the cyclist is isolated from help should anything go wrong, such as a flat tire or a crash.

Ultimately, all the features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski's 'Rough Road Ahead' work together to create a challenging and risky experience for the cyclist. While the isolation and undeveloped terrain can be very appealing, it also increases the chance of a dangerous incident. The cyclist must be constantly vigilant in order to avoid any potential hazards and potential injury.
