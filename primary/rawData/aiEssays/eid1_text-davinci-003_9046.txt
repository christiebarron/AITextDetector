Dear Editor,

It's no secret that computers have drastically changed the way we live our lives. We use them to carry out daily tasks, from communicating with family members to managing our finances. As technology continues to advance, so does the role of computers in our lives.

While it can be worryingly easy to get caught up in the world of technology, it's only right that we pause and consider the effects computers have had on people. The constant connection with technology can be exhausting and cause people to become forgetful, and a decrease in physical activity has been linked with an overuse of computers. Mental health can also be negatively impacted, with many people struggling to disconnect and take breaks from their devices.

However, it would be disingenuous to discount the possibility of positive impacts computers have had on people. With access to computers, people can easily connect with one another and engage in meaningful conversations with others. Computers also enable people to access resources that previously were hoarded only by educated elites, giving everyone the opportunity to learn and further their own education.

Overall, computers are a part of our daily lives. We must recognize the effects it has on people, both good and bad, and use this knowledge to manage our own use. It is possible to maintain a healthy relationship with technology, and I urge readers to consider their personal use when interacting with computers. 

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
