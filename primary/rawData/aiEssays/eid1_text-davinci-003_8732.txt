 

I had just finished a long day at work and was feeling the blues. It had been raining non-stop the whole day, and naturally, I was feeling a bit down.

I almost walked right by my friend, who was standing outside waiting for me. But when I heard his hearty laughter, I knew it was him. His laugh was always so infectious and it always made me feel like I was up to something silly, no matter how bad of a mood I was in.

I smiled and joined in his laughter as I crossed the street. It felt so good to let out some of the stress of the day and just enjoy the moment. We soon started talking and it didn't take long before a serious conversation turned into a game of laughing and joking. I quickly forgot about my bad mood and what had been stressing me out. 

We spent the rest of the evening talking about our day, but even more importantly, sharing laughter. There's something so refreshing about connecting with someone through humor, and I'll never forget how good it felt to just forget about my troubles and laugh with my friend. 

They say that laughter is the shortest distance between two people, and that night, I knew exactly what they meant. A few moments of shared laughter brought us both out of our bad moods and reminded us of how connected we were, despite whatever life might throw our way.
