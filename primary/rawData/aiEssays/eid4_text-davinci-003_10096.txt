The narrator wants to emphasize the connection between the winter hibiscus and her journey of personal growth. By ending on this optimistic note, the narrator suggests that, just like the winter hibiscus she will want to come back to the test when the snows melt, the geese return, and the hibiscus buds once again. This reflects the hopefulness that the narrator has for both their relationship with the nature around them and their own personal progress. The phrase also serves as a metaphor for the narrator's journey to maturity, and the promise of a brighter future.
