Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. While we do not have any data on which models fit the best in this category, it makes some sense as the range of options is wide. Even the most popular tyres for track development are not meant to replace a factory-standard version of the tyre.

There were 2 different types of ROH tyres available at the 2015 Suzuka Testing session, as well as 3 different versions of the same tyres in our test tyre chart.

1. ROH 2.0 - The 2.0 ROH tyre is not available at present, which means the tyres must all be offered to the wider race in order to take place. If you want to buy more ROH 2.0 tyres, try again.

2. ROH 2.1 - The 2.1 tyre is also available to race in the 2014 European Jerez Grand Prix, which is expected to be played at an event set for the summer.

If you own the ROH 2.1 tyres you may want to try the 'Rift Control' option on the ROH website.

3. 1.ROH 2.2 - The racetrack has some nice options for tyres offered by manufacturers, as well as their competitors. Here's a breakdown of which of these options are available:

Roh 2.1

The ROH 2.1 is available in 11 different sizes
