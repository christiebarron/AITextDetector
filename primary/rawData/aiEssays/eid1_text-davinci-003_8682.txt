I still have fond memories of my best friend and me in our freshman year of high school. We were both the mischievous sort, often getting into trouble for our pranks.

One particular day, the two of us had been tasked with a project in our English class that required us to read some Shakespeare. We had both decided it would be entertaining to ad-lib a couple of lines as we read out loud in the class.

We had unfortunately turned our project into an entire performance, often ad-libbing hilarious one-liners and cracking jokes. Our teacher, who was not amused, tried to rein us back in at several points, but to no avail. 

Finally, after many attempts to put an end to our performance, the entire class burst into laughter as I did a perfectly timed pratfall. Even the teacher had to crack a smile.

That moment of shared laughter and joy is something I will never forget, and it had a lasting impact on my friendship with my best friend. We shared a powerful bond then, and still continue to do so all these years later. Laughter truly does bring people together!
