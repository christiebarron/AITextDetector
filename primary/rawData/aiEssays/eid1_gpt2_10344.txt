Computers have many effects on people. One effect that usually only happens with games is that players lose more money on the game if there are fewer playable characters. In the game World of Warcraft, the players who have more friends get more money on their game, and it can help to have more members of your class that live off of people they haven't even met in time. In Starcraft it's possible to kill your opponent with the wrong move at the end of your match in hopes he doesn't respawn, but this won't work if there aren't enough players in the game. If your opponent uses a spell like Shadowflame on you or casts a spell such as Flash Cannon at you, then you could play your way to a draw.


In the previous example when I played Starcraft II, I would only be able to deal 2 damage so when I lost, I lost because those people don't understand the game. At that point I just knew there weren't enough players with any skill level to support my game and I would lose more money on the game. I had no idea what I should have done. Since I have two friends that play WoW, I had a free ride in that game on the strength of having more friends that were willing to kill me if I could take their money. One of the things I learned a lot at that point was that you can't just win an offline event with only 20 players if there aren't enough players to support your game. What
