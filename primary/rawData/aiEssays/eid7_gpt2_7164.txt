An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the time I sat on the couch and watchedVB and talked to a friend. That would be my first time ever feeling sick…it was like I had just got a life change and needed a change. As I watch people like the doctor and the nurse come in to talk to me, I can feel it. All of a sudden I became a regular person…I love the doctor and nurse too. It is an amazing experience.

So you guys have been working on what you call a patient-centered project at AVFM, and are working on your own patient-centered project. And you're taking on a full-time job. How's that working out?

Oh, really, well, I got some extra time of my own….

AVFM is also an online radio program on "TODAY" at 3pm ET on May 5.
