The ending of the story is meant to be a symbol of hope for the future. The hibiscus flower symbolizes renewal and rebirth, so the protagonist is looking to the future and believing that things will get better. The phrase 'when they come back in the spring' in the sentence is a metaphor for a willingness to continue despite difficult times.
