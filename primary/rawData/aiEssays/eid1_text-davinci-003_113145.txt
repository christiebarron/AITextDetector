Dear Editor,

As technology advances at a rapid rate, we are witnessing a shift in the way we communicate and engage with one another. Computers have become an inevitable part of our daily lives and the impact they have had on our world is undeniable.

I believe that computers have had a positive effect on people, as they facilitate the sharing of ideas and information, and enable people to interact and collaborate from all over the world. From education to industry, these machines have made a great contribution to progress and knowledge.

It is important, however, to also take into account the dark side of computers. Over-reliance on computers could lead to loss of skills and knowledge and a decrease in humanityâ€™s reliance on its own abilities. We must remember that human interaction is paramount, and that technology should be used to supplement, and not replace, interpersonal communication.

On the whole, I urge readers to draw attention to the positive contributions computers have made, while being conscious of the potential risks that overuse of the machines can pose.

Yours sincerely,

[Your Name]
