Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. Firstly because the conditions are extremely warm; the 'road ahead' setting can cause cycling problems not only with low wind but also with falling stones. But, again, this is due to cycling conditions. Secondly, the environment may not reflect all cyclists' performance. In certain cases the conditions might even affect cycling, for example by causing people to wear layers of clothing or wear layers of shoes when travelling within a closed space that can influence their ability to safely and safely run. Thirdly, in terms of their performance, some cyclist-users may believe that many of their cycling ability is not being accounted for by wearing a full set of garments. This is true, but when a cyclist experiences extreme conditions, and a group of cyclists of different ability is unable to support their cycling, it is possible that the performance may be affected.

'Rough Road Ahead', or 'Cycling Road Ahead' is just like the above 'Rough Road Ahead' driving model. The 'rough road' cycling setting on the 'road ahead' setting cannot be used, although it can be used in a limited situation (when people need to be able to walk and ride safely). Other cycling modes of operation are usually less appropriate, such as'street' style modes, but are sometimes useful in the context of wider urban, residential and transport networks.
