The Empire State Building is regarded as one of the greatest feats of engineering in history. When it was built, the builders of this iconic structure also had the revolutionary idea to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. This ambitious goal came with many obstacles and challenges that had to be overcome.

The idea of allowing a craft as large and heavy as a dirigible to dock at the top of a building was something never before done, and the builders of the Empire State Building did not have any prior knowledge of how this could even be done. The first and most obvious obstacle they faced was how the docking station could physically support the additional weight of a dirigible. To solve this problem, they built a tower, known as a mooring mast, to securely hold the dirigibles in place.

The second obstacle was determined by the shape of the mooring mast. The mooring mast had to be carefully designed so that the rope of the dirigible could be tied securely while docking, and then quickly released when necessary. The mooring mast had to be engineered in such a way that the dirigibles could “catch” the mast as they approached and then wrap themselves around it without becoming tangled.

The final obstacle to contend with was the weather. In order for a dirigible to dock safely at the top of the building, the wind had to be no more than 5 mph or the dirigible would be
