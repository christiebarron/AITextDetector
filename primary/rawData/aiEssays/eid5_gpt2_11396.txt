The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' has also given rise to a renewed sense of paranoia and a sense of political panic, a sense of mistrust and apprehension over an emerging US-Russian conflict. In the memoir The Shadow of Trump, a former U.S. intelligence official says President Trump and his advisers have deliberately undermined trust between the CIA and their national security allies, turning their backs on international cooperation.

During meetings at the Republican National Convention, the president-elect has said he would sign off on enhanced interrogation programs but also added: ''The president is not interested in interrogation, he wants the Russians to get the job done.' The idea that his actions would compromise our nation's national security is absurd.''

The director deprivation is one example of the deep psychological resonance created by the US election of Donald Trump, who was accused of fabricating information in Cannabis Sativa, a commercial cannabis product that is used to treat diseases.
