The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is not a secret. The book was published in 2001, and in 2002 a new 'Book of the Year' was announced.

'From Home opens with some wonderful conversations with writers and directors who have been involved in making this film about them,' says Janna.

'The biggest issue is its audience,' says Janna. 'There are many who will never agree with every line.

'But at the end... I think the answer to that is that we may have been too naive.'

In her book, Janna says that she went into every aspect of filming to have a safe and creative atmosphere.

'We do not ever want a movie to be 'unrealistic'. Instead we want it to be as real as possible as possible to be believable,' she says.

With the new series of 'From Home is', Janna wants to give her audience a unique and personal experience of the film.

'Let them tell the story and it is real,' she says. 'And if I leave myself on my own for a while they will never hear it again.

'Janna can do anything you want with this new series of films. They can do anything for her but always I do everything I can to give her the opportunity she deserves.'
