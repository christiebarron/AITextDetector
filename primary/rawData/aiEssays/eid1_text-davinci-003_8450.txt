 

I recently had the opportunity to witness incredible patience. My close friend had become disabled due to an accident, and I could tell I needed help with simple everyday tasks. She had exhausted all of other resources and reluctantly asked for my help. 

I was worried that I wouldn't be able to do enough to help her, but she was nothing but understanding and patient with me. She didn't expect me to understand and do everything perfectly right away, and was grateful for even the smallest of assists. She even thanked me multiple times for my help. Every task took much longer than it would have before her accident, but my friend stayed calm and understanding throughout the whole process.

It was truly inspiring to witness her strength and patience throughout this situation. Even when it seemed like she could have given up, her patience and understanding kept her going and encouraged me to do my best. I admire her so much for her resilience and willingness to stay positive throughout it all. It really put things into perspective for me.
