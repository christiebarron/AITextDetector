An example of a time someone in my life was patient was at work getting ready for high school so I sat back around and watched them play football through a thick fog and then realized I was getting ready to take a break. I put on the uniform and got home after 5:30 and thought for a while what the problem was â€” my head didn't seem to be on. It only took a couple seconds at the best to get over it. My best friend started coming and I went back there and told him to calm down. He wasn't listening at all. I told him to move on. At this point he was back and I told him not to worry about it. I told him to just let things go.

If you read all about the problem there really is no way to solve it. People who go out and get hit by cars will never make it to work as they are always going to get caught and never find a job. They are going to make things impossible. I guess this is why every time we write about it, these people are always talking about it. When we are writing about this problem, it is supposed to be about what it is. It is about the "took me out".
