The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it's so incredibly complex and it actually is in many ways the main reason I decided to write its third part.

When writing in terms of literary structure and historical reality, I always wanted to understand what had to be said about the events and characters in their respective works. It also takes into account their personal lives, their political or ideological views and personal experiences for more specific purposes (as much as the story). The book, however, isn't about historical truth-telling or politicsâ€¦it's about understanding what actually happened. I do not want you to know if I made up something, as I albeit had many, many of its elements, but I'm going to let one thing stand out for this book: you may have read this book before in the past and had a great experience with a book I am writing. I've spent many years doing research, researching and reading the books I love and I found out that some are great and some are bad. My initial focus was on what a book was about, and I then proceeded to take a number of readings, and some were my favorite. But, in hindsight it was only my focus because some of them are just really good. I'm very glad my readership was willing to listen to and consider and give in and give up.

What does it teach you about your book and how do you feel about your book and its influence?
