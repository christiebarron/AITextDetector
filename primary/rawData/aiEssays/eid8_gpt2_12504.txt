One time I experienced laughter in my life was when it took about 10 minutes just to laugh it out loud. The whole thing just got me moving forward.

You seem like a bright, cool, and talented kid with a great family like many of the guys I was introduced to in the comedy-themed book, "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly." Can you talk about that part of it?

The writing was great. The pacing was great. There was so much humor in the book. It wasn't for everybody. Everybody kind of had a different way of looking at things.

Did you come from a very different culture in New York City or from any one particular part of England and a particular place in Hollywood that were so completely different?

Yes. They all had good friends and families.

How did working in the comedy industry compare to being a guy in any other medium?

I have no doubt in my mind that it would be a better place if I could have been my own comedian.

Do you like doing funny stuff in front of audiences? Do you take the same approach?

Absolutely. There's nothing wrong with doing it in front of a crowd of five. It's a lot more enjoyable doing it. As long as the audience is prepared and a bit of work goes into it every time so it's fine.

Do you consider yourself or another character in comedy a hero?

Not
