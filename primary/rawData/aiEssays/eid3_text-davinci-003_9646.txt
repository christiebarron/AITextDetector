The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski have a definite and dramatic effect on the cyclist. The terrain he has chosen to ride is mountainous and rough, making it a physically demanding and tiring journey. The cyclist must climb up mountains and travel over hills and valleys, and this takes its toll on his strength and spirit. The roads themselves are a challenge, winding and steep, with sharp turns and sudden drops. 

The weather also plays a major role in the cyclist’s struggle. The wind is strong and pushes against him, slowing him down and sapping his energy. The skies are grey and cloudy, creating a depressing atmosphere that further drags the cyclist down. The rain is cold and unrelenting, making the road slick and treacherous. 

The cyclist is also isolated from the rest of the world, with no one around him and no one to provide comfort or assistance. This makes him feel alone, vulnerable, and powerless against the forces of nature. The presence of wild animals adds another element of danger, forcing him to stay alert and constantly watch his back. 

Ultimately, all of these features of the setting combine to create a hostile, dangerous landscape that the cyclist must traverse despite the tremendous physical and emotional challenges he faces. Though the road is rough, the cyclist’s courage and resilience drive him forward.
