The ending of the poem serves as a moment of reflection for the narrator. Having just experienced a moment of beauty and connection with nature, realizing both the fragility and tenacity of the flower in winter, the narrator is in a contemplative state. By ending the poem with a thought of contemplation and anticipation, the narrator is signaling a moment of hopefulness for the future. The idea that the narrator will one day again. Taking the test thus serves as a metaphor for taking on new challenges in life, and the narrator's anticipation for the future is a reminder that life goes on despite adversity.
