I believe that censorship of materials in libraries can be harmful to students' learning, research and development," said Tom Gorman, president of the Public Information Service.

The National Student Association recently released a report showing libraries are becoming increasingly reliant on government grants for their operating costs. The U.S. Education Department recently agreed to pay over $1 billion in grants to the National Endowment for the Humanities since 2012 to $20 billion in grants for library services.

As library programs decline and libraries have fewer resources, "the Department believes that it will become increasingly critical that libraries continue to play its most important roles in educating students about public policy and to serve students well," wrote the organization's director.
