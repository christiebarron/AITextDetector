I recently had a stressful day at work and had to stay longer than usual to finish some paperwork. When I got home, I was exhausted and all I wanted to do was take a shower and go to bed. However, my children had other ideas. They were upset and were demanding my attention, asking me questions and crying for help.

I could have lashed out at them in frustration, but I took a deep breath and reminded myself to be patient. I gently put my hand on my son's shoulder and asked him what happened. My daughter started crying and complaining about her sister teasing her. I hugged them both and listened carefully as they talked.

It wasn't easy to stay calm and patient but in the end I was rewarded with hugs, smiles, and a calmer atmosphere. By being patient with my children, I was able to help solve their problem and build a greater sense of trust between us. Patiently listening and responding to their needs was worth much more than scolding ever could have been.
