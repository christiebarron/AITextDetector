An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a patient who was having problems taking care of me and I had to try something to try to stop her and eventually had to end up with her going to emergency room because she was having her problems, and I remember asking him and him seeing who did this and I told him, "Well, do I be sure of that and how is that going to work for you?" And he would have the same answer that I gave him - "Yes sir, I know!"

This is one of those times that I remember when one person was in such an anxious state of mind he was trying to understand everything like I'm doing - it didn't make sense at this stage of the process - so I was like, "I don't know what could you say to me," because he was really quite anxious, but then you got into a situation where he got angry at me, he saw I was behaving like this and he said "Listen, you know, this doesn't mean anything, but this is what happens," and the next time I would do that, I was in a period of high anxiety, and he had a friend who had a friend who looked out the window, and he saw me holding my head and he said, "You know what? You don't have to tell me that you're doing this because you want to let down your guard just to be able to talk about it. Just talk about it,
