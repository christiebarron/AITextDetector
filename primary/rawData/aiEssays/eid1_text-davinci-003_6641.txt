Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. In this technological era, computers have become a crucial part of our lives, helping us to do everyday tasks and attain information quickly. However, there is a downside to their use: computer addiction can take over lives and stunt a person's social, emotional, and physical development.

From my perspective, computers can cause users to neglect necessary human contact and suffer consequences such as loneliness and alienation from society. They can also lead to unhealthy habits, such as sitting in front of a screen for hours on end and developing poor eyesight from long exposure to a monitor. Additionally, neglected social skills can create difficulty in forming real-world relationships with family and friends.

The ill effects of computers need to be taken seriously and addressed with practical solutions. For instance, setting limits on computer use, making time to engage in physical activity, and having face-to-face conversations with family and friends can significantly help enhance a person's life and relationships. 

As computer use continues to escalate, it is imperative that we recognize the potential harms of staying glued to the computer screen and put the necessary measures in place for the benefit of everyone.

Sincerely,
