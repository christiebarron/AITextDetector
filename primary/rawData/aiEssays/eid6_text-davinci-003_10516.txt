Between the years of 1931 and 1932, the construction of the Empire State Building presented an array of obstacles that had to be overcome in order to create the world's tallest building. One of the most fascinating obstacles was the efforts to allow for the docking of dirigibles, or airships, at the upper levels of the building. In The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the many obstacles associated with this feat of engineering are discussed in detail.

At the time of the building's construction, dirigibles were large, sophisticated, powerful airships, which had been in use for transportation and commerce for many years. Desiring to make the Empire State Building the most modern building of its time, the Manhattan investors decided to include a mooring mast to the top of the building which could potentially allow these ships to dock.

The construction team faced a number of obstacles in this endeavor, with the necessity of maintaining the structural security of the building at all costs being paramount. The team had to consider how a weight three times the weight of a load of one hundred passengers could be safely supported by the mast. Additionally, they had to create an airflow and air pressure system within the dock. It was also necessary to include landing and guidance mechanisms, since dirigibles did not have brakes to slow them down. In order to handle these and other requirements, the team designed a collective system of steel mooring fixtures, stabilizing fin keels,
