The cyclist is seen riding through a mountainous forest, so the terrain of this landscape is not ideal for a cyclist. The winding road is surrounded by tall trees and is narrow, making it difficult to maneuver. The mountain is steep, the curves tight, and the road littered with small stones, which makes it even more difficult for the cyclist to make it up and down without much difficulty.
