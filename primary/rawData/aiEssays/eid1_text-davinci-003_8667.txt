I was sitting in my friend's room when they announced a lockdown due to the pandemic. My friend and I were both trying to make the best with the situation. We decided to stay connected and hang out every day through video chats.

One day we were discussing our memories from our last trip abroad when my friend started to laugh uncontrollably. I was confused at first until he told me what he found so funny. We had both been carrying a lot of stress due to the lockdown and suddenly, here we were, sitting in our respective homes, still actively making hilarious memories. 

I started to laugh with him, and soon enough our laughter filled my room. It was such a wonderful moment, like the tension in the room had suddenly evaporated, replaced with an instant of shared joy. We still laugh about that moment each time we talk, and it always reminds me of how laughter can be the shortest distance between two people.
