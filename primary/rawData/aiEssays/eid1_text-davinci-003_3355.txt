To the Editor:

As technology advances, computers are becoming more and more accessible, and their influence on our lives has grown in recent years. Some argue that computers have made life easier and improved our quality of life. I, however, believe that computers have had an overwhelmingly detrimental effect on people and should be used less often.

While computers can be used for many helpful tasks, they have proven to be distracting and have caused people to be less communicative, especially in young people. We now find ourselves glued to screens, not interacting with friends or family. Our non-verbal interactions are reduced, leading to an overall decrease in personal communication.

Additionally, computers have caused people to turn away from physical activity. Our reliance on computers to complete tedious tasks has caused us to be more sedentary and less active, causing our overall health to suffer.

Finally, computers have made us more susceptible to mistakes and poor decision-making. With computers and the internet becoming increasingly more accessible, information can be easily manipulated and false claims can be spread.

For these reasons, I believe that computers should be used less often. Instead of relying on computers to do our work, we should use them as a convenient supplement
