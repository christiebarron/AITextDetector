Dear Editor,

As an avid reader and contributor of your paper, I wanted to take a moment to add my opinion on the effect computers have on people. In my opinion, computers can serve both as a powerful tool for creativity and a powerful form of distraction.

The deeper one delves into creative endeavors on the computer, the more creative the results can be. People can write, design, and program in ways that were unfathomable in generations past. An artist no longer needs to rely solely on the physical process of painting a canvas. A musician no longer needs a room full of instruments. Now that computers are so accessible, anyone can create art and music from the comfort of their own home.

But, of course, with the benefits of computers come the risks of distractions. Social media platforms, streaming services, and games can be so enticing and immersive that it’s easy to lose track of time online. It’s important to find the balance between technology and living life offline.

Overall, I believe computers have made a huge impact on our lives. By maintaining a good balance of creative use and mindful limits, we can use computers to great effect.

Thank you for your consideration,
