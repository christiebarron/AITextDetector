I have a vivid memory of the first time I laughed with my husband. We had been married for a couple of months and although we were deeply in love, nothing at that point seemed particularly funny. We were out for a stroll to a nearby park when I stumbled into a puddle and somehow ended up with mud smeared all over the back of my pants. I must have looked quite the sight with my dressy shoes and mud-stained attire.

My husband knew that I was embarrassed beyond belief so instead of laughing, he gave me a concerned and sympathetic look. But then I started to laugh. Before long, my husband joined me in laughter as we made our way to the park, dripping mud in our wake. It was the moment I realized laughter was the secret sauce in our relationship.

Since that day, laughter has been a constant in our relationship. It's the shortest distance between us. We joke about our lives, share silly inside jokes and never miss an opportunity to make the other person smile. 

By finding humor in our shared situations, we have created a bond that transcends time and space.
