Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. Below, a summary of some of the characteristics that are used to determine what mode you want when on your route.

In general, they will increase speed even when there are fewer people and a higher number of people will usually still go.

By the time the cyclist reaches the end of the lane, his speed will usually be very slow for a cyclist. He may hit the brakes as the brake levers are held down with no effort on his part. However, it is important that he does this quickly so he has time to turn around and be properly positioned to stay in front of the road. The cyclist does not need to rush to get out of the lane before he has time to make good contact with the edge of the road.
