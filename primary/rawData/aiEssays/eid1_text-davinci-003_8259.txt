The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock, the most notable being the extreme difficulty of mooring a huge, cumbersome airship floating in the sky. The task of docking a dirigible at the Empire State Building was revolutionary, making it highly ambitious. The project was ambitious enough to be risky; it had to be carefully planned and thoroughly tested in order to ensure success.

The biggest obstacle was the need for a mooring mast tall enough to bed the large dirigible. The Empire State Building was opened in 1931, and the mooring mast was built five years after its official opening in 1936. The mooring mast had to be incredibly sturdy and strong; it was made of steel that was three-and-a-half inches thick, and rose 601 feet above the 86th floor. The mast was one of the most ambitious parts of the project, and took about four months to plan, build, and install.

The actual mooring of the dirigible was no less of a challenge. To be successfully docked, the dirigible had to be maneuvered until its hull was level to the Empire State Building. This proved to be difficult, as the dirigible had to be stabilized in the wind and at an altitude of around 700 feet while being accurately maneuvered. Skilled dirigible pilots were required to be able to master the maneuvering with skill and grace. The process also included a
