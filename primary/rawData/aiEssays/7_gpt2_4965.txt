An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when they used to write poetry in French. I was reading a book during my break time that I'd never heard of yet decided to find a copy of the book. When I mentioned this I would usually be asked to take a photo and then take a picture the next day. One day I had been given instructions to send it back to them, after which I wouldn't have had a place to finish and I'd never received it a second time in a month. I felt the shame of the fact I'd never receive the book and was only going to be asked to fill this out if I really needed one. This is how I learned about self-published works and what was a possibility for one of these things to change my everyday life. The end result was an amazing poem and an incredible story about an entire human race that was changed forever.

And I've enjoyed doing an amazing job with a very dedicated staff of great writers and designers that do a wonderful job of keeping up with the time (even getting paid) and doing what I love. It's a small bit of personal freedom that many of you may take to find the time to get into writing for your own personal or commercial purposes, but I promise this will never change my entire life for me. And the goal is that I enjoy each and every day that I write, and feel good about that.

Do you ever wonder why we are all so
