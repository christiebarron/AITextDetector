Dear Editor,

I am writing to state my opinion on the effects of computers on people. I believe that, while computers may have some negative effects, the overall impact they have on our lives is overwhelmingly positive.

The use of computers has greatly increased our access to information and communication. With just a few clicks, we can access virtually any type of information available in the world. We can also communicate with people around the globe, easily connecting with friends, family members and colleagues from all over the world.

In addition, computers have had a huge impact on our economy. They have helped to drive a vast array of industries, from entertainment to medical technology, manufacturing to retail, and much more. They have also reduced the cost of many basic goods and services, helping to make everyday life much easier and more affordable.

Yes, computers can have some negative effects. It's true that some people become overly dependent on them, and may suffer from psychological or physical health problems as a result. However, the risks are far outweighed by the potentially life-changing positive effects computers can have on our lives.

I encourage readers of your newspaper to consider the various positive effects computers have had on our society in order to fully understand how powerful this technology can be.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
