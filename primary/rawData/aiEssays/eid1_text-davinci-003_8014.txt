The Empire State Building is one of the world's most iconic structures, known for its mammoth stature and lush Art Deco skyline. The building is also remembered for its unique engineering history; it was the first skyscraper to have a rooftop docking mast, allowing dirigibles to moor off the top of the building. However, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a great many difficulties in allowing dirigibles to dock, which are explored in Marcia Amidon Lüsted's book, "The Mooring Mast".

The greatest hurdle in allowing dirigibles to dock was the sheer scale of the construction project. The Empire State Building was built in the 1930s, a time when dirigible-style airships, such as the ones intended to dock at the mast, were still relatively new and unknown. While much of the airship technology and design had already been established by the time the Empire State Building was constructed, the building was much bigger than any other airship dock. As Lüsted explains, "The height of the Empire State Building required special consideration in the designing of the docking mast, for the size of the mast alone posed great engineering challenges." 

The builders of the Empire State Building also had to contend with the volatile New York City weather. As Lüsted points out, the airship mooring was especially difficult to handle in gale-force winds: "the wind factor was particularly difficult to overcome, as the turbulent
