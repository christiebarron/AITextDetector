I was out to dinner with my partner, and the restaurant was especially lively that night. Music was playing and people were chatting, but it was the sound of laughter that really stood out. Looking over at my partner, I saw him smiling and laughing with an infectious air of joy.

I couldn't help but smile back and soon I was joining in the joy. Suddenly, I noticed that the laughter around us had grown louder, and when I looked around I saw that everyone was sharing stories and jokes and the restaurant was full of lighter hearts. 

We cracked jokes and shared stories for what felt like hours, and each time my partner and I laughed together the intensity of it only increased. Before I knew it, people were clinking their glasses and giving us toasts just for our laughter!

Although we don't remember what we said that night, I can still remember so vividly the feeling of the laughter travelling through the room, bringing us all together. Laughter truly is the best medicine, and I'm sure it brought us closer together as well.
