Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

1) The 'Traffic and Vehicle Sorting' function is a great example of what is possible. The more of traffic the better. You can often see a number of people speeding along the way in these settings for different reasons (like too few passengers, the small number of vehicles in 'Trash Island' etc).

2) If you have a traffic signal in your main area, then this should be used. The less people on the roads, the better the signal. If you don't have to do this at all, then it's best simply to leave traffic in 'trash islands', even if it means changing lanes!

3) Traffic at all of the areas of a city is generally fairly normal and not as high risk as in the general area.

4) If you want to reduce the chance that you may go through congestion, this is the easiest way to do so.

5) The Traffic Sorting function also has its own effects, as long as the data is fairly large.

6) In general, this setting makes the traffic more efficient. If you find your bicycle to be congested, for example, then you've probably got to keep it in place, for more than one ride.
