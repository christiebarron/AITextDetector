An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the two friends who were getting into a car accident when they got out. I can think of seven other times I've experienced that lung accident - but this time, at least one did not die. I couldn't imagine being in that accident without the help of the community, the volunteers. I hope to keep going that way, with the help of each community's people, in every way.

I thank all of the community for taking on this task. The community has been extremely supportive, with their help. Every person in a hospital stays in the hospital for 2 hours. Your staff will be there and they will help you. Every little bit of help will go a long way in helping to keep the community on track. Thank you to everyone at www.misfitfusion.com. A fantastic effort is made there every day. Thank you to the other community in my life I have called friends and colleagues to share with me, to give their all, and to offer me a way to keep my job. Thank you very much to all of you who keep making this community a better place. I'm honored to have you on my team. Thank you, Mark (Mr. Fink),
