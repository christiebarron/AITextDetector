The idea of constructing a tall building with a mast at the top for dirigibles to dock is one that seemed quite ambitious back in the late 1920s, when the Empire State Building was under construction. Despite such ambitions, the project was complicated and fraught with obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building had to confront. These hurdles revolved around safety considerations and technical requirements, causing significant delays.

One of the main issues was the danger posed by the docking process itself. Due to the sheer size and weight of dirigibles, there was a risk that they could crash into the building if landing procedures were not correctly followed. As a consequence, strict safety protocols had to be established, in order to ensure the safe arrival and departure of dirigibles from the Empire State Building. For example, the mooring mast had to be sufficiently strong in order to take the strain of draughting or to bear a crash impact, while sufficient air power was also required to bring the dirigible to a stop.

Complicating matters further were the technical specifications of the building and the dirigible. For example, the exact size and shape of the mooring mast had to be precisely designed, so that it could accept the mooring hooks of the dirigible, while the height and diameter of the floor-to-floor spaces in the building had to be taken into account to ensure that the dirigible had enough clearance when docked. Finally, the location of
