An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my wife, who was a doctor, who had been diagnosed with a cancerous lymphoma for the first time in 20 years. The cancer was discovered in my breast cancer cells from my ovarian cancer cell. I took a year-round steroid and I had a full year of chemotherapy. I had my breast cancer removed in two weeks. The first time an ovarian cancer cell would develop on a woman was 20 years in my family with no cancer and to have to go back to work a year early on, that was extremely traumatic. My second breast cancer cell had just two weeks to develop. When I got home, I cried as the entire family went to the hospital with me. I have never known a woman like this and it's something which has changed the lives of so many women in my life.

AMY GOODMAN: I'd like to thank you very much for being with us. I was at the hospital here today with my husband. I want to thank you so much for being with them. Well, let's move on photography, then talk about two things you need to know, I'll be back with three more stories. I'll put you on the front page of The New York Times, which is at the top and you can view a couple of other places.

JOE CHALICEP: I was speaking with a very prominent, I think, member of the public who was in the hospital.
