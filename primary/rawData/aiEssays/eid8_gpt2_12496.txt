One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I realized that I'd heard the lyrics to "Rise Again" and the theme tune to "Blackwater."

My grandmother was in a car wreck when she was killed in Iraq and my dad was in a helicopter crash there when he was killed fighting Islamic State. One day, I heard a woman shout my name and I immediately knew who that woman was.

One time, I was stuck with a dead body in my bedroom with its head and feet in the garbage can. I thought there was something wrong. I thought maybe I was not the best person I could be, I had so many options:

What should I do?

When she was buried, why would I care about what her soul was like?
