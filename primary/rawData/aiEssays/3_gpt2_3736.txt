Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. It has to feel like your character is about to get off on one of the most boring routes in the world before you actually need to step on the other side so you can start taking some risks. As you try riding on this road, you LGBTQ-focused a lot, so you're definitely going to have a hard time doing it successfully unless it's in the way you want it to be done.


How much did you spend on this route and how many are you planning to ride when you can pick up at other places for those?

For a lot of it we just rolled up three-quarters of a day, and spent a lot of time talking to the locals about cycling. If you want to plan the routes carefully you need to pay attention to the direction of the road.

Are you going to ride this route in a public place as we did this winter, right?

Yes, but really just riding in a public place will make it difficult, as it is a short distance from a lot of other cities. If you do take that route, you're going to have fun and you'll be able to learn something great about doing it in this new town, while not leaving any stone unturned this summer.

A new town just got a lot of people into cycling!

Yes, I know there's been a lot of interest in the route
