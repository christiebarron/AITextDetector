The ambition of those behind the Empire State Building to build the world’s tallest structure and to create a mooring mast for dirigibles was unprecedented in its day. The technology and resources needed to bring this feat to fruition created a string of obstacles for the architects and builders that had to be overcome. In her book The Mooring Mast, Marcia Amidon Lüsted recounts the many challenges the crew had to navigate, all in order to bring the idea of a sky-high mooring to realization.

One of the biggest obstacles the builders faced was the lack of existing infrastructure. While the mooring mast was high on the priority list, other necessary components of the project such as a large airship hangar and communication towers were not heavily planned out. To accommodate the large vessels, the building had to be significantly reworked to provide the necessary support infrastructure. This included resizing windows to accommodate the size requirements of an airship dock, as well as the installation of additional communication towers and glow lights for navigation. 

Furthermore, the dangers posed by bad weather were also a major challenge. High winds and cold temperatures posed a risk to the dirigible’s passengers, and the mooring lines could be irreparably damaged if caught in a strong gust. As a result, the mooring mast was outfitted with additional safety features like a de-icing system and air cushions to prevent the mooring lines from shifting
