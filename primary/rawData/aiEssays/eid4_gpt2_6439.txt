The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it's one of the few books that asks a simple question: Could we live with the worst of all possible outcomes, including nuclear war, if we had the luxury of having one person — and that person — the greatest influence?

The answers are still the same: There will probably be no end to this disastrous event.

The book doesn't ask for a nuclear apocalypse. It only asks for the end of a nuclear apocalypse — it offers the possibility of the world surviving for 10,000 years from now if we choose to.
