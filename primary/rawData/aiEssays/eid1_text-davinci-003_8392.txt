I recently had a great opportunity to witness firsthand the power of patience. I was with my family on a long road trip to Florida. We had been on the road for a while and my kids were getting restless and starting to argue with each other in the backseat. My partner and I had been trying to stay strong and stay positive, but it was becoming increasingly difficult with the kids fighting and bickering.

At that moment, I remembered something my grandmother had said to me many years ago - be patient. So, I took a deep breath and decided to be patient despite my kids' behavior, even if it meant I had to contain my growing frustration. I spoke calmly to my kids and asked them to please stop arguing as it isn't helping us get to our destination any faster. Almost immediately, it had an effect and my kids stopped their fighting and the car rides continued peacefully.

This experience really showed the power of patience and how it can be so effective in calming tense situations. I felt proud of myself for listening to my grandmother’s advice and for being patient with my kids, even when it wasn’t easy.
