I remember one time when I was out shopping with my mom and we got to the checkout line. We waited in line for what felt like forever, since the person before us seemed to have about 20 items and was taking a long time to pay for them. Although I was getting kind of impatient, my mom was very patient. She was talking to me and quietly making jokes about the situation.

Finally, when it was our turn to check out, the cashier made a mistake on the register and had to start over. I could feel my patience running out - even though this wasn't our fault, I was ready to start arguing with the cashier. But my mom touched my arm and shook her head, reminding me to be patient. So I stayed quiet and just waited while the cashier double checked our items and refunded the extra.

In the end, I was happy that my mom stayed so patient throughout the situation. Instead of raging like I wanted to do, she showed me that being understanding and tolerant can sometimes be the best way to handle things.
