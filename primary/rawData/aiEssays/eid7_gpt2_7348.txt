An example of a time someone in my life was patient was being a child. Being the patient of being a child is a blessing in disguise. Being a person is much more complex than simply knowing that it is wrong and so what you do with that information will only be in the best interest of the child. Being patient is the ultimate blessing to yourself before you begin to take those lessons seriously.

My friend's first love was having children. It was a time when she was already trying to raise herself by herself. At one point, something had to teach her to be less like the child she thought she was, and to become really like someone who is just beginning to understand what she is. For years she spent years trying to figure out where she needed to be. And, finally, a friend of ours did exactly that with one of her children:

"What the hell am I supposed to do with her? If anyone had told me that she had a son in high school that she would probably be a big fan of and loving for the rest of her life, I would have killed her immediately. Her life would have now ended in tears."

Not surprisingly, it was the most memorable moment in her life and she was so happy.

That was at the time a childhood dream that would end tragically, but, no matter how much your dream was broken up along the way, you'll always remember all of it.
