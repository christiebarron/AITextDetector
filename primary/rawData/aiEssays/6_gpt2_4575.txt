The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. A number of technical difficulties faced by the builders led the builder to alter the height of the crane on a number of occasions and, in the past, for the use of the crane with a crane operator, to make it slightly too tall.

The design of the Empire State Building included a "stiffness and width" at the ends of the curved steel shafts that created a gap between the curved steel in front of the crane and the more oblong structure on the roof-side windows of the building. The designers made the position so that the curved steel should be in direct contact with the edge of the curved steel, making it easier to hold the doors and other structural elements. Additionally, the roof was more easily supported from the lower level by having a raised railing that provided vertical support for the roof rather than a slightly horizontal floor on the exterior, to provide additional support for the building.

The roof's curved steel was also made by a new addition, the "sloped" roofing. The "sloped" roofing is more rigid than the horizontal steel, increasing lateral support even for stairs. The same technique can be used for the "flat" roofing because of its more prominent and prominent curvature, making the curved steel almost impossible for the builders to work withweek and even for the crane operator to hold, as the design would require.
