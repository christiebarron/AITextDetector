The Empire State Building was one of the most ambitious building projects ever undertaken, and its moored mast presented numerous challenges to the engineers who designed it. Marcia Amidon Lüsted notes in her book The Mooring Mast: The Story of the Empire State Building’s Aerial Colony, that “the construction of a dockable mooring mast on the Empire State Building…was one of the most arduous tasks associated with the building’s completion.” In that article, she lists some of the obstacles the engineers had to overcome: the aerodynamics of tethering a large, heavy airship, the architectural limitations of the building itself, and the need to secure bridges that would safely accommodate passengers while allowing them to enter and exit the airship.

The Empire State Building’s limited accessible roof space and its narrow city streets posed significant problems for the engineers, as they had to build the mooring mast without unsightly scaffolding that would detract from the building’s appearance. To devise a suitable support structure, the engineers had to look to existing bridges in Europe for inspiration, eventually designing a network of ropes and cables that could accommodate a large airship.

The aerodynamics of mooring a large airship to the Empire State Building’s mast proved to be a particularly challenging problem. Airships needed stable, resistant moorings due to their size and weight, yet the Empire State Building’s
