I'll never forget the day my husband, John, and I laughed so hard we nearly fell over!

We were out for a walk in the park on a bright sunny day. Birds were singing all around us and it was peaceful and lovely. Suddenly, a pink balloon landed right in front of us. We were both amused, but John, being the mischievous one of us, immediately started chasing it. The balloon flew over the grass and rolled down small hills and we followed. We both laughed as if this was the most amusing game ever played.

John was persistent in his efforts to catch the balloon and eventually he did. By that time his face was glowing red from all the running and laughing. We hugged each other from the joy of the moment. When he presented me with the pink balloon I couldn't contain my laughter any longer and soon we were both bent in half, tears streaming down our faces, proud of our ridiculous adventure.

To this day, when we look back on our memory we can't help but chuckle and ironically soon after that, we got the bright pink balloon framed and hung it in our living room as a reminder of that beautiful day when laughter brought us even closer together.
