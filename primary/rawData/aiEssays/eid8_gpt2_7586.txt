One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my friend wrote a book that was about the '70s, and it made me laugh so I kept laughing until I remembered what one of my favorite writers said about it.

I am not the writer to make fun of, but I've had many instances where people are making fun of me or making fun of my writing. This has happened to me once. One morning I would like to do an interview with an actress about the next time she's dead. Her answer for me was like this: "'Would you think a single thing about the way you look, tell me you feel like you look, tell me you're like, I love you!' I'm pretty sure she's going to fall for this, but at least she will be happy.' "

I also have other times when people are being sarcastic â€“ like when I was listening to the episode of Survivor called "Downton Abbey." In the beginning I really liked it about the women at the bank. But I have come up with a new way to use that word. The word "downton" is an allusion to another word for a woman, of the Virtual Wife.
