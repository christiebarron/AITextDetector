Minfong Ho ends the story with this line because it brings the story full circle and shows how Winter Hibiscus has a sense of hope for the future. The first line of the story is, "I failed the New York State math test again," which shows that the main character has been struggling with the test for quite some time. The ending line serves as a reminder that although Winter Hibiscus has been struggling, she still has the potential to succeed. The reference to the snows melting and the geese returning emphasize that spring always follows winter and is an opportunity to start fresh.
