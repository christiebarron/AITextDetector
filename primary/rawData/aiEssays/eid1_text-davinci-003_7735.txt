Narciso Rodriguez’s memoir, “From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,” is a reflective piece about the author’s journey of self-understanding. While technically a nonfiction piece, Rodriguez’s narrative offers an emotional, often experiential approach to storytelling, creating a feeling of nostalgia and a unique personalness. 

The memoir begins with musicality, setting the mood with the lyrics of songs from the author’s childhood. These immediately invoke the emotion of nostalgia used to poignantly set the stage for the rest of the memoir. Rodriguez also provides vivid descriptions of his family, particularly his matriarchal grandmother, painting her as a powerful figure with warmth and delightful character. These vivid descriptions create a homely atmosphere that embraces the readers, turning them into visitors.

The memoir is often described as nonlinear, as the author explores themes of family, identity, and history on an emotional journey of self-consciousness. Rodriguez’s lyrical prose and poetic flourishes of imagery create an atmosphere of loneliness, mostly due to the way Rodriguez tries to make sense of the past. His stories about his childhood explore notions of identity, belonging, and legacies, and how they are built from remnants of the past.

Throughout the memoir, Rodriguez also conveys a feeling of loss and mourning as he attempts to reconcile with his complex emotions. This creates a somber yet introspective atmosphere
