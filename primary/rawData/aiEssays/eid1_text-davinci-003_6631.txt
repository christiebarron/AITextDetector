Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. As technology continues to evolve, the use of computers increases significantly in todayâ€™s world. With this rapid growth and advancement, it is essential to consider the consequences this technology may have on individuals.

With the access to expansive amounts of information, computers have a positive effect on our lives in many ways. It allows us to simplify everyday tasks, improve our efficiency, and gain knowledge at a greater speed. Computers offer numerous advantages to our lives and learning.

At the same time, it is essential that computers are not relied upon too heavily. People can become too dependent on computers, disregarding the value of developing personal skills and abilities. This causes problems when computers make mistakes, and people are unable to effectively solve the problem without a computer.

Overall, computers greatly improve our lives when managed properly. I believe the use of computers should be limited and that people should learn to think for themselves and develop skills to use when faced with difficult challenges. I urge you to consider the effects of computer use on people and to continue advocating for the principles of self-sufficiency and personal development. 

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
