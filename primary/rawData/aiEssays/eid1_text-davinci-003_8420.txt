I had just been hired to work as a customer service representative for a tech company. On my first day of work, I realized that the job was going to involve a lot more technical knowledge than I expected. I had a hard time understanding the concept and the more the company tried to explain it to me the more confused I became. 

My co-workers could obviously see I was struggling and they were sweet enough to try to help me. As the day went on, it became clear that I wouldn't be able to learn the material that day, so I started feeling really discouraged. It could have been easy for my co-workers to give up on me and treat me like I wasn't worth their time, but instead they were surprisingly patient with me. 

One of the IT managers in particular was especially patient with me and took the time to sit down with me and explain the basics of the job over and over again until I finally understood. His patience was incredible and I'm so grateful that he spent so much one-on-one time with me. 

It was a great example of how being patient and taking the time to help others can truly make a difference.
