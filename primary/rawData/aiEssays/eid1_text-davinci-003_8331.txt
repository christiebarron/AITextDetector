I remember the time where my little brother and I were on a long car ride. He was being a typical sibling--talking loud, whining, and overall being a little terror. Now, I can get a bit impatient when it comes to him, so usually I get irritated and snap--not very nice of me. 

But, this time was different. I took a few deep breaths to keep my patience. I remembered that he was only five years old and a long car ride was probably not the best situation for him. I turned down the radio and instead of raising my voice, I calmly asked him what he wanted to play. 

We ended up playing a few car games and singing songs to pass the time. He was happy, I was patient, and we both had a fun time.
