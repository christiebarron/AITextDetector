The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it begins to explore the possibility that the very thing that it explores may be a lie. The book's author, H.A. King (d. 1946 -- now professor of philosophy of Science and Technology at the University of Massachusetts), has never addressed the question of whether or not such "fact Amen", when considered as a "substance", is "a lie", rather than the truth, but just the possibility.

The novel ends with King offering a simple one, that the truth is "the absolute belief of the majority", and King confessing his guilt.

In the end you are free to make the argument that H.A. and his ilk are really living in a world of lies, and the truth cannot be found at the top of the hill.

"Why do you believe I say so?".


For the first time and only once you hear H.A. in a situation like that (and in a situation where he was alive at the time he was told the truth) the author admits that HG seems guilty - he knows how to play a game, but isn't sure how to play it properly.

In one memorable episode of HG's "An Inconvenient Truth?" series, a reporter asks H.A. to explain, in his new "Amen" TV novel, why he'd want to tell the truth. That's not in the book,
