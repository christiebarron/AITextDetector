In "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski, the cyclist is facing off against the geographic features of the setting, which significantly affect the cyclist in both their journey and the overall outcome. The rugged landscape presents multiple obstacles and challenges for the cyclist to conquer, as each feature creates a different demand on the rider. 

The high altitudes of the mountain presents the challenge of cycling up steep inclines, often requiring an extra effort from the cyclist in order to make it to the top. This is further demonstrated in the short story, when the cyclist is forced to pause to catch their breath multiple times before making it to the summit. The change in climate is also a factor, as the higher altitudes present colder temperatures and, in some cases, less oxygen. The cyclist must work to adjust to the climate in order to keep up their stamina and avoid icy winds, which eventually tire out the rider. 

The roads also present a challenge for the cyclist, as they meander and often deviate from the route previously taken. In one particular scene, the cyclist, in a rush to find his way back on track, must navigate his way through a rough and rocky road. This often presents an extra effort and risk to the cyclist, as the rocky surface can often cause them to lose their balance and risk a fall. The cyclist must therefore take extra precaution when navigating these roads in order to avoid a spill.
