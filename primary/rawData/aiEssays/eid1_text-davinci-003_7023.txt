It is important to consider both the right of individuals to access information and the implied responsibility of those that provide such materials to ensure a safe environment. It is difficult to objectively determine which materials should be made available and which should be censored, and it is equally important that a semblance of balance is struck.

Materials that incite violence, hatred, or discrimination can be dangerous, and therefore should be removed if found in the library.
