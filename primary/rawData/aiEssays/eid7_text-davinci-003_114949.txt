I was in line at the store, on my way to purchase a last-minute gift for my sisterâ€™s birthday. It was already late, but I wanted to get my sister something special. Suddenly the line began moving very slowly, and I could see that the person in front of me was struggling with a complicated purchase.

My first thought was to get frustrated and impatient. I looked at the clock and sighed loudly, but I reminded myself that being patient was the right thing to do. I shifted my focus and thought about how much my sister would appreciate the gift I was getting her.

As the minutes passed, I kept my cool and struck up a conversation with the person in front of me. It turns out we had a lot in common, and before I knew it, we were both done with our purchases and on our way.

My patience that day paid off, and my sister was delighted with the gift. In the end, I was glad that I had taken the time to stay patient and take a deep breath before I had let my impatience get the best of me.
