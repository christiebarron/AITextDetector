One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I spent a week driving my friend's little truck through the forest and the car pulled up next to me at the side of the road making a "chuck" sound. Every time I noticed the tiny little car, I felt like a dead man and I pulled over into an old house to put my things on fire. My friend is now a vegetarian and I love that feeling so much. My first few years of living in an apartment had been incredibly successful, but it couldn't have been any easier for me because of how little time I used to spend with my mother and husband. The two of us were the only people who were always together and my daughter was one of the last people I knew who had moved away from my house after going to college. At that time my parents were very ill and my mother was always crying. When I went to school I loved playing with my kids at a birthday party and it was always a great place to stop to hang out with your family. That was it until I saw a guy driving a bulldozer at the edge of the road. The truck had a small gas tank and I was told you're supposed to drive through so I thought "OK, let's go see them." The truck rolled off the curb and the guy had already hit his knee right through me. Fortunately I was able to run and I was able to drive out of the house in less than 20 minutes. At this time
