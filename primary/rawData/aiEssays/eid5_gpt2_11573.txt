The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' at the end of the series — a quiet moment or moment when one can be free to do what little one does without thinking about the other who is being silenced — is what I like best to remember for this first episode: When 'From Home is' finally airs, the people who have gone through it still have a lot to learn from the whole thing.

And when we do it for these people, we come home to what may be the most profound and most important piece of the story — that our lives were founded on the idea that our lives weren't just some arbitrary thing, that we were all living very differently and that our lives began out of sheer ignorance, self-discipline, and a sense of belonging. To think about the lives of the people who were first introduced to 'From Home' and the lives they experienced in the real world, it's very revealing. I want to say this with more conviction that a sense of belonging is very important.

With a love that often makes me shudder at the thought that my character might not have been the best person for going to college, and it's hard to imagine a better way for me to describe my feelings for the people who came before me, I think this episode should inspire me to go beyond the simple words, 'I wish I knew what a person was like.' I'm just going to hope this is done as soon as possible.
