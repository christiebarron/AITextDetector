I was recently working with someone who was new to my team. She was obviously nervous and struggling to understand her role and all the processes we were using. While it would have been easy for me to just get frustrated or try to hurry her along, I chose to be patient. I knew she was doing her best and wanted to be helpful, so I went out of my way to explain things as clearly as possible. I took the time to answer her questions and review her work as needed. I could tell she appreciated my patience - eventually, she started to feel more confident in her role and really thrived. My patience paid off and was worth the extra effort.
