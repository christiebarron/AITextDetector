She said her journey with 'From Home,' which was directed by her daughter, has taken her life from emotional turmoil, depression and anxiety into her own life.

Her journey began in 2013, with her mother, who had dementia, in the throes of trying to find solace in her son.

Ms. Paz said she found solace in her son, who was diagnosedayne. After an incident in 2013 as a toddler and later after years of struggle with schizophrenia, he started using psychedelics and eventually became adept at painting drawings, she said.

"It got to the point now," Ms. Paz said, "when I had to go to someone for help. I saw someone I didn't want to go. I felt that just after that we all changed and I'm going to do the same thing for kids."
