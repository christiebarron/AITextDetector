The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, the design of the buildings did not allow for a view of objects directly behind the scenes and could not prevent the view-screen from changing, which hindered space exploration. Second, the building faced a steep slope, which made the view for small space objects more challenging. Finally, all the building had a vertical wall. The Empire State Building has not yet been redesigned to accommodate the many new building types.

The Empire State building has also never been used in the construction of movie stars. The only known Star Trek reference for the building goes to a Star Trek episode, "Star Trek: The Next Generation," in which we see the Romulan Empire State Building at the end of its story arc.

"The Empire State Building"

The Empire State Building (from left to right) is said to be a large building from Star Trek and contains most information about the Star War between the Federation and the Empire State of New Eden. (TNG: "An Inconvenient Truth", "Lieutenant Commander IV", "Lieutenant Commander V" and "Lieutenant Commander VI")

The Empire State Building features several large, curved wooden seats, along with three doors to the back that open into an elevator that is connected to the lower right corner of the building. Its upper floors are also covered by steel. (TNG: "The Naked Now")
