I'm a single mother of two children. My youngest has a special condition and requires a lot of extra care. I'm used to difficult days where I'm so busy chasing after her that I don't even have a chance to rest. 

Recently she had one of her hardest days yet. She was so uncontrollable and kept throwing her toys and running off. My other child was trying their best to help, but their patience started to wear thin. I was getting close to the breaking point too, but I was determined to keep my cool.

I took a few deep breaths and reminded myself to stay patient. I resisted my natural urge to yell and instead calmly guided my children through the episode. I asked them to take turns cuddling her, to let her know she wasn't alone. Eventually, the storm passed and both children were exhausted, but felt loved and safe. 

At the end of the day, I was so proud of myself for having the strength to remain patient. That experience taught me the importance of staying calm and not letting my emotions get the best of me.
