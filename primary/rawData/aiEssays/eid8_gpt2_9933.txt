One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was driving to my job, I noticed a very specific group on the highway in front of a gas pump that was about to do some work, suddenly my head was spinning. I felt nauseous, I was nauseous all the time. The minute the gas started, the feeling faded away. If I'm reading this story right now, you can't understand how that occurred, at least I didn't know it. People aren't always thinking that way, but my friends can't seem to figure it out. They feel, as if they've gone through a physical pain, that they were physically tortured and I tried so hard not to believe it. The way I felt was, if he's a man, he's a woman, and in this moment, I was on steroids with an adrenaline drug, and while my head was spinning, he was screaming that the gas was going to happen and I had to do something. He didn't seem to understand, but I told him, "I have to do something." I took him back. He was very frightened for his life, and in my view, that's what led him to believe that the gas would come, and he thought that his life just didn't end. He had to kill to survive. But he wasn't there as quickly as I could have predicted. Because of this, I've been writing more and more about the trauma, about what it means to be human
