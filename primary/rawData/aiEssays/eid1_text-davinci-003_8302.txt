Once, I was at a grocery store when the line for the checkout was especially long. I was in a hurry because I had to pick up my little brother from school, but I didn't let this frustration show. Instead, I took a deep breath and quietly waited my turn. 

When I finally got up to the register, the cashier was having technical difficulties with the machines. I was tempted to get impatient, but I reminded myself that everyone has bad days and that getting worked up wouldn't do any good. I was patient and understanding as the cashier tried again and again to fix the issue. 

Thankfully, the systems eventually worked again, and I was able to pay for my groceries and be on my way. I was proud of myself that day for having such patience, for it isn't always an easy thing to maintain.
