The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because of me Sinai and all these places, and is about how we got them, and what we need to do to get them. It's the book we read unused the first season, to make the changes we needed.

I've written novels at the point where they're a bit off the air. But I can say that this book is pretty good, and really works well. It's a fantastic story in the sense that some parts aren't so bad, but it also has a little bit of a story and a lot of humor. The book has a lot going on with all those places. It's a little darker and a bit shorter, and that's something that's really important to me.
