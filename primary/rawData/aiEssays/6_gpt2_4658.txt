The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, engineers did not anticipate the mounting of a heavy steel column during construction. This would create a large obstacle and cause an emergency rescue. Two attempts were made to make heavy columns in 1956 and 1957. This was the first attempt at having a large column mounted over a low surface. (I have quoted both proposals to avoid mounting the columns which would have caused a large fire by accident. Both proposals seemed feasible because both failed, and the latter was based on a design for a single column and a large column from the same building.) The second attempt resulted in two columns mounted on a small rock column (no height limit was included in the proposal for the columns.) These were not considered for erection until the height limit was reached, in order to ensure rapid erection of columns at this point. The first attempt involved two columns mounted over each other and a large column. This would not have been adequate for high concrete pressure. This required further effort to overcome the problems of uneven ground around the column mounts and to minimize possible damage to the columns by sudden drops. The second attempt involved four columns mounted over each other only in order to keep the columns from rolling, making a sudden fall possible. (The four columns were a part of the original and one anatomy had to be reworked during the project.) The cost was estimated at almost $250,000 and probably would have been in the millions of dollars. (I
