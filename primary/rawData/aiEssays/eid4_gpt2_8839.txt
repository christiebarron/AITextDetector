The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because he uses its name to suggest there's some serious danger in living up to the title. In the book's first chapter, he writes, "I, my lover, am sick of lying." That's it. He's a bit more like John Lennon. There's not much in the way of a much-needed book.

What readers can expect is the kind of story that's easy for most people to pick up on. It's written for writers who've previously worked in novel format, but in the current era, some folks need to be able to read their own work in book form over and over in novel form in a timely fashion. I'm guessing many readers who read Winter Hibiscus, which I know by heart, are starting to put much effort into.
