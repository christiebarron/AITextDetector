One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I found myself talking to an imaginary person.

I mean, who could have known? I can't tell you why. As a kid growing up, my family told me that funny voices could be a good sign of depression. They even said they found them at school. But by the time I started attending school, I grew far more aware of the voices in my head. I remember sitting in class and watching comedians' jokes.

Not at all since I was about 7 in high school, I went to all the shows to see people who were so funny. At the end of the show, one guy mentioned in a bad way that laughter should have happened sooner or later to a funny character, so there was always a good-natured laughter to enjoy. And every show has different jokes, but I could watch them all in person.

I still don't know where I was in high school when I first heard about the comedy show. I remember a friend of mine saying that it was like watching someone watch another person laugh while they was talking.

Now I'm writing a book that will teach what that is, and in doing so will make it more likely for any laughter to be funny.
