Dear Editor,

As technology advances, our reliance on computers becomes increasingly undeniable. From communication to entertainment, our lives are forever changed by this powerful machine. But what effect does it have on people?

At first, the use of computers can be beneficial. Students can extend their knowledge beyond the boundaries of the physical classroom, businesses can automate many tedious processes, and people can access a world of information at their fingertips.

But the effects are often not all positive. Increased computer usage often leads to health issues such as eyestrain, carpal tunnel syndrome, and fatigue; without limits, people can quickly become addicted. Computers can also lead to decreased productivity for some; plenty of time can be wasted when the only activity is browsing the internet or playing video games.

I believe the key to using computers effectively is moderation. Balance screen time with physical activities, allow yourself periodic breaks, and prioritize activities to ensure that the most important tasks are completed. With this balance, computers can become a powerful tool used to the benefit of all.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
