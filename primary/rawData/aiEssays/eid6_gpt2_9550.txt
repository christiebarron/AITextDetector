The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

One such obstacle is that in order to allow them to dock, they need to run in a special vertical line that runs under a concrete fence.

The problem may get worse if the builders need to use a huge tunnel from the ground below to allow them to drop off some objects they are holding. The underground tunnel underneath holds almost all of the material needed to drop one of the large numbers of metal rods that are used to make up the building.
