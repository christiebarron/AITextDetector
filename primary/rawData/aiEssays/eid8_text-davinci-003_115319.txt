I remember the time my best friend and I had a really good laugh. It was during the summer holidays, and we'd recently gotten our licenses and decided to go for a drive around the city.

We were going to meet a few of our friends at a cafe for a movie night, but because of the traffic, we ended up being really late. We were filled with anxiety, but that didn't last long.

As soon as we stopped at a traffic light, my friend started honking and yelling out of his window to the people on the sidewalk. I couldn't believe he was doing this. I didn't know whether to laugh or be embarrassed.

But the next thing I knew, everyone was laughing with us. Even the people walking by were laughing and shouting. It felt so good to just laugh and forget about all the stress we had at the time.

We ended up making it to the cafe in time, and the movie was a great success. We all had a really fun time, and I still fondly remember that night whenever I think about laughter as the best medicine.
