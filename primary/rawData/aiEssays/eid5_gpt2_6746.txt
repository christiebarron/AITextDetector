The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is that as the parents, the kids see themselves as "truly the same" and "one with the future," and "we hope someday to be one."

As the mom of two, I can feel my excitement rising. My excitement is the first to burst out as I realize it. As much as I love how the parents are supportive by leaving their kids, I feel overwhelmed, and confused.

A very emotional book, this book is not about the father's life, nor is it about the kids. It is about the parent's life. But, for me, it shows that one of the great things about a single book is that it exposes a lot of the same themes that are often explored in memoir.

What is your personal story here?

My story is that this book shows that what fathers do, especially young fathers, is not what parents do. Rather, the key to understanding is understanding the importance of fatherhood. How do you grow up with a father who is your father? And the way you grow up with a father who is your Mom's?

Which is a very different idea from how you grew up raising Your Mother.

What is so interesting about Mother? What really resonates with me is that I know what it's like to grow
