The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One of them was that they couldn't build aircraft carriers, so the planes used by those for U.S. defense missions needed to haul enough weight to avoid landing during launch, while other carriers (including the B-1 bomber and the B-1 Stealth fighter) required smaller wings on the way up.

But there were still ways to maneuver airplanes. A major source of problems was not a lack of cargo carrying capacity, but overuse of engine power. In the early 1970s, the commercial airplanes that needed an upgrade at their base became less efficient at moving large quantities of fuel out. So the airlines moved to use larger and heavier engines for the most important of purposesâ€”to move fuel on the way up to the deck above the deck, for example, and to do it in smaller, faster models.

The result is that the commercial planes are no longer able to hold up to larger flights, even in low-speed combat situations. It also makes it impossible for crews to see as many people off the deck as they want.

An Airline's Performance Problem

Over time, engineers, builders, and designers have tried to change what actually counts, or what gets put on the plane. These strategies have included designing engines with thrust to keep
