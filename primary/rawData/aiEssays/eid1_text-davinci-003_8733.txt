I spent an entire weekend with my friends from the dorm and a couple of cousins who had also come to stay with us. We were stacking up for a picnic and laughter was all around us. 

My cousin and I had a running 'polite rivalry' ever since we were kids. We often argued even if we both knew that the other was right and it usually made for some interesting conversations. That particular morning, as we gathered up the food for the picnic, my cousin and I disagreed about something trivial yet again. We started to bicker on about it until we both realized how silly it was. In that moment, we burst out laughing, tears streaming down our eyes.

My friends joined in too, laughing hard at our ridiculous argument and the whole room was filled with contagious laughter. Even when our argument was resolved, we kept on laughing, still enjoying the moment of joy and silliness we all shared.

It was a weekend to remember â€“ nothing else mattered, and we all shared a special bond that day, through laughter.
