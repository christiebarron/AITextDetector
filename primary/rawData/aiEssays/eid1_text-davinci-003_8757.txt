I remember it as if it were yesterday: it was the summer after I had graduated high school. My best friend and I had been discussing our future plans and had just agreed that we would be attending the same college in the Fall. We were so excited that we decided to take a walk around the neighborhood to celebrate.

As we had walked we could not help but crack jokes and laugh. We laughed at even the silliest of things. What started as a casual walk had ended in a two-hour long laughter riot. 

Our laughter grew so loud that it caught the attention of a few passers-by, who just stopped in their tracks and stared in shock. We began to laugh even harder at the attention we were receiving and our laughter only grew in intensity!

At the end of our walk, we were both in tears! That moment taught me an important lesson: that laughter can truly be the bridge between two people, and also the bond that ties them together for life. I have never forgotten that day and every time I remember it I can't help but smile.
