Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Over the last several decades, computers have become increasingly important tools that have had a profound influence on how we live our lives. Computers have greatly increased our productivity and convenience, leading to more efficiency and ease of use in many tasks.

One of the most remarkable effects of computers is how they have increased our access to knowledge. Through computers, we can now access vast amounts of information that would have been impossible to access otherwise. This has allowed us to learn more and become more informed citizens, enabling us to understand and participate in important issues in our society.

Another positive effect computers have had on people is how they have allowed us to communicate more easily with others. Computers facilitate communication between people who would not have been able to communicate before. This encourages a more open and civil public discourse and can promote the sharing of ideas and resources.

Finally, computers can be a great source of entertainment. With computer games and other forms of digital media, people can relax, interact, and have fun in ways that were not available to previous generations.

In conclusion, computers have had a significant impact on our lives,
