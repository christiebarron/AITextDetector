I remember one time I was on an airplane, and I had to sit next to a particularly loud and annoying person. He talked loudly on the phone and kept repeating the same story over and over again to anyone who'd listen. I was getting increasingly frustrated, but I was determined to stay patient and polite. I tried to focus on my own conversation and eventually the person got off the plane. As he left I said "Have a safe flight." Even though it was difficult to remain patient, I wanted to show him that I still had respect and kindness towards him.
