The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is akin to a siren bell. At times we are faced with fear and desperation, wondering if the world is going to end. But it is in it for the best. Some sections of The Road to Ruin, one of the finest of all, have an unpretentious approach. Perhaps the title suggests a deep sense of unease, but the story is always very much about the ending. We must escape, and try to return to living and working life. There is a sense that our lives have, like our dreams, an uneasy purpose to carry on. For in some ways I can relate to the despair and hopelessness of the people of The Road to Ruin and it gives me real joy. As for The Road to Ruin's themes of betrayal and the inevitability of our suffering and failure, the book tells us to hope, to hope that the world will end. It also wants us to get out and make it real. We face many obstacles as well as difficulties to overcome. But that really helps us get out alive. In a way. I love writing, I love to see how others struggle and that's one reason for trying to do it. But I am also trying to make the book a place to go. I think readers would like an adventure that takes life, love, and happiness. I'm hoping my story will inspire others to do so.
