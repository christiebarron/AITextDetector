Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. As technology becomes increasingly vital to society and modern life, computers have become indispensable tools in both our personal and professional lives.

While computers can be incredibly helpful in preparing to face the work day, they can also lead to a decreased mental and emotional wellbeing. The reliance on computers to manage our lives can lead to stress, social isolation, and physical impairments. People are so focused on their laptops and screens, they become less active and isolated, forgetting to socialize in both real and digital ways. With fewer opportunities to engage with others, people become more vulnerable to loneliness, depression, and anxiety.

Furthermore, too much time spent in front of a computer screen, often accompanied by long bouts of sitting, can lead to chronic pain, cervical spine and back pain, and obesity. Without computers, individuals may be forced to step away from their screens, reconnect with those around them, and, most importantly, find some peace and joy in the real world.

In conclusion, I believe computers have the potential to have both positive and negative effects on people, depending on how it is used. With proper use, computers can be a great tool, but moderator moderation is key. With a more conscious effort to use computers not as a means of escape, but rather as a tool to enhance our lives, we can ensure its long-term benefits while avoiding ill effects.
