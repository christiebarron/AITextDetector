The setting in Joe Kurmaski's poem, "Rough Road Ahead", clearly affects the cyclist throughout his journey. The poem is set along an old, unpaved road in the middle of a desert. The presence of the desert is one of the most prominent features of the poem, as it reflects the feelings of loneliness, seclusion, and freedom the cyclist experiences as he rides along.

The lack of pavement and the presence of sand makes it a physically difficult journey, as the cyclist must work harder to keep his balance and navigate the rocky terrain. The desert also carries a sense of danger due to the threats of dangerous wildlife such as rattlesnakes and scorpions. This constant sense of danger adds another layer of difficulty to the cyclist's journey as he must face the fear of the unknown.

The desert also limits the cyclist's access to resources. The fact that he is traveling through a desert means that he does not have access to food, water, or any other amenities that might be found on a normal road. This further heightens the feeling of isolation, as the cyclist has to rely on his own resources to overcome any hardships he might face.

The unforgiving environment of the desert thus has a tremendous impact on the cyclist's journey. The cyclist is constantly struggling against the forces of the desert, such as sand and lack of resources, and this struggle reflects the struggles in life. This poem is ultimately a reflection of the importance of perseverance
