I remember when I went on my first date with my now-husband. We had already talked extensively over the phone, so when we met in person, it felt like we had already been friends for years. 

We decided to go to a dinner and a movie, and we started off walking around the city and getting to know each other. We talked about our families, our ambitions, and our favorite books, and it was great getting to know someone so deeply.

Then, at one point during our walk, a gust of wind went by, and my hat flew off. I was frantically trying to catch it, but it was too late. My husband, without missing a beat, picked up the hat and put it back on my head, upside-down.

As soon as he did that, we both burst out in laughter. The sound of his laughter made me giggle even harder, and soon we were both doubled-over, helplessly cackling. We had both put so much pressure on ourselves to make that evening perfect, we found it a huge relief to share a moment of complete absurdity.

It was that moment that I knew this was the man for me. We both still laugh often and for the same reasons, and I'm thankful that He can make me laugh and can always make me smile.
