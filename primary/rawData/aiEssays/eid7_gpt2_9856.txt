An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when they were all pregnant and they were telling me this girl told them not to have such things as a baby. They told me they don't know what to think about this but if they are really trying to help and not caring about this, then it's a big deal.

I am not talking about what is okay. I am talking about what is just okay, what's right, that's just okay for you to have and I think you see that that is the way to take care of yourselves and how you can not have that because right now they seem to go all the way to the next level, whether it is in trying to care more for yourself or more for your family. The kids seem to be the most concerned about you. I think that right now they seem totally overwhelmed with the fact that they're so busy that they just don't care and they don't think that they need to care anymore. They may not realize that their dad is so caring. And then they are just on the brink of having a baby and they are just starting the day and the next thing you know the hospital tells you they were told not to leave your house.
