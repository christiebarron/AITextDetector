 

I had been friends with my colleague, Brandon, for over a year before something inside me clicked and I realized just how much we had in common. Before long, we were spending our free time together, watching movies and hitting up the town for a bite to eat. 

One night, while walking back from the restaurant, we found ourselves discussing our favorite comedy films and getting stuck in a debate over Shaun of the Dead versus Hot Fuzz. We were about evenly matched and both determined to prove our point, when we were throwing out quotes and helping them out with exaggerated movements. We were laughing so hard that I'm sure the people around must have thought we were crazy. 

Eventually, we both gave up and declared a draw. Brandon, in a moment of realization, patted me on the back and said, “You know, I think I'm going to keep you around for a bit.” 

We've been laughing together ever since, and I'm so glad that I found the connection I had been searching for. Laughter has opened so many doors and brought us together in a way that I would have never expected.
