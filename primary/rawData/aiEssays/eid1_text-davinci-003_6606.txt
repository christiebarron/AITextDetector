Dear Editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. I firmly believe that computers have revolutionized the way people work, study, and communicate with each other.

Since the inception of computers, work processes have become much faster, simpler, and smoother. For example, complex calculations that used to take hours to do manually can now be completed in a matter of seconds using a spreadsheet program. Students can now access course materials, textbooks, and other useful resources with the click of a button. Furthermore, communication has become incredibly easier and more efficient, with emails, instant messaging, and video calling allowing people to instantly connect with each other, regardless of distance.

Despite the many advantages computers have brought us, one must not forget that prolonged and excessive use of computers can also have detrimental effects. Too much time spent staring at a computer screen can lead to headaches, back and neck pain, fatigue, and in some cases, even depression. It is important to take regular breaks from technology and adopt a healthy lifestyle.

In conclusion, the intelligent use of computers and other digital devices can be incredibly beneficial, providing us with a whole range of advantages. However, it is equally important to be aware of the potential risk they pose to our physical and mental well-being.

Sincerely,
