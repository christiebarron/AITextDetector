Recently, debates have been raging over the issue of censorship in libraries. While some people argue for certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines to be removed if they are deemed offensive by a certain group of people, I believe it is not only wrong, but counterproductive to take away someone’s right to explore, grow, and learn from different materials.

For starters, I believe that taking away these materials from public libraries will not address the underlying issues of why something might be deemed offensive. Instead, it will only inhibit an individual’s ability to form their own opinion about the material in question. Without having access to the material, an individual can’t make their own decisions and come to their own conclusions. Libraries are a place to explore and develop critical thought, and censorship would take away that right.

I also believe that censorship is a slippery slope. What if something like the Bible or the Quran was seen as “offensive” to a certain group of people? Should we take away those materials from the shelves as well? I do not think it is beneficial to censor materials like that either, as taking away literature and art that may not be agreed upon by everyone runs contrary to the fundamental principles of freedom of expression and freedom of speech. 

Finally, I fear the censorship might be used in a more sinister way. It could be used by certain groups in power to censor materials that go against their ideals,
