The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock from the plans proposed in the 1930s. The main obstacle was the daring idea of “mooring masts” that would raise the ships into the sky as a way to dock them. This type of docking allowed the dirigibles to take off and land without using external anchors or ropes.

In an attempt to overcome this challenge, the engineers behind the project began to design the “Mooring Mast” which would serve as a point of anchorage for the dirigibles up in the air. The mast would extend up from the Empire State Building and have four rings that could be use to secure the dirigibles. The designers also proposed using compressed air to help the dirigibles to dock and the air pressure would be regulated by the central tower. 

Despite these plans, the obstacles faced with this idea were numerous and daunting. First, there were the financial costs associated with building the mooring mast and compressed air system, which were estimated to be about $50,000, and this amount was considered a steep expense for the time. In addition, during storms, high winds, and unpredictable weather conditions, dirigibles could be at risk of crashing due to the difficulty in controlling them. Moreover, the weight of the ship would be a concern when trying to lift or lower it to the mast, and the mast would need to be
