Because they turn left on some roads, it is easy to see why it is possible to run off the wrong side of the road with a bike, and why it is hard to find a good flat area in either the middle of a road or behind a wall.

Rows on the road may be more difficult to hit than on the flat and flat sides of flat roadways. This is why the number of times over which the cyclist turns left on the road increases by 10-15 on one side of the road, the proportion of all the flats to the flat by the other side decreases from 4 to 2 in the area.
