I recently had the opportunity to demonstrate my patience. One day I went to the store to do some grocery shopping. I was running late for a meeting, and when I got to the checkout line, there was only one cashier working. She was helping an elderly woman who was having difficulty deciding which items to purchase and trouble finding her wallet.

I could feel the frustration growing inside of me, but I took a few deep breaths and told myself to remain calm. I decided to give this woman the courtesy and respect she deserved and be as patient as possible. Despite the impatient customers around me, I kept my cool.

Finally, the woman checked out and the line began to move. As I approached the counter with my items, the cashier told me that she was very sorry for the delay. I smiled and said that it was no problem at all, that I had all the time in the world today. She thanked me for being so understanding and patient. 

That day I was proud of myself for modeling grace and patience in the face of a trying situation. It felt good to know that I had put aside my own needs to show kindness and compassion to someone else.
