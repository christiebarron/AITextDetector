Dear Editor,

As computer technology continues to advance and become ubiquitous in our lives, we must consider its impact on our society. With the power of machines an incredible number of tasks can be automated, but it would be a mistake to believe this process does not also come with a potential cost.

First and foremost is the effect computers have on peopleâ€™s jobs. As automation replaces human labor, a wider swath of people are becoming geographically, socially, and economically marginalized. This displacement can create a great deal of social unrest and a sense of hopelessness that can lead to severe consequences.

Furthermore, constant computer use is a detriment to our physical and mental health. For instance, the artificial light emanating from our screens impairs our circadian rhythm and can lower our overall quality of life. Coupled with this, our time spent interacting with these machines can lead to physical and emotional addiction and isolation.

We need to be cognizant of the overall impact computers have on our lives and ensure that it is being put to use in a responsible way. By tying progress with responsibility, we can ensure that our technological advances are beneficial, not only to our society, but to everyone it affects.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
