In 1930, the Empire State Building was an engineering feat of its time – soaring 1,250 feet skyward in the heart of New York City – and captured the imagination of many. However, the original blueprint also included a daring vision for the building itself: allowing dirigibles, or blimps, to dock at its mast peak. It was an unprecedented idea, and the builders of this iconic structure were intent on making it happen.

Unfortunately, the project to build the Empire State Building came with an array of technical and safety obstacles. The challenge was to find ways to safely secure airships with the mast, which entailed two elements: designing a landing system that could catch and hold a dirigible which had never been done before, and designing a lift system to raise and lower people and materials from the ship deck. On top of this, the mast had to survive the turbulence of aviation winds and support the weight of the airships.

The building's engineers worked diligently to address these difficulties. In order to secure the airships, they would need to install strong cables running from the mooring mast to the underside of the dirigible. This would require a cable system that could accurately sense the wind gusts and adjust cables in order to keep tension. The second concern was lifted addressed by retrofitting cable-lock elevators to transport material and personnel between the two levels. This would enable the project to be completed safely and efficiently.
