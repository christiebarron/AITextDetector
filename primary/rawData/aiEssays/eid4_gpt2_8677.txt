The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because you will see the difference between reading it and reading it with others. This is more of a personal experience, because I spent a year writing a couple of books about my life, and I've read and reread this book several times. As far as writing it goes, I'm a huge fan of Robert Greene's writing, and not just because of his style. He has written novels and short stories that are extremely well thought through, and so I felt very comfortable in taking his work and adding a little extra thought into the stories.

Some critics feel the same way. I was so disappointed, and so pleased with Winter Hibiscus, that I didn't really start reading any other books in the next six-plus years before I had the chance to start reading something new. It's not true. I've never read a book by John Coltrane before, and I have to admit I had no trouble writing it even though this book is not an A-list book. I've never read a book by David Lynch before, and I am in love with Lynch's work and the music. So for me it was easy to fall into the category of books I'd rather die on. I don't know if I ever finish a book by someone I've even read.
