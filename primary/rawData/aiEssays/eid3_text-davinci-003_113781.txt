In Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead," the features of the setting help to create a challenging and difficult situation for the cyclist. The cyclist has to travel through the “rugged terrain of a forgotten back road,” and the mountains, cliffs, and forest make the journey especially difficult. The narrow, windy road is particularly treacherous. It curves and dips sharply, making it a challenge to stay on the bike. Furthermore, the terrain shifts constantly, making it difficult to keep a steady speed. 

The setting also has a psychological effect on the cyclist. The dark and oppressive environment of the forest and the aloneness of the journey make the cyclist feel a sense of fear and apprehension. Even though the cyclist has trained for months and undertaken a difficult physical journey, the psychological toll of the winding road is almost as difficult to bear. 

The cyclist is constantly pushed to the limits of physical and mental endurance in order to complete the journey. A combination of the physical danger of the road and the psychological fear of the environment makes the experience particularly challenging, which is why the cyclist is able to draw strength from the difficult journey. Even if the cyclist cannot complete it, the challenge has pushed them to their limits, giving them a sense of accomplishment and pride.
