The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because if it turns out that the book will remain true, I wouldn't want to share it with anyone. Here is the bottom line: If the final chapter has a few issues, there are only so many to get to so I don't have time to read this book. One day if I've read the entire book I'll make it a part of my life and I love it for that.

Happily, we have just four chapters that don't require any retwitting. The last chapter is more fun for me to spend an extra night reading because it is so well drawn, not only because the ending is really good, but because I can just walk away and spend more time with the book instead of going in and out of the main characters.

If Winter Hibiscus was written under the direction of John Wick and not James Wick, the plot would probably have been interesting. The more I read, the less I like it. The first half of the book is just one long chapter of nothing but suspense.

So this is a good book and I love it. If there is one thing I like, it's reading an entirely enjoyable chapter, but if it's on one of those "read a little while, no follow-throughs" lists people often use to write a love story, how do I know that doesn't work?
