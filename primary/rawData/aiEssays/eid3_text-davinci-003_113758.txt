In Joe Kurmaski's poem "Rough Road Ahead," the cyclist experiences the effects of the setting both physically and emotionally. The poem is clearly set in an urban setting, as indicated by references to "city lights" and "truck exhaust" that "scorch" the cyclist's lungs. The cycling environment is chaotic and challenging, as there are "traffic snarls," a "speed-demon" trying to pass, and more mechanical "beasts" in the cyclist's way.

The cyclist's physical environment is intense, highlighting the fact that the journey through the city is a difficult one. The cyclist has to cope with steep inclines and declines and has to swerve to avoid hazards (such as the "Angry drivers" or the truck exhaust). The poem also mentions the "heat" and "humid air." These details further emphasize the cyclist's difficult journey and hardship.

On an emotional level, the setting of this poem is also challenging for the cyclist. He feels isolated despite the fact that he is in the middle of a city, and experiences "road rage" and "candles raging." These feelings make it difficult for the cyclist to experience the beauty of the urban landscape, and emphasize the mental strain of having to navigate a difficult environment.

In "Rough Road Ahead," the features of the setting affect the cyclist both physically and emotionally. The chaotic urban environment is physically demanding and presents a number of challenges
