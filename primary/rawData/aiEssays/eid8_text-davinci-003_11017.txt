I had been friends with John since high school, but we had drifted apart over the years. One day, we decided to meet up for a catch-up lunch to talk about old times. As soon as we met, I started laughing at an old inside joke he had made about ten years ago. We both knew it well and it brought back so many memories. We ended up laughing for what felt like hours as we tried to outdo one another with stories from the past. 

We shared stories of our more embarrassing moments, talked about our close calls, and commiserated over our mistakes. But teared-up eyes and aching stomachs from laughter kept us going until the restaurant closed and we had to leave.

In all the years I'd known John, I'd never seen him this happy. That moment has stayed with me; the day laughter reconnected us after all these years.
