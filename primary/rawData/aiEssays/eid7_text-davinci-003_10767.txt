I used to volunteer at a local animal shelter when I was in high school. One day, I was assigned to work with a very excitable pup who had just arrived at the shelter. From the moment I started playing and petting her, she was jumping all over me and getting overly excited. 

I knew that she was just expressing her joy in having someone to play with, so I was determined to remain patient. I kept calmly talking to her and soothingly petting her, and as time went on, she slowly started to calm down. I watched as she gradually became more and more relaxed, and I could tell she felt comfortable and secure. 

By the time I was ready to leave, the pup was calm and content. It was amazing how a few minutes of patience and understanding had been so successful. I like to think that moment was the start of her new life, and I was proud to have played a role in giving her the comfort and security she needed.
