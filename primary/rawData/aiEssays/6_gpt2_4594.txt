The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Because of the fact that a dirigible was used in the production of the Empire State Building for more than half of its life, the building was considered a "death bed" for the masses. A dirigible designed by D. W. Cooke in 1895 would be a significant milestone in the growth of the Empire State Building and the completion of the Empire State of New York. " The Empire State Building was one of the most iconic structures of its time and the home of the State of New York, until the death of W. D. Cooke in 1892." At the same time, a great deal was changed in the work on the building in the form of the Empire State Building. In 1910, the Empire State Building had become the Empire State of New York City. It was changed into a huge, imposing and monumental structure. The Empire State Building is the world's tallest building, and the tallest building in the world (the Empire Tower of New York was the tallest in the world at the time). The building, in this case, was designed to represent the State of New York and the whole region. The building had been planned to stay with the Empire State Building and the Department of New York from 1937 to 1955. Although it was intended to be an exhibition piece, in 1968 the State Building was demolished. The Empire State Building was rebuilt and renovated to accommodate the rise of the buildings throughout
