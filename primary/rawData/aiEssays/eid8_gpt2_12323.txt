One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I would see some of my sisters and siblings laugh, sometimes making them cry. And, they made no effort to resist, that was one important thing that they were afraid of.

I have learned that I can be very protective in an incident if I take precautions and I have a responsibility that I never am, especially when I am in danger, when I am trying to help my girlfriend do her thing, or for kids or other people who are at risk, to make sure you don't hurt yourself in the process, because you may hurt others.

I never feel that I have to be angry or anything like that. I am very protective, I do have a responsibility, and that is very important. Even if I am on my phone, I don't want to interrupt my girlfriend because I am taking a risk or something. Sometimes we would all need help. It does just make me a little nervous. I just had to get that out of my mind.

How can I protect myself?

The only one I can help my girlfriend with is to give her a massage and then be in the right place for her body. After this kind of thing she will be better able to do much of herself and is going to enjoy all kinds of things:

Getting up and doing exercise.

Hanging out with her people.

Being comfortable in the public.

Getting comfortable in the business
