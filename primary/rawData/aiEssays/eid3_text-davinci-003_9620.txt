In Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead," the features of the setting strongly affect the cyclist's experience. The short story tells of a young man's bicycle ride over a rough mountain road with harsh terrain and dangerous weather conditions. 

The vastness of the mountain, with its steep climbs and treacherous descents, make it difficult for the cyclist to continue on his journey. He is daunted by the looming summits and forlorn valleys, and the relentless whipping of the wind as he labors up the ascent affects his morale. The sharp switchbacks add to the mental and physical strain on the cyclist, and he has to rely strictly on his focus and determination.

The unpredictable weather further complicates his task. At first, the sun is hot and the day a pleasant one, but as the cyclist pushes himself onward, the sky turns ominous and threatening. The foggy expanse of the mountain creates an otherworldly atmosphere, foreboding in its eeriness. 

The sheer enormity of the setting and its unpredictable conditions make the mountain daunting and intimidating for the cyclist. The vast expanse and rapid changes in the weather lead to feelings of isolation and restlessness in the cyclist. The wind chills him to the bone and the cruel and untenable environment saps him of his energy, making the road ahead seem even more impossible to surmount. All these elements of the setting combine to create an arduous experience for the cyclist
