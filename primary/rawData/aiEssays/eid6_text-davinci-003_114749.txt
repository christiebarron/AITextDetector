The builders of the Empire State Building faced a series of challenges in allowing dirigibles to dock within the architectural confines of their impressive feat of engineering. This issue, while seemingly trivial at first, presented several unwelcome obstacles that had to be addressed for the safety and convenience of potential passengers.

The first issue was that the Empire State Building was potentially too tall and windy to support a safe docking. An ideal docking spot would be much shorter than the Empire State Building; however, the average winds around the building could prevent an airship from maintaining a steady descent towards the riggings. Furthermore, aircrafts of this kind require a large open area to land safely and the narrowness of the Manhattan streets would also make it difficult to find such a place.

In addition, the skyscraper itself posed further problems: its height and narrowness meant that dirigibles could not dock at any convenient distance from the mooring mast. In fact, Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s article ‘The Mooring Mast’ highlights the difficulty of finding a satisfactory site for the mast’s anchor, which had to be placed in such a way that a dirigible could maintain a steady descent towards the mast. This meant compromising on the safety requirements of both the aircraft and the mast itself.

Finally, the fact that the Empire State Building was in a highly congested commercial area presented the builders with further issues. The traffic below the
