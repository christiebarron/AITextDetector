One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was sitting in a diner with a young woman who was sitting opposite me and just sitting there laughing hysterically. I just couldn't stand the sound of her. She was not laughing. This is what the police might see.

The video could be considered a case of police making a mistake rather than a misunderstanding. The police might think that this person is merely laughing because the man at gunpoint was making an assault on her â€” without ever acknowledging that he was in his own home (she probably didn't call him home at the time). And even if he wasn't alone in this act, the video would likely cause the police to know he was not alone in this attack. The video could also raise questions about the officer's motives in making his actions illegal. Would this young woman feel that he didn't act on her due to what he perceived to be a fear of criminal justice? What would he have felt if the woman who was making this decision had been pulled over by the police that night (or even had her car stolen)? Will her fear of the police and of all their other laws lead her to believe he was the aggressor? If the officer did feel an impulse to put his face in my face, can he have imagined his surroundings to be populated by people that were screaming and begging to have my name, my voice and my photo taken with the police cameras or my license plates? What sort of people do I meet
