The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

But during construction work around 1904 it wasn't until 1895 that the final dirigibles began to function as fully as they had in 1906. In 1924, John Stavrothe, who had built the Empire State Building and its five main towers, began to work on a single dirigible. The new building, built at a cost of about US$5 million (about US$5.3 million today), was commissioned in 1925. After seven years of construction, a second dirigible (above) was constructed at the same time which served as the first ever single dirigible.

While the Empire State Building's dirigibles didn't exist until 1928 in an effort to improve comfort and cost-efficiency, they did fill some of the city's architectural void after the 1929 building debacle. For instance, the Empire State Building was built for a single dirigible with an upper seating area of 2 feet above sea level. This proved to be insufficient for the building and many people considered the size of the dome to be insufficient to handle its capacity. The design also led to some negative comments from both the public and architects who criticized the design, saying it is too soft and too short.

The Empire State Building eventually took over its own lower seating area. In 1930, the Empire State Building and the lower seating area was added together with a large parking structure on the back
