I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is an integral part of its functioning," she said.

A "significant level of censorship" is one reason why libraries still get a lot of revenue from the book publishing services like Smashwords and Reddit. However, it is important for those libraries to maintain their legal capacity to keep the text or documents under control, she said. As a result, it is now difficult for library owners or publishers to regulate and censor material, or even to monitor the content.

The study cited multiple guidelines that require libraries to restrict some kinds of text and books, and as a result many users were banned or harassed.
