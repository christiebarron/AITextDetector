Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. Some areas in the landscape can be quite interesting, while some roads may turn somewhat more complicated like with many older examples I've discussed (and here's the latest from IPC Architects):

The best example of this is a famous road named 'Tuck Road' in England. 'Hog Road' is a narrow street that is very winding but often curves well to the left due to its width of 542' (that's it). Like many roads on the road, the road's winding nature makes it challenging to traverse, and 'Hog' was one of the hardest places they were to go in a serious bike race.

This particular section of the road (A2) has a slight sloping section (A3) on the left (I assume the area just south of the road, if not the whole of it) and the winding roads are often quite hard to navigate in the rain. It's ancient, but it was an exceptionally interesting part of the UK's most popular road. The best examples of the setting we've seen so far include what are described as 'Ballyhaha and Newlands'. It can turn quite rough and narrow at times, and the winding streets are also a nice twist around the corner for motorists and the roads are almost always quite difficult to navigate in the rain.

It may be somewhat of a stretch to say that 'H
