One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I took a break, because if I was feeling uncomfortable, I would stand up and do it. I didn't know how to do that, even though I used to do it, so when I looked through my computer screen with anxiety I just didn't bother. It took me a while after getting started to feel comfortable. The good news is it's still easier to do for many men than it may seem. It's a lot better than sitting down and getting a punch in your face. Not to mention the long hours of sweat, and sweat, and anxiety that comes from sitting up in order to do this or that. If you have to sit through five minutes of feeling uncomfortable with something just so you can try it out again, don't do it. It may never be as good as it should be. It may take your mind a little while to do and it might take your mind a lot longer to do things that would make you happy.

Some men are really good at this, and have been for about two years now. They're going to just start getting better at it, but it'll take time and practice. There's no reason you can't do it at some point in your life.
