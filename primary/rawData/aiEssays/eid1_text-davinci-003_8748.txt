I remember the first time my husband, Tom, made me laugh. We'd been together for about a year, and I was just starting to get comfortable with him in our relationship. We'd just had dinner at his favorite restaurant, and he asked if I wanted to go for a walk. I said yes and so we started walking.

Tom had a good sense of humor, and he started to tell me a few jokes as we walked down the street. I wasn't really paying attention, but then he started doing an impression of one of our favorite movie characters, and I couldn't help but laugh. He laughed too, and soon we were both doubled over with laughter.

From then on, no matter how tough things got, Tom always found a way to make me laugh. We have laughter every day, which brings us closer together and makes our relationship stronger than ever. Laughter truly is the best medicine, and I'm grateful for Tom's ability to make me laugh no matter the situation.
