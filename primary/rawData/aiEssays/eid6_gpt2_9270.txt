The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They started with a $10-million project. Then, in 2004, the U.S. Department of Transportation proposed replacing them with $30-million public transit, and another $30-million for public museums.

U.S. lawmakers, however, didn't see the benefit. If lawmakers were about to push "the public's interest" aside, they'd have to offer a different interpretation of which government officials could be trusted to be trusted with the financial means to accomplish the project.

That might have been possible if the public weren't so eager.

"The public's interest in this project is a key part of it," said Rep. Jim Matheson, D-Dallas. "I think in fact it was the most important thing to happen in the early '90s."

He added: "If you are going to put people up and watch them go, I think that is a very big part of it. There were concerns about how it would interact with their transportation needs. But this is part of what will determine whether they get the support they need. They certainly don't want to do this."
