Once, I was traveling in a foreign country and was waiting at the airport for my flight back home. The flight attendants announced that the flight was delayed for four hours due to mechanical issues. Although I was frustrated, I kept my cool and reminded myself that there was nothing I could do about the delay. I set to work browsing through the airport stores and playing games on my phone in order to pass the time. 

The four hours ended up feeling like an eternity, but I managed to remain patient and focused on the positive aspects of the situation. To my surprise, the four hours passed more quickly than I had expected. Eventually, the plane was cleared and we took off on our journey home. At the end of the ordeal, I was glad that I had maintained my patience since it allowed me to enjoy the few amenities the airport had to offer.
