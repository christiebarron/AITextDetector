I will never forget the moment when my best friend and I the first time we laughed together. We had been friends for a while by that point, but we had never shared a true, belly-aching laugh together yet. 

On the day the laughter happened, it was nothing special — we had gone to the movies together, and we were walking back home at sunset. We were talking about the movie, and my friend's comment had struck me as so stupid and ridiculous that I couldn't help but start giggling. Soon enough, we were both in fits of laughter, clutching our stomachs and barely able to stand up straight. 

It felt like the most amazing moment. That belly-aching laughter was such an unexpected surprise, and yet it felt so familiar, so comfortable. There I was, with all my inhibitions momentarily forgotten, sharing an incredibly special moment with my best friend. It was a moment I’ll never forget.

Looking back on it, I realise that laughter was the ultimate bridge between the two of us. It made me realise just how close we had become, and how effortless and effort-filled it felt. I’m glad I had that moment, and I’m so grateful that I still have it with her today.
