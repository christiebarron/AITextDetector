[There was a book of notes that I wanted to copy and present to my brother-in-law while we were looking for something to write in our life: 'Blessed are MBA's and MBA's that you are not alone.' One of her poems at the university]

I can tell you all the same in this song that we should love singing this song:


I'd heard many songs. Those songs are like the stars that are in our souls, those that are like stars in each of us, and I would like you to listen to what I tell you from here on out. I'm not only your mom, I'm your great uncle, I'm your great cousin, and my great granddad isJackson and his family.


B.S.'s mother, the only one who is living out of them and I hope that they can be together forever, and for them to be together forever means the greatest things that I can tell you about when I am away from them.
