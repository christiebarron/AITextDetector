The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because this is a series filled with some truly great characters, including Dory, Pawnee, Rachael, and Ejha, and every character is a true badass. You're going to see some of the greatest writing in comics history, with some of the most gorgeous artwork I've ever seen. And the reason why it's hard to judge by a series of ratings is because you really just haven't seen anything. I'm not trying to paint a perfect picture, and I'm not trying to tell a perfect story, but reading that second book is awesome. I want it to be a whole different world. If you're going to give back, get it.
