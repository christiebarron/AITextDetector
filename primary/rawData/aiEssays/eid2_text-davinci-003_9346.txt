Books, music, movies, and magazines in libraries have long been indispensable sources of knowledge, education, and entertainment for many people. However, with the abundance of resources present in libraries today, some may be deemed inappropriate or offensive to certain individuals. In light of this, the discussion surrounding censorship in libraries has arisen.

When considering censorship in libraries, it is important to note the difference between censorship and selection. Selection is the act of deciding which materials suit a library’s mission and are of use to its patrons. Censorship, however, is the act of suppressing certain information based on personal opinions or beliefs. Libraries should provide their patrons with as much information as possible, while treating all materials with sensitivity.

In general, libraries should be wary of censoring materials based on their content. It is not the library’s job to filter information based on what they personally find to be offensive. Libraries that are open to the public must be willing to accept the fact that some materials may be considered morally wrong or offensive by some patrons. Removing such material would be an act of censorship that is not tolerated in an open society.

At the same time, libraries should exercise discretion when selecting materials. This starts with libraries creating clearly defined collections policies that outline which materials are considered suitable for its patrons. Selection should also be mindful of the public’s sensibilities, as well as the Code of Ethics set out by the American Library Association.
