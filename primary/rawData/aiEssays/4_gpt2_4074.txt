The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it asks all characters to decide which of their friends and whether she can ever get over it. He then offers up five possibilities for you to decide between: You choose what friends she can take over because now she's free from that horrible disease, you choose when to kill her in an emergency as you find someone that can live with the pain; you choose if it's for the love of his or her (with the latter option being the last step) or if it's a cure (when you find a girl who loves him or herself, she tries to get you over it), your choice is either life or death; or both.

He is particularly good at using his power to make things worse, making anyone who isn't dead feel they've been wronged.

I am a fan on this and, while he knows where his hand is and when the "grief" has come, I'm not sure there's anyone else around to point that out. In fact not even him.

As you may have guessed, in the book, the whole plot shifts from a world where everybody who wants to survive dies and lives for their own happiness, with everyone hoping it's someone else's death or the pain of a family tragedy.

As for me? I can still find the best time to save the world. The time it takes to get there is when Winter Hibiscus dies on the planet
