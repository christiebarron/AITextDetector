Dear Editor,

We live in a world overrun by computers. Everything from communication to even groceries can be done with the click of a mouse. But, with the rise in computers, comes the inevitable effect it has on people.

I believe the effects computers have on people are quite alarming. They significantly reduce physical activities, resulting in a host of health problems ranging from cardiovascular issues to problems with vision. Studies have also shown that excessive use of computers has led to an increase in the amount of stress people experience. It has been argued that we are also seeing a decrease in the amount of face-to-face interaction as people increasingly turn to computers to do their tasks.

It is clear that computers have had a tremendous impact on our lives. However, it is essential to understand that we need to be responsible with our usage and actively seek to limit our dependence on them. Too often, we use them as a crutch and become dependent on them to do our tasks.

I urge the readers to think carefully about the effects computers have on people and adopt a responsible approach towards using these devices.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
