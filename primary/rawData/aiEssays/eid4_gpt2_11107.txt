The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it's written from one moment of our lives and another that comes through after. This book goes on to explain just how true it can be, how many times we have walked up to a local grocery store and pulled out our iPhone or watched a movie online in the middle of the night.

You'll recognize those stories, even if you've never made them during any of your last two decades of marriage. And it's a great source for books about the journey the marriage took, and how each of our marriages was so much of an emotional roller-coaster to try and navigate on that journey, just to get some extra time to share those stories with you. And then, once they've been shared, it makes things more moving for those relationships. And you start to get that sense of perspective as you read it.

The Winter Hibiscus is, of course, in two parts: The first part describes how we became the couple, and at that point it actually occurred to our families and friends that we would only ever have one of our wives. And as the series progresses, the story evolves and our love life becomes more and more complicated as we learn how to keep track of who our children are. So for your viewing pleasure, here's our full story.
