One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I saw people laughing, especially when someone told me that they would have my name be erased. And I realized that the laughter was a reaction to myself and that I was doing something wrong for not liking what I was listening to. But people will sometimes laugh when you're making fun from a personal point of view. And it's funny how often people will see people not liking what they were saying because they were so far from getting what they were wanting. In reality, they will often laugh when you're telling people, "I don't want you to hear that. I'd really like to be listened to, though."

How can I make the right decisions when it comes to laughing and feeling out of place in an emotional sense?

I want to hear from you as to what's wrong and what's OK. (For those who don't know, some comedians, like "The Red Pill" John Goodman, do not like having to respond to people who are laughing. So just tell them what you feel.) In general, when I feel a feeling of being alone and experiencing emotions, I'm probably going to put in the work to be alone a bit more instead of making fun of Interesting People: I always know, "I must be joking!" Or like, "Let's go, stop trying to hit on me, you have a lot to work with, and everything is possible!"
