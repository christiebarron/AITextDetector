One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was watching "Sterling & Sherman," and it was about the movie. I had just seen "The Shining", and I'd been sitting in the room and I thought if it goes on, my head would explode. I'm a big, heavy, snotty man, but it was just a joke. No one would understand that I was joking, because that is what my face always looks like.

If I don't say this to a person in the room, my face will literally scream and shake. There will be a person in the room who will hear you out. This never works.

I have one of these "loud laughter" times once every two minutes when I get home and I'm in my chair. (The speaker is not playing anything outside.) I hear it so loud I'll be embarrassed. The next time I hear that, I'm so embarrassed to think that I have suddenly experienced it. That is what I hear. I think, that's okay because it's true.

"The Shining" is the sixth film in a trilogy, not long ago, and directed by William F. Buckley Jr.
