I was invited to a party recently and for some reason I ended up running late. I felt so terrible arriving after everyone else, but the host was so understanding and patient with me. She reassured me that it was no problem and asked me if I was okay. I apologized for my tardiness and she waved it off warmly. She then proceeded to make me feel welcome amidst the other guests. I was amazed by her patience and understanding, and it made me feel so much better about the situation. This experience taught me to be patient when others make mistakes and to welcome them with kindness.
