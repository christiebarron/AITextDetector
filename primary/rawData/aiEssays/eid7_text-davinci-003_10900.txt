I was recently in line to check out at the grocery store, a rather long line actually. Everyone was impatiently tapping their feet and checking their watches, some people even huffing and puffing with annoyance. As the minutes ticked by, I couldn't help but worry too about how long I'd be waiting for. 

But then I saw the elderly lady in line ahead of me. She was slowly and deliberately gathering her things after paying for her groceries. She had arthritis and I noticed she struggled to open and close her purse. The cashier kindly asked her if she could help.

At that moment, I realized that this woman had waited long enough and shouldn't be rushed. So I kept quiet, controlled my frustration, and patiently waited my turn. 

In the end, she ended up exiting the store before I was served. I felt a sense of peace as I realized that I had put someone else's needs ahead of my own. Not only did I show patience, but I also showed kindness and empathy towards a total stranger.
