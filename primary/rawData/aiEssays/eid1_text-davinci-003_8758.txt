I had recently moved in with my college roommate for the summer and neither of us was used to living with another person. We had a couple of awkward moments as we figured out how to live together, but then one day we had a really funny conversation about something that we just couldn't help but laugh about.

We started out talking about everyday things, like bills and shopping trips, but then I started talking about a dating horror story of mine and we both started cracking up at my misfortune. The story wasn't even really funny, but somehow we just kept cracking up, and before we knew it we were both rolling in laughter. 

It was such a wonderful feeling to be able to just enjoy laughter together with my roommate, instead of feeling like it was an awkward and unfamiliar atmosphere. We had gotten past the initial awkwardness, and now we were just two people laughing together. It was a great bonding experience, and it made us both realize that this was going to be a great summer living together!
