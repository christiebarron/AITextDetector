One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was living in St. Louis and being told to put my kids in a safe house, but I knew I was lucky. It was something that was always there. It's what I always did; I love people and not just what they do. I don't think we have any sort of taboo.

We've had plenty of discussions, especially about gun control, gun culture, and the media, about which part of America's gun owners have it safe. But, I have to point out, the media is not the only place where we will hear about guns from gun owners. The way to find people who don't think that, when you hear it from friends who are gun owners, you know you're listening really good, is to look Canon. But Canon is just as important. In my opinion, we can all learn from each other.
