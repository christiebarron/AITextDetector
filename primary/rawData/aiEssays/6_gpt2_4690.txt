The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first of these was that no one was in charge of the building so people had to have an umbrella over their heads to look over it. After these hurdles, the project was finally done because it was clear that the building's designers intended it to be able to dock with two large windows, but the actual design did not take place in one window.

Cities like Chicago had the same problem, with both the Federal Building Commission and the Federal Building Administration having the obligation to allow the construction of a vertical canopy. When you see a building which has a vertical canopy, such as the Federal Building Administration, the window should be a lot more tall and there should probably be no need to open it to dock with the window. However, once a city wants a vertical canopy that is wide enough for one-person occupancy, this window need not be big enough to allow that vertical canopy to be used properly.

However, many cities have added additional vertical windows to keep people from entering from the rear. At the same time there is also that issue of the glass canopy in the upper portion of the elevator of the building. This makes it difficult for people to get to the window before they enter. However, these other reasons have not been addressed by the architects and therefore, the vertical canopy is far more common then originally thought. The answer is that when you have a vertical canopy in the base,
