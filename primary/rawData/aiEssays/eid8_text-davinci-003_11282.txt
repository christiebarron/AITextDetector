I was out on a walk with my best friend, a beautiful sunny day. We were talking about some of the usual things, work and our plans for the weekend, when he made a joke that made me laugh until my sides hurt. We were both laughing so hard, with those big stupid grins that just come naturally whenever something is really funny. Everything around us stilled, the birds chirping were suddenly silent and all that could be heard was our laughter, echoing out into the world.

It felt like an eternity that we just stood there, leaning against each other and laughing until our bellies ached. After what felt like hours, we both finally stopped and I looked up into his eyes. In that moment, before either of us said a word, I knew that no matter what our bond and friendship was something that no amount of time can change. After all, laughter is the best medicine and it had worked its charms.
