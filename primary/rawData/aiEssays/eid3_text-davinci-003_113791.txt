In Joe Kurmaski's poem, 'Rough Road Ahead,' the cyclist encounters a challenging journey, and the setting influences his struggle to reach his destination. The features of the setting are described as “the sky a vast, impenetrable blackness/the fields, an oppressive darkness” and the earth, “a rough, jagged stone.” This creates a feeling of foreboding and danger, as the cyclist is swallowed up by the darkness of the unfamiliar landscape.

The absence of light creates an unsettling, almost oppressive atmosphere of fear and dread, as the cyclist does not know what awaits him on the road ahead. The rough nature of the earth also presents a challenge for the cyclist. He is forced to slow his pace, press down harder on the pedals, and expend more energy in order to make any progress at all. The jagged, uneven surface of the earth jars his body, making it difficult for him to maintain his balance and momentum. 

The darkness and the roughness of the terrain provide an obstacle to the cyclist's progress, making him feel small and insignificant in comparison to the vastness and power of nature. The setting of 'Rough Road Ahead' also emphasizes the cyclist's courage and resilience, though, as he perseveres against the difficult conditions despite his fear and fatigue. The features of the setting challenge the cyclist, but ultimately he triumphs as he nears the end of his journey
