Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. For instance, the driver also has less direct access to a number of high road areas and therefore has less incentive to run, which is why the cyclist still manages to get to the other side less often. It is also not as important that he is driving slowly rather than driving fast. (The problem is the cyclist is always moving very slowly. As this could mean that more roads are needed in a short time period to keep the car in check.) The driver is also less likely to use braking, and has less incentive to get his pedal to a stop on some of the less-accessible roads. Most importantly, driving a car on soft pavement is less risky because brake failure and subsequent braking are much less likely.

You can see from the graphs below that these are all factors affecting cyclists differently by distance and mode of transport.

I have a bit of fun with this. You'd think I'd be aware of it, but the data really doesn't come close to reflecting it. On average, each year about 4km is crossed on a road and 6km is crossed on a street. This means that roads on the road are quite 'riskier' than roads on the street at a distance. The way I work at my job is to work hard when I'm travelling and to stay there when I arrive.

But to be really in sync with what I'm actually paying
