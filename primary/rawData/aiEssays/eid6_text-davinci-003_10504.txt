When the Empire State Building was being constructed in the early 1930s, the planners faced a unique challenge in allowing dirigibles to dock. The sole purpose of the dirigible dock at the top of the building was to revolutionize air travel, making it more convenient for passengers to reach new destinations. However, due to the extreme heights of the Empire State Building, it was difficult to construct a safe and secure way of docking the large airships at the top of the building.

The builders of the Empire State Building had to come up with a way of safely docking Dirigibles amidst the busy city skyline and high winds. The key to this was the development of the revolutionary mooring mast. This was a 205-foot tall steel pole erected at the peak of the building and fitted with a set of steel rings through which the airship pilot could secure the dirigible. This allowed the airship to be secured to the building and held upright, despite the high winds that could have pushed the airships away.

However, even with the development of the mooring mast, it was still a treacherous task to dock the dirigibles at such a height. It was a challenge for the pilots to be able to maneuver the massive airships in the extreme wind conditions, and to do so with precision. To compensate for this, engineers developed special lines and cables to tie down the airships and ensure they could be held stable when docking.
