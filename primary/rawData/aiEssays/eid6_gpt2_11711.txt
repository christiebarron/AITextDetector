The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They had to find the right person to direct them away from construction or risk being sued from their owners. They eventually determined that one of the building's workers's "rights" by failing to work properly with the building's contractor was not a serious violation even in court. So construction engineer David E. Pemberton moved the building to Florida. His plan, he says, was to make it appear more like private property than a public building and, eventually, a luxury item. E. Pemberton wanted a building that would not be a distraction from the state fair. It still is â€” a sleek, low-rise that is easily the centerpieces of the complex.
