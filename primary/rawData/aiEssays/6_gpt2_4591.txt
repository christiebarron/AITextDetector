The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. If the dome would be extended vertically from a building's top to the center of the elevator shaft, then the dome would collapse onto an elevated platform as it approached the top of the tower. Many builders attempted only with high beams or vertical columns to provide vertical support but failed.

After the building was completed in 1936, a series of high beams under the upper deck of the building opened up in the middle of the building. The first high platform attached to the elevator was then lowered from the upper deck to the north, then lowered to the south by the same process. The tallest roof of the building was raised from the top to be placed in front of the bridge tower. Since this height was too tall for the towers to meet, bags of garbage were loaded into the elevator tower. Some architects decided to design taller elevators or lowered roofs to compensate for the extra weight.

The designers of the Empire State Building also designed two floors of elevators on the top of the lower deck. It was not surprising then that the first elevators had an elevation that exceeded 1,650 feet across a 5-story building. The second elevator was the tallest and most extensive elevator ever built by Engineers at the Central New York Hospital. The structure and tower of the building were designed with the lowest possible elevation in mind due to its narrow profile.
