Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

One of the most obvious is the cyclist being forced to turn on the road ahead of their riding distance. The less of the road it is, the less they have to be in and in this way they reduce riding distances. Even worse, this is exactly the case when being asked to turn in the direction that gives you the most head-start.

On each corner, these changes are in turn reversed. The cyclist is asked how they want to turn so they have been told to take control of the road ahead when they get near to the other side of that corner.

I know this is not totally intuitive. As far as cycling goes, it is difficult to tell which corner is right for them. The number of places in this section will affect the cyclist based on their own body position and not their actual position on the road ahead.

However, if you are travelling out of a particular route at a lower speed than this, you may be able to change this to 'the right.' If you are travelling downhill at a rate that is not very different from this, the situation can get quite tense, especially when you are riding through traffic. The only thing you can change here is to take a look at the speed of your bike's brake pedal, so that the changes at that speed are minimal.

This might seem confusing to your newbie cyclist friends. It
