The setting of 'Rough Road Ahead' by Joe Kurmaski has a major effect on the cyclist's journey. The cyclist experiences both physical and mental obstacles as he travels down an isolated stretch of road in the middle of nowhere.

The road surface itself is an obvious physical challenge. He has to face the elements and contend with cracks in the pavement, potholes, and loose gravel that can throw him off his bike. Even though the cyclist is experienced, he knows that navigating through this terrain will require lots of concentration and effort.

The isolation of the area also adds a mental challenge. He is alone without the support of other cyclists or people around him. He feels the loneliness of being isolated and has to stay focused to stay safe. He must rely on his own strength and determination to make it through the ride.

The sense of vulnerability of the barren countryside also contributes to the cyclist's challenge. Any wildlife he may encounter in this environment is unfamiliar and unpredictable. He must maintain a high level of alertness to be aware and navigate potential hazards.

The cyclist's journey is made even more difficult by extreme weather conditions. He finds himself in a hot, dry, dry air and blazing sun that make it difficult for him to stay hydrated and energized. He has to go on despite the fatigue, heat, and exhaustion, pushing himself further than he has before.
