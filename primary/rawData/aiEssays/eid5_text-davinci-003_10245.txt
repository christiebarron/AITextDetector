Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, creates a vivid and deeply emotional mood. The memoir traces Rodriguez's immigrant Puerto Rican upbringing, as he moves from one location to the next—New York City to Long Island to Arizona. Rodriguez captures the struggles of his family's immigrant journey with vivid and poignant language. His vivid descriptions—from the sounds of a busy New York Ave to the pungent smell of a traditional Puerto Rican meal—make the narrative come alive.

Rodriguez also captures the essence of nostalgia as he writes about his childhood. He is able to evoke strong emotions of homesickness and belonging as he recounts his familiarity with the places he has lived. Rodriguez writes of being a stranger in a strange land and his attempt to find a community—where he can simply be “from home.” He reveals the complexity of bridging two cultures within one person.

The memoir also speaks to the significance of family. As he moves between cities, he remembers the moments of connection—such as unwrapping presents during Christmas with his sisters, or eating his mother’s home-cooking. His memoir conveys an intimate understanding of family bonds—even when they are spread apart.

Ultimately, Rodriguez’s memoir creates a deeply reflective and touching mood by sharing his personal journey. His narrative reveals the various ways home can be found and how different cultures can intersect within an individual. From
