Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have had on people in the recent world. I strongly believe that computer technology has brought many positive impacts to our lives.

Thanks to the rapid development of computer technology, our daily life is becoming more convenient. Computers have made it easier and faster to communicate with the outside world. People no longer need to wait for long-distance letters. With just a few clicks of mouse, we can connect with our friends and family on the other side of the world. Moreover, computers are important tools in our workplaces. They allow us to work more efficiently, save time and resources and increase productivity.

Besides these tangible and practical impacts, I believe that computers also have a substantial effect on our intellectual and development. Today, one of the most common ways to search for knowledge is using computer technology. We can easily access online libraries and the internet to learn about almost anything. This has made a huge difference in allowing us to expand our knowledge and skills.

Overall, computers have significantly impacted lives in ways that most people can see and appreciate. I hope this letter has persuaded you to agree with my opinion on the effects computers have had on people. 

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
