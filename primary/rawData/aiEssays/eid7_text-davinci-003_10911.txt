I was recently visiting my grandmother in the nursing home. I was used to seeing a vibrant, active woman when I was younger. But now, with her age and her memory failing, I was not sure what to expect. When I got to her room, she was confused and disoriented. I sat with her and spoke calmly and slowly. I brought her old pictures to show her, so she could have some sense of familiarity. I was patient with her and eventually, she perked up and began to remember more and more details about the people in the pictures. I stayed with her for several hours until it was time for me to go. Even though it had been challenging at first, it was worth the wait.  I cherish the moments we had together.
