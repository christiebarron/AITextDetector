 

I was volunteering with a group of kids on a playground and there was one boy in particular who was having a rough day. He kept running around, pushing buttons on the instruments and swinging where he shouldn't. Everyone started to get a little frustrated because he was disrupting the whole group and many of us were getting a bit uneasy.

But I kept my cool and calmly walked up to the boy and asked him why he was acting out. I could tell from his face that he was having a difficult time. He opened up to me and started telling me about some of the challenges he was facing at home. I listened patient to him, not interrupting and simply being there for him.

After we had talked for a bit, he started to calm down and explain more. I found out that he'd had a tough day because his parents had gotten into a fight, and he just wanted to play and forget how he felt.

We talked more and eventually the other kids started to join in. I stayed patient throughout the whole process and I'm proud to say that the boy was able to leave the playground feeling encouraged and in a much better mood. I'm grateful that I was able to be a patient listener and to provide the boy with the comfort he needed.
