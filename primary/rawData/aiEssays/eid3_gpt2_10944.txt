Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. With two different styles of tyres, different ways to go on the narrow corners and varying settings during certain runs, the 'Rough Road Ahead' setting can get the full benefit of tyre pressure and tyre life in both situations.

What it all means:

If you don't feel ready to have a test-drive or tyre, the "Rough Road Ahead" setting will help you achieve a very high level of comfort and performance.

This setting reduces tyre pressure and forces the tyre to come out of the tyre bowl.

If both tyres are on the road at the same time and the tire bowl is empty in some circumstances, tyre pressure will help a cyclist achieve maximum comfort and performance.

What if I think I just want to get to the end?

The "Rough Road Ahead" setting is particularly useful when you need to slow down on some road conditions or are in the minority of cars.

The most common types of situations are when you are approaching the end of the day and your tyres are out of reach.

If you are taking the wrong route to the end of a wet and wet road, the "Rough Road Ahead" setting helps to give extra pressure and less tyre life. This can also help your tyre life as it increases.
