I was waiting in line at the store recently when a mother and her two children were ahead of me. The mother had been having trouble finding what she was looking for, and the children were both tired and growing more impatient and whiny as time went on. 

I noticed the stress on the mother's face as she looked for what she needed, but none of the containers of food seemed to be what she wanted. The children began to complain and fidget and the mother was clearly getting frustrated and overwhelmed.

I wanted to help, but I did not want to seem intrusive. So, I decided to be patient. I waited patiently, not making any comments or pressing the mother for an answer. At one point, one of the children started to cry, and the mother quickly interrupted him and promised that they would find the food she needed soon. 

Finally, the mother found what she was looking for, and she proceeded to the register. I could see the relief on her face, and I couldn't help but to silently thank her for her patience with her children. Despite her stress and frustration with the situation, she had still taken the time to explain to her children why they had to wait. It was a wonderful reminder of the importance of being patient in difficult situations.
