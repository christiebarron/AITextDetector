I will never forget the day my best friend and I had a very awkward first encounter. We had both just started college and had decided to meet up for lunch. As we nervously made our introductions, we both started to laugh awkwardly at the same time. 

At first we were both embarrassed, but then quickly embraced the moment and started to laugh together. It seemed like our laughter somehow opened up our friendship, helping us to break through the initial awkwardness. We discovered that we had a lot in common and, from that day on, went on to become good friends.

Years later, I have come to appreciate that moment of laughter even more. It reminds me that great relationships are built on moments of joy, and the power that laughter has to bridge the gap between two people.
