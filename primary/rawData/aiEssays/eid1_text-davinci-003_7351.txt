In Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead," the cyclist rides along a road surrounded by lush green trees. The dense foliage creates a peaceful atmosphere that allows the cyclist to enjoy the scenery and reflect on his journey. The trees create a sense of security, protecting the cyclist from the outside world and enabling him to focus on his thoughts.

The rough road, on the other hand, presents a very different experience for the cyclist. The climbing hills and curving turns challenge them both physically and mentally. The cyclist must remain vigilant, relying on their strength and skill to navigate the uneven terrain. The bumpy surface also forces them to keep a slower, steadier pace, allowing for more appreciation of the environment around them. The cyclist is forced to focus on the present moment and stay aware of the road conditions, thus making the ride more of an interactive experience.

Ultimately, the cyclist must find a balance between the tranquil scenery and the demanding road. While the peaceful atmosphere of the woods helps the cyclist reflect on their journey, the constantly changing landscape of the road enables the cyclist to stay alert and present in each moment. Thus, the combination of the two influential features makes the experience of cycling along the rough road more rewarding and memorable.
