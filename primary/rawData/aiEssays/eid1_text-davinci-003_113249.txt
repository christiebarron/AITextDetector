Dear Editor,

I am writing to voice my opinion about the effects computers have on our society. Our technology-rich society has advanced rapidly with the advent of computers, and as a result, many of us rely heavily on them to get through our daily activities.

I have strong beliefs that computers have become an essential part of our lives, as they make our lives more convenient, efficient and productive. The majority of us utilize computers to communicate with other people, to shop for groceries, to pay bills, to research and keep up with current events, to stay in touch with family and friends, to play games, and to store valuable memories and documents.

Moreover, computers have enabled us to be more creative and artistic. Many of us are able to use computers to design and develop artwork, cartoons, websites, networking opportunities, marketing materials and much more. It is my firm belief that these opportunities have allowed for the creation of enhanced technology that has allowed us to discover ways to make life and work much easier.

Having said that, computers can also become a source of disruption and negative effects on people. Spending too much time on the computer can lead to distraction and an unhealthy preoccupation with virtual activities. As well, excessive exposure to computers can contribute to insomnia, irritability, headaches and fatigue, which may lead to physical and mental health issues.

In conclusion, computers have had a substantial impact on people in terms of convenience, creativity and
