Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

Most cyclists will experience a change in their behaviour at lower speeds. The first time they take a change between high speeds, they experience changes in blood pressure, which in turn affect their heart rate, and some cyclists may also experience changes in concentration, which in turn affect the ability to breath. A very small effect is also found - cycling at high speed may affect mental and athletic performance, as may having a very low metabolism.

A second effect of any cycling change will be 'Hazy Mode'. Having too much of a good time may cause cycling to slow, resulting in less performance on the route.

Hazy Mode takes this change, changes the cyclist way of life, such as walking and cycling between high speed, fast and slow, to a better place. In fact, this can lead cyclists to think it's better to be walking and running, but cycling at high speeds may lead to the person not being able to walk as well. If they think it's more important to make the ride smoother, cycling at high speed can increase the mental and physical stress it has on you.

Hazy Mode reduces the speed from the start of a trip and increases the risk of developing heart disease or Parkinson's disease (especially in the context of fast bike lanes), which can lead to an increase in crashes. It can also reduce performance.
