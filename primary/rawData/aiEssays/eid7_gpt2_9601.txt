An example of a time someone in my life was patient was to me when I was a little girl, just to get my life started and my family to feed. I would bring them home to my mom or dad. But that was before there were jobs, so I didn't pay for that, so that paid off. But the thing was, I loved having my own house and my own health care. I was grateful, so I went to the local hospital and got a CT scan. That was when I got it. I thought, 'I've got my health care, I would be better off with a home,'" he says. "That's the kind of person he seems to be."

So when he and his wife moved to his hometown in 2009, they chose Colorado for its beaches. That year, they had two young kids, and all of the parents were in heaven now filed for divorce. Now, they have children for a little older brother and a little older daughter that look nearly identical.

"At that point I'm having to get it off. I don't want my kids to have to live with the fact that, for two years, I will be there and do the little things to make sure they're OK," says Lyle.
