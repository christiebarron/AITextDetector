I'll never forget the time I visited my great-aunt's house with my family. She had been living in her house since the 1940s and her home was filled with old furniture and trinkets from her life. Each time we visited her, we always had a lot of laughs. 

On this particular day, my aunt had prepared a delicious lunch for us and we were enjoying the meal in her dining room. As we were eating, I heard a noise that sounded like it was coming from the living room. When we went to check it out, we discovered that her old rocking chair had started rocking by itself! 

We all started to laugh. My aunt was so confused that she couldn't stop laughing. The chair must have had some kind of ghostly inhabitant because it kept rocking for several minutes! After we all stopped laughing, we took turns sitting in the chair to see if we could get it to start rocking again, but it just stayed still. 

My aunt just shrugged her shoulders and said "Well, I guess it's just another one of the mysteries of this old house!" We all laughed again. That moment is etched in my memory forever and has been a wonderful reminder of how laughter can bring people together, no matter the situation.
