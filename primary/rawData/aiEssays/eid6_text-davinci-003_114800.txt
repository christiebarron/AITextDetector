The building of the Empire State Building posed interesting and unique obstacles related to the decision to include a mooring mast for dirigibles, or airships. When the plans for the building were first drawn, the mooring mast was included with the hope that it would help to usher in a new era of air travel for passengers and mail â€“ an era powered by helium-inflated airships. The decision was revolutionary for its time and spurred great debate as to the practicality of using the mast to moor these large, unwieldy vessels. 

One of the biggest obstacles for the builders of the Empire State Building was assessing if the mast could withstand the pressures and stresses of mooring such large vessels without causing damage to the airships or the building itself. Scientists of the time understood the principles behind floating and helicoptering, but they were uncertain if the mast and the building itself could withstand the stresses of refueling, anchor, and passenger disembarkation. To ensure the safety of the airships and those on board, the engineers studied wind shear, air masses, and even tested designs of the mooring mast with metal scale models.

The second obstacle engineers faced was the tethering of the airships. Because no pilot of the time had firsthand experience in maneuvering at a mooring station, engineers had to develop a secure and efficient mooring method that would help ensure the safety of the vessel and its passengers. This was
