I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is the most successful way to address the problems that threaten libraries and our children," she said.

In the aftermath of last week's shooting that left 12 people dead, public outcry and support for the "Stand Your Ground" policy has been strong.

Last month, Texas Governor Greg Abbott announced he would veto a bill that would give local law enforcement the right to use deadly force if they believe a person is an "enemy combatant." Abbott's office did not respond Monday to a request for comment about the bill.

Critics said Friday's shooting was an act by police who will be required to use deadly force.

"This comes just as gun control supporters are threatening to use lethal force if we stop the use of deadly force against black people or black people of color," said John D. Whelan, chief executive of the Texas Public Policy Association.

The bill provides a new definition and protections for law enforcement to take an officer's handbearing over the life or property of a person they believe is an enemy combatant while also providing for certain forms of retaliation if the officer fires. Whelan said it could be much easier for law enforcement to file a suit if one in 30 people in Texas lives in a prison or other community service center and has never faced a physical or psychological disturbance. Those types of cases often qualify for special protections.
