I had a really difficult day at work, and by the time I came home I was exhausted. All I wanted to do was relax and get some rest. However, my daughter had other ideas. She was filled with energy and wanted me to play with her. I could feel my patience waning, but I knew it was important to take the time for her. I forced a smile and we spent the next hour playing together. And I was rewarded with her beautiful laughter. Sheady finally fell asleep and I was able to take a well deserved nap. I was so glad that I took the time to be patient with her. It was worth the exhaustion.
