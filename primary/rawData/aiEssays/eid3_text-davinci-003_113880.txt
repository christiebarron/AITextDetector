In Joe Kurmaski’s short story, “Rough Road Ahead”, the features of the setting have a major effect on the cyclist, and greatly contribute to the overall tension and suspense created throughout the story. Kurmaski uses descriptive imagery and language to illustrate an unforgiving and primitive environment. The rider comes “around a tight bend in the old, rough, narrow, rocky road” that leads them further and further away from the city and civilization. This creates a sense of dread for the rider, as they have a growing feeling of being alone in a harsh, unwelcoming land. 

Kurmaski also uses the setting to emphasize the rider’s sense of disorientation. In the middle of their journey, the rider comes across a fork in the road and is unsure of what direction to take. Without the guidance of people or recognition of places, the rider feels lost in the unknown land. As they progress on their journey, the rider is instinctively aware of the increasing and looming danger, unable to recognize from which direction the danger is coming. As such, the unknown and unpredictable nature of the wilderness adds to the rider’s sense of peril. 

The physical landscape of the story presents the character with a vast array of natural obstacles. The rough terrain tests the rider’s strength and agility, making the simple act of cycling a challenge. This is another factor that creates a sense of tension
