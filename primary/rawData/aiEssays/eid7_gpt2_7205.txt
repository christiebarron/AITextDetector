An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when she wrote about how her brother went on to write the song 'Hymns of the Dead'. She used it in the song on her way to work. I was writing lyrics to this song on a piece of paper. She wanted to go and hear some song that she had written while I was writing that song on a piece of paper, so, she started playing it for me and kept coming back to it. And I can say now that I felt very touched by it. And it resonated so much with me as I listened to it and read the lyrics to it over and over again – it wasn't all about me being a ghost, it was all about where there was a dark place and in all these places there was a ghost of myself. When you read this song, it is a wonderful song. It is a story of me. But, it's been said about many times and many people over the years have said that a lot of time has passed. I don't think I should worry about that but, in the back of my mind I was thinking: you know – the story is over.

I think it is too often the stories – they have been told about some person who has been ghosted. That's a good one to take up. My mother said "it must have been somebody's mother…" I can almost see a lot of times. I think more people read the stories
