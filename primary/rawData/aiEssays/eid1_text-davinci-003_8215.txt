The Empire State Building was a grand achievement in New York City in 1931, and its distinctive mooring mast was one of its most remarkable features at the time. This structure was designed to accommodate the needs of dirigibles, or large airships, so that they could dock at the top of the building and provide access to the public. However, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock.

The most obvious hurdle was the limited amount of space available at the top of the building, especially since the mooring mast alone was 80 feet tall. There was no way to accommodate a dirigible of any kind in such a restricted area. Secondly, the process of mooring a dirigible to the mast would involve extreme care and skill, since there was very little room for error. Any mistake could cause considerable damage to the structure, making dirigibles a risky endeavor. Finally, the Empire State Building lacked the structural integrity necessary to withstand the immense force of a large airship docking to it. A dirigible moving at high speeds could easily knock the mast off balance, sending the entire building into disarray.

Given these obstacles, the builders of the Empire State Building needed to come up with innovative solutions in order to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. To overcome the limited space restriction, they decided to construct a single platform just beyond the mooring mast that
