Narciso Rodriguez’s memoir, From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, is a collection of stories chronicling his life journey. Throughout the book, Rodriguez creates a mood of reflection, wonderment, and longing.

The memoir is full of stories that follow Rodriguez from his early childhood in Puerto Rico to adulthood in New York City. Each recounting of his experience paints a vivid portrait of his past, as if the reader is transported back in time. Rodriguez is able to capture the emotions of his youth by reflecting on memorable moments and recalling objects and colors that had an impact on his life. This creates a mood of reflection that sparkles nostalgia and allows the reader to ponder on how their own lives have been influenced by their past.

Interspersed throughout Rodriguez’s tales are moments of wonderment. The author often evaluates his experiences from a unique perspective, giving the reader insight into his thought process. He will describe how a moment in time or an unexpected encounter left a lasting impression or changed the course of his life. From those musings, a sense of passive awe is created as the reader is compelled to think of how life’s moments are interconnected.

The longing in the memoir comes in the moments of time where the reader is shown the connections Rodriguez has with his family and friends. He recalls how he felt looking at a picture of his mother before she passed away or the comfort he receives from the place of his childhood
