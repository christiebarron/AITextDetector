 

Dear [Editor]:

As computers become increasingly common, their effects on people have become more and more apparent. On the one hand, computers can be used as a tool to help simplify many aspects of life. For example, computers can be used to streamline communication and help to organize busy schedules.

On the other hand, computers can also have a detrimental effect on people. Too much time spent on computers can lead to a lack of physical activity and social interactions. It can also lead to a decrease in creativity as people spend little time engaging in hands on activities.

Overall, it is important to remember that computers can be beneficial when used properly. However, computers should only be used in moderation to maintain a balance between virtual and physical activities. Excessive use of computers can lead to health and social issues. 

I urge all readers to be mindful of their computer usage and consider the effects it could have on their well-being.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
