Dear Editor:

Computer technology has revolutionized the modern world and has become an integral part of our everyday lives. It is clear that computers have had a profound impact on human life, from the ease with which we communicate and share information, to the increased efficiency and productivity of businesses.

Despite the obvious advantages of computers, it is important to consider the potential risks associated with over-exposure to them. Recent studies have indicated that, in extreme cases, excessive computer use can lead to physical symptoms such as headaches, repetitive strain injury, and eye strain. Additionally, some people may suffer from depression due to the isolating nature of computers and online activities.

It is therefore essential that computer use is regulated and individuals are not exposed to extreme computer usage, especially if not done in moderation. This might require setting aside specific time for gaming or other online activities, and limiting total time spent with computers during the day.

All in all, the benefits of computers are certainly undeniable, but in order to fully reap the benefits of this amazing technology, limits must be imposed on computer usage. I strongly urge readers to consider the potential risks associated with computer use and to approach it with moderation.

Sincerely,
