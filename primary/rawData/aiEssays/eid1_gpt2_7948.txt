Computers have many effects on people. In the lab, we use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to measure which aspects999 of the brain are involved in the development, processes and functioning of emotions. The only way we know what those are is to look for signs of the specific physical features (such as head orientation) our brain might be trying to interpret. But we're not sure what those might look like, so we decided to look at the brain of a chimpanzee, a typical human who uses his or her unique environment quite often to deal with such problems, and find what we think is very important for our understanding human cognitive and emotional control. The study of chimp interactions with chimpanzees is also fascinating, because it involved looking for signs of the complex structures of the human brain. For example, monkeys experience certain kinds of sensory events - but in response to a certain stimuli, the brain does not process them in the usual way so they have to be processed through a different process. "Because our work on chimp activity in a chimpanzee environment is ongoing, this may offer new clues to us about how human and nonhuman cognition differs," says study coauthor L. Veegen, professor of behavioral psychology at The Ohio State University. And in our project, we think it could be possible that human and wild chimpanzees exhibit one of the behaviors that distinguishes chimpanzees from other primates, the ability to process a complex stimulus in order to respond appropriately to that stimulus, as reported in A Thousand
