In today's society, censorship is a hotly debated topic. This is especially true when it comes to libraries, as libraries are responsible for providing access to a variety of materials to the public. While these materials may contain ideas or images which are deemed offensive, libraries must uphold their commitment to free thought and expression, and not succumb to censorship. 

The first principle that governs the freedom of libraries to share information is the belief that everyone should be able to have access to a wide variety of materials in an equally open setting. Censoring content is tantamount to censorship of ideas, which is an assault on freedom of thought. A library must remain open to a variety of ideas, not just those deemed acceptable by a single party or majority. No one should be subject to censorship of any kind; therefore, libraries should not indulge in it. 

Furthermore, censoring materials might make it difficult for researchers to conduct valid research. Materials that address sensitive topics may provide valuable insight into the popular culture of a particular time period, and censoring these materials may not only prevent future researchers from having access to these materials, but also limit our understanding of the past. 

It is important to note that libraries do have a responsibility to protect minors from materials that are deemed offensive. This is why most libraries have policies in place that call for the restricted access of these materials to adults or require that they be in special collections which are restricted to only those over 18 or 21 years
