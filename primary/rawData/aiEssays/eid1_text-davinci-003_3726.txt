Dear Editor,

In a world that has become increasingly reliant on technology and digitalization, the effects of computers on society have become undeniable. As humanity evolves, it is important to understand the implications of this new digital age.

In many ways, computers have made life much easier and more efficient. Students and professionals can communicate and collaborate from remote locations across the world and access vast troves of information with the click of a button. Yet, the increasingly entwined web of digital interconnectivity has undeniable consequences.

Most notably, computers can lead to severe disconnection from reality. People today spend hours upon hours in front of screens, either working or playing games, and think less and less of what is happening outside their living rooms. Society can slowly devolve into senseless consumption of artificial awakenings and the loss of amazement for the physical world.

That is not to say that computers should be discouraged or not implemented. On the contrary, computers can and should be used as powerful tools in different aspects of life. My suggestion is that a healthy balance is achieved with the use of computers and that the human connection with the physical world does not break.

Thank you,

[Your Name]
