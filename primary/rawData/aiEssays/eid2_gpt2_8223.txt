I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a serious problem that needs to be addressed. For me, it's a real problem, because I care about other things than the general public's faith in free speech."

The most recent example would be a letter from the National Endowment for Democracy's director, George P. Patras:

On Monday, Patras issued a statement, titled "Letter to the editor about the First Amendment of our Constitution." It said: "For many Americans it is critical to see content protected by our Constitution and that this free speech principle is central to our democratic system. The recent Supreme Court decision in Citizens United was not a good look for these values misunderstanding. In a democracy our representatives should treat each other fairly at table. I want to draw a distinction between the Constitution and the First Amendment of America. As my fellow Founding Fathers stated in the Declaration of Independence, "For the People of the United States, liberty consists in the exercise of speech." The fact that the Supreme Court has denied the First Amendment to all forms of speech does not detract from these values. Instead, we have a system of "fairness," i.e. the public's right to know the views of its Members of Congress. Without this system, our laws would not be able to function and we would not have even "the possibility of even our own citizens knowing about what we are doing."
