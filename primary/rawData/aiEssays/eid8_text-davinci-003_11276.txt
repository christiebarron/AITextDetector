I remember when I first met my husband. We had taken a dance class together and I had been so nervous. He was so confident and charming that I was sure he wouldn't give me a second glance and it seemed like he was totally blowing off the class.

But then he started to laugh at something I had said, and it made me nervous all over again. I felt my cheeks flush and my heart pounding. But his laughter was contagious and soon I had started to laugh too.

We kept chatting during the class and soon it felt like we had known each other for ages, even though we had just met. We kept laughing at each other's silliness and stories throughout the class and by the end of it I knew without a doubt that I wanted to be with him forever. 

More than five years later, laughter is still an important part of our relationship. We can't get through a conversation without laughing at least once and it always brings us together.

We’ve experienced sadness and heartache but we’ve also shared celebrations and a lot of silliness. And all the while, we've been connected by laughter.
