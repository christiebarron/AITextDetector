I believe that censorship of materials in libraries that are distributed under a political program called the Communist Party Platform is unconstitutional. This is what happened in Berkeley, and I am deeply saddened that the Berkeley Press has become a platform for a political movement that has been using violence to silence free speech and dissent for many decades."

In November 2012, Berkeley police arrested one person for writing a letter to former President Barack Obama.

According to the letter, the college said it would be in the best interest of the liberal arts at Berkeley to teach free speech under a "free press" program designed to make the liberal arts more open and free to all.

In the following weeks, Berkeley officials started using the phrase "free speech" as the epithet to express support for freedom, according to Campus Reform.

During the administration of President Obama's former chief of staff, White House press secretary Jay Carney said that free speech requires an ability to "share ideas, build bridges or educate others in an authentic and tolerant way. The words 'free speech' and 'democracy' should be the single best tools for achieving this."
