The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In the 1940s, the Civil Air Transport Commission put a brake on its use of dirigibles, a decision which has largely remained the basis for the federal government.

In the US, where the FAA does not specify how long it will take to approve a dirigible, it is typically one year after the completion of final construction. The DOT then considers an operator's request in writing and approves the dirigible.

The FAA will not have to approve or disapprove a dirigible with a lifetime of service. Rather, the agency will evaluate the safety or environmental considerations for the vehicle.

The only thing that will prevent a dirigible from docking – or re-entry – in the US, and so may keep it there, is the federal government.
