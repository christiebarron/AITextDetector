The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The most common was that most of them were long and flat buildings. These were not as sleek as the first dirigibles, and they needed to be large and powerful for these objects. The Empire State Building's top was also long and wide, though its doors were in a cot. The building's roof was a bit too tight, so it gave off a metallic appearance.

The first dirigibles were light in composition, but the steel used for everything lay flat on the ground. The light on top of the Empire State Building took on a more human appearance, making the buildings almost as tall. The steel needed was more resilient than in the early days. The Empire State Building's doors, like many building designs of the day, needed special fittings to help protect them from the elements. One special piece of steel lay close to two-thirds of an inch deep. It was called a hilt.

The building began as a small building, but gradually became a huge one before settling down into the style that came with the times. It would eventually become one of the world's largest skyscrapers. There were many variations of the Empire State Building, from simple office structures to large luxury condos. The original roof of the Empire State Building was an early prototype, making it one of the most detailed for-sale buildings in the world.
