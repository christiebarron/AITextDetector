The features of the setting in "Rough Road Ahead" heavily affect the cyclist in this story and shape the entire narrative. The cyclist is not identified by name, but they face a grueling and dangerous journey up a mountain road in an unnamed foreign country. The road is treacherous - filled with dirt, bridges, potholes, tight turns, cliffs, and inclines. 

The danger and difficulty of this route put a huge psychological and physical strain on the cyclist. Even getting started is an issue as the cyclist has to push their bike for more than two miles up a winding road. The cyclist also has to maintain a focus and sharpness to safely navigate the various obstacles and keep their bike under control. 

More than anything, the harshness of the setting helps to elevate the tension and suspense in the story. Static elements like the road itself and the steep climbs can felt by the cyclist. While more kinetic elements like the dirt flying up into the cyclist's eyes, the tight turns, and the blinding sun all draw out the physical and mental struggle of the cyclist. 

In this way, the setting of "Rough Road Ahead" imposes its own danger on the cyclist, and these features bring a unique kind of chaos and intensity that heightens the urgency and danger of the overall story.
