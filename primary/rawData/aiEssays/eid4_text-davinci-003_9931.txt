The author of Winter Hibiscus, Minfong Ho, ends with this idea of hope and renewal. The reference to the snows melting, the geese returning, and the hibiscus budding implies the beginning of a new season and a new start. The phrase “take that test again” could mean any test, whether it's a literal school-related exam or a figurative test of life. It's a reminder that life will go on, regardless of what has happened. It encourages people to never give up, and to always look forward to better things ahead.
