I never could understand why people thought my cousin and I were brother and sister â€“ we look nothing like each other. But when people found out, something strange always happened: they'd start smiling, and the room would quickly fill with laughter.

For as long as I can remember, my cousin and I have been the best of friends. We were always together, and no matter what, we had each other's back. But what really bonded us was our shared love of laughter.

Whether it was our shared jokes about the silliest of things, or just falling about laughing over something goofy we'd done, our laughter was contagious. Whenever we'd get together, it was like everyone else in the room couldn't help but get swept up in it, joining us with loud guffaws and contagious cackles.

The thing about laughter is that it always breaks the ice and brings people together, no matter how different they may be. I treasure the moments when my cousin and I and our friends would laugh until we were in tears, our bellies aching, because it meant that the barriers between us were erasing, and that love and friendship would take their place.
