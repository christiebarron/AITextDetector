I was in line at the grocery store when I noticed an elderly woman who seemed to be struggling with reading the instructions for the product she was buying. She took a long time and seemed very confused. 

I decided to be patient and wait in line. I watched as she finally read the instructions and then slowly reached in her pocket for her coins to pay. As the clerk counted out each coin, I could see the woman's hands shaking. 

I offered to help her count, but she politely refused. I was impressed by her determination to do it herself. She finally finished, and I was glad that I was patient and didn't rush her. I told her she had done a great job and she smiled.
