I recently had an incident at a store where I witnessed someone demonstrate admirable patience. I was at the register, waiting to buy some items from the store, when another customer entered the store. It was quite busy and we were being served on a first-come, first-served basis. 

The customer was obviously frustrated upon entering, as the store was very busy. She asked if she could be served first and the salesperson politely declined. The customer could have argued and complained, but instead she took a step back and apologized for her outburst. She then calmly waited her turn in line.

I was not only impressed by her patience and respect for the store, but also her respect for the other customers in the store. She understood the store's policy and respected it. It made me really appreciate the fact that she was considerate enough to think about everyone else in the situation, instead of just her.

It was a humbling experience and it showed me that patience can be a powerful thing. Even in the face of frustration and annoyance, it was great that this customer was able to stay calm and patient in the situation. I'm sure the other customers around her appreciated it too.
