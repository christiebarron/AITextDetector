The final lines of this poem serve as a metaphor for the narrator's personal growth. The hibiscus is a plant that typically blooms during the summer months, but despite the cold of winter, it can still bloom when the snow melts and the geese return. Similarly, by taking the test again in the spring, the narrator is metaphorically "blooming" despite whatever hardships they may have experienced over the winter. Through this metaphor, they are showing the determination and strength of character needed to persevere through hard times and rediscover personal growth.
