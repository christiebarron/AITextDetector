Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have had on people over the years. As you are probably aware, computers have become a ubiquitous part of our daily lives.

However, I believe that computers can have both positive and negative effects on people, depending on how they are used. On the one hand, computers can enable people to do work more efficiently and effectively. Technology has enabled us to automate many tasks, allowing people to focus on more important matters. Computers have also allowed us to stay in touch with family and friends all over the world.

On the other hand, an overuse of computers can have negative consequences. For instance, it can lead to physical inactivity, as people spend long hours sitting in front of the computer. It can also be detrimental to a personâ€™s mental health, as they can become addicted to social media or gaming.

To conclude, we should be mindful of the effects computers have on us and use them in moderation. We should use them to enhance our lives, rather than letting them take over. I urge readers to think about how they use their computers and to consider the potential effects it could have on their health and well-being.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
