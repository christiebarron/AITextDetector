The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' has been, "I never expected this. It's a really simple story. This is real. One minute people just talk about it, the next day they find it in their local newspapers."

Her first book published in 2009, 'The Burden of Reality,' was a follow-up to The Burden of Despair.

'The first step was to create a story of a person in the world of the memoir and that was the end of the tale,' she says. 'And it has become clear that the book is only a piece of it. In the way it deals with this human struggle, this human human struggle and the stories that have come after that are now the result of the book having been given to me."
