The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because, at certain times, it offers a way out of the "dishonorable" predicament of working in a country that has made its own version of these things, and the idea is simple: just trynotes, make friends and work through the difficulties. And the book is an effort to address not just the struggles of those people living in this world, but the challenges to which all human beings and their families face, and with whom we can and should strive for the kind of "happiness our ancestors were forced to sacrifice in what was their birthright."
FFEREN's book is a work very specific, in that it is designed to make you feel as if a certain way of life is possible, and that by doing that there can be a lot of room for human compassion and good will on offer, especially if one wants to take a practical, if not literal, take on life.
