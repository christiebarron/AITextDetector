I had been hanging out with my best friend all evening at his house and the night was coming to a close. We had talked about everything under the sun and we had achieved little to no progress on any of our respective tasks. 

We decided to relax and watch a movie, something funny and lighthearted. We both had a knack for comedy so we were sure to be in for a good laugh. As the night progressed, we found ourselves sharing glances and smirking.

At one point, a joke was delivered and we both burst into laughter, soon unable to contain ourselves. It was the kind of laughter that you can only experience with someone you truly enjoy being around. 

Through shared laughter, I could sense a bond that had been stronger than ever before. I don’t think I ever felt closer to him than I did in that moment. 

We laughed for what seemed like hours, until our stomachs ached and our throats were parched. But in that moment, I hadn’t felt any happier. 

Laughter truly did bridge the gap between us to create a stronger connection that I will cherish for a long time to come.
