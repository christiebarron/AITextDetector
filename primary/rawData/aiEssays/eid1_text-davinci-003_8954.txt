Dear Editor,

I am writing to discuss the ways computers have positively and negatively impacted society. While technology undeniably brings many helpful and convenient advances to humanity, it is important to note the potential consequences of rapid technology development. 

In the positive sense, computers are great tools for communication, allowing us to connect with people around the world in ways that werenâ€™t possible before. The Internet also provides us with vast amounts of knowledge and research, furthering the pursuit of knowledge and enabling us to perform more efficiently.

However, computers can also have adverse effects on people. For instance, there are growing concerns over addiction to internet-based activities, as well as overstimulation. They can also be abused for criminal activities, such as online fraud and hacking. 

Furthermore, some researchers argue that technology can lead to health issues from sitting for extended periods of time and extended exposure to blue light from computer displays. Our brains may also be affected in ways we cannot predict, as our brains can be rewired to responses that technology provides.

In conclusion, the usage of computers must be managed with caution. While computers are incredible tools, they can also lead to various health and safety issues. We must be mindful of this and take steps to ensure that we use technology responsibly and safely.

Sincerely,
