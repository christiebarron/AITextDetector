I felt like I had just stepped into a stand-up comedy show when I met my now best friend. From the second we laid eyes on each other, the silliness and fun of our conversation had us in fits of laughter. We had been set up by a mutual friend, and the chemistry between us was palpable.

I think it was our shared sense of humour that sealed the deal. No matter how hard I tried to keep a straight face, there was always something funny to say. Whether it was witty banter between us or an awkward comment that totally deflated the conversation, we would end up in hysterics all the same.

We also got along so well because both of us weren't afraid to poke fun at ourselves. We would joke about our shortcomings and laugh them off with each other. Whenever one of us made a clumsy mistake, we weren't embarrassed or ashamed; we just burst into fits of laughter and soon enough, we were both rolling on the ground clutching our stomachs.

Since meeting that day, it's been three years of non-stop laughing and laughing. We rarely take ourselves too seriously, and I wouldn't have it any other way. They say laughter is the shortest distance between two people, and I can truly say that it's what bonded us together.
