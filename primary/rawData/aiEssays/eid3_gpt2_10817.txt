• Long term impacts, like increased congestion on roads, can cause the problem of cycling without mitigating the effect. The following figure shows the effect of cycling in three short-term cycling conditions to two years: In the first cycle conditions, the cyclist is often unable to take the bike for hours at a time, and on weekends the average amount of time for short-distance travel could be reduced by 90%. In the second cycle conditions, the cycle speed is very high and it is difficult to make long journeys of a longer width, but the cyclist has made a lot of small progress.

• The main road that takes cyclists into the cycling conditions in 'Rough Road Ahead' is much less congested than the long-term conditions. Long term outcomes, for example, are not clear. In some scenarios the cycling speed could be 20 km/h or more, and there are other factors at play.

• Long distance travel is difficult and unpredictable in a short-term and it is likely that there will be other factors at play. In most cases the cycling speed will increase in the late summer or fall. In the longer term the speed will be very different, with most roads being slightly less congested. On roads that are very long such as Wellington and Brantley it will be very difficult to maintain a long distance.
