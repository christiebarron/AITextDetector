Dear Editor, 

I believe computers can have both positive and negative effects on people, depending on how they are used. While computers can be a powerful source of education, entertainment and connection, they can also have detrimental effects if used inappropriately. 

As computers have become ubiquitous in modern society, many people find their daily lives dependent on them. This over-reliance on computers can impede a person's natural development as it reduces physical exercise and disconnects us from our surroundings. As human beings, we need to be outdoors and interacting with others in order to thrive both mentally and physically. 

That said, computers can also be very beneficial. By using computers, people can stay connected with friends and family across the globe. It can provide access to an unlimited wealth of information. With the growing presence of the internet, endless news, cultural resources, and educational materials are available to us at the click of a button. 

However, we must remain aware of our digital consumption and the ways we use computers. We need to be aware of our screen time and make sure it is being used in a constructive way, and that it does not take away from our connection to the real world and our loved ones.

Sincerely,
[Your name]
