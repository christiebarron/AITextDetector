I was out for dinner with my best friend the other night. We went to a small Italian restaurant and were enjoying our dinner when we both noticed a couple seated at the table next to us. They seemed to be having a romantic evening and so we agreed to give them some privacy. 

As the night progressed, however, things started to get a little awkward. The couple was clearly uncomfortable and had few topics of conversation. That is until our eyes met. We all started to laugh at the same time and the next thing we knew, we were having a full-blown conversation about the fun times we were having.

It was nice to have a connection with someone so random and the laughter brought us closer together. The couple even recommended a restaurant for us to check out. Laughter definitely broke down all the barriers and brought us closer together that night.
