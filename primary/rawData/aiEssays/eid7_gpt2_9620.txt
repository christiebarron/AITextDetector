An example of a time someone in my life was patient was at the beach. I'm sure I can remember this feeling: I got on the water and I ran away. There were people with a big grin that I'd never seen before. I got off the beach to meet those people, and at one point in time this grin went down through my body. It could be said that I lost a lot of pounds in this new bikini. Now who is it, just from this experience I don't think I would ever be able to say, "Hey, she looks good in a bikini."

In addition to my post on my "skinny bikini photos in my bikini tank" post, I also am sharing a link to a link to my "skinny bikini post" post here here on the NakedBodyBlog.

What, then, do you plan to do for your fat-free life?
