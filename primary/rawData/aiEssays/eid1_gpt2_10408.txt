Computers have many effects on people. Many of these impacts are reversible. As you grow, new ways to communicate become more acceptable. In particular, the emergence of the Internet in large part created a "digital age." And it's also because digital communication is so good at generating unique experiences that social interaction is almost impossible without computer science graduates.

In any of these scenarios, the problem should be solved with computers that can deliver more relevant information. But one thing is clear: that's not going to happen. A digital economy that emphasizes customer service to attract a customer's attention is likely to attract a lot less people than one that requires a centralized database of all the known customers.

We'd need a more competitive system to attract more customers. In the short-run, technology may not be a good tool to capture all of the customer interest; it may not be a great tool to help customers capture more and offer a more personalized experience that's attractive to those with more experience.

Ultimately, a digital economy won't solve the problem we face; it will be a better way to get more people to give a different view of what their world looks like.
