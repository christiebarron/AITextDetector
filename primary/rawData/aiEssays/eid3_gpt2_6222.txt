Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. Whether you're racing with a young cyclist or a person who's only coming from their first road trip (whether or not the person wants to be involved on the roads are much better decisions than driving them over to their car), Rough Road Ahead can help you achieve a variety of specific goals on that journey, which in turn may make for better and more enjoyable lives.

The 'Greater Road Ahead' setting was created for the 2012 Games and has been updated with the latest in road and infrastructure news, improvements and road safety statistics. If you're enjoying Rough Road Ahead as much as we appreciate you, then you're clearly in good hands as the 2014-2015 cycle season will be shaping up to be the best time of the year. All the key features and performance benefits will be included as part of that year-round set of content.


Rough Road Ahead is available in high-res PDF and also as a paperback book.
