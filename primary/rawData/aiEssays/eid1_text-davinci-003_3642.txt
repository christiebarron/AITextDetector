I write this letter to express my opinion on the effects computers have had on people in our society. It is the opinion of many that computers are hindering human relationships, decreasing our ability to think for ourselves, and creating a dependence on technology. However, I stand in strong opposition to this view.

Computers can enhance our human relationships when used properly. Contrary to popular belief, they do not bring us closer to an apocalypse of isolated ‘hive minds’, but allow us to interact with people around the world. Social media, video calls and voice interactions all provide a platform to collaborate on projects and share ideas seamlessly. In this way, computers can easily play an important role in the development of workspaces, educational institutions and social organizations.

Furthermore, computers do not limit our ability to think for ourselves. On the contrary, computer programs give us access to vast knowledge, allowing us to explore and discover new things. Instead of being a crutch, they’re actually a helpful tool that can help us develop our creative and analytical problem-solving skills. Moreover, they make it easier for us to complete tasks like researching and writing about a certain topic.

Finally, computers don't create a complete dependence on technology. Even if someone desires instant information delivered to them, they can still use the resource intelligently. Computer technology can now be utilized in a way that allows us to make faster and better-informed
