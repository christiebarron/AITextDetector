I met my friend Ian at a party. We had became instant friends and chatted for the rest of the night. After a while, Ianâ€™s friend arrived at the party. As soon as his friend walked in, Ian let out laugh that was so loud and infectious that I couldn't help but join in. I had no idea why he laughed but there was something about the way he looked at his friend that made us both realize how ridiculous and wonderful life could be.

We both laughed until we had tears in our eyes, and then suddenly, everything seemed to melt away. We had all the time in the world to figure out what was so funny. Every time we tried to remember, it would immediately send us into another bout of hilarity.

That moment was the start of a lifelong friendship. We could always make each other laugh and I am so thankful for that. Laughter truly can bridge any gap between two people and I will always treasure that moment.
