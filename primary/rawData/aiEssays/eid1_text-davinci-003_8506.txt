It was one of the busiest days I've ever had at the office. I had just taken on a new project and was still learning how to do everything, so working was quite difficult and overwhelming. I could feel my impatience bubbling up, but I was determined to stay patient and get through the day.

I had been stuck on a problem for hours and no matter what I tried, I just couldn't seem to solve it. My stress levels peaked and I felt like giving up. Then, out of the corner of my eye, I saw my manager watching me with a kind and understanding look. She must have seen that I was feeling overwhelmed, because she came over to me and calmly offered to help.

She began to show me different ways I could tackle the problem and explained it in a way that made sense. I was so grateful for her patience and her help, and by the end of the day I felt successful.

That experience really taught me the importance of patience and I'm now better equipped to handle stressful situations.
