The idea of dirigibles (airships) docking on the Empire State Building was a bold innovation of the time. Docking such large aircraft on a building was unprecedented; however, this remarkable engineering feat was not without its challenges, as builders of the Empire State Building soon discovered.

In order to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building, a large steel “mooring mast” was constructed on the top of the building. This mast had to be extremely durable, since it was required to bear the weight of numerous airships. To meet this challenge, the mast was constructed from made of steel bars, each thicker than a human arm, and held together by hundreds of rivets.

Besides the structural issues, the builders of the Empire State Building were also faced with the issue of allowing the dirigibles to safely dock on the building. This required special mooring technology, a system that had never been employed before. The mooring scheme was designed to use large steel cables that extended from the airship to the mooring mast on the rooftop. This allowed the airship to be secured while providing an adjustable rest area for the cargo and passengers.

In addition to creating the mooring mast and designing the docking mechanism, the engineers also had to contend with the propellers of the dirigibles. These powerful engines had the potential to damage the tower, the upper floors, and even the top of the building.
