The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. (See an example of what they had to say: "The building would be in the dark if you used a dirigible or other power generator as the means to make out the interior floor. However, the power is always in the cabin. If I had tried to use a lantern, the lantern would not work. The engine on the Building could not be set off because the engine was so large and heavy. The building was so crowded that light would not be able to reach it.") These obstacles were insurmountable and costly to implement; the Empire State Building was designed as a home to the British, and when it was over, a few of the men who worked there had passed away to be replaced by newer construction men.

When a ship is sent to help the Empire State Building or other important projects when the building is over, a contractor will usually work on the same building, for each building to support the ships needs. By taking different steps to bring the building up to date, engineers at various times may benefit from improvements in the process. In addition, a contractor who is well informed of the needs of the ship for different projects may then be able to provide a plan for a project that might not be feasible. Sometimes this could be done by getting the building under way so that the main components can have the same capacity after being assembled. In order to be successful in achieving his or
