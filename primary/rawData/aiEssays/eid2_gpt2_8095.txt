I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is what we must begin to tackle with the reform of education and the development of education programs in the nation," Sanders said in the statement. "The next generation of teachers will understand that the teacher contract is just another way in which we do not share our values and that teachers must do their job of providing for their students."

After speaking at the Library of Congress in Washington a month ago, Sanders said he's never met with President Obama to learn about the library system or to share his personal experiences in dealing with it.

"No one who has ever tried to learn about education in that way has come up from here at the Library," Sanders said. "This cannot be the Library, where there are no free texts. You cannot find teachers who are willing to share their stories, but we do have hundreds and hundreds of books that are available to students TiG and other communities."

Sanders has advocated for improving education at the library, which he said would encourage children to pursue higher education opportunities "to help the many underprivileged to achieve their potential." The National Education Association reported in 2015 that as of 2014 some 2,125 state and national libraries served the public's needs, though that figure would have declined if Congress enacted legislation to implement his effort.
