Tiffany Bizarre, who lives in San Diego with her mother Karen, is currently working on a song for Kanye's album 'Living With Cancer', which he is scheduled to release this summer. It was written after her father died in 2008.

According to a statement from the rapper, he hoped it would inspire potential fans with his upcoming music project.

A video for the project is due out on Friday in the United States.

Faced with the threat of losing every single song he plays for the record label, Bizarre recently spoke about living life as a normal person.

Karen Bizarre recently spoke about how her life has changed. She tells The Daily Beast about how she is now at home with her mom when her dad died.

On June 12, 2015, Karen was diagnosed with cancer, and after a full 24-hour medical evaluation in late 2015, she was able to pass what was diagnosed as a "non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."
