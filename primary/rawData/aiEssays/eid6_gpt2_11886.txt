The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, they didn't have access to ground-floor plumbing. This meant that the engines and controls that run the Empire State Building were outside of the factory's control, creating an enormous amount of noise. Secondly, in the early 2000s, the only means of controlling and maintaining the building was to be using small, non-conductive, rotating magnets. To control the elevator, a magnetic strip needed to drive a wire or a wire-based cable that provided no electric current at all or that could be tied to the ground. The building's owners, the State of New York, decided to use a series of methods, including a "rigid" magnetic strip, which is used to guide the elevator, the "stick-mounted" mechanism called a "cassette" that automatically controls the car, and the "stick-mounted" mechanism to keep an elevator shaft moving. Because they would only have the "stick-mounted" mechanism to guide the car, the builders kept the building's power steering in low standby mode.

With the release of the Star Wars Episode VII to the public for the first time as Star Wars Insider, you can see some of the features and concepts of the Empire State Building in action. The video above goes into more detail about the project, but you'll have to read all about the details to read those spoilers.
