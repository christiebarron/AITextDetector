I remember one night when I was out with my friends at a local bar, and we were having a great time just talking and laughing. At one point, I was telling a joke that I had read recently, and it incited a lot of laughter from our group. Just then, a fellow patron, who had been listening to our conversation, spoke up and said, "You all must be really good friends because laughter like that comes from a really deep connection." I was so taken aback and surprised by his comment, but I guess he was right. We all laughed it off and kept having a great time. 

From that moment on, I have realized that laughter is an important part of friendships and relationships. It helps to break the ice, keeps your spirits up, and brings people closer together. I have also found that sharing jokes and funny stories is a great way to bond with people and really get to know them better. Laughter truly is the best medicine and the shortest distance between two people.
