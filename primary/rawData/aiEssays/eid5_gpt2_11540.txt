The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' (written in the fall of 2007) was to show how his parents, his new college classmate Adrienne Lee (played by Emma Roberts) and at least one other teenager from the school, James "Nathaniel" Dorn, could be seen as unruly by the day, with a habit of going rogue when they weren't. To give one the idea that even the most timid and timid children are not always as free and independent as they'd like: 'This is for life.'


In the wake of Nathaniel's death, that fear is growing stronger, his friends and family say. "That's what is upsetting when my mum had to leave the classroom just to watch him die," said John Mottle, who is friends with Nathaniel's eldest brother James. "They think they're the best for her. So they're saying, how did he grow up as an independent?"


Nathaniel and his friends have come to terms with the fact that he is the youngest of their four brothers and that he is now the youngest of three of them, and has a life of his own. What is particularly worrying for Nathaniel is that they are seeing him as his brother and that at what was the first time they met is now their only child, having grown up in the same home after his first experience with the bullies they described to their parents.
