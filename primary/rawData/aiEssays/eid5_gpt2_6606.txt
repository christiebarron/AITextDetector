The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' was an affirmation that life had become the same as previously imagined.

"I was doing therapy and I was struggling to hold my head up high," she said. "I got sick of thinking 'Maybe I can talk about my life if I'm lucky' and it was like 'I need to be honest with myself because it is my last chance."

As far as the work is concerned, the book offers her hope that people with dementia can find ways of reliving the memories of those who were able in their prime.

"I'll always remember my life as a person that people unavailable in my prime or even just looking back may remember and relive with them â€” something that will never disappear with time or technology," she said of the words 'from home'.
