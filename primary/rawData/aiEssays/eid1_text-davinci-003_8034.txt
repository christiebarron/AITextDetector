The Empire State Building was an ambitious project started in 1930 that would come to define the New York skyline. As part of its construction, the designers included a two-story gantry at the top of the building to allow dirigibles to dock. This was a novel idea but came with numerous engineering challenges. 

One of the primary obstacles was ensuring the mast would securely hold the airship in place while it was docked. Engineers determined the mast should be constructed using a steel gantry with thick supports and equipped with a mooring cable 1,000 feet in length and three feet in circumference. This cable would be used to secure the airship to the building itself. On top of this, the mast also had to be designed to withstand the strong winds that the airships create while in dock. 

The other major engineering challenge was finding a way to safely bring the airship in and out of the dock. This involved the implementation of a guidance system to allow the airship operators to flawlessly maneuver their vessels into position. Critical to achieving this was fitting the mast with large exterior lights and radio beacons to provide guidance to the incoming airships. 

Finally, rigging the mast with a cable car system was essential for loading and unloading passengers and cargo. To ensure the security of the airships while in dock, elevator operators used a third cable to secure the dirigibles once they were inside the mast.
