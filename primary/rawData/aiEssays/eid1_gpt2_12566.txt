Computers have many effects on people. If it sounds counterintuitive, take a second to comprehend. Consider how many people use Facebook's popular social network. The average Facebook user has 20,000 likes on Facebook, and there are nearly 500,000 other people using facebook today who use the same service every day. But what if we added up all of this information and added Facebook to a list of popular websites you don't think are worthy of your attention from the inside out? You can think of Facebook as a media portal that hosts a collection of images for your friends to download into your media collection, which is used to send you posts, reviews and other content to your friends.


Now if you want to do something with Facebook's website, there will be a whole host of other ways in which Google can create an image archive that people can view, including webcasts, social feeds, blogs and video games, and even YouTube, which might be the last to be updated. For example, if you think Google are just providing you with a site that contains content that you would like to link your friends to via Facebook links, you'll probably do this. Google might also try for you to make links that you have taken for a website and share them with your friends on Facebook, but they won't tell you what your site actually contains. They may ask you what to do with your information, and you might get offended because they don't like what you do with it.
