 

I was recently running late to a friend's birthday lunch. My partner had been caught in traffic and told me he was going to be late. My friend was getting antsy, asking for us to hurry along.

In the spirit of not being rude, I kept my cool and reassured my friend that we would get there soon. I knew it wasn't in our control, so rather than getting angry or frustrated, I just held onto the hope that my partner would get there soon.

It was a long 20 minutes of waiting, but eventually my partner arrived. Everyone could see I had been patient, which they were very thankful for. We all enjoyed the lunch and I was glad I hadn't let stress take away the joy from the moment.
