The remarkable Empire State building, one of the most prominent skyscrapers in the world, was designed with more than just its architecture in mind. When it opened in 1931, it was equipped with a 200-foot tall mooring mast, a feat which made it the only building at the time in the world that was capable of allowing dirigible airships to dock. The plan was ambitious, and many obstacles had to be overcome for the builders to make this goal a reality.

The first obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building had to face was the practicality of the mooring mast. Firstly, they needed to ensure the strength and stability of the mast so that it could withstand the weight of the airships during docking, and that the structure was unobtrusive, allowing for the passage of other air traffic underneath. To achieve this, however, the mast had to be incredibly tall to reach the necessary elevation in order to be able to latch onto the landing lines of the arriving dirigibles. The 200-foot tall mooring mast luckily satisfied both of these requirements.

The second obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building had to face was the safety measures needed in order to ensure the safety of both the passengers and the crew onboard the ships, as well as those who were on the ground. This included the construction of an observation platform, located at the top of the mast, and the installation of a series of radio beacons and communication lights
