In 'Rough Road Ahead' by Joe Kurmaski, the cyclist faces challenging terrain as the setting of the story. This amplifies the difficulty of the cyclist's journey.

The most obvious way in which the setting affects the cyclist is the road itself. It is not just rough terrain, but also inclines and declines as the cyclist progresses. These hills require the cyclist to use more energy to make it over them and can push his already taxed muscles to their limits. This is further complicated when the terrain is wet or muddy, making it even more difficult for the cyclist to move forward. The cyclist also has to be wary of the wildlife such as snakes or rabbits that may cross his path. This can cause him to be startled and potentially break his focus, leading to a crash.

Moreover, temperatures and weather conditions can heavily influence the cyclist's journey. For instance, on a hot day, the cyclist may become fatigued more quickly due to the heat. Alternatively, if the road has become slippery due to rain, the cyclist will need to concentrate more on his balance to stay upright.

The setting of 'Rough Road Ahead' can be seen as a metaphor for the journey of life â€” sometimes it is easy, while other times it is difficult.
