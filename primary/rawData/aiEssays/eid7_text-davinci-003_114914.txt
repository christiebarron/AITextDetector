I remember a time when I was about 7-years-old. My mom had a really busy day ahead of her and I needed her help with something. I was being fussy and insistent, but my mom stayed patient with me. She stopped what she was doing to sit down next to me and take the time to help me. Even though I could tell she was tired and the pressure of her day was really wearing on her, she stayed focused on me and was willing to take the time to patiently explain what I needed to know. As she went over the instructions with me several times, I eventually understood, and I was so grateful for her patience and kindness. Even though she had so much else to do, she still found the time to stay patient with me in that moment, and I'll never forget it.
