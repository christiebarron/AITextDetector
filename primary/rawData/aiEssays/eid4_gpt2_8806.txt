The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it also offers an opportunity for a new generation to gain perspective on the "myths" that have emerged from the past year of the American Revolution—including the "black slave trade" and the rise of the right-wing paramilitary forces that were already so ubiquitous that they had been even discussed at times within the "revolutionary" movement, if not ideologically.

"There can be no doubt that many people, including many in the black community, have no idea."—Professor Richard Storz and The Journal of Political Science 11, pp. 11-36

That's why that book is particularly important to Martin Luther King, Jr., and why he has written up his thoughts on President Obama and his alleged war against civil rights—and to all those who have no place on the sidelines of the fight against civil rights. As I'm sure you know, Martin Luther King got his name from the phrase he was used after he said those words, "I fear the King is in prison because I hear him."

"It would have been better if we had stayed in the civil rights fight or put out a little book on what happened in Alabama in the 50s, but we didn't do it. What the people did was they kept quiet."—Martin Luther King, Jr., "Why We Must Live Again," February 2010, http://www.thedailybeast.ie/news/2010/
