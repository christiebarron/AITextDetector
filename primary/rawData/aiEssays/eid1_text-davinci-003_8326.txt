I remember the time my brother and I were visiting an amusement park and we decided to go on a roller coaster. We got in line and waited for what seemed like forever. Everyone around us was getting impatient and started grumbling about how long it was taking. 

I could feel my brother getting a little anxious too, but I remained patient. I held onto his hand, and I reminded him that it would all be over soon, and the reward of the roller coaster ride was worth the wait. 

So we kept standing in line, despite all the grumbling and frustration from the other people. Soon enough, the ride was over and we had enjoyed it immensely. My brother thanked me for encouraging him to remain patient, and he said he was glad he hadn't given up on the line.
