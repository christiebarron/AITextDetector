In Joe Kurmaski's poem 'Rough Road Ahead', the cyclist's journey is wrought with obstacles which emerge from the features of the setting.

The mountainous terrain of the setting allows for several difficult obstacles, such as sharp inclines, mountaintops, and rock-strewn roads. These elements will tire the cyclist as they require extra effort from them. The cyclist will struggle to ascend to the top of the mountain, pushing their limits to make it up the difficult peaks.

Additionally, the environment of the setting can affect the cyclist. The lack of oxygen at high altitudes will make the cyclist more fatigued and will require them to exert more effort to force their body to continue in spite of the harsh conditions. The humidity of the environment, as well as the temperature, creates an uncomfortable and challenging environment for the cyclist.

The darkness of the night serves to further compound the cyclist's challenges. The cyclist must contend with the overhanging branches and obstacles on the road that become harder to see in the dark. These invisible obstacles can slow the cyclist's journey or cause them injury if undetected. Furthermore, the loneliness of the darkness can cause the cyclist to feel more alone and add psychological strain to the journey.

Overall, the features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski's poem 'Rough Road Ahead' affect the cyclist significantly. These factors add physical and mental challenges that can be used to test the determination and resilience of the cyclist
