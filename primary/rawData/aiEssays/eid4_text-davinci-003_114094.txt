The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho ties together the themes of education and hope. The protagonist is facing the prospect of a difficult test and has been studying hard for it, only to find out when the day of the test arrives that it has been cancelled. Rather than giving into despair, however, they choose to maintain hope by looking ahead to the coming spring as the time for them to retake the test. In addition, this ending also provides a metaphor for how challenging times do not last forever and how winter and suffering must always give way to the promise of a better future.
