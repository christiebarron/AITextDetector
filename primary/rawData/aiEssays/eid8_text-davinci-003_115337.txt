I will never forget the laughter that filled the room that night. It was the kind of laughter that was infectious and quickly spread like wildfire throughout the party.

The night started off normally enough â€“ a few friends, some simple snacks, and good conversation. We had been talking for some time when one of my friends, let's call her Cathy, started to tell a joke. This joke was about a group of scientists who, after much deliberation, were unable to come to a conclusion about a certain phenomenon.

Suddenly, Cathy let out a loud laugh that made all of us smile. We just couldn't help but be infected by her joy. Soon enough, the whole room was filled with laughter, as we all shared in her humor.

The laughter felt like a blanket of warmth surrounding us all and drew us closer together. We were all smiling and laughing along with her, and the energy in the room was incredible. It was the kind of laughter that reminds you why you love being around people; the kind that bonds people together.

I'll never forget that with the laughter in the room that night, our friendship was made even stronger. Laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people.
