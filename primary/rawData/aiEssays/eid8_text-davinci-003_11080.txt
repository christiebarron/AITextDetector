It was the first time we went out together - my first date with Sarah, and we were both a bit nervous. Our small talk was awkward at first, and I could tell that neither one of us had a lot of experience with this. 

Then Sarah made a silly face and started to giggle. I couldn't help but start to laugh, and I could feel the tension melting away. We both laughed until tears were streaming down our faces. 

After that, it was so much easier to talk. All of the nerves and anxiety had melted away and we smiled and laughed together for the rest of the night. 

Sarah and I have been together for five years now and we still laugh together all the time. It was that moment of shared laughter that made me realize that she was the one for me.
