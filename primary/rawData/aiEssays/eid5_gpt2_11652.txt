The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is clear, and the writers are convinced that the way that they depict this is quite good. It seems, in effect, exactly like the kind of novel that the book would have been if it hadn't been so self-serious and that the stories don't feel too self-referential.

'From Home' continues: "I was always aware that I was no mean person in life. This is different. All you have to do is be a nice, good, decent family man. That's how you come to be here. What you do is, it's what makes you who you are, and what you don't get from there is, it's why you stay your whole life, and you are what the characters are.

"Some people think that I'm not smart - at the end of the day what you need for this book is no matter how good your mind does, I'm just another person, a little one in a village that is in danger of becoming a whole different world but that I had. The book did what was necessary for me for life.

'The protagonist's own life, all that he has to do is live a life in the moment - that is one of his biggest desires and aspirations. The more I've written this one, the more the rest of his life gets the realisation. The world will be different as soon as you've read it.'
