In the 1930s, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a challenge – they wanted to create a place for dirigible airships to dock. This posed a difficult problem for the builders, as dirigibles were much larger than conventional aircraft. In order to build the necessary mooring mast, the builders had to overcome a range of obstacles.

The first of these obstacles was the sheer height of the Empire State Building. Constructed in 1930 to be the world’s tallest building at 1,454 feet (in comparison, the Statue of Liberty is only 151 feet tall), the building provided an ideal landmark for airship navigation. However, it also made the possibility of attaching a mooring mast to the top of the building an extremely difficult and dangerous task.

The second obstacle was the weight of the mast. A mooring mast for a dirigible would be considerably heavier than a traditional aircraft mast, and the Empire State Building was not built to support this kind of weight. In order to build a mooring mast that was both capable of supporting a dirigible and able to withstand the high winds of New York City, the builders had to employ sophisticated engineering techniques.

Finally, the builders of the Empire State Building had to face the challenge of creating a safe environment for dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast. In addition to the risks posed by the high winds of the city and the turbulence of the airships,
