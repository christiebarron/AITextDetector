I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is the greatest danger to society, that such censorship is an abuse of democratic process but can be reversed by legislative action without prejudice to public interest in general.

"By this means all libraries should be able to refuse books which it finds objectionable".

In a letter to the Scottish government this week, a library in Edinburgh urged students not to read a book that it considers offensive. It claims in an essay on its website that the words "unfettered free speech" and "unconscionable bullying" are "utterly inconsequential" because they come from an era when we have been bombarded with messages like these from "censors". It's clear from their response that neither is "objectionable" to anyone, but it is more than just someone thinking about "censorship" is trying to tell us what to expect of our culture, our laws and our ideas.

As the Telegraph explained its response on Twitter, the "unfettered free speech" motto was actually uttered on the website of the European Union's legal and human rights office, which is part of the European Parliament, but is now in charge of UK public laws. So the whole thing is not an attempt to tell us what to expect of our culture, our laws and our ideas, it's a propaganda campaign with no real purpose whatsoever and a clear, unguarded truth as to what we think about our political system and society.
