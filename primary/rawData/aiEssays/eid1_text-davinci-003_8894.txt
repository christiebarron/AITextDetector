I was walking through the park with my best friend one Sunday morning. We had both been through a tough week with school and work so we were ready for a break. We needed something to take our minds off all the stress. 

So, we started walking and chatting, sharing stories about our week. As we talked, I felt my mood lift and I suddenly realised how silly our conversations were. I started to giggle, and then my friend joined in. Pretty soon I was laughing so hard that I was reduced to tears. 

It felt great to have such a good, honest laugh. We had forgotten all about the stress and difficulties of our week. We just laughed until our stomachs hurt. 

Laughter is a powerful medicine. Even in tough times, it can be just what we need to lift our spirits and bring us closer together.
