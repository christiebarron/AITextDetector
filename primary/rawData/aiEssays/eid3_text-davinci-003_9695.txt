In “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, the setting plays a major role in the cyclist’s experience. The narrator explains how he faces “long hills”, “dirt roads that seem to go on forever”, and “boulders the size of houses” as he navigates the backcountry roads of the Midwest.

The hills, dirt roads, and boulders create a grueling challenge for the cyclist. Each of these elements of the setting impacts the cyclist’s physical and emotional state. The hills require the cyclist to expend a great deal of energy, and can cause physical exhaustion. The dirt roads add further difficulties, as they require the cyclist to ride cautiously in order to avoid obstacles and treacherous terrain. The boulders are perhaps the greatest challenge. In order to get past the boulders, the cyclist must summon extraordinary mental and physical strength. It is a test of his endurance and determination.

The setting of “Rough Road Ahead” has a profound psychological effect on the cyclist. By taking on the challenge of the backcountry roads, he is testing himself and pushing his limits. It is an exhausting journey, but one that he must undertake in order to experience personal growth. The setting thus serves as a means of inspiring the cyclist, and reinforces his commitment to personal growth.
