The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. Although the use of dirigibles for transportation had become increasingly popular during the early 20th century, the dock itself posed a unique challenge to the builders of the Empire State Building.

The first challenge the builders faced was the mast, or spire, located on the top of the tower. The mast was originally designed for terrestrial radio transmission, yet would need to be structurally modified and reinforced in order to meet the demands of accommodating dirigibles. The mast was already quite tall and thin, so any additional reinforcement would need to be extremely precise in order to maintain the stability of the structure.

The second challenge the builders faced was the actual procedure of attaching or mooring the dirigible to the mast. During this process, several additional components needed to be fabricated and installed in order to securely attach a ship to the spire. For instance, any mooring mast had to be capable of withstanding the immense force generated by the shipâ€™s wind resistance. Additionally, the mooring mast had to have systems in place to capture and prevent the dirigible from slipping off of its perch.

The final challenge the builders faced was one of safety. Given that the Empire State Building housed hundreds of people, additional precautions had to be taken to protect the passengers of any docked dirigibles. The mooring mast needed to be equipped
