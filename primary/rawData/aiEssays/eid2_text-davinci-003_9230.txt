Censorship in libraries has been a hot button issue for decades. Recent events, such as the attempt by the US National Archives and Records Administration to remove documents which supported the Rights movement, have only made this debate more intense. Whether it is protecting children from explicit material, or adults from offensive language, censorship in libraries is complicated and deserves serious consideration. 

When it comes to censorship on books, music, movies, and magazines, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Consideration must be given to the age of the libraryâ€™s patrons, as well as the cultural context of the material being distributed. Librarians can play an important role in providing guidance on appropriate materials and helping patrons find material that is family-friendly or meets their own values and interests. 

However, there are times when libraries need to go beyond providing guidance and take action to remove or restrict circulation of certain materials. Some materials may be so offensive that their presence in the library would be inappropriate and hurtful to patrons. Libraries also need to be concerned with protecting our youngest patrons from dangerous or graphic material. 

It is important for libraries to weigh their responsibility to protect patrons with their commitment to freedom of expression. They can use their discretion to restrict circulation of certain materials where appropriate, and to provide guidance to patrons who need it. 

Libraries should remain true to their mission of providing access to information, and censorship should be used sparingly
