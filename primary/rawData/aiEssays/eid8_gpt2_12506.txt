One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I took a few shots at an elephant and it kept kicking in its ears. At first I thought it was an animal, but then I thought it was human, and then I thought it was the Chinese. And when my wife told me what I was doing, I asked, 'Why is that, when everybody is doing it?' she said in a really sad voice: 'That's a good joke.' I thought the elephants went through life in circles on a regular basis â€“ which is really strange. It would be like trying to explain physics to somebody with an extremely long memory (because it has happened so many times.) But I think many of our readers believe that we go through life in circles to create our own version.

In your book, the elephant is part of a system whose "systems are being designed to create an illusion of order and efficiency" (the "systems that are being designed to create an illusion of order and efficiency"). But the elephant is part ofabama's own "systems," "which come at very high cost to the public," as you write. How does this impact your research?

As far as I know, it wasn't the least bit influenced by what was going on in our state. It was the "system" that started a wave in how the states were building. I think they changed the language, took away certain things and took us out of the public domain in this
