In Joe Kurmaski’s short story “Rough Road Ahead,” the features of the setting directly impact the cyclist. He is on a long bicycle ride on a marathon course, and the terrain is difficult, which requires intense perseverance and effort to make it through the course. 

The cyclist is submerged in a world of nature, as the setting of the story takes place in a park that consists of meadows, bushes, and dirt roads. This natural environment provides a challenge for the cyclist, as the terrain is constantly changing and is often too bumpy or slippery to be maneuvered safely.

In addition, the cyclist must face the dangers of wildlife during his ride. Throughout his journey, he sees many birds, rabbits, rodents, and other creatures that he must continuously be aware of. The presence of wild animals increases the difficulty of the cycling race, as the cyclist must pay attention at all times so as to not disturb the natural environment and wildlife.

Finally, the cyclist must also contend with the ever-changing weather. The sky is continuously changing from bright and sunny to cloudy and stormy, and the cyclist must dress accordingly and be prepared for any kind of weather.

All of these features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. Although the course is difficult, the beauty of the natural world gives him strength and motivation to keep going, and his awareness of the wildlife and weather allows him to stay safe during his ride
