The construction of the Empire State Building posed great challenges for allowing dirigibles to dock safely. Dirigibles were seen as a cutting-edge technology at the time and posed a unique set of challenges, both engineering and legal. Despite these hurdles, architects and engineers were determined to give dirigible pilots the opportunity to dock their ships at the building.

From an engineering standpoint, numerous obstacles posed difficulty in creating a mooring location for the airships. The main concern was creating an ideal location at the top of the Empire State Building that was capable of accommodating the large size of the dirigibles. The beacon mast atop the building featured a mooring mast, which presented challenges of its own. This mast had to be strong and stiff enough to support the stresses inflicted by docking and taking off of the ships. The engineers also had to determine the ideal size and shape of the mooring mast in order to prevent damage to the airships during docking and taking off.

In addition to the engineering hurdles, the construction of the mooring mast and allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building also posed legal obstacles. At the time, the laws of the land had yet to catch up with the technology. This presented a number of gray areas that had to be worked through in order to make sure that pilots would be able to docking safely and legally at the Empire State Building. The engineers had to work closely with lawyers in order to ensure that they
