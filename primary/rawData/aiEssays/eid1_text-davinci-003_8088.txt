The builders of the Empire State Building had a revolutionary idea to allow dirigibles like the Hindenburg to safely dock at the building. This revolutionary plan faced considerable obstacles as the building was simply not designed with dirigibles in mind. Constructed in the 1930s, the Empire State Building was the tallest building of its time and would need to be redesigned and upgraded from the ground up if they wanted to make their vision a reality.

The first obstacle the builders faced was the tower design. Due to the height of the building, it would be difficult for larger dirigibles to gracefully land on the narrow tower. Furthermore, the building wasnâ€™t designed to support the weight of a dirigible, so massive structural reinforcing would need to be done to make the vision a reality. As such, the engineers had to come up with a creative solution and create a steel mooring mast that could be fixed to the top of the Empire State Building.

Next, the builders were faced with the challenge of having to make the building operational to receive a dirigible. Winds and weather conditions in the area posed a threat to the safe landing of dirigibles and the building would need to be equipped with advanced navigation technology to ensure a safe descent. A control tower also needed to be built at the top of the building and specialized personnel needed to be hired who had the necessary experience and knowledge to provide passengers with a smooth landing experience.

Finally, the engineers had
