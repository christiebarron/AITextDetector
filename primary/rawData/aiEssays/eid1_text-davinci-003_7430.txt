Minfong Ho ends Winter Hibiscus with the thought of taking the test again in the Spring as a way to show that the character has grown and matured during their time figuring out how to care for the hibiscus. It also presents a reminder that life is cyclical, and that if they take the test in the Spring, they can be more prepared for it then they were before. This encourages readers to embrace challenges, no matter the outcome, because there will always be a chance for redemption.
