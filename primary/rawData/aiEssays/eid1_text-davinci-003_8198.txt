The Empire State Building was a marvel of engineering when it was first constructed in 1931, with its commanding height making it a focal point for aviation. This also meant it would be a great asset to the growing air commerce industry if aircraft could connect with it. As part of this, efforts were made to enable dirigibles to dock onto the building, which would allow for a more efficient way to transport goods and passengers. However, there were a number of obstacles the builders had to face in order to make this idea a reality.

For starters, the Empire State Building was just too high for the existing dirigibles at the time. This meant that the designers had to make changes to the way the building was built in order to make it more suitable for docking dirigibles. The main obstacle was the creation of a mast of sorts that would allow the dirigible’s ropes to be securely attached to the building. This was a challenge as the mast needed to be sturdy enough to support the tremendous weight of a dirigible without compromising the structural integrity of the building itself.

Fortunately, the designers had a particular type of mooring mast in mind – the Mark IV Mooring Mast. This type of mast was designed to have three sections with different diameters and wall thicknesses, which made it more robust and less likely to buckle under strain. Additionally, as the Mark IV was designed with a suspension cord, it allowed for a greater degree of flexibility to cope
