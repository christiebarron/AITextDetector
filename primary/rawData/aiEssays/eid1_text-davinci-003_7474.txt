The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho provides a sense of cyclical hope as the speaker of the poem contemplates the inevitable arrival of new life and growth that symbolizes the springtime. The image of hibiscus flowers budding symbolizes the start of a new season of growth and life which resonates with the speaker who is hoping to start a new season with better grades from making an effort to retake a test. By ending with the question of whether or not the speaker will take the test again, the ending leaves the reader with a sense of optimism and encouragement as the speaker knows that the promise of a new season and new beginnings is coming.
