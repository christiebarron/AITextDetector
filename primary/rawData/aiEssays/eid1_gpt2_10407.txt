It's not just that their performance will be poor at some stage. It has to be terrible at others. Computers can take advantage of this. It==============is this inescapable fact.

So the big question is this: Why are so many of us being stuck in those "super computers" so much? And how have we become so so lucky? It's hard to answer these questions without having to ask the big questions.

The short answer to this question is this — the answer to this question is "I don't have a choice."

The Long Answer To This Question is One This week on The Next Web

In this week's edition of The Next Web, we will discuss the origins of modern psychology and how it's come to be in favor of and against "super
