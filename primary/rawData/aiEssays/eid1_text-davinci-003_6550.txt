To the Editor of [Newspaper]:

I am writing to comment on the effects computers have had on people. As technology advances, there is no denying that the use of computers has become increasingly commonplace in our everyday lives. But in the world of computers, positives and negatives often come hand-in-hand.

On the one hand, computers have made us more efficient and productive. We are now able to do more in less time, and they have opened up numerous opportunities that were previously unavailable. They can help us keep track of our finances, store and access our files anytime, anywhere, and communicate with our friends and family around the globe.

On the other hand, computers can also have negative effects on us. They can be used to lend a false sense of anonymity, leading some to act in ways that would normally be considered inappropriate. They can also give false information, leading people to make inaccurate decisions. Additionally, they can be used for cyberbullying or cause distraction and issues with communication.

It is important to recognize both the positives and negatives associated with computers and strive to use them in the best possible way. They can be a powerful tool, but it is our responsibility to ensure that we are making the most of them. Careless or irresponsible use of computers could have disastrous effects.

Thank you for taking the time to read this letter and considering my opinion.

Sincerely,
[Your name]
