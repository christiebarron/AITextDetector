I remember once I was at the grocery store and the line was especially long. I knew I wouldn't get out of the store anytime soon, but being impatient wasn't going to solve the problem, so I composed myself and waited patiently in line. 

I noticed the cashier was being inundated with difficult customers, and was struggling to keep up. With each customer, I expected the line to move painfully slow, but I remained still and silent.

Finally my turn arrived and before I could pay the cashier apologized for the wait. I waved away her apology and told her it was no problem, which seemed to surprise her. I remember the cashier looking at me with her eyes wide and asked me how I managed to stay so patient while waiting in line.

I told her I just remembered that being patient was the best solution. When I saw that the cashier was overwhelmed I realized that getting angry or frustrated wasn't going to help the situation. I practiced being patient and it paid off since I soon completed my transaction and got on my way.
