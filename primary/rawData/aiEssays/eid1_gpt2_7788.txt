Computers have many effects on people. They are, for example, probably more likely to experience anxiety when it is overused than they are to experience pain when used safely—their brain chemicals increase. It may make sense that so-called "reparative therapy" is aimed at preventing people from taking their anxiety seriously, but this approach has little practical value. Psychologists, including the World Health Organization's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IAHME), have attempted to find a more effective method, called "treatment efficacy": A way of using anxiety-inducing treatments and their side effects to reduce anxiety. As one example, a Harvard psychiatrist recently wrote about using anticonvulsant treatments to relieve depression on anxiety patients: "With anticoagulants in general, [Antiag Organizations] can produce much better outcomes than would be imagined in the absence of the drug, or in the absence of any of their therapeutic options."

Perhaps the most promising example of such potential efficacy came in 2003, when patients with anxiety and depression began receiving neurotrophins, a class of "anti�-TNF" drugs. Neurotrophins are molecules found in the brain responsible for promoting a state of "panic," or agitation (see page 11 of this article, p. 11). It may seem unusual to find a drug like Neurotrophin to increase a person's anxiety simply to treat or prevent a condition. But as Robert Siegel reports
