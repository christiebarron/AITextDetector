One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my husband was in an accident. He got up, ran around in his chair crying and said, 'What did you see'. I thought very much for a second, because people sometimes talk about the loss of friends. He said, 'What we saw had done me good. I thought that was a good thing'. Well I thought it was a good thing. To see a sad little child doing it was one of the things I hated about my life. When people get down on their hands and knees with their hands in their mouths to tell them, 'Let's take care of you and make it over with so nobody is looking, it will be fine'.

I couldn't stand to believe it. If she'd given me that kind of humour again she'd win me over. Well did I really have words? Well, I knew it was because they saw what she did and she wouldn't let me think about it. The one day she let me think of her and she kept on grinning at me. Then she started crying. 'Why had my mum not asked me that?' and of course I knew I had a right to say my name again - that it was about a man I loved and I'm sure he was looking for a lover. I always used to say it was more like "I guess I was talking to her" when she was smiling at me. It was never like that. That's what it is
