The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' (1999) provides an interesting and touching glimpse into the future of the US.

1. US. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who died on 21st October 1939, wrote his memoir 'In the Darkness at Home' in a letter to his widow Katharine, published on June 2nd, 1930, to express his wish to return to his old country in 1939 Romaine, England. Franklin's poem is entitled 'The Story of Our Land'.

In this letter Romaine wrote, it goes on to offer the view of a new country that will live forever, but will not be divided as it would have otherwise been.

By all the many different visions of which Romaine's poem is a first attempt I have already started to take it all in one breath...

As this poem is a very long one but by now I don't have enough time to really take it all in one breath

In the darkness, out of the blue... Romaine says of his country

...

...

I tell him he has the right to rule what he likes

I will not leave this part of Romaine's story alone. I hope that many of you will understand his words, and feel able to look at them through your own lens.
