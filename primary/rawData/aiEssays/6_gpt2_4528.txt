The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In addition to the difficulties of being able to control the moving parts to carry out the operations of the engine, this had to be done by putting in proper tools, a steel cabinet or by getting adequate air from a car. While the engine had a small air filtration system that was always running and could be activated by a motor, the main components of the tower of the Empire State Building were used only by the pilots in the training room.

This was an extremely demanding task. The only way for the pilots to be able to fly the Empire State Building while in a pilot training was to do special aerial maneuvers involving the plane. The pilots needed an all out force that was trained in a realistic way, and there was very little to learn from such an intense and dangerous situation. Even the pilots knew that they had to be disciplined and be prepared to do these special flying maneuvers. In these high altitude conditions, even pilots in high school were required to work even without any training. The first airplane that could be operated remotely in low altitude and did not have any manual controls, was the F40. It was originally designed for short-range flight. The F40 could fly anywhere in the Empire State. It had the following specifications:

Aileron: 70,000 kg

Power supply: 1 liter and 3.5 liter

Radius: 150Â° F
