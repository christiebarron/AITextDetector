The ending of this poem is meant to be symbolic of the narrator's drive and determination. Like the hibiscus coming back in the spring, the narrator will come back to take the test again. This is a symbol of her perseverance and strength in the face of challenging circumstances, such as having to take a difficult test. The imagery of the snow melting, the geese returning and the hibiscus budding also gives a feeling of renewal and new hope, which the narrator feels as she prepares to take the test again.
