In Joe Kurmaski's 'Rough Road Ahead,' the cyclist's journey is largely shaped by the environment he is travelling through. The environment includes the roads and the landscape the cyclist is travelling through.

The roads, which are primarily dirt roads, are a key feature in the story. The roads are described as rugged and filled with obstacles, making them incredibly difficult and dangerous to traverse. The terrain also changes frequently, leading to twists, turns, and sudden inclines which make the journey slow and arduous, and puts the cyclist at risk of exhaustion due to the required additional effort.

The landscape also has an effect on the cyclist. The mountainous terrain is covered in sharp rocks and debris, providing very little traction. These conditions make crashes more likely, as the cyclist can more easily skid and slip. The landscape also has the potential to cause serious injury, as a small mistake or misstep can lead to a long fall, and there is no telling what could be down below.

The combination of the tight roads and dangerous landscape make for a truly dangerous journey, one that even the most seasoned cyclist might not be able to navigate safely. This demonstrates the power of the setting, as it is essential in creating a story with real stakes, where the cyclists find themselves consistently struggling against the odds of their environment.
