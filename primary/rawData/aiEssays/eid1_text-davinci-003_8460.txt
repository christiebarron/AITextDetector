I was recently at the grocery store, running some errands for my family. As I was getting ready to check out, I noticed that the line was quite long and there was only one cashier open. I had already been shopping for quite some time so I was already a bit tired, but I decided to remain patient and wait my turn. I could tell that the cashier was having a rough day and was going slowly. I could also tell that the people behind me in line were getting annoyed and impatient. Instead of getting frustrated by the slow process, I just smiled and tried to keep a positive attitude. I told myself that it was only a few minutes out of my day and I could be patient for that long. Eventually, I made it to the front of the line and was able to check out and head home. It really felt great to stay patient in a situation that could have been stressful.
