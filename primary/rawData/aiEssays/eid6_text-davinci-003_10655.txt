When the Empire State Building opened in 1931, one of the most ambitious components of its design was the mooring mast — intended to be able to accommodate mooring decks for dirigibles (airships). With the prospect of luxury travel to the 102nd floor and a “universal air terminal”, the building’s architects pushed to make this futuristic innovation a reality. However, they faced multiple obstacles in doing so, some of them more extraordinary than others.

One of the most obvious obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was the mast’s height. The challenge was to build a mast that would be high enough — 1,200 feet tall — to reach the minimum height requirements for a stable mooring deck. Additionally, the entire structure had to be engineered and built to contain enormous stresses which would be caused by the powerful winds generated by the beating of the dirigible’s propellers. To accommodate the extreme load-bearing characteristics of the mooring mast, the architects had to make sure that the mast, and the building itself, were made of the strongest materials available at the time.

The technical considerations of allowing aircrafts to dock posed further engineering challenges. At the time, no means of deploying the landing gear could safely or reliably be used for such heights, and the Empire State Building was the only building of its kind that attempted this. In addition, the docking procedure itself was tricky
