The builders of the Empire State Building faced difficult obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In 1930, when the building was constructed, dirigibles were the latest and greatest form of air travel. Dirigibles, or airships, were huge, lighter-than-air craft with a rigid internal skeleton. They could travel long distances, but docking them was a challenge for the builders. 

The main problem for the builders was that dirigibles were too big and too heavy to land on the roof of the building. This was a problem, because the tallest mooring mast in the world had been built on the Empire State Building specifically for the purpose of allowing dirigibles to dock. To solve this problem, the builders had to come up with a new design for the mooring mast that would enable the airships to dock more easily.

In “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, it is explained that the builders designed an enormous T-shaped steel tube, which extended out from one of the highest sections of the Empire State Building. This steel tube was twice the size of the mast that was built on the building before the Empire State Building existed. At its peak, the mast rose 580 feet above the street, and the tube was wide enough and long enough to accommodate for the extra size and weight of the dirigibles. 

The tube also incorporated special features that enabled the dirig
