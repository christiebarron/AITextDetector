The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The tower was designed from the ground up for a more pedestrian oriented, leisure-focused experience, but eventually its designers were able to realize the potential of the aircraft. The design also allows the building's top to be turned around significantly to increase the space available for the cargo system and the entire cockpit. With that configuration, many of the aeronautic wings could be used, but only a limited number were built.

As a result, the Empire State Building's design has more of an aesthetic value over its interior. The Empire State Building's exterior has been refined to include more contemporary touches like windows, doors, and glass. Most of the interior design was done for low impact aircraft as well, but many of the elements that contributed to the building's unique nature were placed behind much higher-end, higher-power airplanes.

The exterior configuration of the Empire State Building is a bit different from what is found in many other buildings in the United States due to its lower weight relative to the rest of the building. This results in more maneuverability and increased surface area at lower elevations. The Empire State Building's aerodynamic wings are made from wood (approximately 20,000 pounds) that's been specially designed to make up for its bulk while making the structures more mobile and maneuverable. This makes it even more likely that your flight deck will allow
