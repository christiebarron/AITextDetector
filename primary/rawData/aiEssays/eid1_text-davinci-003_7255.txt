In the poem "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski, the cyclist is significantly affected by the features of his setting. The wind loudly whispering and the sun sinking in the sky represent elements of nature that the cyclist is unable to ignore as they remind him of his mortality. The wind blows regardless of his presence, and the sun will set even if he does not finish his journey. The winds represent passing time, calling attention to the cyclist's mortality and also to the length of his journey and the effort required.

The positive aspects of the setting also have a profound effect on the cyclist. The bright colors of the wildflowers and the song of the birds provide a source of beauty, distraction, and hope for the cyclist. The colors represent life and provide a sense of comfort and reassurance that he can continue and succeed. The singer of the songbirds is likened to a cheerleader, providing a sense of encouragement through the poet's words.

The setting of "Rough Road Ahead" influences the cyclist in both positive and negative ways. The poet uses the physical and environmental elements to emphasize the cyclist's endurance and fortitude. The wind, the sun, the wildflowers, and the birds all symbolize elements of determination and progress. The setting serves as a reminder to the cyclist that despite the difficulty of his journey, the end goal is worth it and he will eventually reach it.
