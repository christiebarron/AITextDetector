Author's Notes

-There are a lot of parts about this book, but in this case, no matter how much I watched the first few films and didn't even know what the main action was, you won't find myself watching the series for most people. I just loved my first two movies and it made me smile a little more.

-This is a good book to read. It is very detailed which makes it easy to grasp.

-The only thing that annoys me about this book is the very short description. It is so long. I just love the number of parts which just seem to blur your vision like that.

-Also, this is the only part that I really liked though.
