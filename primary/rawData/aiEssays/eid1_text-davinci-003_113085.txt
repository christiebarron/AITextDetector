Dear Editor,

I am writing to share an opinion I hold about the effects computers have on people. Despite the widespread, popular belief that computers are detrimental to our everyday lives, computers actually have the potential to be incredibly beneficial.

In today’s world, computers have become interwoven into our everyday lives in ways both profound and meaningful. Computers can do so much more than just surf the web - they do have the potential to make our lives more efficient in many ways that were unimaginable in the past. From creating complex technical models to helping organize vast stores of data, computers are seemingly indispensable in today’s digital age.

What’s more, computers can even serve to empower people, allowing those who are less privileged to get the education and the tools they need in order to succeed. Computers can also be used to create art, foster creativity, entertain us, and enable us to communicate with people around the globe. 

I believe that for all these reasons, computers have the potential to be an important and positive force in our lives. Instead of viewing computers as an impediment or as a source of impatience and distraction, we should embrace them as an invaluable modern tool that can help us maximize our potential, make our lives more efficient, and open our minds to new intellectual possibilities. I urge readers to support this opinion and recognize the incredible opportunities that computers provide us.

Sincerely,

[Name]
