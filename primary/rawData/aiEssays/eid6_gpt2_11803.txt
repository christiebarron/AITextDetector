The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first obstacle was that unlike a ship with an electrical mast, a building could't ship to a certain direction without being in a state of flux.

According to a 2002 Wall Street Journal article from the time, building engineers wanted to move toward the most efficient means of propulsion: the ability to change from horizontal to vertical.

The other obstacle to thenar were obstacles along the city's waterways. As a result, the Empire Center was built along the city's bayfront, near the river, in 1928, just after the Civil War. The structure was designed to give an opportunity for people to get a break near their houses when it became apparent that the canal would inevitably be drained. The result was a large dam â€” a large swath of water that led straight to the river that empties out into the open. At the end of the dam's life span, the construction process began.

The Empire Center

According to The Journal article, the Empire Center became the first city and state building in the United States to get a retractable dome over its central base in the 1930s. The new structure was constructed to be able to move horizontally if necessary; people using a hydraulic elevator would be able to move from one end of the dome to either the other, according to WIRED.
