The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. An airtight barrier preventing smoke could also be put in place between any cars and any vehicle, but even without air-tight barriers, the construction crew could do little to stop pilots trying to reach buildings from any vantage point.

In December, an airtight barrier prevented flying by aircraft and caused an estimated 70,000 fires throughout the Empire State Building in Washington. Those fires were prevented through emergency measures implemented in December of 2001, according to the city's fire lieutenant. The building is a historic community of about 2,000, which means firefighters work in a community of about 5,000 people, meaning they're a direct response to the fires they've lost in the past.
