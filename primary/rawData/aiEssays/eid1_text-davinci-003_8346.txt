I was at the grocery store the other day when I noticed the line to check out was incredibly long. Instead of getting frustrated, I held my tongue and patiently stayed in line. I took the time to appreciate the hustle and bustle around me and even had a few conversations with the people standing around me. Before I knew it, I was at the front of the line and moved quickly through the checkout process. 

By staying patient, I was rewarded with a positive experience and even bumped into some nice people while I was waiting. Patiently standing in line ended up being well worth the wait and I'm always reminded to practice patience whenever I find myself in a similar situation.
