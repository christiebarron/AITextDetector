His writing evokes a sense of longing for the past; for his familiar home, the people he used to know and the distant places he had been. 

The way Rodriguez has arranged the material in the book helps to create a strong sense of atmosphere. The description of the houses, cultures, people, and places he experienced gives a vivid impression of a life lived in many places.

The vivid narrative makes Rodriguezâ€™s journey seem surprisingly tangible even when the reader never experienced it. 

This transformative journey from his childhood home to the bustling streets of Madrid, provides the reader with a journey full of emotional power. The style of the book, alternating between childhood memories and adult reflections, helps creates a nostalgia for the past. Throughout the book, there is a strong sense of his history, of family, of the bonds between his father and himself, and of his home. This powerful connection to home allows the reader to feel the same sense of longing that Rodriguez has in reflecting on his story.
