Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects of computers on people, and to persuade readers to share my view. Computers, particularly the internet, can have positive effects on people of all ages.

From a first glance, one might assume that computers are mainly used for entertainment purposes. In fact, computers can be used to exceed conventional learning capabilities in the education sector. For example, online education makes learning interactive and allows students to easily reach out to their teachers for additional support. In addition, computers can help bridge the digital divide, especially in low-income and high poverty areas, by providing students with free access to virtual libraries and databases.

The internet is also an amazing tool for collaboration and social interaction. Social media networks such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter make it easier than ever to stay connected with friends and family. These digital platforms also allow access to an expansive array of online communities, which can provide people with support and guidance that they normally wouldn't have had access to before. 

Ultimately, when used properly, computers can be instrumental in improving the quality of life in many ways. They can enable people to get better education, access resources that were once out of reach, and make it easier to stay connected with people and communities. Therefore, computers can be beneficial and beneficial to everyone who uses them responsibly.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
