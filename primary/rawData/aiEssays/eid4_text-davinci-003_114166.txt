At the end of Winter Hibiscus, the narrator is reflecting on a difficult academic test she was taking in the winter. The test results had not been good, and she is feeling overwhelmed and somewhat defeated by this outcome. As she stands looking at a hibiscus in her yard, she takes a moment of solace in the assurance of the cycle of life: spring will come and bring with it a fresh start. She comforts herself with the idea that she will take the test again in the spring when the snow melts and the hibiscus buds. This provides the narrator with hope and optimism for the future.
