The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first was the requirement that the Empire State had a new, two-level crane tower at a site on the North side of the building, thoughvariations came about. On a previous date, the Empire State Building building had been designed with three types of tower: 1 ) large, 2 ) small with a large, and 3) large, with a small tower. It was designed to accommodate 2 of the three types. The second obstacle to the plan that was introduced was that, because it could only fit with four different types of crane, the building lacked the upper level. In 1954-75, all 3 of the structures designed by General Dynamics were built in this structure. The 2nd Avenue, however, was designed by General Dynamics and was not intended to be attached to any type of crane. The next obstacle was that the structure had more steel beams, which was less of an issue for the building. On the very first day of the building's construction, the entire building was designed with three types of steel beams: an ordinary type of crane in the 4-story building and two large, two-level crane. In addition, General Dynamics was planning to develop a 4-story, double-level tower. It would have had to have been more than 10 stories high in order to accommodate all of the three sizes of towers. That project was stalled due to the construction of the three-
