The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because if it'd come first (a more logical place that I think could be used) it should have been published at the end of the last century.

The Fall: A Novel of Literary Fiction and Myth

By Alan Johnson

Review:

Here's a couple more great retellings of the book, which would be very enjoyable if you didn't mind a bit of a rant.

Lothar, by Harry James, was the beginning for the first two books, and he made a nice attempt to introduce this world from the point of view of a young girl, the girl that has to become Winter Hibiscus.

The Fall, as many others say, is by far the first book to introduce the idea of "Winter Hibiscus" to a teenage reader. The book isn't perfect like Tolkien's, but it's certainly an excellent introduction to the way fantasy is seen. If you're thinking, "Okay, that could end up being a very nice book", well of course it will.
