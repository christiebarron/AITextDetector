 

I was sitting in my car at a red light, alone, when out of the corner of my eye I saw movement. I glanced over in the opposite lane and saw a man shaking the snow off of a tree. His hat had slipped over his eyes, and he was dancing around the tree, shaking away the snow. I couldn't help but laugh. 

My laughter caught the man's attention and he stopped what he was doing. We both started cracking up at the ridiculousness of his actions. I rolled down my window and he approached my vehicle, introducing himself. As it turned out, we had been classmates in high school together. 

We talked about the old days and laughed even harder as we remembered all the days of debauchery. We shared stories of different classes and teachers and other things that had been hilarious. We really connected. 

Just then, the light turned green and I started to pull away, but before I left he grabbed a fistful of snow from the tree and threw it at my car. We both laughed so hard - I imagine we were quite the sight for the other drivers watching us. 

That was a few years ago now, but even when we're together in person, I know that the simple gesture of his throwing that snowball will always make us both burst into laughter.
