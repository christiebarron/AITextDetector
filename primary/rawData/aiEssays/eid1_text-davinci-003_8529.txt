I recently had to wait in line at the bank for a long time. I was there for probably 45 minutes. It was incredibly frustrating as this was my lunch break and I was supposed to be done in 15 minutes. But despite my frustration, I gritted my teeth and I was patient. I kept breathing deeply and reminded myself that these people had to wait in line for the same reasons I did. I smiled at the people who were in line ahead and beside me and made conversation with them. Even though it was a difficult situation, I was determined to remain patient towards the others in line as well as the staff. Eventually the line started to move faster and I was able to complete my business. I was so proud of myself for staying patient, and thankful that I was able to be kind to those around me even in the difficult situation.
