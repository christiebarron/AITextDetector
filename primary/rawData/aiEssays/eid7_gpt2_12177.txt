An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the time I watched her lose weight on YouTube. The first, funny moment was this: "I just found out about a bunch of people dying at home. I was crying in my sleep and the world was watching." It was one of the strangest things in my life."

The idea of "caring about your body is to love it and know it is there and do it for you" was central. It's the antithesis of what makes people successful, the "survival of the fittest." The idea was to make us the best of the poor, the most successful and the ones who were the greatest in all of human history.

What is so great about the movement? I believe it's this: by using social media, individuals are empowered to offer their fellow human beings something worth saving to allow people to "change the world" at will. We are more important to "be good neighbors" than to "live by a different rules" to create "better lives." Because most importantly, we have become an equal and better force; the better we can create for others, the better we become for ourselves. And it can be hard sometimes. "If we have the strength so to tell the world that it's always on the side that makes you the better person, is that the very definition of good?" I want to be able to do that."
