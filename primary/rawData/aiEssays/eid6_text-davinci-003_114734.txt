The builders of the Empire State Building considered the idea of allowing dirigibles, or large airships, to dock on the rooftop. This task presented a unique set of obstacles, given that the Empire State Building was, and is, the tallest building in the world. In Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s article “The Mooring Mast,” she explores the challenges builders faced when incorporating a dirigible docking station on the rooftop.

To begin, the Empire State Building demanded that the directors of the project find a way to make sure that the docking and undocking process was as safe as possible. The risk of a wide-bodied dirigible colliding with the high-rise was a real concern. This problem was addressed by installing a mooring mast about 200 feet tall, which would allow the dirigible to tie up securely and above the peak of the building.

The next obstacle builders had to overcome was accommodating the width of the dirigible. Across the entire width of the rooftop was a “bird cage,” housing equipment like fans for ventilation and exhaust systems. This limited the landing area of a dirigible to a width of about 80 feet, which might be considered too small for a wide-bodied airship. To solve this problem, builders set up a large net to extend the landing area in the event that a larger dirigible were to dock.

Another issue builders faced was the role of wind. At
