Computers have many effects on people. However, what is particularly worrisome is the fact that there are people on computer systems who have some experience with programming, and who are more likely than others to start out as programmers. Even in those programs where programmers are very adept—such as computer programs for a military or government system—even they may struggle to write software that can actually run on their system. But sometimes you just end up wasting your time reading up on the computer security and the things that go wrong with a lot of things, like the vulnerability of your system.

An excellent analogy here is from our example. At one age, when we were growing up, there would be about 50 people at work, every day, for hours every day doing different things with a computer that doesn't have a security hole built in. Every workday, if I was able to get up at 9:30 at night, and then go to work doing my computer work (the computer doing the computer work yawning) as opposed to a young kid doing his homework, I was going to have a problem in my day. I'd get annoyed by it and the rest of the week, and start complaining about it. If I had the time at work at 9:30 or the computer work to make sure all the other work was done at 8:45, if I had the time for all my other work, then you could almost go to sleep thinking that if I could wake up the next
