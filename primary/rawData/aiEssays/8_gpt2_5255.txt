One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I met the lady who works at the Dursley. The female was in her 40s and I saw her face when she asked me to try her on the show. I told her to try it - she just smiled and said yes. I hope that's the case for you. Thank you for doing this and I'll be looking out for you as soon I get them all. Thanks, Kail
