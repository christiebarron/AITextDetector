It was an incredibly tense day - the day before my best friend's wedding. We were all getting our hair done when my other friend and maid of honor decided that some laughter was needed in the situation.

"Let's share the best joke we know!" she proclaimed. We all laughed, but also groaned in exhaustion.

My friend began with her joke. It was an old classic and I laughed so much and so hard my stomach hurt. My good friend and bridesmaid chimed in with another joke. It was full of puns and we all had a good chuckle. 

But then it was my turn. 

I had been building up a joke for weeks with my friend, a joke I had promised to save for this moment. So I launched into it, each word funnier than the last. My friends laughed and laughed, doubling over in pain from the hilarity. 

The laughter was infectious and soon the entire salon was filled with it. Even the hairdressers were uncontrollably giggling despite doing their best to remain professional. I finished my joke and received a rousing round of applause from the audience. We all hugged, and for a moment the stress was forgotten and the joy of the upcoming wedding was fully alive. Laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people.
