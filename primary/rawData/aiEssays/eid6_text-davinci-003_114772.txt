The builders of the Empire State Building faced several technical challenges in allowing dirigibles to dock. According to “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the first obstacle was finding a way to make sure that the metal framework and unstable airships wouldn’t be damaged in the process of docking. The designers had to develop ways to minimize the shock to the airship as it descended from the sky. This included ensuring that the airship was properly secured and stabilized before it touched the ground.

The second obstacle was finding a powerful enough mooring mast to hold the dirigible in the air. The mooring mast had to be sturdy enough to bear the load of the airship and be flexible enough to handle the changing air buoyancy of the dirigible. It also had to provide support during the multiple docking cycles that would be necessary as passengers got on and off the airship.

The final obstacle was ensuring the safety of the passengers during the docking process. Although building an internal structure that could accommodate an airship was a technical challenge, the Empire State Building builders had to also ensure that the airship had an adequate and safe passage to enter and leave the tower. Rail tracks and cables had to be constructed to support the airship’s movement and ensure the safety of the passengers.
