Dear Editor: 

I am writing to share my opinion on the effects computers have on people. While computers have made countless tasks easier and more convenient, some may argue they have done more harm than good. I strongly disagree.

I believe the impact of computers on individuals is extremely beneficial. They enable us to work remotely, connect with loved ones, stay informed with current events, and get entertained. With the advancement of technology, they have helped us stay more connected and productive than ever.

Not only that, but computers are also increasing education opportunities. Digital classrooms and online courses have opened the door to knowledge more than ever before. Students from all over the world now have access to educational material that might have been otherwise unavailable. Furthermore, computers are making certain professions much more efficient, leading to an increase of productivity and economic growth.

I believe computers are a vital part of modern society. They have revolutionized the way we teach, work, and stay connected with loved ones. Without them, we would be unable to achieve the same level of success. I urge readers to consider the positive effects of computers and the countless opportunities they provide.

Sincerely,

[Your name]
