In recent years, libraries across the country have seen a sharp increase in the number of library patrons voicing their disapproval of the materials found on library shelves. There is a great deal of debate about whether censorship should be allowed in libraries.

As a library patron, I strongly believe that censorship should not be allowed in libraries, as it restricts access to information and places limits on freedom of expression. In addition, censorship is not effective in providing an environment of moral safety for library patrons. It has been shown that censorship, as it attempts to eliminate all materials deemed “offensive”, can lead to more extreme material going unnoticed. Furthermore, it is important to remember that libraries provide access to an incredible variety of information, material, and resources, and should remain a safe and reliable source of diverse materials. 

Rather than censorship, libraries should instead focus on providing a safe and comfortable learning environment for all patrons. If library patrons express concern or disapproval of certain materials, the library should work to provide an advisory notice, rather than censorship. An advisory warning would allow patrons to be better informed of the sensitive materials available in libraries. Additionally, libraries should promote their open access policies and work with patrons to promote respect and civility. Libraries should also use their resources to showcase cultural sensitivity, inclusivity, and open-mindedness within the library facility.

In conclusion, censorship should not be allowed in libraries as it restricts access to information and restricts freedom of expression. Libraries
