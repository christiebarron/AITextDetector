As libraries are places of free expression and exploration, it is essential for them to remain open to a wide variety of materials, from books to music and movies, without fear of censorship. Removing certain items from library shelves simply for being deemed offensive does not create an accurate representation of the diverse world around us, nor does it reflect the commitment these institutions have to free speech. 

At the same time, it is important to establish certain boundaries as to what is appropriate material for children and young adults. Parents and guardians should have the right to decide what their children can access within a library, and libraries should be aware of the age-appropriateness of materials. For example, books that promote violence or sexual content should be clearly labeled and in a separate area accessible only to certain readers. 

Considering the options available to libraries, it is my firm belief that the most beneficial route is to make all materials available to the public, but with the caveat that certain ones require parent or guardian permission to access. By never simply “banning” certain materials, it would better serve the library’s mission of encouraging education, creativity, and learning without censorship. 

Ultimately, libraries should be places of free expression and exploration, and should embrace open dialogue and understanding between all patrons. It is only through conscious curation of materials and conscious dialogue between all readers that we can truly create a positive learning environment without censorship.
