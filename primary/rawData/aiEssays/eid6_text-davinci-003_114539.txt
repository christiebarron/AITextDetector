The building of the Empire State Building represented a feat of engineering and ambition, standing as the tallest building in the world for over forty years. One element of this iconic structure that has been overlooked over the years is the installation of a mast at its peak to allow mooring of dirigibles. This remarkable installation, detailed in Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted's The Mooring Mast, faced significant obstacles while in the planning and construction stages. 

The first and most significant challenge the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock was the sheer size of the mooring mast. At the time of its construction, the Empire State Building stood at more than 1,250 feet tall. In order for the mooring mast to betall enough to be suitable for dirigibles, it needed to be an additional 200 feet taller. This would make the mast as high as a fifty-story building.

Another major obstacle the builders had to face was the addition of stabilizers to the base of the mooring mast, which were added to counter the swaying motion of the mast due to strong winds. The stabilizers, which could weigh up to 200 tons, made the installation of the mast even more difficult, as the engineers had to balance the extra weight with additional bracing systems.

Thirdly, the Empire State Building's mooring mast had to be designed according to specific standards, as established by the Good
