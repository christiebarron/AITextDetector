I remember the first time my boyfriend ever made me laugh. We were walking down the street together when he stopped to check out a funny poster that was put up on a telephone pole. He read it aloud, and his delivery was spot on. I knew it was ridiculous but I couldn't help but laugh at his deadpan take. He turned to me and his expression suddenly changed. I realized he was doing it all for me so I laughed even harder and gave him a big hug. That was the moment I knew I loved him. We joke about it everytime we pass that poster, and laugh together like only two people in love can.
