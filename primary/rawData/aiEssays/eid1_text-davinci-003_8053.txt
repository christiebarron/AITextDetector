The construction of the Empire State Building was seen as an ambitious and innovative project by its builders. Completed in 1931, this iconic building was one of the first skyscrapers to incorporate new technology in its design. One such feature was the incorporation of mooring masts for the docking of dirigibles – or lighter-than-air aircraft. However, despite the seemingly promising idea, obstacles prevented the mooring masts from ever fulfilling their purpose.

The first and foremost obstacle the builders encountered was the inability to safely secure the airships to the building. To aid the docking of dirigibles, four mooring masts were placed atop the Empire State Building, with two more hovering near the base of the building’s east side.  Although the majority of the mooring masts were connected to the building’s steel frame, the two situated closer to the ground were constructed independently.  This in itself caused difficulty, as the sheer weight and height of the building made it impossible for workers to properly secure the mooring masts with sufficient strength. Furthermore, the mooring masts were equipped with grapples, bulky metal hooks designed to secure the airship when it descended. However, the relationship of the grapple to the airships themselves was too weak, creating an insufficient and insecure connection between the two.

In addition, the Empire State Building faced the everyday obstacles that are associated with Manhattan. Due to air traffic and
