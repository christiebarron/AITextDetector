I remember the first time I truly shared a belly laugh with my best friend, Dan. We were sitting in the middle of the quad at college on a warm April day. We had been friends for several months, but were just starting to get to know each other more intimately. 

We had just finished talking about a funny incident, and before I knew it we were both bursting into uncontrollable laughter. Heads turned and faces smiled as people around us were drawn into our laughter. It felt so liberating and genuine, and I couldn't help but join in. 

In that moment, Dan and I were connecting in a way that words could not describe. We were connected on some level that I had never experienced before and the laughter seemed to bring us closer together. As the laughter subsided, we glanced around the now empty quad and smiled knowingly at each other. It was then that I realized that laughter was indeed a powerful thing.
