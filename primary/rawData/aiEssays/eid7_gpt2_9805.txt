An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when we had a terrible accident in my past and I got drunk and went on a rampage (unlike at work), I had to use some medication to take it. I kept in my mind why did that take hold (and how could I ever explain it to someone else).

But it didn't. All I can tell you about that is to stay alive, never die.


I've been married twice, first as spouses, who was to take over my post at the time. But before we even started I was a father with my three children that is my wife. My daughter, now 6. She never gave me that part of herself because when I told her I thought of dying for her sake I thought of just being alive and had taken it for the love of the child.

But to this day I'm not really ready to be able to be alive, just because it doesn't feel good that way. I can think about killing my wife from day one and the feeling of "Oh my god what can I do?" comes back as time goes by.

Also, I am living my life to be on time with friends. Because after about nine years of living full time I started to become ill. And having lost my work so that I would have a chance to work as an artist or a cook, it wasn't in my nature to work so hard. All of my love for
