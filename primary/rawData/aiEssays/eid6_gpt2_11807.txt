The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The Empire State Building (EPCB) housed many thousands of passengers, including many prominent women such as actress Judy Garland and famed astronaut Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. However, there was a problem: a small dirigible carrying passengers aboard could be hit by fire. The designers feared that a dirigible flying at high altitude would fire on the top of their landing gear and hit the ship. The proposed EPCB had to be constructed for this purpose.

By the late 1950's, the EPCB's designers had built an entirely new, much better, aerostat that required a much taller aircraft for it to fly over the city. This new aerostat, which in 1958 received two pilot's permits, incorporated a very advanced form of aer averabld from the EPCB. A single small propeller mounted in the wings was mounted by a very complicated wing design that had three blades to move in unison along a wide flight path. The aircraft was designed to take the two propeller blades out of the water by tilting the top of the wings and then placing the trailing edge of the blade between the wing tip and the boat. The wings would spin and tilt in unison as this made the new aircraft much more maneuverable. When a craft lands at high enough altitude, the top of the wings would pivot up to the boat, and the top of the aircraft pivots down to
