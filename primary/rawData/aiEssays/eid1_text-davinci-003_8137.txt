The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. After the construction of such a majestic building, dirigibles had the potential to expand its use and visibility. While the idea of a floating docking tower was widely praised, the feat was not without its challenges. 

The first obstacle to address was the nature of dirigibles. These giant airships, filled with hydrogen and other combustible gases, didn’t come with a rudder. Due to the size and structure of the Empire State Building, docking one of these airships required precise navigation. In order to make this possible, the groundbreaking “Mooring Mast” was constructed on the Empire State Building’s 86th-floor observation deck. 

The mast itself was an engineering feat. The mast was engineered to permit the mooring of a dirigible without putting too much weight or strain the Empire State Building’s structure. It had a bracket on its lower end that would house the dirigible while it was docked.

The mooring mast was one of the first of its kind in history. After the mast was built, the actual act of docking was the next challenge. Contrary to popular belief, the airship was not actually tethered to the mast itself. Instead, the New York Harbor Police used cables and grapples on the Empire State Building’s roof to secure the airship to the m
