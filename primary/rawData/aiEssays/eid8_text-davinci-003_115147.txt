My family often likes to joke around. We'll think of silly games to play and make each other laugh. But we don't often get the chance to all be together, since we live in different cities.

Recently, however, we all got together for a family reunion at my parents' cottage. It was a joyful reunion that had been months in the making.

On the first night, it was just my parents, my brothers and me sitting around the table eating dinner. We'd all been digging into the food and talking for a while when my dad started to make jokes about some of the things my mom had cooked. 

The dinner—and the jokes—just kept getting better and better until my mom finally burst out laughing. We all joined in, not just because of my dad's funny jokes, but because of the relief we all felt just to be together as a family after so long apart.

I was laughing so hard that tears came to my eyes. We were all laughing, really laughing, and it felt like a weight had been lifted from our shoulders. 

That night, it felt like our laughter was the shortest distance between us. It was a reminder, in a way, of our connection to each other, a connection only deepened through laughter. 

We've all gone our separate ways now, back to our different lives, but the laughter and the memories of our reunion stay with us.
