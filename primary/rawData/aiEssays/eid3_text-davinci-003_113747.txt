The setting of Joe Kurmaski's 'Rough Road Ahead' has a lasting effect on the cyclist. The story follows a young cyclist navigating a vast, winding, bumpy, dirt road deep in an isolated desert. The landscape itself is relentless, with sharp turns at unpredictable moments and steep rocky hills. All around, the dessert offers an unforgiving harshness, with dry desert shrubs and jagged mesas.

The cyclist must constantly battle the terrain in order to make progress. The winding roads, in particular, are a challenge to him. He is not able to gain momentum or gain speed on these turns, instead often having to come to a complete stop and adjust his line before continuing. This adds to the exhaustion of the ride and can stand in the way of a personal accomplishment. 

The dry desert climate does not offer any reprieve for the cyclist. Gusting winds, relentless heat, and a lack of shade are all issues that the character must constantly suffer. Lack of water, too, can make it difficult to replenish lost energy and sustain his endurance. In order for the cyclist to stay on track, he must learn quickly how to ration his resources. 

Finally, the terrain of the desert often conceals hidden hazards. Rocks, tree roots, and hidden ditches are just a few of the challenges that the cyclist must constantly be on the lookout for. It's these little details that make navigating the terrain a difficult task.
