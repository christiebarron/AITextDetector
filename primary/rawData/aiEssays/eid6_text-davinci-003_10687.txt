The Empire State Building was completed in 1931, and was the largest skyscraper in the world at the time. One unique feature was its "mooring mast," over 200 feet tall, constructed in order to allow dirigibles (blimps) to moor (dock) at the top of the building. While the prospect of having dirigibles dock atop the Empire State Building was exciting, it also posed a great challenge from a design and safety standpoint. This essay will discuss some of the obstacles the builders faced in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. 

The first challenge was to construct a large mast which could bear the weight and pressure of mooring a dirigible. The top of the mast was made of metal, but the section below the dirigible was hollow and filled with cement for added strength. This was designed with safety in mind, in that if a mooring line did fail, the strain would go through the mast not the building itself. The top of the mast was a platform which could hold anchor lines or a curved gangway for passengers to disembark. All these components had to be engineered and constructed with precision.

The second challenge was to create an effective mooring system. Having an open platform atop the mast created additional safety issues when the dirigible was preparing to dock. A special wind sail had to be designed so the blimp could stay in one place while the passengers disembarked. A
