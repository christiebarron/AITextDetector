The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first was that they needed a way to fit a high speed ballast onto the crane. The Empire State is a well known and important skyscraper location with over 6,000 apartments and over 1,000,000 tons of assets including retail, office and retail space.

The second obstacle was that the high speed ballast would require a long, heavy rope or an excavator. For their solution they brought in three steel beams designed by American builder Aron W. Gentry and one by British engineer Thomas Davenport for use in the Empire State Building. Using these, the builders built the Empire State from the ground up. The three workers for the two towers built a small elevator system and raised one of the top towers to its highest point, while the eight tower building workers worked a " exceptional lifting system " that was "at least 30 inches in diameter (7.55 feet high and 8 feet wide) and 6 to 8 feet high (12.25 feet deep), all to achieve the desired dimensions." The system's lift capability was 1,000 lbs. (9 tons) per second (9,500 pounds per minute) at the top of that tower.

The idea that an elevator will propel any mass of matter, whether or not the materials, that goes around it is not only laughable but also downright ridiculous. The skyscrapers are not designed to hold large items
