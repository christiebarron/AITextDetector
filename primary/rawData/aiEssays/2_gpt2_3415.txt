I believe that censorship of materials in libraries can be a positive influence on the public's understanding of what's relevant and relevant to our societies," he said. "(Libraries in general, and their collections) are important institutions in the life of the country. The state and society are in the hands of the public. The people who care about them and who have chosen them. For that reason, freedom of expression is critical to our democracies. This freedom cannot be efforts to censor books which are not available from within our schools."

"That's what's really important," he added.

"That's what's been good about our democratic system since 1800 because we had a system of representation. We had an unshackled idea of what democracy meant."

The debate came after the Supreme Court of India ruled that books should be placed on display in library halls without a license, which the government has argued is an overstepping of political correctness. The verdict and other landmark rulings could spell the end of the debate over censorship of books in libraries.

The government had argued it will not pursue any attempt to take down books by censorship or public shaming.
