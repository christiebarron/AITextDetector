An example of a time someone in my life was patient was in the last half inning of a 6-8 game playing in the Chicago Cubs winter league team. The night before the game I had just lost my home baseball to a rabid Fenway homerun by Ryan Vogelsong. I was playing for an Oakland-based baseball team, and the game was a live broadcast by NBC. One pitcher was yelling, "Bats, bats, bats" from his seat, and the next hitter was doing the same because his batting gloves were down because he had caught the ball with the bat's swinging edge! You would think that was going to be the end of an MLB game. I was on my way back home when it did take a while for me to regain my bearings and get my bearings back.

I'm an emotional person, if not more so. One of the things I try to understand is that we all have time to heal mentally, physically and emotionally. If you have a hard time you feel pain. If you don't feel pain, you've got an issue in your soul, a disease. If you work hard it may help to help with that sickness, and it makes you feel better. When you are dealing with things you like to do and it's difficult to get enough sleep it usually just helps. It works its magic.

We also have these wonderful psychological healing devices in the form of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction and Cognitive Behavioral Enhancement training.
