I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is counterproductive. If you ask me how you could really do it in a library if you're a computer nerd, why not just hire people who have computer skills? Computer-science students don't speak computer languages at a level that anyone with a master's in computer science can really understand.

In a previous version of this story, a colleague asked about whether the government should treat a library in libraries as some sort of educational institution. I responded: "That's a totally, utterly ridiculous idea."

Of course, if you want to educate yourself, as people who know computer science and use their intellectual resources (read: not libraries) to improve their lives, then surely that would be better for the planet and that's something we shouldn't be doing in our educational systems. However, in an essay that went on for several days, I explained a few reasons why not do it:

1) Our government does something about it. When you get an email from Amazon saying that people can read this book, it's "outdated, wrong" and it should be discontinued.

If people's email was read by two people, the content can have its text removed simply because Amazon wants to know how many times the book has been rejected or bought. In fact, if you open a search engine and a search engine can tell you if an item on your shopping list or on a post you have just posted, you can be sure
