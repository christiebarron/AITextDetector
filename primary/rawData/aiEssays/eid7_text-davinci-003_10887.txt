I recently had a situation in which I needed to practice patience. I was out shopping with my mother when, unexpectedly, my mother's credit card got declined. My mother became very embarrassed and started to apologize profusely. That's when I stepped in and reminded her that it was ok. I told her that the most important thing was to stay calm and just figure out a different way to get what we needed. 

Rather than being frustrated or embarrassed, I remained patient and understanding. I waited while my mother talked to the cashier and explained the situation. Ultimately, we ended up using another card and all was solved. My mother thanked me for being patient while she figured out an alternate solution. I'm glad I was able to keep my cool and help my mother out of an uncomfortable situation.
