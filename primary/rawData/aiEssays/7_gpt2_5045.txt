An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my boyfriend as early as December 15, 1984, when our 3-year old son sat in the front seat of our car, my 3 year-old daughter was holding on to a pillow while a dog ran over and I held the blanket. I just knew that if I didn't go for that, he'd think that I was just lying on the floor when he came closer," Hickey said.
