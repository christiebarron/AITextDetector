The setting of Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead” is filled with countless features that affect the cyclist in various ways. The first feature of the setting is the terrain itself. It is described as mountainous, featuring steep climbs and winding downhills that challenge the agility and skill of the rider. The cyclist has to navigate the terrain with care as one wrong maneuver can be catastrophic. The second feature is the weather, as the cyclist is met with extreme heat and humidity which has an effect on his performance. Lastly, there is the terrain’s unevenness and unexpected dips which create a situation that forces the cyclist out of his comfort zone and into full-on survival mode.

All of these features require the cyclist to remain extremely focused and ready to act quickly if a situation arises. He must navigate the terrain with precision as it is full of dips and sharp turns that can cause him to lose control of his bike. The extreme weather conditions and unpredictable terrain also tire the cyclist out faster, making it more difficult to keep going. 

The features of the setting have a big impact on the cyclist in “Rough Road Ahead”. It not only tests his skills as a rider, but also his mental tenacity and ability to remain focused and ready for any potential obstacles he may face. The cyclist has to summon all his strength of body and mind in order to overcome the challenges presented by the difficult setting.
