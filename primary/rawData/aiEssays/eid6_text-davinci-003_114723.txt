The Empire State Building was a revolutionary achievement of human engineering spanning 102 stories and 396m tall. It had been previously dreamed of that by constructing the tallest buildings in the world, dirigibles would have a dockable point to which they could arrive safely. However, this harsh reality of achieving such a feat was fraught with numerous problems and obstacles.

The first obstacle was the structural limitations of the building. This was because dirigibles are incredibly large and complex airships, meaning the Empire State Building had to be built very sturdy in order to support the immense weight. It was determined that it had to be built with steel frames and girders to ensure it could withstand the force of dirigibles docking against it. As a result, the cost of the building rocketed as steel was expensive. 

The next obstacle was the issue of engineering. Not only did the architects have to make sure the concrete building was sturdy and would not collapse, they also had to consider the safety of the passengers of the dirigibles. A crucial element was the mooring mast, which was a large steel pole that extended up from the 103rd floor, allowing the dirigibles to attach to the building and keep them steady while people and goods got on and off. Engineers had to make sure that this mast was able to withstand the winds of the turbulent skies while the dirigibles were docked.

The final obstacle was bureaucratic and financial. It wasnâ€™
