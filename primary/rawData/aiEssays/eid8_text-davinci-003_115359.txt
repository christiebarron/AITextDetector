I was with my best friend, Mara, at the movies the other day. We had been close since childhood and had seen tons of films. We had gone to this particular theater many times before but, this time, something funny happened.

As we waited in line at the concession stand, Mara was filling me in on the latest gossip when a man from behind us suddenly burst out into laughter. We both turned around to see a little girl, probably about four years old, wearing a bright yellow hooded jacket, a huge smile on her face, and a quarter held up in her hand. She had asked her dad to buy her some candy and he said no, but she confidently offered to pay the bill!

The dad burst out laughing and gave her a hug. Mara and I started laughing along with them. The little girl smiled even wider and Mara and I knew that we would never forget that moment. That connection between us three was so strong that even today, when we tell the story, we all still laugh at the memory of the little girl with the quarter. We all felt more connected in that moment, and I know that laughter has the power to do that.
