Dear Editor,

I feel strongly that computers have had a positive effect on people’s lives. As technology advances, computers are becoming ever more ingrained in our everyday lives. It seems likely that this will only increase as time progresses, and I believe that this is a cause for celebration.

Computers have enabled the spread of information in a way the world has never seen before, enabling a blossoming of knowledge and understanding on a global scale. Whether it is through personal computers, tablets, or smartphones, computers have connected us to the world like never before, allowing us to access information from anywhere, anytime.

Education benefits greatly from the rise of computers, as students can access information live while researching assignments or projects. Moreover, computing topics are now integral to a course of study. Technology has allowed us to store and process huge amounts of data, which can then be used to research solutions to some of the world's most challenging problems.

Furthermore, computers have become a great entertainment source. They allow people to access films, music, games, social media, and much more from the comfort of their own home, with no need to spend money or leave the house.

In summary, I strongly believe that computers have had a beneficial effect on people’s lives. They have transformed information access and communication, enabled new advancements in education, and provided affordable entertainment for everyone. I hope that this letter will help persuade readers to agree with me.
