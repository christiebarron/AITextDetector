Computers have many effects on people. And that's why we need to understand what is happening."

But, said Kim, there aren't just two factors to consider: the amount of data needed to understand the impact of large-scale software solutions on individuals' data.

For example, small numbers of users are more likely to use certain products and services online, and data can carry larger consequences if users try new products and technologies too quickly. These trends in data aren't consistent across businesses, he said.

Citizen Analytics, an ad-led analytics group that also collaborates internally with Microsoft, has found that it has seen significant increases in software-based solutions that take advantage of analytics and "underperform" in their effectiveness. The group says it also is testing new software that integrates with automated systems in ways that are "more scalable."

"We're seeing improvements that havebling to be able to understand user behaviors such as a customer's habits and preferences," said Martin Smith, principal data scientist for CFO Analytics. "There are going to become a lot of ways to understand, measure, and better detect user behaviors and trends in general."

Companies typically want to know things like whether they want a product's performance compared to a database of users, said Kim. If a software company is concerned that customer data, like user behavior, may be too big, it may want to take other metrics, such as customer satisfaction, to better understand that
