The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In January 1841 the Metropolitan Commission placed a new bridge over the Hudson River between Buffalo and New York City with a diameter of 5,700 feet.

Construction of the Tower of York on the top of the Hudson could be completed by the end of the century.

The Tower of York, on the Hudson, was built about 15 years before the first planes came into use.

The Empire State Building was constructed in 1752 using glass-block glass from the late William H. Smith. During World War I and the war in Europe it was opened for the first time as an exhibition space in the War Memorial Building. The building was constructed of 5,280 m2 steel and built in 1772 by William F. Copley, Jr. it was later opened as the War Memorial for the 1917, 1923 and 1924 World Wars to attract visitors and help increase the building's popularity. The Empire State has been an iconic building in New York City for many decades and is considered an architectural landmark in the United States of America.

The Empire State Building was the home of the Rockefeller University which was established in 1906 as a National Gallery in New York City and became the new National Museum in 1922. During World War II the Rockefeller University School of Design built a new National Military Education Center of the National Guard. While it is still a member of the National University Center of American History,
