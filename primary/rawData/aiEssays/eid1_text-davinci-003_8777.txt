I was on a date with a guy I had just met a few weeks earlier. We were having a great time, and the conversation was easy and fun. 

At one point I said something that was supposed to be funny, but it didn't quite land the way I had intended. We both sort of hesitated for a moment, not sure what to do next. Then, suddenly we both burst out laughing. It wasn't even the joke that cracked us up, but rather the shared feeling of awkwardness that preceded it. 

That laughter was so refreshing and honest that it immediately bonded us together. From that moment on, I somehow knew this date was going to be different. We continued talking and laughing for hours, and it felt like I had already known this person for a long time.

It's been five years since that date and laughter is still just as integral to our relationship as it was in the beginning!
