As librarians, we have an ethical responsibility to provide access to a wide range of materials and viewpoints, without bias or censorship. The right to access information and express a variety of opinions, including those we disagree with, is crucial to a thriving democracy. However, censorship in libraries is a complex issue and it is important to tread carefully when deciding what materials to make available to the public. 

Censorship must not be used as an instrument to suppress unpopular opinions or ideas, nor should it be used to shield individuals from materials deemed offensive by only a few. We must be mindful to not limit the public’s access to ideas and information that may challenge our understanding of the world. Furthermore, librarians should be aware that censorship should not be applied to materials simply because they contain offensive language – in such cases, the librarian should consider providing contextual information or explanations that can help library users to make an informed decision about whether to check out the material for themselves. 

At the same time, it is important to recognize that sometimes a library must take steps to protect vulnerable populations from content which could be considered highly offensive. In such cases, libraries should consider creating an alternate resource or section within the library
