I distinctly remember the sound of my own laughter rising and echoing in the tight confines of our little car. We had just finished our dinner at the cozy Italian restaurant downtown — a dinner that seemed to revolve as much around our laughter as it did about the food. 

It was my partner’s idea to go out tonight, and I had to admit, they didn’t disappoint. The meal had been a remarkable study in humor; their witty comments throughout the meal had kept me laughing and amused the entire night. 

At one point, I had gotten completely carried away with the hilarity of the moment and hadn’t been able to contain my laughter. I actually laughed so hard that I ended up clapping my hands and nearly ruining the moment by making a loud commotion in the restaurant. Despite that, though, the moment was a great one — made better with the addition of laughter. 

Before parting ways, we each gave the other a big hug, and, of course, it was accompanied by the gentle sound of our laughter. It was the perfect finale to what had already been a night of joy.

I’ll never forget the feeling of our laughter filling the car as we drove away from the restaurant, both content with the shared experience.
