The ending of the poem reflects the uncertainty of the speaker. By stating that she will take the test again, it implies that she may not have passed the first time around. The image of the hibiscus blooming with the return of the geese is used as a metaphor for the speakerâ€™s own resilience and her determination to face the test a second time despite the odds. It serves to highlight her perseverance in the face of challenge and her faith in the power of renewal and growth.
