The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. For example, the first person in the building to set it up was a German-American engineer, Heinrich Himmler. But his efforts did not help create the building as some critics say it did not adequately reflect the reality of the Great Depression. Himmler, for example, was not in a position to dictate design of building materials in ways that the architect could understand. The Himmler architects, for example, used the most sophisticated of industrial building materials in their design.

At the time of their demolition the Himmler architects, who had been building the Empire State Building for many years, had a number of projects that had to be completed before a single dirigible could be fitted out (that would take over one week). For example the German-American, Robert Vidal, worked with several builders in Chicago in the early 1930s. For each of his projects Robert worked for a few weeks to plan various housing projects and plans. Many would be completed over time. The last project that Vidal worked on was the one that brought the entire Empire State Building to completion in the early 1970s.

In the early 1970s Vidal and his wife, Marie, lived in a rental housing project on the edge of their former home on the Chicago River. The project had started out as a $10-a-day house, but as a combination of improvements and the
