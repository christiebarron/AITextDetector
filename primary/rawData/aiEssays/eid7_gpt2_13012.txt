An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was 22.

I was born in England in 1791. We were in a boarding school and had a good reputation there—if that is what you ask us. I grew up with a decent family—an aunt, my little sister and my two brothers. I went to school under Miss B. G. Wm. of Winchester; Miss M. C. P. of London; Miss W. H. L. of London; Miss S. C. P. of London; Miss H. P.] and then Miss M. G."

From the outset she was pretty much a regular at school, though I soon went to her in my old age. Every year we went to the same home, though the weather was terrible; and I took her to the doctor for her asthma. After that I came to New York where I got a pretty satisfactory answer to her question.

"How many years do you live in the city?"

"I think five—that is my whole life, and my whole life is in England. I don't think I like life at all. I feel very sorry for the people in that community, I really do. I feel quite ashamed of them. They are so poor. The government is always taking care of them. I felt sorry for Mrs. Wills.'s, of course, but I didn't wish to be put in their predicament
