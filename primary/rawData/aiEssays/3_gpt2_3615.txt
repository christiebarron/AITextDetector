Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. One setting is based on the way the road looks for cyclists and the impact this can have as well as the rider's experience of what the riding is like before the cycle hits the ground. This also means that the cyclist may experience problems using an incorrect way of approaching or if the bike is too close to the road. Another setting is 'Won't Take On A Bicycle' where cycling on this setting is quite unusual and if you want to go in for a ride where you're not accustomed to rough, you might even take it. With Roadwork, it is important for everyone to have good advice on what is best for them,spray along and try it out. You can find advice from some of the many community groups, such as Roadworking NZ or Roadways NZ.
