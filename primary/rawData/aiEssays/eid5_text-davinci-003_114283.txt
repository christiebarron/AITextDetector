Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, evokes a range of emotions from its readers. On the surface, the memoir is a story of Rodriguez's personal journey, exploring his success in the fashion industry and the struggles of his early life. Yet, beneath this narrative lies a much deeper and more somber mood.

The memoir is defined by a feeling of melancholy and despair, as Rodriguez's childhood is punctured by abuse and neglect. Despite his childhood experiences, Rodriguez refuses to be bitter and instead chooses to draw strength from them. This determination is poignantly expressed in scenes of struggle and hardship. Rodriguez’s family, with their father absent and their mother's battle with an addiction, is fractured and struggling to cope. In the midst of his pain, Rodriguez finds the courage to succeed, driven on by his belief in “the power of possibility”.

Although the memoir is sombre, Rodriguez does not dwell on his sorrow and pain. Instead, he actively looks for moments of joy and positivity to highlight and explore. He appreciates the beauty in his daily life, from the sunlight filtering through the trees in the park to the neighbor's homemade tamales and finds strength in their happy memories. Despite difficult circumstances, Rodriguez chooses to savor the good moments amidst the bad.
