I was out to lunch with my best friend, and we were sharing stories from when we were kids. We laughed so hard at some of the things that had happened! I certainly couldn't believe the 'bad-haired day' she had had, where she'd dyed her hair bright green. We both gasped when she mentioned that her mum had bought her a hat to cover it up.

One thing that always makes us laugh is our mutual awkwardness. We love recounting the time we were out at a party and both had simultaneously spilled a drink across ourselves. We had one of those painful moments of silence, just standing there, soaking wet and looking at each other, each of us trying not to laugh until finally we just burst out in hysterics. It was still so funny, no matter how many times we told the story. 

Laughter is definitely a bond between us. Even when we disagree, a good laugh always brings us back to a place of comfort and understanding. I'm so grateful for the gift of laughter. It's a common language that we can always rely on when words fail us.
