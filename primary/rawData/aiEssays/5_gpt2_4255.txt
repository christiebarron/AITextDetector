The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' can sometimes become very sour. It's a memoir about being the girl with a voice and her struggles to understand them. It's a memoir about dealing with the fact that there is often a stigma placed on people who write about having certain voices in their lives.

There isn't much we can do on her behalf to make that happen. But after the writing comes into focus, we get a glimpse into her life and the story of a loving, intelligent, and devoted mom who found a way through her experiences to get her own voice out there. For the record, she's here.

You can watch more of her song 'No Country for Old Men' from her collection at the following link:
