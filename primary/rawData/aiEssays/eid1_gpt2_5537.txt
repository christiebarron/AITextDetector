Computers have many effects on people. One is that their brains turn off when they read. This is due to a brain process called "cognitive dissonance." We're very familiar with this concept: the feeling of being asked to 'go back' or simply "go on autopilot.'

According to psychologist Dr. Michael Schofield, one study found that participants who read more were more likely to lose cognitive capacity that would normally occur when people are already in a situation that threatens to overwhelm them

The study comes from researchers at the University of Cambridge and the University of Pennsylvania, who tested a group of about 20 researchers at the University of Oxford.

In the early sections of each session, volunteers had to pick up a novel message, then complete a simple task to read aloud a portion of the message aloud, for 15 minutes. They were asked if they wanted to read either a good story or an ill-fated story.

Those who read more were more likely to lose an averageires cognitive ability. The more likely they were to read a story, the more likely they were to lose an averageires cognitive ability.

If you were thinking about doing something, you're likely to think about reading a story.

"The good news is that it's not all about you, it's not just about you," says Professor John Wold from the Department of Psychology, who led the study.

It's just that there's a disconnect
