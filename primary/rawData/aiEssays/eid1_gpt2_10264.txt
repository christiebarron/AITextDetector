Computers have many effects on people. We can detect differences between people in this social environment," says Lillian, one of the study's authors and a researcher for the university's Institute of Social Sciences.

Researchers say that when people're exposed to their environment, their ability to adapt to it — and that many of such differences are shared — can be affected. "We often talk about the social role of environmental factors such as socioeconomic status and the way society is organized or the way people live, and these social factors are so tightly integrated that even within the same group of genes, people are interacting with one another," says Lillian.

People with autism and other neurodevelopmental conditions tend to become exposed to a host of other environmental stimuli throughout their lives with the help of some of these genes. When that happens, researchers say, other people are more at risk, and they feel that they have less protection against developing autism. "It would seem that our efforts at understanding the dynamics of autism might be a strong motivator in this study," says Lillian.

Previous attempts to measure environmental factors are difficult. The present system, by contrast, is the most robust to date. As a result, it is a model for future research, which includes tests to determine which environmental factors are a cause of autism in individuals with children who have trouble with family, caregivers and siblings.

"This is the first time that we have this robust system to have such an accurate measurement
