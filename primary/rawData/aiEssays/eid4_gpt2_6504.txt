The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it doesn't want to disappoint you with the way it handles spoilers or with the way the story starts to twist and end. I was a little impressed that the book closes with you telling the main story, just being too busy telling the next one!

When I look back at what happens in the world of Winter Hibiscus after the events of Ice-T first, I see you are not very "cool" and thinking about what happened later that time. But in the next chapter, you have to come out of nowhere and face the end. You can't see all of the "crows" who you lost in the world in Ice-T for you in Summer, Snowdon and Cuddly will be back and new enemies will appear as well. There is also a lot of new enemies. I think that in Snowdon's turn she gets the opportunity to fight Cuddly or some friends.

The more you approach the story and the more you think about the future, the more I learn. I'll admit that in Winter Hibiscus, I feel much more excited and excited. I was even encouraged by the fact that it isn't all about your father... He's the one who finally got to leave for the year because you finally found your freedom. In fact, Winter Hibiscus was one of my favourite fantasy books ever. I really feel like I am a fan of Winter Hibisc
