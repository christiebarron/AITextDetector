The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it does so clearly in the first, because the books are broken, the dialogue is lacking, the book's length is minuscule and the chapters are unmemorable. Not one of these stories can be found in a book as big as this. And you never know just how much of this will be forgotten. If there was a plot point worth pointing out, it won't be there.

This is the thing about good book. What you don't need as long as you're reading it is so bad it will eventually cause the last sentence to hang in your head, like you'll never get anything out of it again. For a long time I have read this book twice. The first is in 1997, when the author did the long run rewriting. This time it was on the whole length of the book because they cut out the dialogue, rewrote it for the last three chapters, and did this for the third. I haven't read this book since. It didn't start on the same page as the other two, but I've gotten used to it. I've even gotten used to it being in the back yard.

I don't think Winter Hibiscus is good at anything other than editing. It tries too hard to keep you read in your head. It tries badly to stay grounded in your head. I suspect it didn't succeed. It doesn't write well, although that's only
