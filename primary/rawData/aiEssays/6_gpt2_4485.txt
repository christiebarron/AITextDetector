The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Before the first of those was completed around 1900, the first dirigible was not installed, and even so, a special, specially developed design was introduced by a Japanese engineer named Takashi Mitsubishi to complete the system. He proposed that the first dirigible, with a maximum speed of 50,000 kph in the air, could be used across the world without any interference from a human pilot, although it could still be used on a world to which ships could not be located. It had to be possible to get the "best light to travel in space without the worry of taking any risks and getting stuck there." (Takashi Mitsubishi Report, No. 14 of 1910) Because of its immense size and complexity, this was not a particularly difficult project, and its cost in the form of the Japanese government's own debt meant that it was not an option for people who tried the approach, either; it had to be considered as a low-cost "hibernate" version of the Empire State Building project with no commercial or personal interests, and for these participants not to have been connected with the public.

Despite his many setbacks, Mitsubishi made it onto the final building of the World Trade Center, at the site of the World Trade Center's first major air strike, in 1944, while still on his flight to Europe. In 1945, this
