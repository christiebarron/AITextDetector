Computers have many effects on people. Some of the most interesting are the effects of the electrical system and the system itself. On a PC this is often called 'power loss'. On Mac it is called 'power efficiency', on your Mac it is called 'power-efficiency.'This, of course, depends on what you do with the CPU, memory and processing cores. On a single processor, the more cores you use, the greater is the power loss that needs to be accounted for. At this point, you might want to consider some software that will allow you to do this to your system. Some programs which were previously considered too CPU intensive will allow you to put those programs in 'virtual memory'. That means that programs like Java or JavaFX are no longer used by your system for 'unlimited power'. In Mac OS X they are much less 'unlimited power' than they were on a single hardware platform.

Power loss is probably the most common of all in computer cases. In particular the power loss when the power comes down. In the case of the CPU or the disk it is also known as a 'peak temperature'. This is when power is 'no longer coming in'. These conditions, along with your environment, make it possible for the power loss to be extremely minimal. It is also known as the'max cooling efficiency'. This can be as high as 80%. The following charts show the power loss after the most recent CPU run is used:
