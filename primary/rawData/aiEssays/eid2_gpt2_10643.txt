I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is an inherently dangerous business and should be outlawed. This legislation's first provision, Section 1144, requires that libraries "shall ensure (a) every accessible book as to its contents, (b) books that are publicly accessible and publicly available to the public are clearly marked, clearly identified, readily available to the public and readily available to the public; and (c) Library boards shall have an ability to prohibit or prohibit access to material on library grounds."

"Article XVI of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights obligates public library workers to demonstrate the dignity of their human being â€¦ and the right of an identifiable individual to have the freedom to decide whether that person should be allowed to print information relating to a protected category of protected content, such as information about intellectual works that is considered in accordance with the law, and the right of individual protected organizations and organizations seeking public funding to ensure that material is not used in an offensive manner."

The bill will also include a provision that prohibits "public performance of government duties."

According to Wollheim, there are "many ways our government can act today so as to promote democracy, free speech, and civil liberties, the purpose of which would be to end tyranny and allow political parties and individuals to express and keep their opinions."

While I disagree with many of the proposals proposed, what I agree with most of all is that public libraries are an important part of the public discussion in this country
