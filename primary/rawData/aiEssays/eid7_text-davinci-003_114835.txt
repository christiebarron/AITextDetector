One time, I was walking down the street and a girl with crutches passed me. I immediately noticed how slow she was going and I could tell that she was struggling. I decided to slow my pace and walk with her. We talked for a while and I could tell that she was doing her best. After a few minutes, I suggested that she take a break, so we stopped and she sat down on a bench for a few minutes while I stood by her side. 

Afterwards, we kept walking until we arrived at her destination. Despite the fact that it took longer than usual, I never once complained and was happy to help. Being patient with her meant that I was understanding and tolerant of her situation, and the end result was that she felt supported and well taken care of.
