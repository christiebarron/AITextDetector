Dear Editor,

I am writing to voice my opinion on the effects computers have on people and to persuade your readers to recognize the importance of this issue. 

Computers are a major part of our lives today and have certainly made our lives more convenient and efficient in many ways. However, the amount of time people spend interacting with computers is sometimes far too much. It has been seen through various studies that too much computer use can lead to numerous physical, mental, and emotional issues, such as eyesight problems, depression, and social isolation.

We must prioritize physical activity as the human body was not designed to stay in a fixed position for long periods of time. We must call attention to the outcome of computer dependency in young children, in particular. According to a recent study, sedentary behavior in children has been linked to several issues, such as depression and increased irritability.

It is essential that we all take the right steps to make sure computer use is properly moderated. We should be fully aware of the potential health consequences of computer use and limit its use to ensure we are leading healthy and balanced lifestyles.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
