Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion as to the effects computers have on people. As technology increasingly infiltrates our everyday life, so too does the prevalence of computers and other forms of digital media. It is with this in mind that I firmly believe that the effects of computer technology on the lives of people should be assessed in a positive light. 

Computers allow us access to a vast wealth of knowledge and resources that would never have been available to us in the past. We are able to stay in touch with family, research complex topics, and experience new worlds that exist only in a digital realm. The ubiquity of social media sites gives us the opportunity to engage with an international community, fostering a sense of connectedness and community that transcends physical limitations.

At the same time, computers also bring their own set of unique challenges. Issues of privacy, security, and responsible use of digital media are of particular importance. However, I believe we should not let these issues prevent us from appreciating the uniquely powerful set of tools and resources that computers provide. 

In conclusion, I suggest that computers have overall had a positive effect on the lives of individuals, and that we can only be enriched by their continued presence in our lives.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
