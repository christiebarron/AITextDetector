An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a friend and she was doing very well and her parents went off on her for an hour and a half. All day we were eating and drinking, but it was just so amazing to have someone that was here for this and she had this fantastic, wonderful family.

The family will now have dinner with my mother at 1 pm and at 8 pm my sisters and I will go back to school. And of course we will also get back to work and I will be in touch with everyone. My son has a good morning and a great morning. We are all so focused on our jobs and everything, but this was just something that really stuck with me personally and the impact it did on my family in that life wasn't limited to just the job I was doing.

So, thank you all for looking after Mr. James and his family.

Thanks all for all your questions, and I will make sure you have my next post on it all soon.
