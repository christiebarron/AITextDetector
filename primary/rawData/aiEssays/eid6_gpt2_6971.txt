The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Among them, the public objected to certain changes to the zoning codes. And so on.

Juschinsky led dozens of others to the proposed building. The most memorable of the projects they saw was the South Lake Union building, a new, pedestrian-friendly extension of the subway station. According to Juschinsky, the new structure would allow car-pooling commuters to the building (and, for that matter, to take public transit from South Main Street to Union Street).
