Computers have many effects on people. So, as computer science progresses, the best way to identify an effect of an algorithm is to use it.

An example of that would be to get people to think about their options when they think about something. (If you want to read up on what this tool does, watch my video. If you can't find the video, check my page on the topic. Or check out my articles on the topic on my site here).

A better way to talk about the algorithms and how computers interact with it is to talk abstractly about this topic. Maybe you will look at the examples you could give and decide whether at all it is important to discuss here or not.

A second one will be to ask questions in general.

If you have the same kind of desire as I have and the same person you like as a child, then you would choose to take the shortcut to something else. (You see how I had a crush on you, my kid! But this was a different kind of crush than I was having on a date!) This could be something that I wish I did more often (so my husband might have been dating me less or so often? And he doesn't do that much stuff anymore!) Or maybe a job, but you're busy in school, so you would be very happy to spend more time working and learning. Perhaps there is a better way and this is a way to solve my problem
