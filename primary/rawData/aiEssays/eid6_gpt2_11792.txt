The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One was the Federal Trade Commission's proposal for a separate way to install dirigibles in every major American city. But a new, wireless service could enable dirigibles to be mounted directly above the building. In the United States, an airplane, an aircraft carrying passengers or cargo must be connected to its master's or cargo carrier to deliver a piece of cargo or a package, such as a passport or the Star Wars poster, before it can dock on the dock. The Federal Trade Commission's proposal, however, still offered many advantages: a high level of flexibility for docking. In its initial draft of the plan, the Federal Trade Commission asked the FAA to determine the maximum number of dirigibles possible. That number was determined by the number of dirigibles that could be used on an airplane. The design was then adopted by the FAA and the Departmentolia of New York, which included its own system of dirigibles. The result was a new system called the dirigibles docking system, after the aviation industry had a say in the design, for which the FAA had already installed a high-speed dock system before World War II. It now uses the same basic design technology for docking to the aircraft as it did during World War II, says Peter Lefebvre, a longtime fellow in the aviation industry and the author of the 1993 book, The Flying Lizards.
