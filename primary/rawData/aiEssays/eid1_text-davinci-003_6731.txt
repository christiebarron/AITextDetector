Dear Editor, 

We are currently living in a digital age where almost every aspect of our lives involve technology, most predominantly the use of computers. Computers have undoubtedly revolutionised education, work, communication, and the way we access and store information, and this has had positive effects on many peopleâ€™s lives. 

However, I believe it is important to recognise that the effects of computers can be both positive and negative. For example, there is increasing evidence that overuse of computers can lead to physical and mental health problems. People, especially young people, often spend long hours on devices, resulting in poor posture, strain on eyesight and a lack of physical activity, which can all contribute to health issues. Furthermore, using screens too often and for too long can disrupt sleep patterns and sleep quality. 

On the other hand, it is undeniable that computers have revolutionised how we communicate, learn, work and have made life much easier in many ways. That being said, it is important to be aware of the possible health risks and to strike the right balance with computer use. Clearly, this applies to both young people and those of us who use computers for work or leisure. 

I urge everyone to consider the positive and negative effects of computers and keep digital usage in moderation to ensure a healthy lifestyle and to protect our physical and mental wellbeing. 

Yours sincerely,
