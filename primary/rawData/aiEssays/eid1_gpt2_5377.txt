Computers have many effects on people. We understand this by looking at the role that hardware plays in people's lives and also their health."

It was the second such experiment conducted in the laboratory in London that focused RxS. Researchers from the University of Sussex tested the effects of a different kind of "computer" and found that when the synthetic opioid-based drug was administered in a human, it produced results similar to those in a computer, researchers said.

"The question is what effects of such drug, as our paper shows, will they have on our health," Peter van Rensburg, the chief executive of medical device maker Roche, said Monday in a teleconference. He added that studiesikarp had shown that it might help people detect diseases "in a much more effective way" than traditional narcotics and be used as a "lifestyle drug."

What do the results mean for doctors and health systems? As RxS became availableâ€”and in some countries in the U.S. more quickly than on the black market. Roche and TIF Health Systems, which will be the first companies to sell it, are already in talks with medical devices makers, though they are not expected to be able to announce the results of their pilot program with RxS.

In some countries other treatments are already available through other drugs and are not subject to review by the Food and Drug Administration, according to a recent European Society of Clinical and Translational Patholary Diseases study
