To the Editor, 

As technology continues to advance, computers are having a larger and larger impact on people's lives. The opinions on the effects of computers are all over the map. Some people believe they help us to be more efficient and productive, while others claim that our reliance on computers has caused us to become disconnected from real life and lazy.

After extensive research on the effects of computers, I believe that the use of computers has had a primarily positive effect on people's lives. Through computers, individuals now have access to more information than ever before, allowing them to become more knowledgeable and informed. Additionally, computers allow us to be more productive than we were in the past, enabling us to do more work in less time.

On the other hand, some have argued that computers have made us more dependent on machines and less capable of solving our own problems. I do not think that computers should replace human interaction. However, it is true that computers bring us closer together. Through the use of social media and other communication tools, we can stay connected with people from across the globe.

To conclude, I believe that the use of computers has had a mostly positive effect on people's lives. By allowing us to access more knowledge, become more productive, and stay connected, computers have improved our lives in many ways. I encourage readers to thoughtfully weigh both the pros and cons of computers and make conclusions for themselves. 

Sincerely,
