The Empire State Building is an iconic structure located in Manhattan, New York, and the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock on its roof was a fascinating concept. However, the process of making this a reality was far from easy. Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted's book "The Mooring Mast" details the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock on its roof. 

One of the main challenges for the builders of the Empire State Building was finding a suitable place for the mooring mast. The idea of creating a mast was initially considered, but the space required on the roof of the building posed a problem. This meant that a location outside the building itself had to be found. A nearby park was identified as a potential option, but this proposal came with a range of logistical challenges, including securing permission from the various relevant parties and preparing the site for the mast by cleaning it of debris and installing lighting.

Another significant obstacle to the project was the issue of safety. It was essential that diregibles could be safely secured and moored to the mast, and that the related procedures were as safe as possible. To address this, traction windlasses were installed on the top of the mast, which draped cables down the sides of the building. This enabled pilots to use the cables to secure their dirigibles without having to rely simply on the power of their engines. 

The last major challenge was the
