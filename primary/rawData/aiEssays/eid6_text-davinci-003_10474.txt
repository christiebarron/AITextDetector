The task of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was a tremendous challenge for the builders of this iconic structure. The ambitious attempt, a revolutionary development at the time, posed serious, unforeseen engineering and safety issues. As detailed in “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders had to account for a number of obstacles in order to make the Empire State Building a dockable destination for dirigibles. 

The first and foremost issue was structural; the tower, as originally designed, was simply too weak to support the weight of the airships. As a result, the building’s facade was reinforced with steel girders two feet thick, the balconies were removed from the 72nd to 77th floors, and 10-foot-tall concrete mooring masts were added to the sides of the building near the 78th and 79th floor levels. In addition to strengthening the tower, the masts had to be connected to the building’s frame in such a way as to make an airtight seal in order to prevent hydrogen gas leakage and an uncontrolled fire. These modifications had a tremendous impact on the aesthetic of the building, with the concrete moorings adding to the Art Deco style of the building’s spire. 

The building was also equipped with an array of meteorological devices on its roof in order to provide the dirigible pilots with data about the
