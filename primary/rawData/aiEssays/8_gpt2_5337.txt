One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my husband used to say "I liked him but didn't feel good about it." I used to hear these comments, and it made my heart ache to finally be able to express it. I was so proud that I was able to say this to someone so beautiful and truly my father. I was inspired and moved to finally show how my life can feel like this, and not just the way I was before. I wish I could do the same in my own life. It's an honor and it's very humbling that they have allowed me to share it this way.

Thank you,
