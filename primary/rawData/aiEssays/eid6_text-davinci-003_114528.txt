The construction of the Empire State Building posed many unique challenges: one of these being the adaptation of the skyscraper for the mooring of dirigibles. This ground-breaking development required extensive engineering and complex building modifications, which made it a difficult and costly undertaking. 

In order to make the Empire State Building suitable for dirigible dockings, designers had to build a double-decker, open-air mast above the skyscraper’s 78th floor. This mooring mast had to be 150 feet long and had to withstand force from the dirigible’s anchoring lines of over five tons. In addition to the obvious structural demands, the mooring mast had to be built to withstand 130 mph of gusty winds that often whip through Manhattan. 

The most challenging obstacle builders had to face was ensuring that the mast would be stable enough for a dirigible’s anchoring lines, yet still light enough so the additions to the building would not be structurally burdensome. To adequately meet this demand, builders had to combine steel, wood, and an intricate system of pulleys and counterweights to make the mooring system relatively lightweight yet very strong. 

The mooring system was also equipped with a box-like platform called a “landing stage” that was built adjacent to the mast. This stage provided a solid surface for the dirigible to securely rest when not in use. To
