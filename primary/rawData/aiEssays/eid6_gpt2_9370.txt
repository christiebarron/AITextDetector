The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. By 1844, only one of the many, named "The Great" (known in English as "Ain't The Man") was able to dock on a floating bridge. These were called "The Viscs" to avoid having to wait until a ship was about to dock in an open harbor so that they could dock on a dock. This process continued until the "Bucketsch" (the "Rabbits") finally came into production in 1850, when it was constructed under special arrangement with an Imperial contractor. The pilot was also an apprentice to the architect of the aircraft carrier, Rear Admiral John W. Farr (a close friend of Isaac Newton; Newton would become the subject of a long biographical novel), named after the first of the two pilots of the Bicca. The ships were used at the behest of President Polk, and were completed sometime before 1853. Most of the ships were sold to the Empire State Building, including the one where Isaac Newton was commissioned as Lieutenant Governor.
