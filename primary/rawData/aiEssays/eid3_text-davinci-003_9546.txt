The setting of Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead" greatly affects the cyclist. The cyclist is faced with a variety of challenges that are caused by the environment and conditions of the road.

The setting affects the cyclist in two primary ways. First, the specific conditions of the road heavily influence the cyclist. For example, the road is deliberately described as uneven and rocky which makes it much harder to ride a bicycle. The narrowness of the road makes it difficult to navigate and the rain-slickened surface is incredibly treacherous. In addition, the fact that there are no other vehicles on the road, and no one to accompany them, means that there is a greater sense of danger and vulnerability.

Secondly, the cycling route itself creates certain physical limits and expectations for the cyclist. The long and winding curves of the road demand both endurance and strength from the cyclist in order to reach the end. Any efforts to relax during the ride can have dangerous consequences in such a rough environment. Likewise, the cyclist is faced with a lack of resources, food, and shelter, making it difficult to deal with adverse conditions.

Overall, it's clear that the particular features of the setting in "Rough Road Ahead" considerably affect the cyclist. The treacherous and unforgiving conditions of the road, as well as the physical limitations of the route, create a difficult and dangerous journey for the cyclist with no guarantee of success.
