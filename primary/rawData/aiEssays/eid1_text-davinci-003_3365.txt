Dear Editor,

As we all know, computers have made a lasting impact in our lives over the last few decades. However, the effects computers have on people have been both positive and negative.

On the positive side, computers have enabled millions of people to have access to education, knowledge, and so much more that was not available in prior generations. Computers have caused an overall increase in efficiency and productivity, allowing us to accomplish more in shorter amounts of time. It has allowed information to be shared much more easily across borders, creating diversity and enriching our lives.

On the negative side, computers have the potential to lead to a decrease in physical activity and human interaction. Since many things can now be done online, such as shopping and communicating, this could lead to the overall decrease in efficiency from lack of physical exercise and socializing.

In conclusion, although computers can be a great asset to our lives, it should be used in moderation to ensure that our lives are enriched, both mentally and physically. By utilizing this amazing technology in a balanced way, we will be able to continue to benefit from its advantages while avoiding its potential drawbacks.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
