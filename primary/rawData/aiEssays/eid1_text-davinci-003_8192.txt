The Empire State Building was an engineering marvel during its construction in 1930s NYC. It was designed with the intention to serve as an airplane terminal for dirigibles, allowing them to effortlessly moor and dock in its sky-high roosts. However, it faced innumerable obstacles and challenges over the years, delaying the building's realization of its initial vision.

One of the most daunting obstacles was the need to develop a safe and secure mooring system. This was tackled by German aerospace engineer Dr. Hugo Eckener, the leader of the good ship Graf Zeppelin. He designed an advanced mooring mast that used two cantilevered steel arms for stability and anchors that provided friction to keep the vessel firmly in place. However, the challenge of accommodating large vessels and providing a steady flow of air required for operation in high winds and other hazardous conditions meant that the mooring mast was only partially successful.

Despite this setback, Dr. Eckener's team was able to find a unique solution to the issue of air flow. Through a combination of two large fans placed on the upper and lower decks, the team was able to create a steady flow of air necessary for successful landings. The fans acted like an invisible guide, assisting the Pilot in gauging the air flow and allowing for a safe and swift docking process.

Still, the Empire State Building faced many more obstacles in successfully accommodating dirigibles. Though the mooring mast had become
