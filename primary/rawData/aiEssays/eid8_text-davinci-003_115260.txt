I remember the day like it was yesterday. My best friend and I were sitting in the courtyard of our college, enjoying the warm sun and soft breeze on that beautiful summer day. We had been catching up on each other's lives since our last meeting and eventually, the conversation turned to something funny that had recently happened to me.

I recounted the story in great detail, laughing more and more as I went, and my friend joined in with me. We then kept talking for a while, but soon we were both overcome with uncontrollable laughter. I was so surprised that it felt almost like a joke, but I was also somehow completely content.

In that moment, I felt so connected to my friend. Laughing together is one of the simplest and most satisfying feelings I can think of. That connection made all the difference; it felt like we both fully understood each other, and that feeling was very precious to me.

The laughter quickly faded, but the memory of that day and the feelings it left me with remain to this day. Even now it brings a smile to my face and lightens my mood. That's why I value laughter so much in my relationships; it truly is the shortest distance between two people.
