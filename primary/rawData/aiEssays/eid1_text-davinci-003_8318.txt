I once had a friend who got a pretty bad grade on a test when we were in grade school. Everyone else was really upset with him and some of them even started to bully him for having done so poorly. Despite all the negativity from his classmates, my friend remained incredibly patient and kind throughout the entire ordeal. He was so mature that it really inspired me to do my best and accept all the difficulties that life throws my way.
