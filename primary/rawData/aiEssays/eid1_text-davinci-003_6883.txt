In recent years, libraries have become battlegrounds for arguments over censorship. There has been lively debate over whether certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, should be removed from library shelves if they are found offensive. However, this debate neglects a critical balancing of basic rights, specifically freedom of expression. 

When considering whether censorship is warranted, many people forget that censorship attempts to control access to certain ideas, opinions, or information. By removing books, music, movies, and magazines from the shelves of a library, people are denied access to information that they can use to learn and make informed decisions. If a school library decides to remove certain books because their content is deemed offensive, it is denying students access to that information and is thus ultimately infringing on their most basic rights. While one may argue that literature, music, movies, and magazines may contain offensive material, it is wrong to deny people access to such material if they so choose to access it.

Additionally, libraries should not be the arbiters of what materials are offensive. Rather, it should be up to the individual to decide how to respond to potentially offensive content. Libraries ought to provide access to a variety of materials so that the public can research, explore, and draw their own conclusions. A library should also provide access to materials that have been challenged or controversialized. Doing so allows readers to experience both sides of an argument and make up their own minds.
