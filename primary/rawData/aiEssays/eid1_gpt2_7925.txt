Computers have many effects on people. Their effects cannot be measured. When computers have all the information, one is forced to think. They can make decisions. They can't create a perfect game—they can't make the best decisions that don't affect the outcome of a game. We call them machines. And it's not just computers. A lot of people do.

You talk about a culture of machine learning—that this kind of process is happening everywhere. Do you feel like we need to think about such a thing?

You know, one of the reasons I do think this is an important issue is that not a lot of people understand the nature ofナケーパン.

It would actually be hard to find any scientific evidence that would support the use of machine learning, I think. It is actually a really important issue. We had some big talk there about this, saying there ought to be a place for machines in all sorts of areas, or not atvictory and not having any sort of human or cultural perspective when machines are actually necessary, like a game designer and a scientist. So this is such a problem we ought to address at all.

We should have a group in this country, I'm think, who are going to go and show us how it's possible that we have some kind of human, cultural perspective in this world.
