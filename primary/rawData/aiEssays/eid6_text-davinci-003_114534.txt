The concept of allowing dirigibles, or airships, to dock onto the Empire State Building was revolutionary in its day, presenting a unique challenge for the building's builders. Various hurdles had to be cleared before the idea could be put into practice.

The first major obstacle to be surmounted was structural. As described in “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the mooring tower atop the Empire State Building needed to be substantial enough to support an enormous airship. The plan's advocates argued for a steel mast that could support the weight of the airships without endangering the roof line of the building. This technical detail posed a difficult feasibility challenge for the building's engineers and was eventually solved by adding two more stories to the tower and bracing them with a strong steel frame.

Safety was an even more pressing concern, as dirigibles would soon become large enough to carry hundreds of passengers, a potentially catastrophic danger if a mooring accident were to occur. The builders of the Empire State Building went to great lengths to ensure that the mooring system would be sufficiently secure and safe to operate. Strong wind conditions posed one major threat; to counter this, the mooring mast was designed to pivot so that airships could be pulled away from the mast if exposed to dangerous winds. Furthermore, the engineers devised a cable and pulley system so that ships could be safely tethered to the mast.
