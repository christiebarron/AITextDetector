An example of a time someone in my life was patient was her father and the man behind this project, Mike. He was always so humble and we kept going through this time. In order to make his life a very special one, he chose to live on the weekends! It was for this day that he was so overwhelmed with love.

The first project we've done is a book called The Life-Giving Machine. It's got a big world tour this month, and it starts with the day you tell your parents your name. The book has been printed and is still running the day after we launched the project. We've put on two hundred thousand copies and are ready to be in our local store once we have sold out.

Mike's life has changed over time. He has lost the ability to talk. He's been on an eating disorder or a seizure or a bad marriage or a terrible parenting. He has no family. He has grown up to be the one person to not only live the life she wanted but to even live into adulthood and to want to live happily ever after. It is an amazing dream because I know Mike could never believe that this was possible when I told him. The idea that life is easy or that you have the power to change it into whatever you want it to be or any other thing that the universe has told you that is beyond belief made me extremely proud to help this man create.

The goal is to become a millionaire.
