Dear Editor:

While computers can be seen as a huge convenience for many, I would like to take this opportunity to discuss their potentially dangerous effects on people.

In today's world, people are increasingly reliant on computers to carry out practically all of their everyday activities. Yes, computers have improved our lives in some ways. But there are also potentially dangerous effects they can have. 

For one, computer addiction is a growing problem among the younger population. Many find it difficult to tear themselves away from their smartphones and computers, and instead of engaging in constructive activities, they stay wired to their devices and completely lose touch with reality. This is a huge concern and should be watched closely.

Another effect can be an excessive dependence on computers. With the vast resources and tools available online, people can even forget how to do things manually. This can lead to a lack of creativity and also a decrease in cognitive flexibility. 

Moreover, computers can cause physical health problems such as back pain, eye strain and headaches. People who frequently use computers can suffer from poor posture, and those who spend extended periods of time at their computer can suffer from weak vision. 

To sum up, computers can negatively affect our lives in many ways. Computers should be used with caution and moderation to avoid the aforementioned problems.

Sincerely,

[Name]
