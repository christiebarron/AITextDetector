It was a blustery winter day. My husband and I were walking in the park, trying to stay warm in our heavy winter coats. We were walking in companionable silence, enjoying the peacefulness of the fresh winter air.

Suddenly, something caught my eye. A small, white fluffy dog was playing with a ball in the distance. We stopped walking, and without being able to control it, we both started to laugh. We laughed so hard our stomachs ached and we couldnâ€™t stop, even as tears began streaming down our faces. 

Still giggling, we continued our walk a few moments later, both of us basking in the warmth of a shared moment. We had connected in a way only laughter could, forgetting our brief quarrel earlier that day. 

It goes without saying that we both remain loyal dog-lovers to this day.
