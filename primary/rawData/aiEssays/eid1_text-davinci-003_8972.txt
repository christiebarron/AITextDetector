I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Technology advancements such as computers have revolutionized the way we live and interact with each other. In just a few decades, computers have become an important part of our daily routines—so much so that they have begun to influence many aspects of our lives, be it education, business, communication, or entertainment.

As computers become more commonplace, it’s becoming ever more evident that they can significantly improve our daily lives and enable us to carry out complex tasks quickly and efficiently. For instance, computers can assist us with automating mundane chores and with providing access to vast sources of information. Computer-assisted instruction, once only available to college students, can be now easily accessed from the comfort of one’s home. Additionally, computers can greatly facilitate communication, enabling us to instantly contact anyone around the world regardless of geographical distance. 

However, I believe that we should also be aware of the potentially negative effects of relying too heavily on computers. It can be argued that, through repetitive use of the same technology, people can develop a certain level of dependency on it—leading to a decline in creativity and personal initiative when faced with unfamiliar tasks. Addiction to computers also has potential health risks due to continued exposure to electromagnetic radiation.

In conclusion, while there is no denying the numerous benefits of computers, we must be conscious of their potential downsides and be ready
