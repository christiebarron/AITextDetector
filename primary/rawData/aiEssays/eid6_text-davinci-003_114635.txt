The iconic Empire State Building has been an iconic New York City landmark since the early 20th century. The initial plan for building the Empire State Building included providing docking capabilities for dirigibles – large, lighter than air aircrafts. This feature was symbolic of the technological advancements of the time and showcased the confidence in the engineers and architects who designed the building. 

Despite the strong ambition to incorporate the docking capabilities for dirigibles, there were a number of substantial obstacles that stood in the way of this ambition. Firstly, the construction of the Empire State Building took place at a time when experimentation was ongoing and the understanding from engineers about the requirements of dirigible docking was still limited. Furthermore, the Empire State Building had a steel skeletal frame, leaving no room for incorporating a mooring mast – a structure necessary for dirigibles to docks in. Even if the mooring mast had been incorporated during construction, the cost of such an addition would have been astronomical. 

In order to overcome this obstacle, the building owners and engineers began searching for ways to make the dirigible docking feasible and successful. The engineers eventually concluded that the only feasible option was to construct a 200-foot mast at the roof of the building that would enable the dirigibles to be secured in place. In addition, the engineers had to construct a windbreak made of steel plates to protect the dirigibles from being damaged by the wind.
