For instance, there's no way to make sure, as the road is relatively flat, that the driver will actually have to ride with the car in terms of comfort.

I've tried some combination of both modes and they all work. But for a wide range of riders there's no definitive consensus on what works best or worst for them. What is clear is that 'Rough Road Ahead' as defined for cycling is an incredibly complex car that is more forgiving of road conditions than the average cyclist.

This really is the crux of the discussion. The main problem is that the car is simply not the best solution to a cycling problem (it doesn't exist). Most of the time the solution is to have the car run at a higher level (in a way that gives the rider more control in handling), especially in the long term, where riders simply don't want to ride when the car goes off.

To deal with this we need more people. A better solution would be to see more people working with the car, rather than just driving, at least to ensure a greater degree of autonomy and comfort.
