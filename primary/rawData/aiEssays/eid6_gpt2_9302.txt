The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, they had to obtain approval from the Empire State Building Association to use such an experimental device. The builders, led by Daniel Kahneman, also faced another challenge. The company had a history stretching back to its early days in the early 1970s, when it helped start the construction of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch to which it had long been the patron. The company also faced a series of political problems — the post and the city were divided— and had to develop and construct separate buildings for the Post station and its sister city of Baltimore. Kahneman's plan to create a large public square and build it entirely with a dirigible has never caught fire.

Sixty-seven companies eventually built a large dirigible on a project called the Los Angeles Coliseum project, the first of the nation's biggest, to build over two thousands-seat live entertainment units. The project, which was completed in 2002, cost almost $4 billion and resulted in the first domed dirigibles in U.S. history. The new cars, known as the Buses, were developed by a consortium of small car rental companies that included Ford, General Motors, General Electric, Toyota and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.

Other firms, such as CAA and Vans Motors, also considered a dirigibles business. But a smaller group of car rental firms backed by Drexel University
