Dear Editor of [Local Newspaper],

As a concerned citizen, I wanted to express my opinion on the effects of computers on people. Computers have become commonplace in our lives, but I believe we should be more aware of their implications.

The use of computers can be both beneficial and detrimental, depending on how we use them. On the upside, computers help us stay connected to our families, friends, and beyond, and they allow us to access a vast array of knowledge and resources that would otherwise be unavailable to us. On the other hand, however, computers can be a source of addiction, disconnection, and cyberbullying.

It is important to be aware of the potential negative impacts of computer use. For example, too much screen time can lead to physical health problems, increased anxiety, and loss of focus. Cyberbullying can hurt anyone from elementary school children to adults. It is also easy to get caught in a web of false information and malicious websites on the internet.

It is crucial that parents and other responsible adults teach children acceptable and responsible use of computers. Educate children on the potential risks and dangers of computers and be sure to set reasonable limits on their use. It is also essential for adults to take responsibility for their own use of computers. Doing so will help to mitigate the potential harms of computer use and promote positive outcomes such as staying connected to a global network of people and knowledge.

Thank you for taking the time
