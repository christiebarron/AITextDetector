I was on vacation with my family in the Bahamas recently, and although it was an idyllic situation, it didn't always run perfectly. One morning we were trying to get out the door to go explore the island, but our toddler had other ideas. She was refusing to get dressed, running in circles around the room, spilling food and drinks, and being quite difficult in general.

I could feel my patience wearing thin, but I took a few deep breaths and chose to remain calm. I tried to explain to her in a kind but firm tone that we had to get dressed and brush her teeth. After repeating myself a few times patiently, she finally calmed down and started to cooperate. 

It took a few extra minutes, but seeing my toddler calm down little by little was worth it. Later, we were prepared to go enjoy our day together while creating lasting family memories. It's situations like this that remind me of the importance of patience and how rewarding it can be in the end.
