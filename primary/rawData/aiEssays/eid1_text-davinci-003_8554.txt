I remember a time when I was standing in line at the store and the person in front of me was taking their sweet time. As I waited for what seemed like an eternity, other people started getting frustrated and started complaining, but I chose to remain patient. Although it was hard to ignore the chatter from the other people, I kept my cool and remembered that the cashier was doing their best. 

Finally, after what seemed like forever, the person in front of me finished paying and I was up. Instead of rushing and acting out of frustration, I took my time and made sure that I got all of my items. 

By being patient, I was able to stay calm and collected when faced with an annoying situation. I'm proud of myself for not giving in to the rush and taking my time.
