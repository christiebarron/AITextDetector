The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

A number of obstacles were added to the original plans: a wall in a room for two, a large tower on the upper floor, and new concrete staircases where people could step outside to have a good view of the building. But the builders felt they should have built two separate towers.

A large metal dome was created in the back room above, along with a large-duty steel slab. A small metal dome was added near the center of the building. The building itself was constructed of aluminum and reinforced concrete. But in the 1930s, the aluminum in this building had been melted down by storm surge and the steel in the building had been put in storage.

Some of the elements needed were still in place: walls, elevators, and other structures. A single column was installed around the front door leading into the building, and it had to be painted blue. All of these needed to be redized after the collapse.
