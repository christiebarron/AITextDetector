How do people come to identify technology as their primary tool for self-improvement? As the technology's usefulness has grown, so has its use. For example, there are increasingly more people interested in learning about AI than in computer science but little attention is given to how the skills that will increase your skills within two years of learning (e.g., cognitive science, artificial intelligence, or artificial intelligence) will decrease in the coming decade. The problem with that is that you end up using less to develop your knowledge than you used before.
