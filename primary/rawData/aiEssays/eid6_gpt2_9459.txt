The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

Bobby O'Connell and Bill Hall were among the first to design and start an effort that helped pioneer a variety of models of the device. A large-scale testing program began with pilot testing in January 1945. The pilot test was followed by numerous tests and the device was successfully tested in the United States and other countries.

While the aircraft was being fitted and tested in the United States, many were still not sure which aircraft Website would carry it. A short series of tests, culminating in a series of test flights from December to March 1946, provided clear hints of what a dirigible could do. The aircraft's range, altitude, and acceleration were all considered important factors in calculating the maximum speeds of their engines, which were very high.

At the start of the test in February and early March, hundreds of American pilots flew to Britain and France, flying a pilot-designed jet powered by a modified, twin-engine C-16. The pilot's equipment was included in the jet, as was its airframe. The pilot's airspeed record was monitored.

It was found that the C-16's thrust record was about 50 mph faster than that of a comparable model. Its speed was also about the speed of noise. The system had low energy density to operate at the expense of its flight speed.

This system was considered preferable to conventional tail and
