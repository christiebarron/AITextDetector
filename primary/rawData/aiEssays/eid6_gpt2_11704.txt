The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Several of the proposed plans included, instead, lowering the height of the elevator to provide maximum lift for those with long legs for shorter trips. To ensure optimal flight results, the New York City Department of Transportation eliminated the requirement that the elevator have to be lowered five or six stories above the ground.

Even though they failed to create a single landing point for the Falcon 9, an array of ground-based air-filled containers were added to alleviate the problems with the airlock.

However, it also took a while before the construction finally began. One of the first steps toward completion of the site was built almost exactly 12 months after the original launch, when the company and the California-based National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced plans to build the 7.2-m long aircraft and 12.5-m long jet. However, as the Falcon 9 began its ascent, it was not long before the new cargo bay appeared on the horizon. That meant it could land on any part of the city for more than the rest of the flight, and it would be a "major international test" for those seeking to take part in some of the busiest flights in the history of the U.S.

At the time, the United States had long been trying to build an airship, a concept that the United States and Canada could use to test their ability to fly the new spaceplane
