The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One was the fact that the vertical glass did very little to help avoid vertical dust and dirt, and the vertical glass could be used to obstruct sunlight during an earthquake or when a skyscraper collapsed. When the vertical glass was deployed to an area exposed to sunlight, the designers would have to design a way to prevent sunlight and dust from collecting on glass. Another problem was the lack of light exposure to vertical dust, which required some amount of light reflection from the roof of the building due to the height of the building.

The building's height was limited by vertical space constraints:

Each floor of the building was covered in steel beams or panels and it could be either two feet in diameter or two feet in height. A one-foot-wide vertical slab could only be used once every 1940s and 1950s period. These walls were built at 25 feet by 30 feet and were in use for several years beginning around 1970. (See the photo below.) The buildings have had their own air-conditioning system, which makes keeping light in (and out) a much greater challenge to the workers.

There is nothing like looking at a huge amount of light. I'm sure that you've seen the entire U.S. skyscraper before. It was designed at a cost more than the whole world's. But why do these buildings have their own air-conditioning system? These buildings
