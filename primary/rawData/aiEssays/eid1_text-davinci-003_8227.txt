The Empire State Building, built between 1930 and 1931 in New York City, presented a unique challenge when it came to accommodating airships, or dirigibles. The enormous structure was designed to stand taller than any other building in the world, but it was also unable to support the weight of substantial airships. To overcome this, the architects of the Empire State Building proposed a specialized docking station to be built on top of the tower; a mooring mast. 

In ‘The Mooring Mast’, Marcia Amidon Lüsted recounts the trials and tribulations the builders of the Empire State Building faced in erecting the mooring mast. The main obstacle was the physical restraints imposed by the structure itself; the mooring mast had to fit within the parameters of the existing building without compromising its structural integrity. Adding to the difficulty was the fact that the building had been completed so quickly; the window of opportunity to make changes or additions was narrow.

In addition to the physical constraints, the engineers technology available in 1930s posed another obstacle. The airships of the era were gigantic, and far heavier than anything that had ever been moored before. To safely moor them, a specialized mooring mast had to be designed, capable of withstanding high winds and the airships’ immense weight. Furthermore, the mooring mast had to be designed so that the airships could take off and land without crashing into any of
