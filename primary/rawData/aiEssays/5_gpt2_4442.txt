The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' can be summed up by two lines of the text: "You made me happy when you wrote 'Everything is happening here as it should be,' you've given me the comfort of knowing how things are happening in general, so it's no surprise I came here to write this book." The message, of course, is much more dire: "We have to have a break now to get back to this normalcy we found ourselves in. The work was just the beginning."

Perhaps the most remarkable moment of The Black Album came at the end of it all: the day that Martin said: "When I woke up in the shower, I thought my body was getting tired, and I wasn't thinking clearly at all." But why? Because the writing of these thoughts was hard, and the effort went nowhere. It was too difficult to write the lines that Martin needed to read in order to survive, which is why 'From Home is' feels like some sort of book about living a dream, with all-too-lucrative ideas and all-too-inchoate, all-too-wrong ideas. Like an unruly little school of thinking.

One thing Martin had come to realise was that he had to find a way to do anything that he was not already doing; his best dream was that of being able to be here to experience reality, instead of trying to put it in a box.
