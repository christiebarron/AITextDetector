I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a mistake and not really possible. In my view, copyright infringement is a fundamental infringement on the rights of the public and the ability of public libraries to function. This is what I believe a fundamental right of the users and the rights of non-users and their communities."

As part of BPSU's efforts to defend library safety, the organization recently released a long list of measures to prevent inappropriate distribution of information among third parties.

BPSU says it is working in concert with law enforcement authorities in Colorado and Connecticut to improve its ability to protect library security.

"We believe that libraries in Colorado and Connecticut should be a leader in the fight Against Unlawful Harassment, which includes protecting libraries against misuse. In particular," wrote Sam Dufault, director of communications, for BPSU in a statement. "BPSU will lead on this in the future and the BPSU community is very excited to work with law enforcement and in collaboration with educators and other organizations to reduce harassment and other forms of discrimination in our libraries."
