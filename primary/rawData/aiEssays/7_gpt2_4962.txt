An example of a time someone in my life was patient was on my desk during a meeting when she was working for the National Post, where she was not paying full time. I have to find something to say.

If that's you, I won't be a patron. I'll have an opportunity to help out the staff â€” there's not much they can do about it.

Do I owe any debts to anyone? How much does it cost me?

You owe money (including all of my other business debts) in part; or, if I'm using you as a way to avoid certain things, you owe your business. I can't promise you I may never owe them back, since your contribution is so voluntary and the amount of debt is so small.

Can I still be paid off at work?

Again, this is up to you to decide. But pay your wages in full. If you do or don't give them the benefit of your will, you'll not get paid off Hannibal Lecter by me. You might, but no one cares. I don't care that I'm still getting paid for using my name or that everyone pays me. I'm just keeping the money in that account as long as it is.
