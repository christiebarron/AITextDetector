I was at the mall recently, browsing through the clothing racks, when I noticed a young girl throwing a huge temper tantrum. She was screaming, crying, and her mom looked exhausted. I could tell the mother was at her wit's end and wasn't sure how to handle the situation. Out of instinct, I went over and put my hand on the girl's shoulder. I remembered how embarrassed I used to feel when I was younger and would act out in public, so I decided to treat her with respect and understanding. 

I smiled and told her that I completely understood why she was so upset, and that it was okay to feel angry and frustrated. I went on to explain to the young girl that it was only natural for us to have strong emotions, but it was not okay to act out in this way. 

Soon, the girl’s tears stopped and she looked a little calmer. She eventually apologized and said thank you. After that, I said goodbye and let the girl and her mom be on their way. 

I’m still proud of myself for staying patient and using the right words to help the girl feel better. Times like those make me appreciate having emotional intelligence and the ability to show understanding and tolerance.
