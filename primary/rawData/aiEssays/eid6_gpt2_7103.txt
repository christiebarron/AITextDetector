The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. If their designs failed, it might make it impossible for the people who built the skyscrapers to rent, or that the existing buildings might have to be moved into state facilities as construction drew to a close. The construction of the Empire State Building during the Second World War was an ambitious project, the first of which went to completion.

Wade O'Brien has given us a closer look into the building's future. "Wade O'Brien takes a long look at what's happened in the first half of the twentieth century," he writes in his forthcoming book about the building. "It was all so tragic that, at the height of public policy uncertainty, it was decided, to keep some level of secrecy about the plan of construction. It was also determined that the building — the first to be built in all major U.S. military service zones — would be kept out of the public eye, if any could be reasonably said to exist."
