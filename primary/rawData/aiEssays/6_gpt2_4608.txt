The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Many of them were based on models which were used within the building industry and were not easily adaptable to an extremely popular consumer market. The builders had to compete with one another in order to sell those models. Also, for example, when a truck could dock with a passenger car that would then dock with a large vehicle, the designers could use their craftsmanship to build a huge new building. The designers had to understand what was important and what should be done for the building of that building. Furthermore, such problems were very common in public transportation, especially when it came to construction of the new government building. Because of these restrictions, the contractors decided to change the materials used in order to create a mass-produced prototype that would perform as closely as possible together with the building material. It could take years of painstaking work before the final size and design were of equivalent value, so it could be used without the constraints of any specific design, such as the need for special special features. Building on that process was the World Trade Center, which at that time was considered one of America's premier skyscrapers. Many aspects of the building's exterior were modified due to the fact that all elements and materials were from a different era and culture; hence, it could not be built as close as it was meant to be. This also included the design of the massive central tower being used to house the International Space Station
