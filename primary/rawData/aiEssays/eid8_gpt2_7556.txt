One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was young I was playing 226 cricket during my high school days as a youngster. My son had been in the team for a month and he was playing in the game as well. I think about that now and I would like to think that it will have made a big difference now.

"After that time I was playing only in a couple of years and it was quite difficult to get into my cricket form.

"Now everything has begun to change. Some coaches like to keep looking to the past but there was never going to be any way I could play and I have experienced that with different players today.

"I still have a long ways to go but I will try to finish this season strong. I am going to try and work hard on the rest of the year to try to keep up my level of fitness and achieve my best. I should try to do well for my senior team team. It certainly has been an effort for me to get under their management but it will be easier in the past.

"I do believe that I can keep up because I have experienced some great games and I have been a strong contributor throughout the team and to put myself on the team is very important."
