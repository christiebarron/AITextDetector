The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it shows, what happens when you make fun of a man because of his beard, and then the book starts to end when the author says "you're wrong," but the book ends when he goes to go make an "all-caps version." And with that the writers were saying "you gotta do that, I don't understand, because I can now do it. You can do it, the world is going to love and don't stop, but we gotta get back to what was last year and put the book back into the way that it was the year before." I said, "So what if our hero said, 'oh, no, I gotta do this again?' What'd I look like if he didn't come back to that. I mean, he was a coward and he was not just a kid, he was an adult in many ways."

Q: If it's a good book you'd like?

A: I hope not. If it was that good I would probably just read it again with as much care, if not more. I do read a lot of bad books, probably about violence and things like that, but at least I've been able to enjoy the books that I've read. We didn't have to write a book on it (but we did use all those people in the book) and still I found myself reading about things that weren't there
