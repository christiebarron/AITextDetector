An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a couple who I had loved for 10 years and decided to marry. I saw her and knew from the time my parents had worked the house where I lived that she was as much at home at the end of the marriage as you are at the end of the decade. This was very difficult. It meant living with the husband who I had known for 10 years because his family wasn't always open. But, he was a very thoughtful guy and would tell you what he should be doing. So it wasn't something that worked because I made her happy and gave her the peace and happiness that I wanted and she just wanted to start again in her own time. And when you start getting the satisfaction that the person with whom you are having this conversation will be having a time for 20 years as your marriage continues to grow, the time you may be waiting for to start you enzyme is very precious. The person will go for it when she is ready.

So here we are with the "first two centuries," with what does the Bible say about marriage and the early church (especially in the first century), and the "great rule with which that church was formed" (Matthew 5:23)? That the first two centuries were one period of flourishing (after Matthew and Luke, and in the first century) when the church was reformed and at least some elements of the church were intact. And that there is no mention anywhere in the Bible
