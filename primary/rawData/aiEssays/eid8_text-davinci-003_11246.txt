I remember the time when I laughed so hard with my best friend that it felt like I had literally let go of all my worries for a few moments. We were strolling along the beach, discussing our college plans, when suddenly he started to tell me a joke he’d heard a few days back. Even though I tried to hold back, soon I was laughing uncontrollably, and every time I tried to catch my breath, he would make another joke and I would start laughing again.

The more I laughed, the more I felt my worries dissipating. Soon, there was nothing but carefree joy in my heart, and I could feel even the sand beneath my feet lightening up with my happiness.

I knew that this was something special, that laughter could be so powerful and connect two people with so much joy and ease. Eventually, we stopped laughing when we needed a breath of fresh air, and then retreated to the shade for a refreshment.

We never felt the need to finish that conversation about college, but just knowing that we could laugh and connect without any expectations was one of the best memories I’ve ever made.
