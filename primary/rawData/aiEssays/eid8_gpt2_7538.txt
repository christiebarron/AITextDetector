One time I experienced laughter in my life was when there was something particularly exciting about the new album – A World's Greatest Musical Moments. It was not a good song. Rather, it was a very boring one, but I didn't understand the meaning of it.

What do you think about the new album?

I'd rather that it wasn't a simple song and a very silly one – the two, but let's call it that. The one I really liked was "Saving My Son from Hitler." The song went with a pretty serious sense of humour or emotion – it was really beautiful, and the lyrics were beautifully executed. It was very touching, even if it was a bit silly. It was funny because the lyrics were quite good. Perhaps my problem was that I was used to seeing children in their '70s looking too well-toned for their ages (there's a lot of irony in this, isn't there?) What kind of child is that?

Do you still have any favorite singers?

Well, I haven't been to a concert ever this year. I've never thought they'd get picked. I've only had one concert the last few times I've been to one in North Carolina, where they gave me a ticket for the show, which would have been quite helpful, when the people at the theatre said "No no, don't hold a ticket."

Have you heard the soundtrack for The Life Aquatic with
