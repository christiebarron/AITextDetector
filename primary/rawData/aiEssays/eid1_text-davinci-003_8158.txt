The Empire State Building posed a unique opportunity for dirigible docking when it was first constructed in 1931. However, the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

The first obstacle the builders had to tackle was the logistics of mooring the airships to the building in a secure and safe way. Without this secure dock, airships would not be allowed to land or take off. The builders had to create a plan to install a mooring mast, or ship-like post, to the roof of the building. The goal was to create a safe and secure post large and strong enough to handle the weight of a dirigible.

The second challenge presented itself to the designers of the mast, which included inventor and builder William Van Sleffelen and designer Thomas Adams. They had to fashion the mooring mast to withstand the weather, strong winds, and the weight of the dirigible, all while fitting the height and topographical conditions of the building. Furthermore, they had to come up with a system that would facilitate the mooring of large airships despite the size of the roof, as dirigibles need space when docking.

Thirdly, the buildingâ€™s power grid had to be reconfigured in a way that would allow the airships to use the electricity for the mast. This was no small feat, as the engineers needed to set up a stable connection and more powerful cables than
