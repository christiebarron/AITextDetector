An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my brother and I. I had been with him since we were two or three.

I took off his socks and my brother wore them for all the years of his love of his dog. No one told me how I was trying to keep my head down during this period or what I was trying to get out of it. He was still a loyal companion even after some of the emotional stress of his life.

I love you, my brother. I don't take credit for anything you have done for me. It's my business and I'll never give it up for anyone else. I promise we will get into his training and how the pain would go down. I'm more interested in you now than ever before. I'm going to do everything I can to help him along the way.

Please note I'm writing this message only to inform you of the fact that I have lost my son. If you or anyone you know would like additional information on this information, please contact: namamod@yahoo.com
