Computers have many effects on people. A large proportion of what is used today is not what the consumer is paying for, even though they can be paid for what they bought.

There's no such thing as a standard education for technology workers. At some point you have to learn to use computers, be familiar with the terms behind technology, and then you'll get by.

My advice is always to take your time figuring out what's available and not to overdo it. When there are lots of options in the world, don't overthink. Use a variety of forms to try. Find commonalities, but know it in your own time.
