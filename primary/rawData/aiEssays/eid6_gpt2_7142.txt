The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Though they had an abundance of commercial space in the building, some were particularly difficult to put into orbit and have to rely on an open-ended satellite or two. The building also came close to being abandoned when the Air Force announced that its first civilian-built satellite was coming into fruition.

One such failure occurred in June 2003 when its owners sued the Empire State Building for breach of title. This was during a contentious three-day renovation of the building in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The building was also subject to demolition during the 2003 renovation.

The plaintiffs, who had raised $12 million for improvements of the building, filed a lawsuit on behalf of an elderly man that claimed the roof collapsed and damaged his car. The case was subsequently dismissed and the case was turned over to the Department of Justice for the initial review.
