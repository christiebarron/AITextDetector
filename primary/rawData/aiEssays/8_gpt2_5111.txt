One time I experienced laughter in my life was when she asked if I wanted an orgasm, and I said "no." Then my first time seeing a boy she was really impressed by my strength. He was really gentle and showed interest. At 3-4, I asked, could anyone really do things like this? In between my masturbation sessions, I remember wondering if I could just take more pleasure. I would do anything for the first time in my life I wanted — I did any of the things I wanted a girl to do with my free spirit. For this, it is necessary to make the connection with a relationship you are most comfortable with. If you do not feel a connection with this partner, it is not the right thing to do. Remember that masturbation only works for a short time.

I have heard some people say that masturbation is like a sex toy. They use it to treat or relax. I do not believe that it works, but it is good that I had a boyfriend as well because if I masturbated more often he would find a better orgasm than before.

1 — The most important thing to remember is not getting the wrong feeling by masturbating when you are doing it. Let your partner know that as long as you do not let your partner do it for you it can be ok. It can only be good if you are good at telling good stories about masturbation and insecurities. Always make it clear that masturbation is not your place to do something
