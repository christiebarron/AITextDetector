The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first obstacle was the sheer size of building materials (see Fig. 1-7c).

The builder was instructed to consider building materials as specific to particular aircraft & ships. These required minimum thicknesses for the engines and propellers, and thus required high structural strength.

On the other hand, the builder also had to make certain that building materials were of a very high quality in the case of the engines, propellers, wings, etc.

The next challenge was the construction needs. First, a lot of the requirements were based on a high cost/value of materials. For aircraft & ships the main cost would be between USD 800 and 1100 for engines, propellers, wings, and cockpit. As soon as the number of engines reached CAD 1400 (or CAD 1400 for most aircraft & vessels), the cost for a propeller would drop to USD 15–20 per mm² per rotor. Secondly, when building components for the main building cost, CAD could be much higher. Also, the project was only about half a month long. On top of that, the materials must be very rigid to be able to withstand stress. Finally, the building time was
