Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the impact that computers have had on our population. After decades of use, it has become increasingly apparent that computers have revolutionized the way we live our daily lives. 

From doing simple tasks such as online shopping and banking, to complex tasks such as designing microscopic circuits and analyzing vast streams of data, computers have made extraordinary contributions to society. With a few clicks and taps, we can now access information, transfer funds, and even communicate with people of different cultures without having to leave the comfort of our homes. 

However, there are some drawbacks to their growing prevalence. For example, desk-bound jobs can increase the risk of physical ailments to individuals who do not have an ergonomically-designed workstation. Moreover, too much time spent computer gaming, browsing, and social networking can have an adverse effect on our mental health, leading to feelings of depression and isolation.

On the whole, computers have enabled us to take advantage of great opportunities and other conveniences. But it’s up to us to use them responsibly and in moderation. Let’s embrace the advances in technology, but also remember to practice self-control and engage in activities and conversations away from screens. 
 
Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
