I was at the store the other day waiting for my turn in line to pay. There were a few people ahead of me and I could tell the cashier was having trouble processing one of the transactions. As the minutes ticked by I started to feel frustratedâ€”I didn't have time to be stuck in the store for this. But then I paused, reminding myself to be patient. I could see that the cashier was doing her best to work through the issue. After a few more minutes, the transaction got sorted out and the cashier finished with the customer. When it was my turn, she thanked me for my patience, and I just smiled and said, "No problem." In the end, it wasn't that big of a deal to wait a few extra minutes. I was proud of myself for not getting frustrated and instead being patient and understanding.
