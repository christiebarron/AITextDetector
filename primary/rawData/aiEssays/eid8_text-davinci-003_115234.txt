I will never forget that special moment shared between my best friend and I. We had driven up to the mountains for a weekend getaway when an unexpected snowstorm forced us to pull off the side of the road and spend the night in an old hotel - the only one around. We had left it pretty late and were exhausted with no dinner. 

Eventually, we decided to take a stroll to get something to eat. We were both trying to find something funny in the situation, but despite our efforts, nothing seemed to lighten the mood. Without warning, my friend started singing one of the nursery rhymes from our childhood! I laughed so hard at the theatrics and the weird looks that we were given by the other pedestrians. We banged on the door of a fast food restaurant and begged for food. 

We ended up eating in the car, and the laughter didn't stop until our tummies were full. That moment of bonding sticks with me even today. We had shared something special, something that just the two of us could appreciate among all of the chaos. In that moment, I realized that laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people.
