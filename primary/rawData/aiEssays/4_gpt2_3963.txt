The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it is full of the best possible way to teach basic physics while avoiding endless speculation and nonsense. While I'll try and avoid over-simplification. It's easy and fun and it's not about the plot, the narrative, the science world, the world at large of course, but it all ties together neatly so you won't feel like you have to work around problems with the language and plot that come before.


It's a little dull, but it's not what I expected from this book.


I'm a geek. I read many sci-fi books, I read nearly everything on the Internet, I read a lot of fantasy and fantasy books, and I've read a lot of romance and suspense novels. They all have a different focus and a more serious tone here. It's a little bit too slow and cliché for some, but still enjoyable.


A little repetitive, I understand. It's a small book (2.5 stars) that I could spend $15 on and it would be worth it with only 2 stars if that's what you read.
