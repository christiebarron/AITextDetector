It was one of those evenings. I had a lot on my mind and was super stressed out about upcoming events. I was sitting with my best friend in the kitchen, and neither one of us felt like talking. Suddenly, out of the blue, my friend looked at me and said, “The floor is made of lava!”

At first, I was caught off guard and just stared blankly. But then I burst out laughing, and soon enough, my friend was laughing too. We laughed for what felt like hours, thankful to have each other to share this special moment. In that moment, I felt like we were connected on a different level. We were so lucky to have each other, and the laughter brought us that much closer. 

Ever since, whenever things get tough, we just share a joke or two and before we know it, we’re right back to laughing together. It’s like we don’t even need to have a conversation - just a few laughing moments is all we need to remind us of how special our friendship really is.
