Dear Editor,

In today's world, where access to technology is more plentiful than ever, I believe it is important to consider the effects computers have on people.

At first glance, it may be easy to assume that computers can only do good, allowing access to endless amounts of resources and information. But, if access to computers is unchecked and unmonitored, possible negative effects can arise, such as an overly-reliance on technology and decreased physical activity. 

While computers have opened up our educational and work opportunities, they have also kept us glued to chairs for lengthy periods of time. This lack of physical activity can increase the risk of obesity, heart disease, diabetes and other long-term health issues. 

On the other hand, it would be wrong to regard computers as negative use only. Rather, computers can be seen as a great training tool, as long as it is balanced alongside physical activity. 

In conclusion, computers have the potential to give people access to an abundance of resources, but it is our responsibility to be sure we don't let this technology overtake our lives. 

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
