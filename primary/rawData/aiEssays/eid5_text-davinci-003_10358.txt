Narciso Rodriguez’s memoir, From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, narrates his early life, growing up in the working-class city of Newark, NJ in the 1960s-1970s and provides an intimate glimpse into his challenging upbringing. Rodriguez masterfully employs rhetorical devices to paint a vivid picture of the sights, smells, and sounds of his childhood, evoking emotions of nostalgia, discomfort, and hope.

Throughout his memoir, Rodriguez constantly references his experiences with poverty in his city, and the consequent feelings oppressed communities often experience, such as shame and despair. He opens the memoir with these lines: “From home, we entered a place/A place of bitter cold without hope.” The tone of these lines is immediately dismal, setting the tone for the rest of the memoir. He continues to place the reader within the oppressive environment of Newark at the time, creating a foreboding, depressive mood that pervades the narrative.

Despite the feelings of hopelessness, Rodriguez skillfully crafts a feeling of resilience throughout the memoir. As the title of the memoir implies, the author turns to his childhood home as a source of hope. Through vivid descriptions of his grandmother and the experience of belonging when he enters his house, Rodriguez manages to share a sense of solace and resilience. Whenever Rodriguez references his home, the feelings of comfort and refuge he experiences are palpable.
