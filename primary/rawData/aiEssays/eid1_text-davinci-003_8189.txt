The builders of the Empire State Building faced considerable obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Construction of the skyscraper began in early 1930, at the same time that commercial dirigible service was experiencing a short-lived boom. Providing the tallest building in the world with a mooring mast would have added to its grandeur, while also serving to advertise the successes of the emerging dirigible industry. 

Unfortunately, several engineering hurdles stood in the way of this plan. Firstly, the mooring mast had to be able to withstand the powerful winds that roared along the heights of the Empire State. While 200mph winds had already been recorded by an anemometer on the upper floors of the building, the strength of the winds around the mast was impossible to accurately estimate. 

Furthermore, the mooring mast had to be tall enough for the largest of the dirigibles to reach out of the high winds, while also being short enough to fit among the other structures atop the building. Without baseline figures of these winds, it was not possible to determine what height would be necessary for the mast. As a result, engineers concluded that some trial and error would be necessary in order to design an effective mast. 

Finally, the architects of the building had to reckon with the public opinion on this project. News of the potential dirigible services quickly spread across the nation, and the masses had mixed opinions. Some were enthused by the idea of
