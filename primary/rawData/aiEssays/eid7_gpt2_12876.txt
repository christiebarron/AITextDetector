An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a 30-year-old man. His wife was severely mentally crippled. The husband was sick because one day his wife's heart stopped working. I had the courage to do what I could for him in therapy, and they were very supportive. The other wife needed to know how I could bring her to her best possible condition and they worked hard to help. In my own work, I found time to give my wife a lot of advice.

I would write about these people on social media and in writing about myself all the time. I remember a couple of her friends, friends and family were so upset when they started getting depressed. I was so grateful and so proud to let these people know it doesn't happen to me anymore and that it has helped me.

In the meantime, we have a great marriage, many talented people from our town come here to care for each other, and we just want to be there with you.

Happy Birthday Mary!
