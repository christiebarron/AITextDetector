One time I experienced laughter in my life was when Commentators (and writers (who had written and collaborated on a blog) who loved a particular post made fun of me for asking an obvious question: Do you read and write poetry, the other day? I told him that I do, and he laughed and laughed again. That had been the last time I had a laugh in my life.

I've seen myself do that over the years, with several different people. I've seen it go for another person, another one, if not all at once, and yet. When I was a teenager and then a boy I read about the power of laughter to change people's lives. In college I loved it, though I didn't know it for sure. It's a wonderful experience, and for me it's a testament to the power of laughter to change people's lives.

Not only do I share most of the power â€” I feel almost 100 percent responsible for this power, and I will always feel that way. If I could only share it with your kids and parents, I would.

How do I get it from here, and where would I begin? I'm grateful to everyone involved and I'm always grateful. I'd love a great post on other cultures and social aspects of your life, and I hope you will find it helpful.
