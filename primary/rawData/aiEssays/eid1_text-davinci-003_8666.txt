I remember the time when my son and I were playing around on the trampoline. He had been begging me for weeks to come outside and join him, but as a busy mom, it never seemed like I had the time. But one day, I gave in and decided to go out and give it a try. As soon as I stepped on, I felt like a kid again and we both burst out laughing. We played together for hours, enjoying every minute of it. 

We jumped higher and higher, laughed harder and harder. For the first time in a long time, I felt truly connected to my son. That day we created memories that will last forever. Every time I think about that day, I can't help but smile and laugh.
