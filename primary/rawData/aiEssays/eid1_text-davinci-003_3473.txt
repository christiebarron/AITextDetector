Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my opinion on the effects computers have on people. As technology advances, so does our reliance on computers in our daily lives. From completing tasks at work to the entertainment we consume, itâ€™s no secret that most of us are completely dependent on them.

While computers are a valuable tool for efficiency and business, they can have concerning effects when used for personal and recreational purposes. Regular computer use can lead to obesity, musculoskeletal ailments, and mental health issues. In addition, too much time spent on the internet can lead to feelings of isolation and depression, as people have fewer opportunities to socialize in person.

However, computers can also be a great tool for education and communication. Individuals can use computers to document and share their thoughts with the world, and it has opened up limitless opportunities for exploration and growth. With the endless amount of information available on the internet, people can search and learn anything they desire.
