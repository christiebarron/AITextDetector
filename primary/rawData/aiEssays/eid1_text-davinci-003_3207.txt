 

Dear Editor, 

I am writing to express my views on the effects computers have on people. Computers have become an integral part of everyday life, and their use has had both positive and negative effects on us. 

On the one hand, it is true that computers have put a great deal of convenience in our lives. We no longer have to manually carry out a variety of tasks, from office work to recreational activities. This has saved us a lot of time and made our lives easier. 

On the other hand, too much reliance on computers has created a great deal of problems as well. People nowadays often become too reliant on their computers, to the point that they can no longer think or act independently. In addition, computers are notorious for making us more sedentary and isolated, which has a very negative impact on our physical and mental health. 

In my opinion, we should reap the benefits of computers while also remembering to limit our use of them. Only then, can we benefit from this technology without having to worry about its adverse effects. 

I am sure that you, as readers, agree with my opinion. 

Sincerely, 
[Your name
