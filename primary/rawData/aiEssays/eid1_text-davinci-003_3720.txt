Dear Editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have had on people. I am firmly convinced that the introduction of computers has had a positive impact on individuals and society.

To begin with, computers have made a lot of tasks much more efficient. From banking to communication, computers have enhanced the speed and accuracy of many everyday activities. Furthermore, computers have enabled us to access a world of information at the click of a button. Thanks to the internet, millions of people now have access to knowledge previously unavailable to them.

Moreover, computers have helped to revolutionize health care. Through the use of computers and digital imaging, physicians can diagnose and treat conditions with unprecedented accuracy. Even medical students can use computers to help them learn and practice medicine more efficiently.

In addition, computers have transformed the way we work. Many jobs now require some degree of proficiency with computers. Automation and artificial intelligence have helped take the tedious out of many of our day-to-day tasks.

All in all, the introduction of computers has had a significant impact on people. Computers have made life easier and, as a result, more enjoyable. I therefore encourage your audience to consider the many ways computers can be used to improve our lives.

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
