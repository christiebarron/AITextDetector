I believe that censorship of materials in libraries, museums and the media is in fact counterproductive to the advancement of the community, especially to the most vulnerable. We need to reject censorship of materials in libraries and museums in their entirety, in the hopes that they will not serve the community for fear that they will be used as the base for political, religious and other subversive ideas found in this country."

Katherine Fyodor, who is writing a book on the subject, has become a favorite of liberal activists because of her research on what has gone wrong in the culture wars, especially in the arts, which she often criticizes. In one of her works, "The New School: The Changing and Disturbing Future of the American School of Education," she describes how that changed the course of modern education: "After a civil service career that lasted four decades and the death of his father as chairman of the Board of Education made him feel isolated, and he began an effort, funded by his father, to run private schools, K-12, free, public and charter school, the government set down a plan, and for this he and his family were fortunate. But there was also much that went wrong; as the year began to climb, the government began to shut down private schools; it was in crisis and began to close schools without warning, leaving the young students in the dust."
