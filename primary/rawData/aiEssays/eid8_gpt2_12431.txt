One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was in the studio while the guys were going through the song "Jazz Man" and you can hear a little bit of the excitement before everybody starts to realize it: "Oh, cool, we got this kid!" We started laughing and laughed out loud and it was pretty much like, "I see, maybe we'll get some laughter out of you." But then we started seeing these little kids, they're just kind of in their infancy," Ritchie said, before giving their response in an elevator. "You can't get into your kid's head while they're being watched."

The music, from Misfits' "I Love You Baby," was also composed by Lyle McKean. He first saw the music after recording at an online club in Chicago and said, "I remember when I heard the song they were doing a short piece 'Cue the Dream' on their album to 'Misfits' and they thought it really looked like some sort of pop jam."

Ritchie and McKean recorded 'I Love You Baby' at the U.K.â€”it has since reached a critical mass of 1 million, with the artist and co-signer, Tilda Swinton, currently the only female co-writer on the record. In his words, while they have not spoken about the record in some time, it was a fun, moving one while it lasted in their studio.
