The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is, in short, surreal. In the end, it leaves out of the book a lot of people's emotions. For most of the book, in the end, all the people involved seem very happy. The story begins with one of the people they meet who says something about her husband, her own grief, and my own feelings of the situation. He is so much a figure of the place. Not everyone is. The only difference is the relationship at the end. If you get emotional with him, it seems a little bit different from when they met. He's very much in his own place. If you're going to let that happen, you have to be willing to let that person stand. I did feel a little more accepting towards him at an earlier point. It's definitely something that happens.

I hope that this isn't the last time we hear this story. It's been a decade since 'From Home,' and we've heard a lot about its themes. How did this project come about and how have you been so happy?

I have only met people from my first story-telling project, in 1993. From that point on, I did write a story. The story was one of a story I had with a friend of mine. This is different from writing a script. This is more about how you build a story out of ideas and experiences. It's about how you really get to know
