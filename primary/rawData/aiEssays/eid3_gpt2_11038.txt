This is known as 'Rough Road Ahead'.

To keep the effect of Rough Road Ahead in mind, the following examples apply to all the conditions on the road. The first and second-most important rule of thumb to keep in mind while selecting road conditions is that an increased chance of a collision occurs if one of the vehicles on the left-hand side (or even three-tenths of a kilometre from each side) is in collision condition.

It should be noted that the second most important rule of thumb is when any of the vehicles that are on the right-hand side will be hitting. The first-most important rule of thumb on the road is not to be taken lightly. There are different factors at play. The two-tenths of a kilometre to the left-of-the-bicycle and one-third of a kilometre in the left-over zone, where this is the highest density, is likely to produce an accident. If these conditions and other factors occur in the road, then the cyclist has a number of options to avoid being
