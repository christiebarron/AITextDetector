The features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski’s ‘Rough Road Ahead’ have a direct effect on the cyclist. When the cyclist ventures into the forest on his bicycle, he finds himself navigating a very different terrain than what he is used to. He must now contend with the rocks, roots, and mud on the winding path that can make it difficult to traverse. 

The dense foliage also gives the cyclist a feeling of being ‘enclosed’, which increases both the tension and excitement of the journey. As the cyclist navigates the rugged terrain, it causes him to become stronger, more adept, and better equipped to take on the challenge of the next obstacle. As the ride progresses, so too does the cyclist’s confidence and his willingness to push himself to the limit. 

The sun shining through the trees, and the occasional breeze on the cyclist’s face, also helps to make the experience more enjoyable and satisfying. He begins to appreciate the beauty and tranquility of his surroundings and becomes more determined to make it to the end of the ride. The cyclist’s sense of accomplishment as he passes through each obstacle is enhanced by the fact that the environment he is in is constantly changing and presenting him with new challenges.
