The Empire State Building was constructed in New York City in 1931, and for many years, its main obsessions was to allow dirigibles to dock at the iconic structure. However, the builders of the Empire State Building faced several hurdles before they could make this a reality. 

The first major challenge was the construction process itself. The building was planned to have a record-breaking height of 1,250 feet and include a 200-foot mooring mast sticking up from the very top to attach and hold dirigibles in place. However, constructing such a huge structure posed numerous engineering and cost issues for contractors, including adjusting the foundation and steelwork to bear the mooring mast's load as well as making the mast windproof and safe for dirigible travel.

Furthermore, gaining the necessary permits and public approval to build the mooring mast was no easy task, as it was a relatively unknown technology. This was compounded by historical events, such as the death of scores of people in the famed Hindenburg disaster of 1933, which generated public fear and negative sentiment towards the idea of docking airships at the Empire State Building.

Eventually, the builders of the Empire State Building were successful in overcoming these challenges and the mooring mast was erected in time for the building's opening in 1931. It was also equipped with the most advanced technologies of the time, including titanium-steel cable trusses, windfences, and foamed rubber cush
