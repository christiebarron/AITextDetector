The Empire State Building was one of the most ambitious and impressive architectural projects of the early 20th century. The building was built with the aim of allowing dirigibles—a form of airship—to dock there. The task of creating a landing station for the dirigibles was a formidable challenge, and the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles on the way.

The first obstacle was finding a viable engineering method of connecting the tower to the dirigibles. The builders of the Empire State Building decided to take an innovative approach and designed a special docking mast that was a separate structure built on top of the building's base. The 'mooring mast' as it was called was 300 feet high, and it was designed to enable dirigibles to moor safely and securely. 

Even though the mooring mast was a great engineering solution, the builders still had to come up with a way to secure the dirigibles to it. They decided to install a large metal arm on the mast that was linked to a mechanical counterweight system at the top of the building. This system allowed the arm to rotate and hold any size airship in place while it was docked. 

The final obstacle for the Empire State Building was the unpredictable and treacherous winds of New York City. High winds meant that the dirigibles could not dock safely, and this led to the mast being equipped with a system of double-layered leather straps
