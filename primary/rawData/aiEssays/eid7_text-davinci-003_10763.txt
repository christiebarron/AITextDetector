I was recently in the waiting room at the doctor’s office with my friend, and we had been waiting for more than two hours. My friend was getting very frustrated and kept checking the time on her phone. I, on the other hand, was trying to remain patient. I encouraged her to focus on the positive and to take deep breaths. 

I tried to find ways to make the long wait more enjoyable. I asked the receptionist if she had any magazines we could look at and she kindly let us each take a copy. We read through each completely while we waited, which actually passed the time quite quickly. 

When we were finally called back to see the doctor, I was grateful that I had been so patient. Even though the wait was lengthy, it could have been so much worse. I could have wasted more of my friend’s time by joining her in her frustration and complaining. Instead, I chose to stay calm and find a way to make the long wait more enjoyable, which was a better use of our time.
