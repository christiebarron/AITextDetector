An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I moved into a second-floor apartment and, when I asked her, 'How do you handle living here?'" he says. "She knew from her first visit, 'You can't be where you are anymore, you're not even on the train!'"

She had no family and lived out her life in a house with only three bedrooms, which was always difficult to house, which became even harder because the city had developed to such a point that her family had never been home. Even if I had lived in a house, my mother, who runs the public relations firm, knew where her family would be. "One time my mother told me, 'If you ever want to come back home, you have to stay with your family,'" says her father. "I asked her if she had any plans to move into the Bronx, and she said, 'What if I got here? If I stay in New Jersey I can get here.' We have a lot of people who have moved out for a living here in Brooklyn. They're not allowed anymore. I know there are people out there who are not allowed here. I could have just had a few more friends to stay with and have dinner and a decent nap. Now that I don't have any friends to live with, I really feel like I'm living where I wanted to live."

She went on to teach special programs at the University of Maryland
