Minfong Ho ends Winter Hibiscus with this statement because it is a metaphor for resilience and hope. The hibiscus is a symbol of the protagonist's struggles to adjust to a new culture and the tests that she must take in order to fit in. In many cases, resiliency is the key to overcoming obstacles in life and the hibiscus symbolizes this. The comparison of the hibiscus coming back in the spring to the protagonist taking the test again gives readers hope that all of their hardships will eventually pass and they will come out on the other side a stronger person.
