The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because many people are able to relate to it as they are able to see the meaning of the chapters in the book. There is an appreciation for the way the story ends, especially when given the opportunity to find the hidden meaning in the other book.

In addition to the book's main character Astrid's personal story, there are also other important events and people that are important to her life and relationships. Also, the book is set in a future where the entire world of Westeros is in trouble. Also, the main characters from Snow's story are involved with other important things. We cannot assume that their stories just happen to occur because the actual events took place even though the characters' story occurred.


I also made the change between the books because after having read most of your other works, there is one area I am not completely satisfied with. If you follow the story, you can see yourself thinking about other things that happened in the story. It feels like your character is reading it after the events that you have read in the book. I also added some things of which I am still going to write about later and I hope that there will be additional things from those books that would make it slightly easier for other people to read it (and that makes your character much more believable as a character).

I think the author and I agree that I should revisit all of the books as it shows everything
