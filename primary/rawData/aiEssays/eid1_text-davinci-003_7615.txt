The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho serves to draw attention to the concept of renewal and hope that can be seen in the cycle of nature. The protagonist of the story faces a difficult challenge which is complicated when both her parents go abroad. However, her home is filled with natural reminders of the life that will continue and the plant, the hibiscus, serves as a metaphor for this. The speaker symbolizes her own situation by referencing the hibiscus, concluding that when the snows melt and the geese return, the hibiscus will be in bloom and serve as a reminder for her to take the test again and strive forward. Thus, the final line hinting at renewal and hope symbolizes the protagonist's journey towards redeeming herself from a difficult challenge, and serves as a message of encouragement that no matter how difficult things may seem, there is always a chance of change and revival.
