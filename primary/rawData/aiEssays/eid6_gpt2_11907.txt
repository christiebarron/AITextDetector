The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

Some feared using the space as a station for special use in the future and others feared what the building could do to space, including building new rocket motors.

So the Empire State Building was built using an American ingenuity that dates back to at least 1,000 years to have been used to hold a launch pad, the first in the country's history, and a space training facility.

But the Empire State Building has yet to set its own record of space construction.

NASA's Mars Rover has taken up some space in space.

This week Nasa astronaut Scott Kelly, who has made a habit out of flying by an orbiting craft so that he can study asteroids and Mars, was seen by the public of the ISS outside of Los Angeles.

The ULA's Orion spacecraft has orbited between Mars and Jupiter for more than 50 years.
