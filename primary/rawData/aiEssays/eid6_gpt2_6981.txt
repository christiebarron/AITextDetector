The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first hurdle was that the Empire State Building must have a wide berth on either side of Broadway before a vehicle could dock. The next barrier was that dirigibles were to be mounted outside the building's main entryway. These were deemed inadequate but were permitted to be built in the Empire State Building.

Another obstacle was the difficulty that a small number of large, fixed-width, open-floor dirigibles would have to enter, allowing some form of portability. After the final decision, and with approval from officials at the National Park Service, the National Park Service, the Federal Express Authority, the US Post Office, Metro-North Station, and the National Park Service, dirigibles were to be built along existing bridge widths to avoid bridge damage. For this reason, a lot of dirigibles were to be built directly in front of the main entrance of the building to avoid the problem with the "highways over" sign that the entrance to the building was blocked. The first stop was the new National Park Service bridge. This was only one step in an effort to improve visibility of the large and fixed-width dirigibles built for the agency, which were under construction at the end of the previous year.

When the Dirigibles were originally built on West Broadway, the street widths of the two buildings were about 1/10-1/2 inch
