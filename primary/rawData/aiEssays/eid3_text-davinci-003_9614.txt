In Joe Kurmaski’s short story “Rough Road Ahead,” the features of the setting play a large role in how the cyclist ultimately fares throughout his journey. As the story progresses, the cyclist traverses a winding, remote mountain road. The road is described as a “rugged ribbon of asphalt,” having “tight curves and rough edges.” This description of the road suggests that the cyclist must contend with a number of tight turns that require him to adjust his speed. This, combined with the rough edges of the road, serves as a challenge to his bike handling and tire grip. 

The mountainous terrain also impacts the cyclist’s ride. The road is on a “twisting mountain slope,” and the cyclist has to contend with steep grades and harrowing descents. This makes the ride much more tiring and difficult, as the cyclist must work hard just to maintain traction and speed on the considerable inclines. Moveover, any downhill segments are more treacherous, as the cyclist must be sure to maintain control over the speed of the bike and not let it get away from them. 

The cyclist must also contend with various weather and climate conditions which can further complicate the journey. Downpours of rain and gusts of wind make the road increasingly difficult to maneuver and only add to the cyclist’s exhaustion. Additionally, the cyclist must deal with shifts between various temperatures and climates as he
