Dear Editor,

I am writing to inform your readers of the often overlooked effects that computers have on people. In recent years, we have become evermore reliant on technology and computers, and too often these effects are dismissed.

Recent studies have shown that using computers can lead to a number of physical and psychological issues. Repetitive stress injuries, headaches, fatigue, and vision problems are just some of the physical ailments computers can cause. Additionally, studies have shown increased anxiety and depression, worsened concentration, morbidity, and obsession related to the use of computers.

Not only can computers cause physical and psychological harm, but they can also incite social isolation. Dependence on computers can lead us to forget the benefits of human interaction, and the ways in which it has benefited our species. Technology has its place, but it is nothing compared to direct interaction between people.

Sedentary lifestyles, feelings of detachment in public places, and a lack of understanding of how computers work is only a few of the detrimental effects of computers. I strongly urge your readers to consider how computers are effecting their lives, and to take measures that can help prevent any negative effects.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
