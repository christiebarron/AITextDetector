I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a public good, and we will never restrict freedom of expression," she said. "This debate is about education, not censorship of books, and I think she needs to give those a chance."

"I find it interesting," she added, "that some individuals feel that that's inappropriate and that a little change would be better."

In a statement, a Library spokeswoman said that the decision by the NAM was based solely on the rights of the individual whose work is published, as opposed to the fact that such a public interest would be offensive to any individual. It also did not address the potential impact on some students, who have a number of other educational issues that have little to do with the subject matter of any particular book.

"These individuals were not targeted by Ms. Whetstone simply because of their opinions as individuals," a spokeswoman said in an email.
