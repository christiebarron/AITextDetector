The speaker in the poem is reflecting on her relationship with her mother, who is a test on her patience and perseverance because of her demanding and high expectations. Even though it is difficult for the speaker to pass her mother's tests, the ending of the poem provides a hopeful note of possibility. By saying that she'll take the test again when the hibiscus blooms in the spring, it serves as a metaphor for the relationship between her and her mother. Just as the hibiscus comes back to life after the cold winter, the speaker hopes that her relationship with her mother will also be mended when they come back together in the spring. The poem serves as an encouragement to the speaker to keep pressing on through the difficulties.
