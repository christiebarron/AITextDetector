I remember when I first met my husband. I had been introduced to him through a mutual friend and we were immediately smitten with each other. The connection between us was electric, and it felt like we had been best friends for years!

One night a few weeks after we first met, I invited him over for dinner at my place. We were sitting down at the table laughing and enjoying each other’s company when his phone buzzed. As he picked it up, he looked over at me and said, “I just got a text from our mutual friend asking us if we were having a really good time.” We both started laughing uncontrollably. He quickly texted back, “Yes, the best time ever!” 

From that moment on, laughter was just as integral to our relationship as being there for each other in good and bad times. Our relationship has only grown stronger since that day, and it all began with laughter.
