The rhetorical question at the end of "Winter Hibiscus" by Minfong Ho serves as a reminder that the main character has to overcome her fear of the English language exam she needs to take in order to receive a high school diploma. The end of the poem is symbolic, as it suggests that, with the end of winter, and the new cycle of renewal that comes with spring, she will be ready to finally face her fears and take the exam. The author uses the imagery of the hibiscus bud to emphasize a sense of hope and optimism, as the flower blooms every spring, representing the characters determination and will to overcome the obstacles she faces.
