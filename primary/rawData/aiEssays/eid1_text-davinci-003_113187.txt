Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my opinion on the impact that computers have had on our lives. In todayâ€™s society, computers are an integral part of our lives. We use them for a range of activities, from work to entertainment.

I believe that computers have had a largely positive impact on us. They have made it easier for us to access information, and they have revolutionized the way we communicate. With the rise of social media, we can now connect with people from all over the world. This has increased our knowledge of different cultures and enabled us to strengthen our global connections.

On the other hand, it is important to recognize that computers can have negative impacts as well. Excessive screen time can lead to physical and mental health problems, such as headaches, sleep deprivation, anxiety, and depression. It is important to be aware of these issues and to ensure that we are using computers in moderation.

Overall, I believe that computers have had largely positive effects on us, and I hope that my readers will agree. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
