The idea of having a large steel building, like the Empire State Building, capable of having dirigibles dock, was quite ambitious. Building such a structure was no small feat, and the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome many obstacles to achieve this feat. 

One of the big obstacles that the builders encountered was the fact that there was no existing technology capable of doing the job. It was necessary to come up with a way to attach the framework to the top of a tall steel structure without compromising its structural integrity. In their book, "The Mooring Mast," Marcia Amidon Lüsted and her husband, George Lüsted, describe how the builders solved this challenge. The engineers developed an innovative system of beams and braces that were fitted into the existing foundation of the building. This system not only provided the necessary anchorage, but it also served to strengthen the building and protect it from the strong winds that could be expected at the top of a skyscraper.

Another problem faced by the Empire State Building builders was the height of the structure. The skyscraper was projected to be 1,250 feet tall, making it taller than any other building at the time. This height presented a challenge because the dirigibles had to be lowered within the building in order to dock properly. To address this issue, the engineers designed and constructed a massive mooring mast that extended from the 86th floor to the top of the building. This mast allowed
