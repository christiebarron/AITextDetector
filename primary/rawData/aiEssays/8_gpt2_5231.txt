One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my husband put his hand under my arm when he passed. I found that it was not a word we spoke often, and I couldn't feel anything," he told me.

In 2011, he and his wife decided to divorce him and set up what he called Lidl, Lidf.

"I came across it as a way of getting closer to my child. I would call her Lid," he explained. "I couldn't really express how it was. It was really difficult to communicate with my child. What if she asked you to kiss their hand a few times or even just a couple of times. But then you didn't say anything about it, you just sat there. It was really important. I got a lot from it."

The next step was to understand.

At first, it involved feeling very small and small-hearted. But after two or three couples started dating, it got to be more about people's personalities, family bonds, and shared interests, as opposed to just one.

"It was very similar when I started, but you knew very little about them," he said. And now, with the marriage still a few months away, he's getting close enough to the children to know what he wants them to do.
