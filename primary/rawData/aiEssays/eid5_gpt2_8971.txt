The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' on a scale of 0 to 10 suggests it also shows a different response from the ones we get on the screen. In reality the memoir's characters all felt the same: the one with the better sense of humor, the one like to stay focused, the one who has an ego built on arrogance, the one who is always looking for something better than the last day, the one whose self-fulfilling prophecy is always the same, the one whose heart is always full of love.

This is a kind of meta-commentary: a response to the reality in the book that is actually not so far from the book but rather, at the very highest level, from the past, in the first years of his life. In it is true to his experience that the book's character is not unique, but unique, and that his life has been one that he spent many millions of dollars on. If this is not what you read, please consider reading more about him that appears on the front page of your local newspaper. Maybe even on the pages of any non-Barry and Burt Allen, with some of them more relevant to you, you will see the same.
