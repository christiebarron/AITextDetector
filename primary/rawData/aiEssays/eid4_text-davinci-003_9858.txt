The author is trying to end on a hopeful and optimistic note. The imagery of the geese returning and the hibiscus budding provides a sense of renewal and the possibility of a better future. The protagonist of the story faced a number of obstacles and difficulties (such as taking a difficult test in a language in which she is not proficient), but the narrator provides her with hope that if she perseveres, she will have a successful outcome the next time around. The ending provides an uplifting message that with patience and hard work, anything can be achieved.
