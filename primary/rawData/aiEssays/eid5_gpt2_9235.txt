The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' was of a calm, sobering, hopeful place. It was a year later when we were talking to Mr M's mother in Malahide and her family about how much she loved the family, how great her family has been to them and how they have played such an influence on her life this young.

"I think in the beginning of writing this, it looked like we might be writing a book which would be different from the books in the previous few years but this year it was better. It gave me hope that was going to happen with 'From Home.' That's what the book was all about."

In other words, the book was about him and how he thinks back to when he had first read the memoir 'From Home. I'm sorry' or 'I went back to the wrong place.'

He said: "I started thinking about how I could try and do something different.

"I was able to bring something into my life that I didn't have before that was really in the spotlight, that was not in my books, that was really in my life, and that's who I am. I never imagined that it would become a good book, so it was fantastic."
