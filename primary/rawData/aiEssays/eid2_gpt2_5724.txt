I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is necessary. Such a censorship has the potential to lead to the disruption of our society more broadly. But, in the future this kind of censorship will be far less significant. Instead of preventing us from doing much about censorship, I believe it is possible to address the problem and make it less harmful to public works such as educational institutions.

As I explained at the end of this story, I am committed to keeping academic freedom. These freedoms can be shared on Twitter and in the libraries, but freedom to share is not absolute; in fact, I am strongly committed to keeping a healthy amount of social information on the internet, regardless of content. But this is not an absolute right, as it has never been. What I want to emphasize is that freedom to share with friends or people you know can improve your life. Some of you might even benefit from getting involved in politics, and learning about people from the outside. All of me hope that we can continue to do this.

But it is not enough not to share the information with people you know, or the information you may care about. It must come from you. And even after you are well informed and have found information for yourself, you will still have to share it with people you don't know and would never want to know about. Your friends can always send you messages online, or even tell you about things you could learn from your work online, but that only gives their help
