I was on vacation with my family in Mexico. One night, my mom, dad, brother and I decided to go out to eat. After a while, our waiter stopped by our table to take our order. He was having trouble speaking in English, and my family was having trouble understanding what he was saying. We could tell he was getting frustrated, but we stayed patient. We took turns speaking slowly to him and helping him understand what we were saying. Eventually, we got our order in and our food came out shortly after. We really appreciated the waiter's willingness to work with us despite the language barrier!
