Once upon a time, I was waiting at the post office for my passport to be renewed. I had been told it would take several weeks for it to arrive and I was prepared to wait. 

The days slowly ticked by and I eagerly tracked its progress. After what felt like an eternity, I finally got an update that it was on its way. But then a few days later, I had another update â€” there was a delay with the passport. It had been misplaced and it would take an extra two weeks for it to arrive. Disappointment welled within me.

At first, I felt angry and frustrated. I had been waiting for it and I was ready to have it. But as time went on, I made the conscious decision to be patient. Instead of complaing, I focused on all the positive things that would come with having the passport, like being able to easily travel and experience new cultures. 

Finally, after several more weeks, it arrived in the mail. I excitedly opened it and was so grateful for the reward of my patience. I had waited for what felt like a very long time but the payoff of having the passport was well worth it.
