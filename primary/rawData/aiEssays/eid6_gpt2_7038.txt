The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. It was not clear what kind of air-conditioning was needed and the building's owners had to use electric Dolphins. When two trucks approached and lowered from the building's ground floor, engineers and engineers working for the Metropolitan Opera were told that their units would never be able to reach a ceiling of more than 90 feet. Some said that it would take as long as three and a half years to reach that ceiling. Many residents protested the building when it opened a decade later.

A year and a half after the Twin Towers, the National Parks Service issued a permit for using dirigibles to make lanterns for government and city agencies and public servants who perform public functions. After much controversy, public officials and planners began experimenting with the concept. One of those people, Mark Twain, was also one of the first to suggest building dirigibles from scratch. In the end, he was persuaded to produce the first commercial dirigible-powered aircraft in 1961.

As American aerospace continues to grow, people continue to use dirigibles for public safety. In the United States, more than 100 private and public entities use the dirigible to deliver commercial and industrial cargo. A variety of other companies, such as Jetjet, are testing how the commercial aircraft will fly using the dirigibles.
