An example of a time someone in my life was patient was our daughter in high school. She was one of a very few whose lives were shaped by her experiences in the service economy. She found her way to be a volunteer for those who cared, and she had a great interest in giving back to community groups in search of work. I was very proud of how well she taught I what she was talking about at the time. We all had people who stood by us, and their service in the community worked by showing kindness, generosity, and courage.

Her service at the volunteer program at a local homeless shelter would end in 2007 when the program moved from the San Joaquin Valley to El Paso, where we moved to St. Louis, MO. Our program continues! We have never lost more than two years of volunteer time. We work on a daily basis with volunteers to keep at it while the resources are in place to meet our needs.

I am grateful for helping people, because I think people have value and are looking beyond their own lives for meaningful work. So, thanks in advance.

Thanks so much,
