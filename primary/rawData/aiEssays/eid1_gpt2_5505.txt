Computers have many effects on people. For one thing, they can be disruptive in certain ways. For example, if we know we can do better with some less expensive resources, a lot of people (especially engineers) will want to do more with less expensive resources. But if you make such an obvious thing known so quickly and efficiently that everyone can see it – then this is how computers work. Or that certain things that would be extremely cost effective but were clearly not, might be the most cost effective solution.

How can we do it?

Well, just think about what these systems can accomplish. What they make possible for you is you can use them effectively in ways that are just beyond the simple computation and computation of the mind. It can be so simple, it can actually change everything that we're doing. It might look too simple or simple at first, but you can really get out of it and be a part of it.

Computer networks are built on top of the idea that computers are computers. There's a simple but powerful application for machine learning, a general purpose learning model, and machine learning frameworks on top of that. If you want to be able to think about what machines can do right at the moment – I've been doing that over the last couple of years and it has been incredible. It does actually seem obvious that we're going to learn about how all of these things look and behave, not just how to do them in the short term
