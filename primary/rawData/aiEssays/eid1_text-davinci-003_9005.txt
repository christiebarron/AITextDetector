Dear Editor, 

I believe that computers have changed the way people think, interact, and work. It is no exaggeration to say that computers have revolutionized our way of life. Computer technology has become an integral part of our lives, from increasing our work efficiency to simplifying our daily activities. 

Yet, many people seem to overlook its positive effects. Computers allow us to remain productive while away from the office or while at home. Parents can check up on their children from remote locations with the help of computers. Moreover, computers can enable people to access information quickly and easily. With the help of computers, people can edit, store, and retrieve information with great ease.

Computers are also becoming more important for education. In fact, many schools and universities are introducing various types of computer technologies to help enhance their studentsâ€™ learning experiences.

In conclusion, I believe that computers should not be viewed as a source of trouble or distress. Instead, they should be seen as a tool for creativity, productivity, and interaction. I encourage everyone to explore the world of computers and use them to their advantage. 

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
