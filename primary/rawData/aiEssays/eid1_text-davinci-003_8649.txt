It was Friday night and my best friend and I had decided to go out for dinner. We arrived at the restaurant, found our table, and quickly opened the menu to decide what we'd be eating.

But before we could even peruse the pages of the menu, we heard a loud crack of laughter coming from the table next to us. As if it were a reflex, my friend and I both immediately started cracking up. My friend leaned over and said, "What's so funny over there!?"

We couldn't help ourselves and soon were all laughing together, if only for a moment before we returned to the business of ordering food. It was a brief exchange, but it lightened the mood so much that by the time dinner was finished, the entire table was in a good mood.

I love my best friend, but we both know laughter is what really makes us click. That night in the restaurant, I realized how important it is for us to keep laughing, no matter what. We might not always agree, but laughter is a bridge that can never be broken.
