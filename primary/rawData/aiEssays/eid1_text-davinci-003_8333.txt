I was filling out a job application one day when I realized I had forgotten to attach the requested attachments. I was frustrated with myself for making such a simple mistake but I was patient and called the contact person to explain the situation. The person on the line assured me that my application had been noted and that I could send the attachments, but that it wasn't crucial for the job. I was relieved to hear that I wouldn't be disqualified for my mistake and thanked them for being so understanding. From that experience, I learned to remain patient and courteous, even when I make mistakes.
