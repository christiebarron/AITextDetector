In the early 20th century, air travel by dirigibles had become a booming industry and the Empire State Building, located in New York City, was an ideal site to house a mast from which airships could be moored. However, the process of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was not without its obstacles. In her article, "The Mooring Mast," Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted reveals the difficulties that were faced by the architects and builders of the Empire State Building in preparing for the arrival of dirigibles.

The first obstacle that the Empire State Building builders faced was the issue of providing a mooring mast strong enough to support the airships. The mast had to be able to resist the strong winds and storms that often came through the area. In order to meet this challenge, the builders designed an elaborate system of cables and braces to support the mast's weight, making it strong enough to withstand almost any weather condition.

The second obstacle the Empire State Building creators had to overcome was the danger of an airship crashing into the building during a docking procedure. To address this problem, the builders approached the aviation industry and requested a special set of landing conventions for airships arriving at the Empire State Building. These conventions were accepted by the industry and incorporated into the docking practices of airships, making them far safer than if the building had been left open for any aircraft to approach.

The third and final obstacle the
