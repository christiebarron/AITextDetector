I remember the day I met my husband like it was yesterday. We didn't have an instant connection. We were just two people attending the same college function and making polite conversation. It wasn't until later that night that I started to see his true colours. 

It all began with a joke. He had been telling me about the time he had gotten lost in the woods when camping with his family, when I couldn't contain my laughter any longer. I felt embarrassed for having laughed so loudly but when I looked up, I saw that he was laughing too. His eyes were full of joy and I could tell he was just as amused by the story as I was. 

The rest of the night was filled with laughter. We would joke about anything and everythingâ€”the other people at the party, the music, our lives, heck even each other. Neither of us could keep a straight face for more than a few seconds at a time.

By the end of the night, I could tell that there was something special between us. That spark came from the laughter and it only continued to grow as years passed. Even during the hardest times in our lives, we had our sense of humour to lean on and it always seemed to make everything better.

Laughter was the single greatest thing that connected us and even now, it's the one thing that lasts.
