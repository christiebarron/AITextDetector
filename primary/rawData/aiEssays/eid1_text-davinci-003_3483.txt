Dear Editor,

As a lifelong member of our community, I would like to share my opinion on the effects computers have on people and why I think readers should agree with me.

While computers have made many aspects of life more efficient and convenient, they have also had a detrimental effect on our mental health. With so much of our daily lives devoted to using computers and the internet, we are becoming more and more disconnected from the physical world and the people around us. This disconnection has been linked to anxiety, depression, and other mental illnesses.

In addition to its effects on mental health, increased reliance on computers has led to a decrease in physical activity. Rather than making our day-to-day tasks easier, computers have encouraged us to become more sedentary. This sedentary lifestyle has been linked to an increase in obesity and other chronic health conditions.

While computers can be incredibly useful, it is important to remember that too much screen time can have a negative effect on our mental and physical health. I urge the readers of this newspaper to take into consideration the risks of relying too much on computers and to be mindful of their personal computer use.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
