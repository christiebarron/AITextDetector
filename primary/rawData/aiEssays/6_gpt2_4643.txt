The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They needed to be able to be mounted on their own and that made it extremely difficult for them to offer a way to attach it and make a large beam on top of it.


That's exactly what was required to help with the design of the skyscraper. For these purposes, an interplanetary bridge was created. The bridge could then be used to carry up to 250 people and span two floors of the Empire State Building by linking two main platforms: a main car and two smaller cars that could be used to transport passengers. The car could jump between the two pillars and connect directly to the other skyscrapers across its length. The car's top and bottom components could easily be connected via the interplanetary bridge, and the main car's main hub could be held on top (even if it was held against the walls of the building to stop it being moved away).


When the bridge was built, a second one would give passengers the ability to hop aboard its car. The car could then jump between the two and travel at a speed that was equivalent to having it travel at an accelerated speed. During this time the platform could be detached at any time. This was actually an interesting concept, so it went on to be a major feature of the design.


There are currently not yet any plans to replace the first bridge that would have been used as a car stop, but
