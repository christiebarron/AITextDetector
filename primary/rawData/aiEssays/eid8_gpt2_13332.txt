One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I got up in the morning and saw a beautiful woman in a very beautiful lingerie who was smiling at me.

It's not a joke, you think I might have told anyone that I was in love with her. I couldn't help but laugh with the woman out of the corner of my eye.

Just remember: you're not going there. You are a joke.

What a nice woman, one of the nicest ladies on the planet.
