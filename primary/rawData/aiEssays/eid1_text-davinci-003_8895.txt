I was out with my best friend at the time for our weekly Sunday brunch, when he suddenly started to double over in laughter. Startled by his reaction, I prodded him for what was so funny, expecting a hilarious story as I always did when he got like this. He looked up at me with a sly smile and shook his head, telling me that he had been thinking about something I had said earlier and that it still made him laugh. 

At first, I couldn't remember what I had said and had to give him time to explain. It turns out, that while we were catching up on each other's lives, I had recounted a pretty light-hearted story about a family trip we had gone on, and had said something along the lines of “And of course, mom had to be the mom...”

We both laughed out loud at this, and I realized how stupidly simple the joke had been. It was something I had said without really thinking, and yet in its simplicity, it felt like I had connected with him on a deeper level. We laughed and talked about the silly things our families had done over the years, sharing stories and moments that we had both experienced but had never really considered in the same way. 

What started out as a lighthearted joke, ended in us having a deep and meaningful conversation filled with laughter. It had made me appreciate the importance of laughing and enjoying life together, regardless
