Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. With regard to the effects on people in this setting, I've seen no evidence to suggest that people are more cautious or use more extreme approaches to the roads while on it, especially on rough roads."

The researchers said drivers might not think this behaviour is justified, but that it would not be an entirely unreasonable practice: "The 'Rough Road Ahead' scenario may lead to the development of new forms of road safety, potentially increasing both the frequency of the use of pavement, the frequency of the road closure and the number of people who can use pavement, both on and off the roads, which is a significant increase in road traffic."

The research by the team includes a project to examine "unsupervised use of road" in some regions, on a pilot basis to see if this would increase the risk of crash. The research will begin in the spring and run until the end of July.
