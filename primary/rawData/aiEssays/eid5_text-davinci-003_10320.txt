I recently had the pleasure of reading the stunning memoir ‘From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives’ by Narciso Rodriguez. This book follows the life of Pulitzer Prize-winning fashion designer Narciso Rodriguez, taking readers from his humble beginnings in a Cuban neighborhood in New Jersey, to his rise to the top of the fashion world. Throughout his memoir, Rodriguez captures a complex mood that reflects his journey through life and fashion.

The memoir radiates a sense of warmth and comfort as it paints a vivid picture of a loving and supportive family life during Rodriguez’s formative years. Rodriguez’s nostalgia is tangible as he portrays his family ties with honesty and sentiment, leaving readers with a sense of security. At the same time, we are taken on a journey detailed with Rodriguez’s struggles alongside his successes, creating a dual mood of comfort and hardship. 

This duality is further reflected in the many other elements of the memoir. Rodriguez shares his experience of fashion as a vehicle of identity, conveying a deep respect and admiration for its power in his life. His journey in this realm is also one of struggle, as he faces difficult decisions and new paths in his pursuit of success. His crisp attention to detail in fashion and the surrounding environment also give the mood a tangible texture.

The overall result of this combination of events, people and emotions in From Home is a magnificent and powerful story of Rodriguez's life and a powerful tribute to
