The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho is meant to offer a hopeful outlook for the future. The protagonist and her mother will take the college test again in the future, which will provide them with the opportunity to have a better life. The symbol of hope in the story is the winter hibiscus, which will continue to grow and flourish despite the harsh winter conditions. This serves as a reminder that no matter how difficult the present may be, things can always take a turn for the better in the future. The phrase "when the snows melt and the geese return" offers the idea that life will improve when the winter is over and the warmer seasons return, which will bring the promise of change and new beginnings.
