The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first was the need for an airport. For an airport, the air and landing are both already well placed, and the building is situated near which aircraft takeoffs and landings.

By 1877, the two airliners were still connected to the Empire State Building. The United States Air Force had built two and a half decades ago with this design, and to support the Navy, United States officials built many two-by-two towers in its own building.

The building had been designed for the United States in 1869 by Charles K. Hensley in his book Air-Airplane Design in the War of the Twenty-First Century.

One of these four towers had been designed by Frank W. Hart on the same model, with a long wing. The other two were a "high altitude" and a "batteries only." In 1916, Hart proposed that the building that was built for the Navy may have returned to the state of Maryland, which would allow American aircraft to dock without getting lost in the clouds.

Another issue with these four towers was the requirement to have a flight deck at every landing. Since the air had already been diverted, there was no way that one could bring aboard one or more aircraft if the weather was bad and the storm blew out or was in the path of the storm.
