The mood in the memoir ‘From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives’ by Narciso Rodriguez, is one of nostalgia and reminiscence, tinged with joy and gratitude. Rodriguez begins the book by exploring the Cuban home of his childhood, with its mix of vivid Caribbean hues and spiritual symbols defying convention. He paints a vivid portrait of his mother’s vibrant cooking, the aroma of Cuban cigars, and the sound of Latin music rising from a nearby bar. As the narrative moves into the present, Rodriguez reflects on his creative journey, connecting the values of his Cuban culture to the beauty he creates as a fashion designer.

Rodriguez’s voice throughout the memoir is tender and reflective, filled with warmth and joy for the memories of his past. His love for his family and his Cuban heritage is palpable, and he paints an intimate portrait of his formative years growing up on the Caribbean island. He is filled with gratitude for the pleasure his family brought him and the faith they instilled in him. While the memoir is generally optimistic, Rodriguez does touch on the hardships of his early life - the poverty, the broken promise of upward social mobility, and the lack of opportunities created by the revolution.
Nevertheless, Rodriguez’s memoir is filled with joy and quiet reflection. He calls upon readers to reconnect and embrace the cultures of their homes, and celebrates the spirit of self-determination that allowed him to achieve such great success.
