Computers have many effects on people. I can hear them, but they tend not to hear my thoughts too loud:

I want to be cool like I think I am, and I want to be a little more quiet. I can't see things, and I don't want to say anything. I'm cool.

I'm in the room writing "I'm a great person and I want to be cool like that," and then you have someone who says, "He's cool, but I really like him." Well, he probably does. Not cool. Cool people don't tend to be cool. They like people whose behavior suggests they are cool. They're cool because they like cool people. They want to be cool.

Here is a great quote from John M. O'Neill's The World of Quiet People:

The cold-hearted, often unfeeling person who uses the cold to his advantage usually finds himself or herself on the front step of an old fashioned conversation. The cold-hearted, often unfeeling person who uses the cold to his advantage usually finds himself or herself in many situations who, for the purpose of explaining things to other people, are far less likely to be rude or unkind. He uses language and speaks only when the only one understands him.

I'm in a room when I hear all of this:

"If you know me, you know that I love you, always."
