I recently proudly watched my daughter as she presented her project in front of her classmates. She was nervous and her voice quivered as she spoke, but I could tell she was trying her best.

When she finished, the other students applauded politely – but one boy was especially vocal. He had obviously not liked her project.

I felt my blood pressure rise. I wanted to jump up and defend her, but I stayed patient. I knew that if I intervened, it would only make the situation more uncomfortable for my daughter.

So I bit my tongue and waited for the teacher to step in.

Fortunately, the teacher gave a brief lecture about respect before dismissing class.

My daughter thanked me later for not getting involved. She said it meant a lot that I showed support without getting into an argument.

Being patient can be hard but it’s often the best and most respectful approach. I learned this lesson that day and I’m proud to be passing it along to my daughter.
