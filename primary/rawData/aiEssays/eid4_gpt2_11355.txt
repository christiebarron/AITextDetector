The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it has so much historical depth that it makes sense, and that's not the point here. The central plot here is that the end of Winter Hibiscus is an interesting one, one that involves a series of events that might seem like mere coincidences. But actually, there is a long end to that series of events that doesn't make sense except as a means of avoiding going through the very last chapter of that book. We meet Miki in the main story where she comes across a sword, which makes her think "oh! that weapon's actually the most fearsome sword I've ever seen!" and her thoughts are:

"Wow, you can tell that from the sword?"

So to be honest, this is like trying to kill the Joker with a pencil on. Well, I didn't see it that way, so I would have considered doing what I'd said was just a really good idea at once, I hope that wasn't "shooting down the Joker with a pencil" either. But the character never makes that choice, and it becomes hard to see what the main plot here is going to be about. In fact, it could be about any number of things: Miki's obsession with this sword, Miki's obsession with Miki and Miki (aka the Death Guard on some level) being drawn to this sword as something like "the most fearsome sword I have ever seen" or
