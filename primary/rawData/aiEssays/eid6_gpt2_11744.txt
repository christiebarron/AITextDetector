The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The city was building to be a private city, the "City of the World," and the building's planners were forced to create a public space.

There are a few things that can happen when designing public works that have private citizens in them. The architects or construction companies who want to use a building will have to comply with federal regulations which require them to provide a special structure or permit the building to be considered a public building. There may be exceptions to zoning laws in case of public buildings. However, the same regulations may be applicable to public buildings as well. Examples are the use of large, enclosed buildings regeneration, as well as public space in certain states.

The "Designee" Designee Standards

In the United States, there is a new design standard that defines for public buildings a high level of design in regard to public spaces, including public facilities. This standard defines the overall design and general purpose of the building. In the United States, public buildings are constructed in private buildings or by contract between the architect and the construction company, and no private company or building is permitted to build a public building unless that building is constructed by contractors or subcontractors.

These new public buildings do not meet the designees of the Office of the Architect of the National Historic Archimate and Preservation under the Public Buildings and Construction Tax Act of 1966.
