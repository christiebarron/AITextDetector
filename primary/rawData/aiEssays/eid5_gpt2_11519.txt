The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' in December by Ugo Fosse, the editor-in-chief of The Guardian, is that she was "as a British woman growing up in Ghana in 1979 and later in Argentina." There is a growing awareness that the UK was no longer a representative democracy, or even that it was still a working-class community, but that the UK was at the head of what was considered by some observers as postcolonial imperialism.

For many in Ghana, it's the experience of trying to understand one's own country and its people from a single-mindedness. In its best sense, it does have its challenges as the world war progressed, but it also was a time of cultural change. Its people suffered through an explosion of urbanisation and economic mobility. It was, in fact, all of these things that led to the early transition to democracy in the West, which helped to fuel the revolution and the first mass democracy in the 21st century.
