The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it gives hope to those affected and makes the most of the events that have happened. It's a beautiful book. The art is amazing too. I was pretty excited to read about this until I read the chapter where we get to see some of the memories as we were waiting for the letter.

It's a very fun book. It gives us a lot of detail about who the characters and their story will be, and what the characters will be facing in relation to their other lives. There is an interesting and very interesting theme of this book as well. They had a lot of characters that were affected by the circumstances at large, sometimes for different reasons. It BYU really gives you lots to think about about how the story will end in that case. It also provides some perspective on how the people affected will have reacted.

The art: It's a hard book to put down, but it is an amazing book. There are many illustrations with great detail. I really love the illustrations that the author does for my favorite characters on the continent. These are all very unique drawings. They're from China!
