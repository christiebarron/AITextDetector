I was recently walking to pick up a take-out order when I saw an elderly woman slowly crossing the street. I noticed right away that she was having trouble because of a cane she had in her hand. Even though I was in a hurry to get my food and get home, I decided to pause and help her from one side of the street to the other.

The elderly woman was very appreciative of my help, though she insisted that I should take the time to cross the street before she did. I told her that I was in no rush and she was my priority. When we reached the other side, I waited with her until she made it to the sidewalk safely.

I could tell that she appreciated the fact that I was being patient with her and I could even see a smile on her face. This experience reminded me that being patient is always the right thing to do and sometimes all it takes is an act of kindness to make someoneâ€™s day a little brighter.
