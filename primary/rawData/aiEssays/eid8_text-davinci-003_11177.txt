I met my best friend in sixth grade. We had an immediate connection and were always laughing. No matter the mood in the room, the two of us could always make each other smile.

One time in particular, I remember we were in my room doing our homework, and I had finally made a breakthrough on a particularly tricky math question. I couldn't believe it and wanted to share my success with my friend. But instead of being happy for me, he totally burst my bubble.

"Ha ha, that's probably wrong," he said.

At first I was surprised, then annoyed. But before I could even respond, he started laughing uncontrollably. I couldn't help but take part, and soon enough we were both in stitches. I still don't know how he can make light of things like that, but I love him for it.

That moment was almost a decade ago, but it's still one of the most fun moments I shared with my friend. Our ability to laugh together has helped us make it to where we are today.
