I remember it like it was yesterday. My best friend, who I'd known since kindergarten, had invited me over to his house for a night of board games. We had just ordered a pizza and were picking out a game to play. Then, for some reason, we both just started laughing. We couldn't remember what made us start, but soon we were both bent over- laughing our hearts out.

We were laughing so hard tears were streaming down our faces and our stomachs ached from the effort. We even got his parents in on the act! His parents, who usually were so strict, were laughing along with us. It was the most fun I'd had with my best friend and his family in ages.

After a while, we calmed down, and decided to actually play a board game. But, every now and then, one of us would just giggle and the rest of us would soon follow, the same laughter bubbling up again. We just couldn't contain ourselves after that and the laughter just kept coming!

Eventually we had to call it a night, but I couldn't forget that night- the laughter we shared that evening had a special bond between us that I had never experienced before. We still talk about that night and always laugh when we think about it. Even now, when I'm feeling down, I can usually bring a smile to my face just by recalling that evening of laughter and fun.
