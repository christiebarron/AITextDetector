The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' can be summed up as an obsession with music. "On the eve of their tour, we were still pretty much obsessed with the things we loved and didn't really remember, like what people said in their stories or on their TV show (because our parents just didn't tell us). We'd always dreamed of being friends with anyone who seemed to be good with us, and not being sad about it. It was my dad, we'd always play shows around my mom's house (because she was a very great singerancer that we used to go to every once in awhile!), and I'd always try to make her laugh. But I really didn't like our new friends until the moment I met them, who were pretty damn good at it, so we'd go to dinner together in front of her, sing, and they'd just kinda giggle and enjoy singing along, we just always went to them for one-upmanship." On music the album seems to offer a more honest portrait of his childhood. From the start of his love of music it's clear he has a deep and abiding love for his mother, who is still active, and his dad is also a devoted mom to keep him from becoming obsessed with his music. I'm really glad he's done this sort of listening for someone, even though I always thought it would be a completely different story.
