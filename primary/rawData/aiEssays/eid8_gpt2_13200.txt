One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my family decided something in my book was going to happen and got mad that it was being discussed. I didn't expect to be told about it, but somehow I didn't think about it. Even then, it was the worst. I don't know in what manner, but I feel bad for all the victims who have come to the service and are being subjected to abuse. They feel scared to lose their job, work and life. I have not gone to a service where people are sexually abused. That would be shocking. I feel bad for all of you who would be concerned that someone might say something like that to you. One-on-one cleaned up by us at the very least would be the best thing for us. They should not be involved in these things. As soon as I saw this, I was sick of the "they" and what they were doing. I don't want you to think you are crazy or anything. I am not a celebrity, so if I are, I don't want to hold my phone for long. I got to know more people at the service and that is great for me. I do not ever hold any kind of business or business meetings. I do just a very good job. I am 100% a regular here at the service as I would expect. You will always be here if you are feeling angry or frustrated or having any concerns, but that is not what happened at this
