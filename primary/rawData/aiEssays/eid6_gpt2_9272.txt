The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

Many built their own dirigibles â€” many did so 318 years after the end of the First World War

The Empire State Built also faced an obstacle that could have prevented them from getting there, though, as the project's architect was a member of the Royal Society who later died.

The government eventually agreed to allow dirigibles from the US because that would give them more room to land on, instead of having to wait until the First World War.

A private contractor built the Empire State Building in 1882 that was used to ship supplies and fuel to Britain.
