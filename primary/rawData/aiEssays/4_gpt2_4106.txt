The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it's a deeply important book to me. It's full of information that has touched me so deeply. It's full of information that I'm willing to share to give myself a little something to remember about being a woman, about being a woman at this important time of my life. I want to ask forgiveness to them. I want them to give me something to forget about myself, but I want my thoughts, my dreams, my problems to come back to me.

In addition I want to remind myself—after a lot of reading about my life and how I got here—that what makes a man is what I live for! And then I will find something—in a world that is still too complicated to even be able to explain—that if something happens and it turns out that the fact is that the world was created out of nothing, there was also a mistake, that a man can have a life of his own. That's how I've found so much joy so far.
