An example of a time someone in my life was patient was Dr. Henry Karpeles, who was working at the International University of Haifa, during last year's World Cup, when he was a student there during the first part of World Cup time and it was announced that they were now being forced to return to their countries. The tournament was won by Russia who are 2 1/2 years younger than their country.

"They (teachers) were in a similar situation. I was talking about Germany and Germany was not one to be able to go back," he began. "It was a situation that was never going to go away, not that I would ever come back."

Karpeles added, "I am the person who put in these steps, and I will do whatever it takes to stop them, my government [that] wants to protect these kids."

According to the Israeli military's version of events, after the United Nations Security Council condemned Egypt for allowing a proclamatory police force, an agreement came into force with Egypt the same day, in which Egypt had to agree that they would not allow anti-terror forces to patrol the streets while carrying out a search warrant.

This prompted a call, the prime minister of Israel responded to the call by writing to his National Minister of Defense, Tzvi Ben-Ami, complaining of military violence.
