I was waiting in line at the bank the other day, and it was taking an unusually long time. Other customers around me started getting irritated and some were even starting to make comments about how slow the process was going. I could feel my own frustration growing, as I had an appointment I was already late for.

But instead of letting my impatience take over, I decided to be patient and just try to make the best of the situation. So instead of dwelling on the length of the line, I closed my eyes and took a few deep breaths. When I opened my eyes, I noticed people around me and began to make small talk with the people next to me. I asked them how their day was going and we ended up having some really interesting conversations.

By the end of my wait, the line had moved a lot faster than I expected and I was actually able to make it to my appointment on time. I felt good not giving in to my impatience, as it allowed me to have some friendly conversations and hopefully made the wait more bearable for the others around me. Being patient is a choice that can be difficult, but the rewards of making the right decision are worth it.
