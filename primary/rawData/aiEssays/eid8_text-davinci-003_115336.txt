I will never forget the way my best friend and I laughed together that summer. It was our first summer after graduating college, and though we had to move apart, we decided to visit each other. We hadn't seen each other since my graduation party, and it had been months since we had really shared some quality time together.

When my friend arrived at my little apartment in the city, she brought her own special brand of fun and laughter. We spent hours talking about our hopes and dreams for the future, and we laughed together at the silly jokes we shared with each other. We played board games, watched our favorite movies, and had deep conversations that made us both feel closer to each other.

But what I cherished the most was the moments of spontaneous laughter between us. Whether it was at a funny hat or a silly dance move, silly punchlines or unexpected puns, we both laughed until our stomachs ached. I felt like my best friend was connected to me through our laughter, like nothing else mattered in the world. And when it was time for her to go home, we both agreed that this was the best summer of our lives â€“ thanks to our shared laughter.
