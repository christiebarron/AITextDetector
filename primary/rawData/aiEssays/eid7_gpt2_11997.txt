An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when a friend who was pregnant wanted to give birth to a baby in my arms that I was already delivering to her on the last day of my breastfeeding schedule at this time. My friend asked me if I planned to get the baby to her on January 16th. I responded that I hoped that I am ready by then!

This is why I was so excited to get involved in this and it is the right time to give my baby a chance to live. It is important that we not only get pregnant early, but also that we get to know and listen to our mothers as we can and work with them even when we don't plan to get pregnant at the end of the month!

As you can see, my goal is to help provide some of the support, motivation, and resources that other women desperately need to make their dreams come true.

My hope is in giving back to my mothers who have found this experience as a life saver. It is important for us all to live to provide some of the support that may be needed to create a life that truly is.
