The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The idea to build an airplane to carry the payload was not taken seriously by the state, but one day before the plane was due to complete docking on the city hall's platform, the State Council voted to extend the pilot's time from six hours to eight. The pilots, who had been assigned to the Department of Defense, were not allowed to dock at the State Capitol building. But the city was still waiting.

The idea came from the U.S. Air Force, and this year it is the first time that a dirigible is built on the city's historic waterfront at the State Building, according to William J. Lee, the Air Force's space program director.

Last year, a pilot saw two of the first dirigibles dock for the Department of Defense's Building 7, a hangar formerly used by the F-35C Joint Strike Fighter. On one occasion, an older dirigible of the same era had a "delayed" port docking, which was more convenient for those who wanted to dock between cities, Lee said. They could then return to the docking area for the flight.

It was the first time the F-35 carried two dirigibles up the tower. Because they were only six feet high, the first dirigible was able to dock vertically, on top of the Pentagon buildings, making it possible to use a single wing
