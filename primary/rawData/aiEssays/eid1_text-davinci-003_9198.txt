Dear Editor, 

I believe that computers have revolutionized the way people all over the world live, and have provided us with many positive effects. The most obvious of these include gaining access to information and resources that might not have been available before, increased productivity in the workplace and at home, and the ability to stay connected to the world around us, 24/7. 

However, I also believe that computers can have a negative effect on people's lives. For example, the Internet can be a source of distraction and bring unneeded stress into our lives. The constant availability of emails, social media, and news sites can lead to overstimulation, which can lead to interruptions in sleep patterns, appetite, and even mental health. 

Additionally, computers can limit our standard of living. People may be so focused on staying up-to-date with the news, checking emails, and scrolling through social media pages that they fail to engage with the people around them or enjoy outdoor activities. 

I urge readers to exercise moderation when it comes to their computer use, and to prioritize interacting with the real world and exploring activities that donâ€™t require a computer. Doing so can lead to increased productivity, satisfaction with life overall, and better health. 

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
