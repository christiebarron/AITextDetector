An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the little girl that I was looking at after I came around to the corner and threw him on his back to go to the door, and I saw him fall. And I just said, 'He has to go.'"

The girl's mother said the teenager had been waiting on her for hours at a time to get a medical opinion, to then come home when the police arrived. She said it was so traumatizing they called for emergency medical help.

In the case of a case in which one of her children's parents was killed when their house was burglarized in an attack on an Orthodox synagogue, a mother has said she was told by relatives that her son was a part of a group. Investigators found evidence that the synagogue house belonged to Rabbi Zvi Tishri, though one cousin said she could not identify who was behind the attack.

"It's a very bizarre story," said Hana Amar, a Jewish-American woman who was part of a group of Israeli soldiers who left Israel to join the United States in 1985. When she learned of the abduction, she started a GoFundMe page that raised nearly $25,000, including more than $25,000 going toward a funeral. On Tuesday, the foundation took its usual days off with some business to take care of her children.

"We're going to make this really weird," said Amar.
