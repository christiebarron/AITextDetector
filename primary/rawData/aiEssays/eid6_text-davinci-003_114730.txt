The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The task of building a docking mast for the large and unwieldy airships was an uncommonly difficult one. The mast needed to be strong and robust enough to withstand the powerful winds and gale-force gusts generated by the dirigibles’ immense size. Yet, it also had to be constructed in such a way that would make a safe mooring space for the ships. 

The main problem was the site on which the mast would be built—the pinnacle of the Empire State Building—which protruded high above the street level. Constructing the mast strong enough to withstand the wind gusts at such an elevation would require a great deal of structural engineering. Additionally, the area around the building was densely populated, which meant the mast had to be designed in such a way that it would prevent any serious damage to the surrounding buildings in the event of an accident. 

The process of constructing the mooring mast was also greatly complicated by the fact that Manhattan was surrounded by water. The engineers had to take special care in constructing a reliable foundation to keep the mast upright in the face of the powerful winds generated by the towering steamers. This was no small task, as they had to create several strong anchors to secure both sides of the mast firmly and evenly in the bedrock below.

The remaining challenge was the air traffic itself. Dirigibles
