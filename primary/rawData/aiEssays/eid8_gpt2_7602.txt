One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I fell asleep and watched the world around me shrink. I'd wake up in an office in London one morning with a piece of paper saying: "This is a joke on BBC 2 which won't stop playing over and over again because it's going to be the last.

'A bit of a comedy but not a great one.'

'I didn't know what I wanted to do, I just wanted to be funny.'
