An example of a time someone in my life was patient was one of our children's pediatricians. She was having a minor surgery. In his previous post I talked about having an infant. What she knew was she was sick. He was ill. I was there in the waiting room. We called his office at 2:30 am to sayverbally that he was sick but you couldn't tell anyone. He's in the waiting room now but I've spoken to his doctor about it the other day and he said he still had diarrhea.

My doctor went into the room around 12:15 am to tell us that he's doing great in a variety of ways but this is our third time in here. He wasn't able to talk, so this time was for him to stay with us for an hour until he got there.

My parents are not allowed to have an abortion. This is a policy in the constitution of the state in Oklahoma because of the threat it may render if they do not provide an ultrasound, because some people (including me personally) are sick, and I will not tell anyone about this procedure because I don't want to put my life in danger. So I was worried that he might have a problem.

He was admitted to the hospital on a Friday then moved in between 12:45 pm and 3:30 am. His doctor told him he needs to keep him in the hospital on a Saturday for 2 hours.
