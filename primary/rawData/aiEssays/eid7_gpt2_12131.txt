An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was diagnosed with Alzheimer's and my mum was diagnosed with Parkinson's, and it was the first thing I learned I had to do was change my way of looking at my own actions and my relationships"

However, I was only diagnosed in 2008 and as a result my doctor saw how I looked different and decided it was time to take action.

"At the end of 2010 the government sent me a letter recommending I should pursue an aggressive anti-ageing treatment plan and after about two years of this medication working out what I had, I decided I needed my own treatment plan and the government said they would look into it."

After working out this was how.

"I went into surgery at the age of five (before my parents and grandparents were diagnosed) and my mum did what I did in the following year. Now I see my family doing the same things - the new year, the new year, the new year. I don't think this is going to be an issue, this should be my plan and I just need to keep doing exactly what I am doing without any problems for the next seven years to come. I don't want me to feel like my life has been taken away from me.

"I need to stay committed to what I'm doing. Because I've been fighting really hard, taking what I could get for myself and staying focused on what I care about
