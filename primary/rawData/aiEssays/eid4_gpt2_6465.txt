The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it offers an interpretation of the relationship between humans and monsters in ancient Greece: you're monsters, humans are human. This relationship between monsters and humans is what the book explores and the authors do a terrific job in giving our characters a sense of the world's monsters â€” we see them in a way we haven't seen them before in the book, in the world (and perhaps even in the Bible itself).

The second important element in the book's story is a lot of the stories in the book begin and end with the monsters themselves. What's interesting is a little side note from the book about how people would be better off if they didn't have to worry about monsters, and how that would change with the time that we are stuck with, rather than how the book begins and ends. I'm not saying all of the world's monsters are bad, and I'm doing this after a while. But the book starts off really, really wrong, because a lot of things seem to go wrong when you try to get past this.

It's one of my favorite parts of this book, really, because I would rather be wrong than not be right. The book has this very strong "you're doing what weVanion told you to do," that you have to do what weVanion told you to do. But when you try to avoid those things (and then we're stuck with it, without filmed)
