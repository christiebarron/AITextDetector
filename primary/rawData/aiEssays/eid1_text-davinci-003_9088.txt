To The Editor:

In today’s ever-changing world of technology, the effects computers have had on people’s lives cannot be overstated. While there are some negative results of relying so heavily on technology, I strongly believe that computers have had a largely positive influence on our lives.

First, computer technology means that people now have more access to information than ever before. Through the internet, people can quickly find information about any topic imaginable, allowing everyone to stay informed and knowledgeable. This access to information is undoubtedly beneficial to society as a whole.

Secondly, computers have revolutionized the way in which people communicate. Social networking outlets such as Twitter and Facebook allow people to keep in touch with each other, even if they are geographically distant from one another. This means that more relationships can be formed and maintained than ever before.

Finally, the use of technology has enabled people to work and accomplish tasks in less time. Computers make it possible to do things more quickly and efficiently, freeing up time that can be spent with families and on leisure activities, thus enriching people’s lives.

In conclusion, computers have undoubtedly had positive effects on our lives. They provide us with access to information, enhanced communication, and more leisure time. I urge your readers to think of the many benefits computers bring, and to recognize the widespread positive effects they have had on our lives.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
