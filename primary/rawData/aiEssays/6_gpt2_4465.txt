The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. If the building had been built on the first floor, it was a relatively standard-issue skyscraper with some of the more famous buildings like Carnegie Hall and the State House with seating for 300.

In the 1930s, several of the city's many landmarks - including the New York City Opera House and the State House - were left unfinished.

When he took office, George M. Kennedy wrote:

...it is difficult to understand how the architectural and moral, cultural, and aesthetic value of these buildings alone is sufficient to justify their abandonment and destruction during an era of renewed civic and political enthusiasm.

He argued that the city, which had been built on the first floor of a city skyscraper for decades, would have to adapt to new, more modern uses in order to ensure the architectural and moral value of the buildings remain intact.

The proposed renaming of Kennedy's apartment building is an indication that the building has yet to pass public scrutiny - the property currently in the State Library's archivist's possession is already listed by the archivist.
