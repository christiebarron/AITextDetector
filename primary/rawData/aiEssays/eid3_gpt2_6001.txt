Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. The first is that the cyclist is more responsive to the change in traffic when passing a high-speed vehicle. By reducing the drag on the bike, there is less risk going to the road.

The other benefit of using these two variables is an increased propensity to use lower pressure and use fewer tools, which increases the degree to which road safety is enhanced by using more equipment.
