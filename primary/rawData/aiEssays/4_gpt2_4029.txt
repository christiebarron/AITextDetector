The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because, if you distraction yourself from the story, you forget the events. It also makes the ending sound like it's not very important to you and that you should pay attention. Winter Hibiscus makes for interesting reading so I should have no hesitation in saying that it's good. Not as much as my last book was for me because I don't understand how this works.
