Dear Editor, 

I'm writing to express my opinion on the effect computers have on people. It's a common belief that computers are a negative influence, but I believe this is an outdated view. 

In the modern age, it's impossible to go through life without using a computer. With a computer, people can do countless things – from making business transactions to finding answers to life's questions – much faster and easier than ever before. Computers offer a wealth of resources that would be impossible to access otherwise.

Although there are obviously downsides, such as the potential for fraud and cybercrime, computers can also be empowering tools. They can give people access to new opportunities and foster creativity. By providing a practising space, students can develop essential computing skills and develop innovative solutions to difficult problems.

In conclusion, computers undoubtedly bring some challenges, but they have also provided us with an endless number of advantages. People can become productive, informed and connected citizens by taking advantage of the capabilities computers provide us. Therefore, I'm convinced that the effects computers have on people are overwhelmingly positive.

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
