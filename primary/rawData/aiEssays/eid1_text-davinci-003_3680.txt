Dear Editor,

As technology continues to evolve, it is impossible to ignore how computers have profoundly changed our daily lives. While computers can be incredibly advantageous for people in many different ways, I strongly believe that they also have the potential to cause some significant negative consequences, especially over long-term use. 

It has been documented that too much exposure to screens can decrease one's ability to focus, including the ability to focus on tasks that do not involve computers, such as reading and writing. As a result, people can become less engaged with the real world around them and often struggle to develop their personal interests, skills and relationships. It is becoming increasingly common for people to become too dependent on technology and fail to recognize how their physical health and mental wellbeing can be adversely affected. 

The current technology landscape of our world has the potential to be immensely positive but, it is important to remember that a healthy balance between technology usage and other activities should always be encouraged. Parents play a vital role in setting a good example and promoting the appropriate use of technology for their kids.

I urge my fellow readers to consider the importance of investing in understanding and learning how to use technology to our advantage, while also advantaging yourself by engaging in other activities.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
