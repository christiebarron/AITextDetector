I was out shopping with my friends when I noticed a customer in front of me was making a return. The customer was having a difficult time because the store wouldn't take the item back due to its condition. She was getting frustrated and I could tell she was anxious to get out of the store and on with her day. I had been waiting in line for quite a while so I could have easily become impatient.

However, I decided to be patient and realize that this was a particularly difficult situation. So instead of getting frustrated and irritated, I tried to understand the customer's situation and put myself in her shoes. I kept my calm and tried to help the customer out by suggesting other solutions. In the end, we were able to come to a resolution and the customer was able to leave the store satisfied.

I'm proud of my patience that day and I'm confident that this situation could have gone in a much less pleasant direction if I hadn't chosen to stay patient and understanding.
