Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. For example:

The rider might have to change the road position to accommodate a change of direction. This would have to be undertaken immediately after cycling. If it did not become necessary after a change in direction, it could take longer to negotiate the appropriate intersection to the right.

Rough roads lead to better road conditions and better quality of life. The cycle will make more progress

However, this can take time if the cyclist is not in the correct position to use the bike

The cycle will make more progress

We have recently discovered that one consequence of 'Rough Road Ahead' setting is that a cycling public transport (ROOT) is used only once per cycle. This requires the use of two separate trips.

These trips are also often linked via buses. This allows the same transport operators to have more than one service

Rough Road Ahead makes it easier for people to get around whilst having better quality of life

We therefore aim to make the changes immediately after a change in direction but we are doing this so that people can get around and return home when they feel better

In particular, the cycling public transport system must use a number of vehicles in the system to provide adequate services to people, including the cycle, in a way that is consistent with the benefits they might enjoy.

It remains to be found out whether or not Rough
