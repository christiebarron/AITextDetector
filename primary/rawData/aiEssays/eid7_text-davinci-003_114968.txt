I was walking down the street when I was stopped by an older gentleman who asked me for directions on how to get to a specific bus stop. I was a bit flustered because I wasn't familiar with the area, so I explained that I could not provide him the directions he was looking for. But, instead of getting angry at me as I half expected, he smiled and thanked me for my help. He said, "That's okay. I'm sure I can find it. I understand it can be hard to know your way around a new place." I was so impressed by his kindness and patience, despite the fact that I could not provide him with assistance. I thanked him for his understanding and wished him well in his search for the bus stop.  I feel like I learned a lot from his patience and I'm grateful I had the chance to encounter someone so kind.
