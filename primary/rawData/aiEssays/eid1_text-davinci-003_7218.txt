The setting of "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski affects the cyclist in a myriad of ways, creating a heightened sense of difficulty and danger for the protagonist. The setting of an unkempt road in the Oregon wilderness, full of sharp turns and sharp edges, along with the heavy summer rains, creates a treacherous terrain for the cyclist.

The cyclist is forced to navigate the "rough and broken up roadway" while relying on their own physical strength and maneuverability to stay upright. In addition, the heavy summer rains create hazardous potholes and flooding, further challenging the cyclist's path. The thick fog further clouds visibility, preventing the cyclist from detecting potential obstacles and hazards ahead.

Ultimately, the cyclist is left relying on their own instincts and sheer will to survive the course. This makes every slight turn and every setback even more intense, as the cyclist is never able to plan ahead and see what lies ahead. The ever-present danger and seemingly insurmountable obstacles make for a nerve-wracking experience for the cyclist.

Overall, Joe Kurmaski's description of the setting contributes to the tension and difficulty of the cyclist's journey. The elements of the setting, from the rough and broken roadway to the thick fog and hazardous flooding, all work together to highlight the severity of the cyclist's situation and make for an intense read.
