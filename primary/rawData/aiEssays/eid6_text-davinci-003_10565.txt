The Empire State Building was a feat of engineering during its time of completion in 1931, and one of the most notable innovations was its ability for dirigibles to dock at the building. This however was not a simple task. The builders of the Empire State Building were presented with many obstacles to overcome in order for these airships to dock, and it took dedicated effort and thought to allow them to.

One of the main challenges the Empire State Building would face was height. In order to accommodate the airships, the building had to be 234 meters tall. This was a staggering height for the time, and provided many issues with the buildingâ€™s stability. Furthermore, to make sure the building could withstand airships docking at its peak, further adjustments had to be made beyond its foundation strength.

In addition to height, air flow was a key factor in making sure dirigibles were safe and secure when docking. Any potential crosswinds that could come from the surrounding buildings had to be assessed. This was of particular importance seeing as the airships were large and yet light, and could be greatly affected by winds. Adding to this, the Empire State Building was also situated in the flightpath of many of the dirigibles that would be docking. As such, new zoning regulations had to be put in place to ensure the safety of air traffic around the building.

The final major challenge the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to
