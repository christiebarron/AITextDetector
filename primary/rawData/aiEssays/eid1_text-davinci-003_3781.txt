Dear Editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people in todayâ€™s world. The majority of people, including myself, have been greatly affected by the presence of computers in our lives. 

Computers have made our lives easier in some ways. They have enabled us to do tasks quickly and easily that would have taken hours if not days to do manually. We can store vast amounts of data, connect with people from all over the world, and access information at lighting speed.

However, the presence of computers has had some negative effects as well. For example, computers have made some people less social. People, instead of going out and engaging in face-to-face conversations, now often depend on computers for entertainment and communication. Furthermore, computers have made people more reliant on technology, which has in some cases led to the shortening of attention spans.

The presence of computers is here to stay, but with these negative effects in mind, it is important for us to find a balance between computer use and other activities that require human interaction. We must be aware of the effects computers have on our lives and find a balance so we can continue to benefit from the convenience of computers and also not experience the negative effects.

I urge readers to consider the effects computers have on people and work towards finding a healthy balance between computer use and other activities. 

Sincerely, 
[Your Name
