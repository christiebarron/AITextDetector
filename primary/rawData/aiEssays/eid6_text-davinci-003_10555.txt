The Empire State Building was built in the early 1930s and was designed to allow for dirigibles, or floating aircrafts, to dock at the top. This initial plan posed many problems that the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome in order to make it a reality. One of the main obstacles was the sheer size of the building. At more than 1,250 feet tall, the Empire State Building was one of the tallest skyscrapers in the world. This presented a problem because it would require a very large dirigible to be able to dock, and a large dirigible would require an extreme amount of fuel, reducing the range it could travel and drastically limiting its practicality.

Another obstacle was the thought of navigating the New York skyline. At the time, the pilots of dirigibles had never attempted such a feat in such a dense urban setting. The obstacles of navigating such a busy skyline were compounded by the sheer number of tall buildings in Manhattan which could prove difficult or near impossible to navigate for a large dirigible. In addition, the winds around the Empire State Building would likely cause turbulence on approach, which would be very dangerous for such a large aircraft. 

The final obstacle was in the structural design of the building and the proposed platform for the dirigible to dock on. The roof of the Empire State Building was made of steel and concrete, both of which present a problem to the large gas bags found on dirigibles. The original
