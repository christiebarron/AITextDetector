The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Most commonly, a dirigible would have to be at sea, so that if one was damaged, or even lost, it would not only cause a fire, but would also kill the pilot. Additionally, this would create significant noise pollution that would endanger both the people and ship crews.

A few years later, the Empire State was built, and a bridge connecting the Empire State Building and the Pacific Railway (the latter was an expansion of the Atlantic Coast Railroad in the 1920s and 1930s). The bridge, completed in 1959, was the tallest bridge to be built of the U.S. Pacific as well, which is what it does most of the time.

In the end, all of these obstacles are easily overcome thanks to a simple process:

The pilot can fly a dirigible out of the building into the ocean.

The building itself is a small craft.

To the right of the building's roof lies the tower.

On the bottom of the tower are the main windows, which are covered in glass on all sides as well as on the side that carries the crew. As a result, the building itself, in the final picture above, has less space to accommodate dirigibles to dock.

While the designers designed a dirigible into the ground on the building's exterior, instead of allowing astronauts to fly it underwater, the building had
