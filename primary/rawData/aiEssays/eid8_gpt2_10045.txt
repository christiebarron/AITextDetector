One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was 12 years old and I heard a friend of mine tell me that it was amazing how many laughs we got that day. It was a nice little experience and after all the great times I went through there was no way for me to make a laugh.


As a young lady I enjoyed my time in class because I could learn everything you need to know on your own about being funny and being happy. My high school was a great learning experience for me because it taught me a lot about the world that I didn't know existed in elementary school and taught me how to be self-confident and not lose it.


My high school was wonderful because it was a lot of fun, but not everything was as easy as it seemed like. In the middle of our first year of college we wanted to make some big changes in class so I went out to read a book called The Great American Novel. It was kind of a book about the life of a person through school. It was really interesting because I always thought there was a lot more to America than we do and what it was about. It's also sort of something that comes up frequently, and there's a lot of that that comes up in my life. It is more about what it is about than it does about the world.


I learned that being funny is about��GOOD
