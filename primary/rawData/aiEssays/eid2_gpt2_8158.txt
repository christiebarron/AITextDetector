I believe that censorship of materials in libraries, schools and libraries is a way to reduce the amount of content on the Internet we share, in our educational materials, and we are working with legislators to get information about how to do it. I would like Congress to take action to require that libraries and public schools require that everyone have the option of downloading materials from the Internet.
