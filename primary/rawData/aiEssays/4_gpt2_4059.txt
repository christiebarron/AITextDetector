The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because we're back in the world of books where you write stories using real words (rather than fictional characters or animals, e.g., or words they were not meant to write for but would have come up in) with more and more examples. For instance, in the book The First Tale of a White Dove, you write a story about a bird that becomes the first person there to receive the gift of an egg, with just as much foresight and detail and ingenuity as "something white-eyed and very long with a big head."

It's true that some of these stories will still take place decades or even longer, but a lot of the best stories are already there: In the story The End of Men, for example, you find the word "mild" applied to a house of goats near a lake called Duxford, which you know is the same house the author intended or wanted to write next, but you didn't realize the family had recently built that house into it: Instead of making it much taller, but not too much less, the writing took this one extra step.

Another way to think about our time in the book is that it's not as we may have lived it, but rather as we'll see it in the next paragraph.
