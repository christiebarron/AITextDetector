One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was sitting next to my family at work. My husband and I all laugh. I got bored, so I just said, "You need a laugh. Not only are you a great person but you're our friend." He took a breath and I laughed.

It's my favorite thing about my job. My coworkers all have great friendships. I've never felt like I wasn't around and even more so when they're talking about my job.
