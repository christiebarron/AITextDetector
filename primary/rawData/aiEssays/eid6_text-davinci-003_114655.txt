The construction of the Empire State Building presented unique obstacles to those attempting to adapt the structure to allow the docking of dirigibles. The difficulty of accommodating airships was the result of the physical characteristics of the building as well as the mechanical and technological considerations associated with the docking procedure.

The height of the building was the first major obstacle builders needed to address in order to permit the docking of dirigibles. When it was completed in 1931, the Empire State Building was the tallest structure in the world at 1,250 feet, well above the minimum altitude of a blimp. The building also featured a large flat roof, an essential feature for the effective mooring of the large airships. Additionally, the building had a spire at the top reaching as high as 1,472 feet, providing adequate elevation for airships to dock safely at the building.

The second issue facing the builders of the Empire State Building was the structural considerations of the building. It needed to be reinforced to support the significant structural stress that comes with docking a large dirigible. This process required investments in new materials and technologies to upgrade the building's mooring capacity. For example, the tower had to install a steel-reinforced, anchor-style platform on the roof and attach several elongated stainless-steel mooring poles to the building's roof. These mooring poles, which extended as high as 1,480 feet, had to account for the varying elevations
