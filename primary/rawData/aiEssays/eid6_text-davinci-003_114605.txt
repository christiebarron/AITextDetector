The Empire State Building was completed in 1931 and quickly became an iconic structure and landmark. While most people are familiar with the 102-story skyscraper, few realize the Empire State Building was originally designed to dock dirigible airships. While the idea of airship docking had excited many at the beginning of the 20th century, the project engineers and architects faced a variety of obstacles in making this concept a reality.

The first obstacle that the Empire State Building team faced was how to properly design a space large enough to accommodate the dirigibles. Despite the dimensions of the world’s largest airship, the Hindenburg, being 803 feet long and 135 feet high, the architects had to squeeze 200 feet of additional space into the building’s design in order to accommodate the mooring of the dirigible. They also had to develop a mast to extend 100 feet above the tallest section of the building so that the mooring lines could be attached.  

The second obstacle the architects faced was developing an effective means of securing the mooring ropes and lines used to dock the airship. While the mooring mast was designed to be made from structural steel, the engineers faced the challenge of securely tying down the dirigible to the mast on the Empire State Building. Since the mooring lines had far too much kinetic energy when the airship started to descend, engineers had to develop some way of containing the force of the dirigibles and
