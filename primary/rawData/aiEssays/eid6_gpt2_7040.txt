The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. An early attempt had involved a small pilot who flew an aerial saucer. But his own crew of flight-tested planes could not land. That year, the first U.S. and Canadian planes carrying U.S.-built dirigibles arrived in the United States and Canada.


It was around this time that the first U.S. and Canada-built radar systems were launched. The U.S. Congress appropriated billions of dollars for a $5 billion project to build radars for radar facilities. Some critics predicted that the project would fail and the U.S. might lose its own radars. But no one would say that because the planes could not dock.


In April 1962, a special joint committee to develop a plan for the development of radar radars for the U.S. Navy signed off on planning a $5 billion project to develop radars for the U.S.-built military radars program. The committee proposed the following design elements and features: A "spectral system array" based on the radar constellation that can monitor the surface of the ocean and provide low power communications equipment.

A "satellites system" where an operator could monitor the ocean surface from an aircraft's antenna.


The committee agreed on the following design elements including "air-orbiting and optical systems".

A "radar control system", a system
