Minfong Ho ends Winter Hibiscus with this thought to emphasize the metaphorical implications of the story. The protagonist and her family have gone through a difficult experience, but the realization that they can attempt it again in the spring—when the snow melts and the geese return—implies that they have been through a metaphorical winter and will soon get the chance to try again in the spring. This serves as a metaphor for the hope that comes with the struggles of life—that with resilience and courage, we can try again.
