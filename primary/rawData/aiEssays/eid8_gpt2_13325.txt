One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my mother taught me how to think. I loved itâ€”I like it, as am I. My brother said, "Every day when you hear it, you can hear laughter again."

The best way of doing this is to listen with curiosity and empathy and respect, because there's so much that the world does not offer. The good news is that people all over the world enjoy doing good, and we should all be grateful.

Spring 2012: My mom was working as a nurse when she was diagnosed with Parkinson's and was taken to the Mayo Clinic to see an MRI. She needed surgery, she says. But was the diagnosis enough to give her back to work and resume her normal activities?

My answer is no. While I've continued to believe, I do have a serious condition. It's called my back pain, and in those rare moments when nothing stops me, sometimes they just can't be ignored. I'm an all-around good person. I've also learned that not everything is good and that others are looking at people with problems. This makes it easier for me to share my stories.

I'm writing these quotes out in my favorite little dictionary and I'm also writing them down. I'd like to share my last words about why I'm so happy I am helping people with back pain. So make sure to leave any and all comments below, and tell me what you think.
