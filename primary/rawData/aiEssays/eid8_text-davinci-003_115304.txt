I always look forward to my weekly Skype calls with my best friend. We usually just sit there and catch up on life, but this one call was especially memorable. 

We were about 10 minutes into the call when the conversation took an unexpected turn as we began to reflect on the difficult year we'd both had. We ended up venting about the struggles and details of our challenges. But in doing so, we couldn't help but start making jokes about what we had gone through.

At first, it was just a little chuckle here and then, but before long we were both in tears, tears of laughter, that is! It felt so good to be able to laugh with my friend about the circumstances we were in and to see the humor in it all.

When the call ended, neither of us wanted it to. We'd had a surprisingly upbeat conversation, given the circumstances, and just enjoyed the moments we shared. We also appreciated the reminder that even in the most difficult times, laughter truly is the best medicine.
