The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it leaves a lot of unanswered questions about the nature of the supernatural while being a relatively light, straightforward introduction into various aspects of the scientific understanding of the supernatural. I'm glad that the book focuses, for the most part, on quantum mechanics and physics, however, I think those are just two of the basic disciplines that need some exploration, although many of the other fields are in further dispute and need more research and analysis.

A recent new book, The Nature of Consciousness by George W. Bush explains how our understanding of consciousness is shaped by our ability to comprehend the supernatural, but this makes the book just a bit dull, as it does not really go into the fundamental concepts of that supernatural. While it does provide some background on human experience that has come from several sources, it does not provide much of a roadmap. Rather I find it quite distracting when I'm exploring supernatural phenomena and its origins.

A new book, The Soul, by James Haldane, gives insights back into our ability to think, feel, see and be perceived on a cosmic level for a brief period of time and is a nice read!

The book comes in a beautiful paperback of its own, but it lacks some of the detail, especially the introduction
