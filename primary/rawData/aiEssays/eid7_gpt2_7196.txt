An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was 10 years old and I was being treated sexually by a nurse. She said if I had been in a sex position no one would have come. My grandmother thought she was a witch, and for that I think all women can be. But she is wrong. All women do not need to be sexually active. And it is wrong to act according to your wishes, because it shows them your disapproval to them. So when a nurse takes me to the bathroom when I am in a sex position then I'm supposed to let the nurse touch me so she can say, 'You don't have to be sexual, but if you do I'll have to have your hand. He's got a good mouth. I'm going to say I'm fine.' What you're showing is that you are okay? There is no place for that and there is no place for you to talk about what you want.

Lorenzo: So a lot of sexual assault survivors and survivors come in and say, 'Well, I didn't try to touch you, but I have to touch you as well, because no one ever came to help me with my sexual abuse.' In my mind that's a victim-blaming that people have on the Internet. The media can be pretty powerful just in the nature of it. You have to realize that some people's minds don't always match the reality if they have to face the realities
