Narciso Rodriguez's memoir 'From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives' is designed to complement the powerful stories in his fashion collection. Through intensely detailed narrative, Rodriguez skillfully crafts an atmosphere of nostalgia that hearkens back to his childhood growing up in New Jersey and the Dominican Republic.

The opening of the memoir establishes an intimate atmosphere of reflection and closeness to the narrator's family. Rodriguez outlines a vivid portrait of his home and remembers the sense of security and love it fostered in himself and his family. He describes the tactile qualities of the home's environment in vivid detail, from the thick wallpapers to the stuffed animals arranged on the shelves.

Throughout the memoir, Rodriguez preserves the memory of his loved ones with tiny snapshots of his relationships with them. He gleefully describes moments spent with his mother – baking chicken with pumpkin and making dresses for his sisters. These brief moments are packed with sentiment and emotion, and in tandem with the descriptions of his home, Rodriguez paints a warm, loving home life.

The poetic narrative in 'From Home' sets a melancholic yet optimistic mood – an atmosphere of longing and yearning for the past while still recognizing the positive impact of these memories. This tone is most evident when Rodriguez recounts his parents' migration from the Dominican Republic and the subsequent passion with which they approached life in America. These stories serve as an inspiration for the readers to remember their roots and be proud of all their hard-fought accomplishments
