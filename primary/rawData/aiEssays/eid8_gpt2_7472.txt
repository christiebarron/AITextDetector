One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my parents were sick. "It is not like you had a big laugh when you were sick?" they asked. I remember it as a pretty good chuckle. We have been friends ever since. So when I had done something strange with my mind I was still pretty much shocked. I felt like a little kid now. Now I realize that is not to say my mind hasn't affected my thinking and thought process. When I remember something I am now scared of my thoughts that are going into my brain and sometimes go into those thoughts myself. I also find a way to do things with my mind without affecting my writing. I try out a new method (also described in the previous section), for example if I am trying to write I can do it with my own hands and not rely on my emotions, I can just use my hands on my phone... I would not use hand in me but with my mind. The only thing I would change is to be able to write without emotion.

You can tell yourself that no writing is good!

After writing, I have some ideas to write my next project and the first book I am going to publish. It is a big project so I have some ideas to write this year. Some of the books I am going to publish are one thing. There are two things I will post after writing. First, I will write something for the website. Next, I will do something on Amazon
