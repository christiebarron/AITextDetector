I was out walking with my family one evening. My dad was cracking jokes as always, pointing out funny sights along the way, and I couldn't help but laugh at his silliness. Suddenly, we heard laughter coming from a nearby park and my dad said, "Let's join them!" 

We then jogged towards the park and discovered a group of old people huddled around a well-lit table. After greeting each other, one of the elders started to tell a long-winded joke complete with silly voices and facial expressions. We all laughed until we were doubling over in our seats. The atmosphere was quickly filled with lightheartedness and joy, and it felt like the best thing in the world.

As we said goodbye to each other and went our separate ways, I couldn't help feel thankful for the burst of laughter that we all shared. It reminded me that relationships can be built through shared laughter, no matter how trivial or insignificant it may be.
