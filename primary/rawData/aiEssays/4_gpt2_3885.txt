The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because in each piece of the puzzle, the characters find some kind of emotional connection to one another. At the end, I had to admit that it was incredibly hard for me to read itâ€”because while the book was very readable, the plot is often a mess. Even writing it was very challenging. To me, it felt like the first half of what would happen should have been rather abrupt. It seems like I may feel a little less pressure to read a book like this after all.

I think that when this book starts to get a little more polished, even a little sadder and more real, I'll continue to read it. I just started reading it from beginning to end. I've been interested in all sorts of different books, and now, it seems to me that there really isn't any easy way to go back, and those sorts of things aren't necessarily easy. I'm hoping that if I're fortunate enough at all, I will at some point reach some sort of endgame where I finally find what I really want to do with my own life, or at least not to just read another book.

If you're like me, you're aware of the struggles that lie ahead. Maybe some of us feel like this is our time in life. You're aware of the challenges that lie ahead. How many days is enough to really start thinking of what you want to end up with? Will
