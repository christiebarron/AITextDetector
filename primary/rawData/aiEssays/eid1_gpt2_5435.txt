Computers have many effects on people. The key point is that you're always trying to figure out your own effect (maybe have a way for your user to see the impact), whether you're doing something that might be called a virtual machine, a virtual machine that uses a virtual controller or a single computer with a few different memory locations, or more importantly you're trying to figure out what effects the machine has on people's behaviors, you're trying to get a sense of the effects the machine has on you. That is, a little bit of data becomes big data and it becomes something that we have no control over. So if people can see or hear a person's behavior and their actions, they will think that we can help them identify what their effect is. In fact, you should be able to tell the difference between what a person does and what they think so that you can then use that information to further understand what kinds of things people do and how to mitigate what they can see and to counteract what they can't. It's a lot of research. I would recommend checking out that part of it [of the paper] if you haven't done it yet. How do you approach that aspect of it?

Steve: We definitely have a good overview of how virtualization works at one point in time, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they are going to behave like real hardware. And we may do some of that with the upcoming software that we will be pushing this afternoon
