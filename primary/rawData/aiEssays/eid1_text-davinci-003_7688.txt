This line is the narrator's attempt to close the poem in an optimistic manner. The narrator appears to be indicating that they will take the test (presumably a difficult one) when things return to normal and during warmer weather when life has the promise of renewal and hope. The imagery of the snow melting and the geese returning creates a sense of optimism for the future, hinting that the difficult times will eventually end. The presence of the hibiscus, a symbol of resilience and beauty, further underscores this sentiment of hope.
