One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I saw my sister on TV and realized, "Oh my God, that was so sad!" That's when I got really sick on April 23rd. When my husband saw my daughter in a car accident that was going on and said, "Oh, God, she's dead!" I knew, "Holy shit!" I couldn't believe it at the time because someone was making something up and I was already sick on April 23rd, and I started the next day crying. That's when I realized I am a pretty normal person. That I have some good friends, and they care.

What does it feel like to go through this pain? Is it more normal and normal to deal with this?

One of the things that I've gotten up to since the accident is that my brother really needs help when he gets sick. It's not like I'm afraid. This is a normal human being who is very happy and fulfilled. As you get older, you need to try everything you can to get yourself back to normality. I hope you had a very good time! Just keep fighting.
