In Joe Kurmaski’s poem “Rough Road Ahead”, the features of the setting provide a mental and physical challenge to the cyclist. 

The poem begins with the cyclist on a hilltop, making his way “down the descent of the mountain”. This encourages isolation, as there are no other cyclists around the protagonist, making it almost a spiritual journey. The path is also rugged and uncharted, with the cyclist navigating the elements of mud, stones, and branches. These harsh conditions add another layer of difficulty for the cyclist, requiring him to be constantly alert of his surroundings to ensure his safety. 

The road ahead is also uncertain; while the cyclist is in search of a village and shelter, there are no immediate signs telling him which way to go “for miles ahead”. The unknown could be seen as another challenge, as the cyclist must be brave and believe in himself to carry him through despite facing no informed direction. 

In this poem, Kurmaski uses the features of the setting to represent the mental resilience and determination of the cyclist. As he embarks on a solitary journey across an unforgiving road, it represents a struggle for the cyclist to prove himself and to overcome the odds. By writing about the obstacles the cyclist faces, the poem encourages the reader to understand the importance of facing adversity with confidence.
