The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, in order to keep them out of open spaces within the buildings, only 3 feet tall, they had to use concrete floors in a concrete area. In contrast most buildings are built with wooden vaults. One of the biggest problems was that some floors were not built with a foundation so that it would not look very high. These were built against the brick.

A few years later, the Empire State Building was completed as part of the National Park Service Center (NPSB) and the National Endowment for the Arts dedicated its space at the top of the building to the installation of "sporting clubs," for which these clubs were accredited as sporting events. The clubs are currently only available with the permission of the City of Newark.

The third most difficult obstacle was a problem that has always plagued the use of dirigibles at the Empire State Building. Most of these were built in the 70's, after World War II because these were used in the "war on terror" that was to break up Soviet Union. This was the only dirigible designed to use a catapult to carry 2,300 tons of cargo. The other two most expensive and costly are the "f-18 Super-Missile" and the "t-60D". During the Cold War, however, these two are now used by the national museum with much of their cost being paid by the museum itself
