Dear Editor,

As the technology of computers continues to advance, I am increasingly aware of the profound effects they have on people. Itâ€™s undeniable that computers have made our lives easier in many ways. This technology has allowed us to work faster, communicate quicker, store information easier, and share media with greater ease.

However, I am concerned with the potentially detrimental effects of computers on people. They have the power to disconnect us from our physical reality, keeping us inside a virtual one. We find ourselves trapped behind a computer screen, unable to escape and interact with the world around us. Instead of striking up a conversation with strangers, we isolate ourselves online. Rather than playing outside, we watch videos on YouTube or log onto social media sites to see what our friends are up to. 

A study conducted by the University of Illinois revealed that too much computer use is linked to deleterious impacts on our mental health, as it increases stress and depression. With increased computer usage comes a less active lifestyle, resulting in physical health problems like obesity, poor posture, and leg strain.

I urge the readers of this paper to strive to find a healthy balance between the real and virtual worlds. We can achieve this by interacting with others while away from our computers, facing the outside world. Participating in outdoor activities and being actively involved in our communities will help us stay physically healthy and emotionally strong.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
