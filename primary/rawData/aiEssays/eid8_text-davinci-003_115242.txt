Iâ€™ll never forget the first time my husband and I laughed together. We had just begun dating, and had been out for dinner. I had made a joke in the middle of the meal, and he had caught on immediately and surprisingly enough, cracked a joke of his own. His joke had built on mine and was even funnier. 

We both laughed heartily until our stomachs ached and tears rolled down our cheeks. I had never experienced that kind of bond before, the kind you can only achieve through laughter. Until that moment, I hadn't realized how much I had missed it. While we might not be telling jokes all of the time, that moment of laughter gets us through tough times and serves as a reminder of the strong connection between us.
