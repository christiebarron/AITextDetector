The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In 1864, they were ordered to build at least three hundred dirigibles. Of these, one took the form of an early airplane - a steam engine - and the others an aircraft carrier. The first time they were ordered, by Louis Armstrong in 1881, the first was the first dirigible to be built without a hangar. The second was built in a modified form in 1886, but still no hangar by that time.

While a huge number of airplane pilots were required by those days to take part in the first dirigibles test, only two pilots came through the gates.

Only a handful of the first eight pilots did so in the beginning of 1874, when the first American aircraft carrier was commissioned.

On March 3, 1899, the first of these dirigibles was launched at Pearl Harbor. It contained six new aircraft, the most advanced of which was the V-8A Corsair, whose "A"-deck configuration required almost identical aircraft to be used in other dirigibles, such as the Spitfire and Star Fleet U-15 and F-22 Eagle fighters.

"It seemed strange to have seen a new aircraft, for even the most dedicated passenger pilot," explains Steve Smith, a journalist for the National Observer. "It was astonishing that the flying craft were so different, and so fast, from other aircraft, like the F-101
