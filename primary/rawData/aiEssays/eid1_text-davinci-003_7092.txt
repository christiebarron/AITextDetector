Censorship in libraries is often a controversial topic of discussion, as we struggle to balance the intellectual freedom of library patrons and the discomfort or even danger that certain materials may cause. As a result, we must carefully consider what materials should be available in our public and school libraries. 

I believe that certain books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from library shelves if they are found to be offensive. While there is immense value in libraries providing access to all kinds of information, our first priority should be to ensure the safety of our patrons. Materials that are excessively violent, sexual, or derogatory should be excluded, in order to protect vulnerable patrons. We also have a responsibility to avoid exposing people to materials that may be hurtful or damaging to their emotional, cultural, or religious values. 

Furthermore, providing access to only certain types of materials does not mean prohibiting access to all. Libraries are an incredibly diverse and wonderful source of information and entertainment, and they can provide access to different ideas, histories, and perspectives that people may not have explored before. This diversity and openness is essential to fulfilling the responsibilities of a library, and should be continued through the censorship of certain materials. 

We must take special care to ensure that our libraries are safe and open to all. By placing careful guidelines on what materials will and will not be allowed in our libraries, we can continue to embrace the rich diversity of thought and perspective that make our libraries so essential.
