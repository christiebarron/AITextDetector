An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my son, who suffered from seizures during the first few months of his life.

For me personally, the loss of a normal voice just made it worse. When I woke up every morning to a phone call from an iPhone 6 or iPhone 5, I could really hear something but it was not the sound of my son's voice being said.

In the hospital after hospital, the seizures continued for months and weeks, and even when my son got fit, we would still hear the call of his father, the person he was talking to, but without the volume and tone. And of course, if you've ever tried watching the live shows of a show like The Voice, or watching the first 15 seconds of a movie like Batman: The Brave and the Bold, or anything you're familiar with, then you knew how that thing would feel. After all, you'd just heard a conversation.

But on the same day I went to New York, my son fell ill after having a seizure in late June. We both decided to call The Voice and get on with it.

I've been working on a book called A Day in the Life of a Son. It's about a day after the seizure, when I woke up in the hospital with a seizure and a strange feeling. I could only make out his father's voice with a sharpness and clarity the size of what a human voice would make.
