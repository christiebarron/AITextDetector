My best friend and I had been hanging out one night, sharing laughs and stories until the sun went down. We had been catching up on all the events in our lives since the last time we had seen each other and it felt like no time had passed since the moment we said goodbye. 

In the midst of all the conversation, we started talking about a mutual friend who had a reputation for being incredibly dramatic. We laughed until tears started streaming down our faces as I remembered telling my friend about an insane phone conversation we had with this dramatic individual. 

We laughed even harder when my best friend impersonated the dramatic individual, mimicking well-known phrases and words they used in a way that was almost indistinguishable from the real thing. We laughed until both of our stomachs hurt and we started to choke from laughing too hard. 

That night, I felt an even deeper connection with my best friend thanks to the good laugh we shared. It was a powerful moment that made me realize how strong our friendship is, and how laughter can be the bridge that connects us.
