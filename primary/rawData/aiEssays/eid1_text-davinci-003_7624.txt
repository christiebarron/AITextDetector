The concluding line of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho is meant to convey a sense of renewal and optimism. The poem is about a young girl facing a difficult academic challenge and feeling overwhelmed by it. By ending with these lines, her feelings of inadequacy and despair are uplifted as she connects the coming of springtime with her own determination to understand and persevere through the challenge. In the poem, the hibiscus flower is symbolic of the struggles that both the girl and her family face, and by connecting her own resilience to the flower breaking through the winter and blooming in the spring, she is reminded of her own agency to tackle the challenge and gain back her strength.
