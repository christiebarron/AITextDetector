I had been friends with Sarah for years, but there was always something that held us back from getting closer. We'd hang out every once in awhile and laugh, but it never felt true or deep. She'd laugh at the things I'd say, but it always felt forced.

One summer, we decided to take a road trip together. Since I had just gotten my driver's license, I was going to do all the driving, while she navigated and inflicted her singing (or what she called singing) upon me.

At first, we were silent and tense, both of us unsure of how to act. But soon enough, we found ourselves deep in conversation and real, joyous laughter. We talked of family, friends, hopes, dreams and all the silly things that come up when two old friends reconnect. We laughed until our sides ached and we had tears rolling down our faces. 

It was then that I realized that Sarah and I could be more than just old friends. We could laugh together and truly enjoy one another's company. Now we talk and laugh almost every day, and I'm so thankful for that road trip and that moment of true laughter that changed our entire relationship.
