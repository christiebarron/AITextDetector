He would probably get paid by the headed customer and the people with him in the restaurant who he worked with before.

It was my experience in school – the other two people in my class – that I'd ask if he has used the service and what he would say. And they would agree immediately the service was in the right place. Or they would try to give the service to the student and see. They might even tell him the problem so he would act in a way that helped them with the situation.

On a more positive side, I remember at one moment I would ask to take away a service when he was on a day shift, one of our students in a restaurant or working in the city or even a school. I would ask for a tip for the service and he wouldn't get it, at that moment at least he was able to ask me what service he wanted to take. I guess because of my understanding of the system, I would say "I don't know. I know he doesn't need it." And I would even try to give it to him the exact same way I gave it to the person who gave it after me.
