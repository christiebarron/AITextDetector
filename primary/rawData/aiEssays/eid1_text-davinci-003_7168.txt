The setting in Joe Kurmaski's poem 'Rough Road Ahead' is a critical factor in understanding the situation of the cyclist. The sun is setting on a steep and winding path, and in the fading light, it is difficult for the cyclist to make their way safely. The setting emphasizes the difficulty and challenge the cyclist is facing, making the poem feel dark and daunting. The steep, winding roads are a metaphor for the difficult journey that our protagonist is undertaking, and the setting provides a vivid image of how hard and serious it will be to reach his destination.

The twist and turns of the road represent the difficulties and struggles in life, and how hard one must work to reach their goals. This is exemplified by the challenge of having to slow down on the steep roads, requiring more effort than if it were straight. Similarly, progress in life and reaching your goals often requires we take our time and persist even when it feels like no progress is being made. 

The fading light in the setting also serves to emphasize the challenge ahead - it is getting darker, and so the cyclist must move quickly to get to his destination before the light fails. The contrast between the fading light and the increasing steep and winding roads paints a vivid picture of the increasing difficulty of his task. The setting serves to highlight the challenge that the cyclist is facing, and the need for him to work hard and persevere despite the obstacles in his way.
