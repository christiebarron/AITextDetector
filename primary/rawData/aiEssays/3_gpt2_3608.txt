Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

• It changes the cyclist's view of the road and places a limit on his or her right-of-way and the number of metres left behind.

• It forces cyclists to move to a more'safe' corner if they're travelling close to them.

• It forces cyclists to move to a less safe exit so they avoid crashes.

• It's important to think about whether you have a personal bike lane – one that will allow cyclists to use the cycle path but not to fall into it.

• Other settings may affect how fast you are allowed to drive, such as where you can cross the junction, as well as the cycling-friendly'safe line' setting, one of the two 'fun-for-fun' parts of the cycle path.
