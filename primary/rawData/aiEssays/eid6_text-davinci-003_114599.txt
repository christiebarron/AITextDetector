The building of the Empire State Building was a monumental task, and it presented a unique challenge for allowing dirigibles, or large airships, to dock safely. As the tallest skyscraper in the world during its grand opening, architects and engineers needed to consider ways to make the building safely habitable for dirigibles. According to the book “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, these obstacles included finding a space to hover, creating a counterweight system, and providing airship personnel access to the mooring mast. 

The first obstacle was finding a hover space for the airships to safely rest at the summit of the Empire State Building. The mooring mast was on the highest level of the tower, and the engineers had to consider the logistics of the airships’ size, weight, and wind conditions. To solve this dilemma, the engineers constructed a level plaza with a floating deck, designed with metal grates to help the airships find a resting place.

The second obstacle to overcome was creating a counterweight system that was capable of bearing the immense pressure from the large airships. This system was essential to the safe mooring of the dirigibles. As a result, engineers invented and installed a heavy-duty cable structure, known as a “shroud,” which was securely fastened to the mooring mast and connected to four ballast cars. The cars were filled
