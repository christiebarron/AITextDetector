One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I saw an old photograph with a baby baby that I had taken when I was at the height of my late life. It had been on the wall for a long time in my apartment. I thought this was a photograph I would never forget.

I looked under it into a piece of paper with these little children and I put that photograph on the table so I could see where they were and what was going on there. It made me feel like I am seeing something real. I couldortion everything, I could figure things out in a few minutes.

At the time I thought there was another place of my life that lived in such a small way that it would have been easier to come and go if I left their world. As I think of them, it hurts a little. I would not have been able to even be there with my babies and babies would be at home.

And so I left my life in a place that would not have made any sense. I never felt the world was different or what I would have known. We would come back like children again. I will never forget that day. I will forget how I felt. I will forget seeing my little family grow up. I will think of them.

If you have never read the book, try it out for yourself. It's still about the family and the life I had in my life.
