It was the morning of my first date with the girl of my dreams. I was so nervous. I decided to take a deep breath and knock on her door. When she opened the door I couldn’t help but start to laugh. She had a giant toothbrush sticking out of the pocket of her jeans. She had a sheepish grin on her face and said, “It’s a long story…”

We laughed, and we laughed. Her laugh was so contagious it felt like I hadn’t laughed in weeks. We talked without pause for hours on end. The time flew by and soon it was time for me to leave. We hugged goodbye and I left feeling happy and content. I realized that laughter was the key to connecting and fostering a relationship.
