The setting of 'Rough Road Ahead' by Joe Kurmaski has a significant impact on the cyclist in the story. 

The most obvious feature of the setting that affects the cyclist is the terrain. As the name of the story implies, the cyclist is faced with a bumpy, dangerous road ahead. This rough terrain makes the cyclist’s journey much more difficult, as they must navigate around obstacles, navigate sharp turns and undulations, and maintain their balance on some precarious surfaces. Secondly, the climate affects the cyclist. As the story begins, they are out riding in very cold temperatures, adversely affecting their physical condition and making their limbs stiff. They must often rely on motivation and determination to overcome this challenge. 

In addition to the challenging climate, the cyclist is also facing a psychological struggle within themselves. This is reflective of the dark sky that “gave a sense of doom and despair”. The mood of the setting is an obstacle that the cyclist must try to overcome. 

The setting plays a huge role in the story, impacting the cyclist in numerous ways. The rough terrain, cold climate, and oppressive mood make for huge obstacles to be overcome. While it may seem daunting to face such challenges, ultimately, these obstacles push the cyclist in the story forward, pushing them to become stronger and more resilient.
