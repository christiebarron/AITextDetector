The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock, including designing a structure strong enough to suspend these massive flying vessels. This was a feat that had to be undertaken when the Empire State Building was first constructed in the early twentieth century, as the trend towards air travel started to pick up. As Marcia Amidon Lüsted notes in her book “The Mooring Mast”, the idea of mooring airships at the Empire State Building was first proposed by investors.

The challenge for the design team came in the form of needing to develop a safe and secure way of safely suspending the 1,000-4,000 foot dirigibles while they refueled or even stopped for the night. As such, the greatest obstacle to allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was designing a structure and mooring system. The engineers of the day had to come up with a complex engineering solution that was capable of supporting these massive ships and their payloads.

In order to accomplish such a feat, the engineering team had to consider the loads, wind course, and materials that would be needed to construct the mooring system. They also had to design an efficient and stable way of transferring passengers and cargo to and from the dirigible. Additionally, the engineers had to come up with a solution to prevent the mooring mast from swaying and breaking under the wind loads that were the result of the
