Dear Editor,

I write to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people today. In this increasingly digital world, computers have become an integral part of our lives— a tool used for communication, work, entertainment, and so much more.

While computers offer convenience and a way to do things faster, I believe that they also have potentially detrimental effects on people. The average person spends an alarming amount of time in front of a computer, whether for leisure or work-related tasks. This long-term use can lead to a decrease in physical activity, and consequently, various negative health effects, such as eye strain, carpal tunnel syndrome, and obesity.

It can also have mental health implications in that excessive use can lead to feelings of anxiety and depression. Social media platforms can make comparisons with other people’s lives formidable and cause low self-esteem. The amount of addictive video and gaming content available is incredible, leaving some people unable to disconnect from their screens.

In my opinion, computer use should be moderated and monitored. We should focus on striking a balance with other activities such as physical exercise, reading, and socializing. We should also be mindful of our online activities and remember to take breaks away from the screen.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
