It was this aspect of the setting – which has been described as 'fantastic' by one cyclist – that convinced researchers to write an article on the effect of using a road setting in the UK.

They concluded that: 'The potential benefits of using a road setting are particularly significant based on the way the cycling and walking landscape is defined, the characteristics of the road, the number of kilometres travelled, and the potential for positive feedback from a wider audience.

'Despite some initial positive and negative feedback from cycling and walkers, these results remain significant in our review and may lead to increased uptake of road-based transport decisions in the near future.

'However, it is important not to assume that the effect on the psychological responses to being on the road can be fully captured or that these responses are entirely independent of the actual environment.

'Furthermore, they represent the first direct, long-term study on the impact of any road setting of any kind on cycling and walkers, and have limitations related to their statistical power.

'The lack of an effect on cognitive ability by cycling and walking is likely to lead to further
