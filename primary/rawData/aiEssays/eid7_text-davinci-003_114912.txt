I was on a crowded bus riding to an event. After having to stand up for twenty minutes, I began to lose my patience; I had a lot of things to do so I was getting stressed with the slow ride. 

Then a woman with a stroller got on the bus and asked me to move. I was already in a bad mood, but I decided to be patient and give her some space. I stepped aside and watched as she maneuvered around the other people. I'm glad I did, because it allowed a mother and child to have a comfortable ride to their destination. 

I felt bad for thinking that my situation was worse than others, and I admired the woman's resilience. I was grateful that, in that moment, I was able to be patient and generous to another person.
