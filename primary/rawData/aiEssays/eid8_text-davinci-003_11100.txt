I was sitting in the waiting room of the doctor’s office, idly flipping through a magazine, when I heard a chuckle. Looking up, I saw another person in the room, a woman I assumed to be around my age. She noticed me glancing her way and smiled, motioning for me to come over.

Being the friendly person that I am, I went over to her, introducing myself and becoming acquainted. She told me her name was Sandy and that she’d been stuck in this room since she’d been called a half hour ago.

We started talking and, before long, we were both chuckling and later laughing together. It was nice to have a break from the monotonous waiting and the patients around us in the room and we were both lifting our spirits.

After several minutes of talking and laughter, I was called back to see the doctor. I thanked Sandy for her company and we went our separate ways—me to my appointment and her, hopefully, to hers. I’m still reminded of that afternoon whenever I laugh with someone, and it’s a feeling I hope to experience many times over.
