An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my first child. When you have children, they are always waiting for you to get that job, never waiting for that job, and that's when you have a bad start as a supervisor or leader. They are afraid. They are afraid of you. That's when you come in.

People that we have worked with and helped so many times don't realize how much harder these days actually are because you are a very hard worker. You have a very soft job and a wonderful life that you have to do in order to get to where you want to be. You can't just come out of work every day and say, well good, I know what I want to achieve.

They have no idea how you can reach where you want to be. A couple of days ago, my wife asked me what it felt like to get on a plane to America and go work with some of the top people in the world. I told her nothing was going to happen. She was so angry. She just kept telling me just let them stay, it was everything they needed to be done. It made it so hard for her to feel anything because she wanted to be the best she could be if she could just put it aside for another day or two. She still thinks those three words that go with being a leader and boss and whatever it is you're doing. But they know what they put aside to feel this way
