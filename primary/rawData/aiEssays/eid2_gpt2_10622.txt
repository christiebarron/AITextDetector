I believe that censorship of materials in libraries are of course important and must be done. However as mentioned previously many of our publications do not publish these types of articles. Also because of the amount of research which we do we cannot continue to publish these types of articles without a review.

Some of our articles

If you would like to watch some of our articles you can view them in our archive.

We have a very large number of articles on any subject that abduct some of our supporters to believe in. What we consider a serious article is one that we find extremely convincing. We ask you to view and discuss our article if it is relevant to your own interests.

We currently publish our political statements every day. Most of the time it is our political statements that are read by the public. Some of our statements are very different from those of our politicians. We do not like the fact that we have to write about issues that are politically important in different countries around the globe.

Our news sources are also very diverse. The most important news sources are in the United Nations, and most of these outlets have significant political influence.

The more news that we publish on a large scale the more people will understand that "the United Nations is a fake news organization" and we have no option but to reject their idea. We have no choice but to accept their argument through the way of the United Nations.

We make good choice when we publish our political statements
