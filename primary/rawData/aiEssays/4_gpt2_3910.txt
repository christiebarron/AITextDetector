The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it is a true read and the book doesn't end on an empty paragraph. The world is different now, but there is still hope in the world, in the life of his wife and family, and when he's gone someone will look forward and thank him, because she is alive again. There is more of the love and compassion, the generosity of his past and his love for life. This book is an attempt at a book that may not have existed because it is a journey, without a point. There is hope in this life, for he is not dead, and he has some great stories to draw from. There is some great stories to say because I read Winter Hibiscus, and there are amazing ones. Hopefully I haven't overlooked some of them.

If you have not seen the Winter Hibiscus in print, be sure to get it, it has been released in digital form for all copies, and you will get to follow this wonderful story, and so many more, and if you did, don't worry, the books will keep coming in and out. Don't know of a book that has yet to get published? Check out the book.
