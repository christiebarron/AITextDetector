I had been friends with Jane for the last two years. We had chosen to take the same classes in college, so since freshman year we had been spending a lot of our time together, both in and out of school.

We often found ourselves in some crazy situations and laughed until our sides hurt.

One night, we decided to stay up late and watch a movie. We settled on a classic slapstick comedy and couldn't stop laughing as we watched. It felt like the movie kept getting funnier and funnier.

At one point, the main character did something so ridiculous that we both burst into uncontrollable laughter. We couldn't even muster up enough energy to pause the movie. The laughter kept on and on until we finally had to pause it to catch our breath.

After we paused, we both just lay there looking at each other and laughing. We knew we should try to get some sleep, but the laughter was so contagious that we just kept going until we were both exhausted.

When everything finally calmed down, we could feel the warmth emanating from the connection we had. There was something truly special about this moment and it made me really cherish our friendship.

Laughter had brought us even closer together.
