The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. One of the primary considerations was the fact that the mooring mast had to be strong enough to withstand winds of up to eighty mph and had to remain stable during a gale. This posed a huge construction challenge, as the mast needed to be supported at the top of a 1,454-foot skyscraper, without compromising the safety of any dirigible trapped in its cable.

The designers had to also determine which type of mast to use, balancing the need for flexibility against the load of the airship. An inclined mast was chosen, with angled arms to provide additional support and larger cable to support the airships. The entire mast structure had to be designed in such a way that it did not interfere with any other parts of the building, such as elevators and stairwells.

The process of securing the cable to the mast presented yet another obstacle. Because of the heavy winds, the cable had to be securely fastened to the mast, while also able to absorb the strain put on it from a large airship. To achieve this, the builders used steel wires, burying them deep below the surface of the mooring mast. 

Finally, the builders had to take into consideration the limited space on the roof of the Empire State Building for a docking station. Ultimately, the docking station was composed of two mooring
