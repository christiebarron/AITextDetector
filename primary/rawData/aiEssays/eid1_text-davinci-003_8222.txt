The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of obstacles when considering allowing dirigibles to dock at the building. When the building was constructed in the early 1930s, it was designed with the intention of making the structure capable of mooring dirigibles. However, a variety of issues had to be addressed in order to make this feat possible. 

One challenge was the design of the mast towering over the skyscraper. While it had to be strong enough to support the weight of a large airship, it also had to be able to retract quickly if a strong gust of wind occurred. In addition, the shape of the mast had to work with the air currents that existed around the building. As outlined in “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, designer William Lamb proposed the innovative solution of making the mast into the shape of an airfoil. This allowed air to flow around the mast smoothly, as it did with an airplane wing.

The Empire State Building’s mooring mast also had to have a way for the ships to attach to it. To accomplish this, two lines were hung from the top of the mast and a large basket was affixed to the building’s wall. This basket contained metal loops for the lines to hook onto. Often, the captains of the dirigibles had a difficult time navigating the lines and capturing the loops.
