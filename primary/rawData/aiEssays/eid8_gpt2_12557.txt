One time I experienced laughter in my life was when a guy was playing video games to his sister at school. I didn't know what flickering eyes were and I just smiled into my camera. One time the girl stood in my school courtyard and said to me, "You're really cool. No school or anything." I said no, but she did. They knew she wasn't a fan of video games which makes it much easier to smile too.

I was a part of a project I did and loved and wanted to build from the ground up. I love working with artists in the field of working with graphic design so I wanted people to play around with my idea, figure out a way to build something, make some adjustments and then play with it.

Did you ever hear a designer say that games are the easiest thing, or were they maybe more like "the fun stuff"?

Sofía Rodriguez (@Sofía_Rodriguez) I love video games. You just have to realize that when you have a person's imagination, if the game is a little easier, it isn't always easy to work together – it's always hard both ways.

What was the hardest to come by as a creative director?

Sofía Rodriguez (@Sofía_Rodriguez) One thing that gets lost when you start making games is all the creative time and all the time in which we have to do it. No one makes games.
