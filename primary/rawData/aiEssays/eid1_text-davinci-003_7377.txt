In his poem ‘Rough Road Ahead’, Joe Kurmaski paints a vivid picture of a cyclist’s journey. The cyclist faces several obstacles, both physical and emotional. The features of the setting affect the cyclist’s experience throughout the poem.

The rural road that the cyclist is travelling is described as “rough”, likely indicating that the surface is uneven. The road is described as “narrow” and “snaking”, making it more difficult to navigate due to its lack of straightness. Together, these two features create a sense of difficulty for the cyclist and contribute to the challenge of the journey.

The setting is also described as “desolate” and “barren”, suggesting that the cyclist is travelling alone. This loneliness is further emphasised by the fact the only form of wildlife mentioned is “scavenging crows”, emphasising the desolate nature of the environment. This serves to increase the sense of emotional difficulty the cyclist is experiencing, as they are reminded that they are alone on their journey.

The “sunset’s murky glow” further enhances the sense of difficulty the cyclist is experiencing. This provides a sense that the cyclist is facing their struggles in a difficult environment, as the sunset implies the end of a long day and the onset of darkness.
