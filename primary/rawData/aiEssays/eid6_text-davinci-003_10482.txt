The construction of the Empire State Building in New York City in the early 1930s posed an interesting challenge – namely, allowing dirigibles, or large, blimp-style airships, to dock at the top of the building. The potential for dirigibles to link distant cities together signaled a change in travel that excited many engineers and innovators. Despite the allure of use of dirigibles for transportation, the obstacles to allow them to dock at the Empire State Building were significant, illustrating the immense emphasis on safety, structural integrity, and sheer ingenuity required to design a large-scale project.

The first obstacle faced by the builders of the Empire State building was figuring out a practical and secure way to construct the mooring mast. The mast would be the vertical metal frame to which dirigibles would dock, making the height (791 feet) and strength of the mast particularly important. To secure both the mast and the airship when attached, engineers had to develop a way to attach the cables connecting the ship to the mast directly to the building. Through innovation, the engineers created a type of clip known as the ‘Thearle Clip’, which was secured to the inside of the Empire State Building so as to provide stability against the strong downwash created from the ship’s propulsion system. 

A second challenge that construction workers faced was providing a safe harbor for the dirigibles once docked. To do this, the
