Because people were so dependent on their transportation modes for their life, the Empire State Building provided a constant source of power.

This allowed them to avoid air pollution that would cause them to lose their ability to maintain their health while living in the city.

In general, energy savings were not a good thing, as it forced people to live a life with minimal energy use. People also had to use gasoline, which was unreliable but had a small amount of benefits. However, it proved that living on a rooftop was not necessarily a good option when the building was in a climate that was a place that could be used for energy saving. In other words, if only the roof was there that there was less energy to use, those people would eventually lose their homes.
