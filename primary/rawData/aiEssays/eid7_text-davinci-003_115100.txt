I was helping a coworker to move some boxes in the back room of our office when one of the boxes slipped from his hands and dropped to the ground. Immediately, my coworker started to panic saying that he was sure he had broken something inside. I knew I had to act quickly to calm him down, so I took a deep breath and reminded him that no matter what, we would find a way to fix it.

Rather than get angry or express frustration, I calmly spoke to him and reminded him of our resources. I helped him slowly unpack the box to see what was damaged, and while we only found a few minor scratches on some of items, I was proud of myself for staying so patient through the whole ordeal.

I had to remember to stay patient, and in turn my coworker followed my lead, bringing down the intensity of the moment. In the end, my patience helped us work together to get through the situation and come up with a solution.
