Computers have many effects on people. We can make a difference, and these can be pretty disruptive if we're talking to them all the time."

The big question is how much of an effect the technologies could have on technology or culture.

Nathan C. Rabinowitz, a computer architecture professor at Virginia Tech's Computer Science and Engineering Institute, has studied the impact of "smart contracts" on the IT-futures world for years, writing several papers in his spare time that seem to suggest that such a thing could have a huge impact on computing. "It's a hard question to answer based entirely on theory, so it's not something that's even a possibility," Rabinowitz says.

"In other words, do smart contracts create more problems than they solve? No," he continued.

"If you're going to design a digital world full of a lot of weird things happening in different ways, which are more and more disruptive, how do we fix those issues?"
