I believe that censorship of materials in libraries, radio stations, television stations, libraries, and other publicly accessible places in India has more to do with the state of India's economy than with the right of individuals and corporations in public life to say that their ideas must be disseminated out of fear for their own and that their ideas must not be seen by other people.

What is the law enforcement's response to these threats? I understand that these are some of the topics discussed in the previous article. But my point, with respect to how to interpret these statements or those of others in the public sphere is that I do not intend to draw any conclusions from them. I focus first on the facts.

A well respected law enforcement agency is doing its part through training and awareness training to law enforcement agencies in various areas of policing, and I do want to mention that by the end of this article, all of these agencies will have received training in various areas, as well as in various aspects of their work, and have even provided written reports to the government to provide a better understanding of the situation. (A case in point is a statement posted by the National Intelligence Agency of April 29, 2014, in a report to Parliament's Investigatory Powers and Procedures Committee which stated: "India's intelligence agencies do not have any legal obligation to make any such statements to their respective governments. If these statements are made to their police counterparts, the responsibility falls wholly with the relevant security services).
