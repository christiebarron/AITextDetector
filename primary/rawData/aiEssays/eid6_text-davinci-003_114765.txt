When the Empire State Building was constructed in early 1931, it was built with the intention of allowing dirigibles to dock on the top of the building. This bold engineering feat was made possible by constructing a 200-foot tall mooring mast, aptly named the Empire State Building Mooring Mast. Despite the potential of this exciting advancement, several challenges and obstacles soon surfaced which prevented dirigibles from ever docking safely at the Empire State Building.

To begin with, there was a safety concern: dirigibles had difficulty navigating the strong winds that blew through New York Cityâ€™s skyscrapers. In order to ensure the dirigibles could safely dock and take off, they had to fly below the level of the buildings, creating a safety hazard for people and property on the ground. To combat this issue, engineers redesigned the mooring mast with the intention of allowing dirigibles to approach the mast from a higher altitude and then fly down into a pocket of stable air between the tower and the building. However, when dirigibles tried to approach the mooring mast in this manner, the concentrated updraft of air created by the Empire State Building caused the dirigibles to drift towards the building instead of the mast.

This issue would have proven difficult enough, but further complications arose when a system of tethers had to be designed to physically anchor each dirigible. Once a dirigible had been safely maneuvered towards the mooring mast,
