As I rounded the corner, I was expecting to see my friend Helen, but instead I saw her doubled over, laughing hysterically. I was immediately confused and concerned, not knowing what was so funny. I slowly walked towards her, concerned that maybe something had gone wrong.

When I got close enough to her, I asked her what she was laughing at. She pointed to the wall behind me and said “Look!”

Reflexively, I turned around to see what had her in stitches. When I saw it, though, I couldn’t help but laugh too. There was a giant poster on the wall, with a picture of a cute, fuzzy puppy and the caption “Life is Ruff!”

We were both laughing so hard at this silly pun that eventually we had to hug each other to keep from tumbling to the ground. After that, we were inseparable. Laughing together became a regular part of our friendship, and I'm forever grateful for that silly little moment that showed me how much joy a friendship can bring.
