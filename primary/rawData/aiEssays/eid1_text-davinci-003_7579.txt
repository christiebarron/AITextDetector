The ending of Minfong Ho’s “Winter Hibiscus” is the narrator’s hopeful musing about a time when she can take the “test” again in the future. The “test” symbolizes the challenge of embracing her identity and making decisions about the future based on her values and what is important to her. The imagery of the hibiscus budding, the snow melting, and the geese returning reflects the beauty and freshness of a new beginning that the narrator can experience when she takes the “test” again. The narrator’s hopeful musing reflects her belief that she can make decisions that honor who she is, despite any obstacles she may face with her immigration status.
