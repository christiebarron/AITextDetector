Dear Editor,

As the world advances rapidly in technology, computers have become integral in both the professional and personal lives of many people. These devices are pervasive and offer amazing capabilities; however, I feel that the use of computers has led to more negative than positive effects. I believe it is important to realize the risks of excessive reliance on computers before they become an issue.

Firstly, computer usage has caused people to focus less on other important activities, such as exercise and social interaction. This can lead to physical and mental health issues in the long run. Additionally, it has been seen that people can have a hard time distinguishing the bounds of reality, as digital content can often be taken as factual even if it is not.

On the other hand, computers can be used as a way to better understand the world. Through internet access and research, people have the opportunity to explore different topics and expand their horizons. Moreover, computers have been credited for thrusting the world into a new era of digital communication.

Having explored all of the effects computers have on people, I believe that while their use can have a positive impact, the downsides deserve more attention. People must be aware of the signs of dependency if they wish to reap the rewards of technology without any of the risks.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
