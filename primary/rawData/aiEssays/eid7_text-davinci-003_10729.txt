I'd never been an especially patient person until I had to spend some time with my sick grandmother in the hospital. Normally, I'm a pretty impatient person. I don't like waiting, and I get easily irritated when things don't go my way. 

But I knew that being patient was one of the best things I could do to help my grandma. Despite the fact that she was in pain, she remained calm. She didn't complain about her illness or anything else, and she seemed to remain optimistic and even cheerful.

Watching her, I was inspired to draw on her strength. I learned to take things one moment at a time. I consciously held back my instincts to be frustrated when the nurses were slow, or when there was some complication. Instead, I just stayed quiet, held my grandmother's hand, and told her that everything was going to be ok.

It wasn't an easy thing to do, but I'm grateful I was able to cultivate some patience and learn something from my grandmotherâ€™s example. In the end, we were able toget her through the worst of her illness and back to her home.
