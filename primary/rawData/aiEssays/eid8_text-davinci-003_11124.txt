I remember the first time my husband and I laughed together. We had been together for a few months and were still getting to know each other. We were both very shy, so it was difficult to find things to talk about. 

One Saturday afternoon, we were sitting together on our sofa watching a movie. As the movie went on, I made some funny comment about one of the characters' actions and glanced at my husband out of the corner of my eye.

In an instant, he started to laugh. I could tell he was trying to stop it because he turned his head away from me, but I could still hear the sound of joy in his throat. It was the sweetest sound.

Encouraged by his reaction, I made another comment and this time both of us broke into a laughter fit that lasted a few minutes. We were both in tears from laughing so much!

But in that moment, something in the air changed. It was like a barrier had been broken down between us. We knew then that we could laugh together and share stories, and that we'd be okay. 

That moment of laughter between us is one that will stay with me forever. It was the start of a beautiful relationship and I'm so grateful to have shared it with my husband.
