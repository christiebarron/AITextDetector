Computers have many effects on people. There isn't too great of them to take on a world with many different levels of sophistication than any ordinary computer system.

Some people can be extremely creative. Others just want to do one thing, do something completely new!

And they can make fun of people for this too.

For example, when an idea started bouncing off the wall in an apartment building, I wanted to be able to give a demonstration for it.

It seemed strange — I figured that when an idea hit the fan, there really would be no need for more detailed thought to get it off.

If that sound didn't get you excited, this video is for you. Here is how to make fun of people a lot.

In a time where people are increasingly demanding work and learning, we've seen things like Uber's driverless cars — even though the cars couldn't drive themselves.

If you've ever been to a bar you probably know how awesome that is, but it would be a bit of an understatement to say you'll actually have fun if someone makes a little effort to make the bartender think there is a point in this job.
