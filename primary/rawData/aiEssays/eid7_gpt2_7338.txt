An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when the surgeon asked me if he knew how to open an appendix for the first five years of life, if he saw any signs of infection at all. He was extremely patient and didn't think he would be able to take it off with another surgeon or the specialist until it would be ready. In that kind of situation patients should not be made to believe that all they need is a surgeon.


And that is what I think today's doctors and others are now doing. I think there is something to be said for treating the conditions of people who are in their later 30s who need an appendix for only the first five years. But when it comes time to start in the field of medicine, I think now is a time that we have much more respect and courage to fight that as well as those who need a doctor's appointment.
