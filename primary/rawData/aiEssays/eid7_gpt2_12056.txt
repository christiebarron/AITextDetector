An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when we went to the funeral service for a man who had been shot three times in the head. He was pronounced dead at that spot as he rolled outside his apartment.

He got out, got on the subway, ran. He came in a few minutes later. He saw what his mother was going through, and she couldn't stop crying because she was afraid and didn't know where to turn.

He said he was sitting in the grocery store on the Upper East Side on the morning of the gun battle.

All he could see was a man lying prone in the street. The man who had shot him, of course, was dead one minute later.

So why would anyone do these kinds of things when they were in the same position as a man they didn't want to be with?
