The Empire State Building in New York City has long been an incredible engineering feat and a symbol of success for its builders and architects. One of the unique challenges these builders faced was in developing a viable plan to allow dirigibles—massive airships of the 1920s and 1930s—to dock at the top of the building. In Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s book The Mooring Mast, she outlines the obstacles and complex solutions the builders had to develop in order to make this a reality.

The most obvious and difficult issue that needed to be addressed was the climate. In the winter, high winds and icy conditions would be dangerous for the crew and passengers of the dirigibles, as well as the structure of the building itself. To protect against this, the builders had to come up with a way to keep the uppermost deck of the building enclosed and thermally regulated. To achieve this, lean-to structures were built onto the mooring masts which added a wind and rain screen, and provided a heated docking space. Additionally, the designers had to work around the existing sky lobby of the building and develop a new docking space on the 85th floor which included a mammoth arch and a mixture of cables and chains which could firmly secure the lower portion of the dirigible when it docked.

Other considerations which had to be accounted for included the type of fuel the dirigibles would be using, as well as the impact of m
