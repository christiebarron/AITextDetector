Dear Editor:

As technology rapidly evolves, so too do the effects it has on society. The spread of computer usage can be seen everywhere, with computers now an integral part of our everyday lives. While computers have advanced our society in various ways, there has been some concern about their effect on people.

While computers have undeniably been beneficial for us, some fear the adverse effects they have brought about. For example, increased computer usage has been linked to an increased risk of sedentary lifestyle, obesity, and chronic pain. There are also concerns over potential addiction, especially among younger generations.

Having said that, the consensus of opinion is that computers should be used in controlled doses. Doing so allows us to take advantage of the advantages that computers have to offer, while mitigating any potential harm. Indeed, constant computer use may lead to feelings of isolation, depression, or extreme stress. It is therefore important to monitor computer usage and ensure that those exposed to computers have access to other social activities.

Overall, it is clear that computers have a significant impact on our society. With this in mind, it is key to ensure proper usage in order to reap the benefits and avoid the potentially detrimental effects.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
