I was on a first date with a man I had started talking to a few weeks ago. We had both been nervous about meeting up, but after some initial awkwardness, we had really hit it off. We were talking about our favorite movies and things we found funny when an ambulance happened to drive by on the street just outside the restaurant. 

The next thing I knew, we were both laughing hysterically at the absurdity of the situation. We looked at each other in amazement, both aware that we had just shared an incredible moment. 

The laughter had brought us even closer together, and it felt like it had broken off the last of the tension that had been holding us back. We ended up talking for hours that night and I had the best time.

Laughter can really bring two people together. I'm glad to say that this first date wasn't our last.
