The author ends Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho with this line to emphasize the idea that, although it may seem like a long time until the warmer weather returns and the hibiscus blooms again, it is a perfectly acceptable amount of time to wait before taking the test again. The line indicates to the reader that although the protagonist may be discouraged now, they will have the energy and motivation to attempt the test again when the snows melt and the geese return. This serves as a reminder to the reader that although setbacks are discouraging, it is important to look to the future with optimism.
