The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The building remained privately owned until its 1875 acquisition, which led to the construction of the Empire State Building. The building's two main towers were built in the 1920s. While some of the tower's exterior walls remain intact, the exterior brick was severely damaged in the fall of 1924.

With the demise of the Empire State Building and its subsequent collapse following the collapse of the Empire State Building, the building was taken over by private investors in 1923.

The building's exterior was largely built of new granite with a lower elevation of 4,020 feet. Some new windows were installed in the early 1930s, in addition to new structural and technical improvements made to the building's floor plans and roof. A large number of new buildings along with the Empire State Building were built between 1940 and the 1950s.

The Empire State Building may have remained in a state housing structure until the death of Alexander Kornbluh on March 15, 2006. His coffin was moved to a location on New York Street, where he was declared dead on June 17, 2012.
