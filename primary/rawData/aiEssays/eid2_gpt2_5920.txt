I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is essential to preventing violent terrorism. I believe that the state should consider censorship on university campuses where those of us who have used those facilities have been confronted by violent extremists. I will call upon Congress to reject censorship in the United States in order to protect the American people from future terrorist attacks."In a statement released by a pro-Trump, pro-Trump PAC supporting Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), McCain wrote:If you were watching TV last night I'm sure you noticed that Senator McCain and his group are attacking an event by the Islamic State. So my question is why it's being attacked?"McConnell responded, "I would like to ask for a second question. I have been asked this before, in support of civil rights, for example. It's not just about the Constitution or what the Constitution says, but it's about defending these liberties. The Constitution and how it says that we have to protect those rights is clearly violated."When asked, McCain pointed to an issue that he does not agree with."How does this impact American life," McCain said, "I think it affects the lives of many Americans."
