The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because of its depiction of ancient Greeks living long after the collapse of the Roman Empire.

"I think that there is so much going on behind the scenes, but you can't read it without doing some research at home," Miroff says. "There are hundreds of pages of information out there, written and typed at the same time that we're writing."

And the book isn't just written by Miroff and other authors looking to replicate what they've seen in the Bible.

"We used to make people wonder," Miroff says. "Who was Jesus Christ and who did he mean?"

Miroff has Pikachu, who was once an ancient woman but lost her virginity at the age of 10. She had the boy circumcised in an effort to prevent a miscarriage and later died without her knowledge.

"I do love the fact that we were able to work with this culture, so to say, 'Wow, this is what we're doing and that's why we're doing it now,'" Miroff says. "You can't turn around and say that."

The book, which is the last known manuscript that shows a boy named Jesus Christ, is the latest in a tradition of biblical illustrations that use ancient characters and places to suggest that Christianity was dead before Christ took down the empire.
