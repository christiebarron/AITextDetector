As we know, libraries provide a shared resource of knowledge that is crucial to our educational and cultural lives. Unfortunately, with the relative freedom to access information comes a host of potential issues, including censorship. At the heart of this debate lies the argument of whether or not certain materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves in libraries if they are deemed offensive. As the issue of censorship continues to be fiercely contested, I am strongly of the opinion that libraries should not succumb to current trends of censorship and instead provide access to a wide variety of materials without fear or judgement. 

The censorship of materials in libraries is a slippery slope, and one that could cascade into more dangerous consequences than intended. Libraries should reflect the rich variety of cultures and viewpoints from around the world; they should strive to be diverse in their offerings in order to give students and patrons the opportunity to educate themselves on varied topics. Shelves should not be cleared simply because they may be deemed offensive; instead, libraries should encourage thoughtful dialogue between those of all viewpoints. Building an open and welcoming space for learning and discussion is the best way to foster an understanding of different opinions. 

Furthermore, removing certain materials from the shelves of libraries in the name of censorship can, ironically, lead to an environment of ignorance and repression. While not all material needs to be accessible to all patrons, banning materials entirely instead of presenting them in a responsible way not only leads to narrow-mindedness
