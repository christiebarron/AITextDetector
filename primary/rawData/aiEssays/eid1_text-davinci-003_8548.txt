 

I once had a good friend who was extremely patient. We had been best friends for five years, and over that time, I had often seen him be patient with others.

One particular incident that sticks out in my mind was when my friend's car broke down on the side of the road. We had been out shopping and it was getting late. He calmly accepted the situation and worked to figure out a solution. He called a tow truck and waited for its arrival. When the tow truck finally did arrive, we found out that it was going to be a while before it was time for the car to be taken in for repairs. Not once did my friend complain about the situation, despite its inconvenience. 

My friend's patience was really inspiring. He showed his care and understanding in the face of an inconvenient situation that was out of our control. His patience was really admirable and I continue to look up to him as an example of what it means to be patient.
