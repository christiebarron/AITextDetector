One time I experienced laughter in my life was when it was coming out on my lips. I was like, "Whoa, you're kidding" and you have no idea what you're talking about." I thought it was funny and so did I. I had no idea what I was talking about. I thought I was joking and that made me a little happier because when you say someone a is who they are and that person is the one who talks about what they are, what they're doing is funny, so sometimes, you see a little bit of that innate joy inside that person, but the rest is self defense; you know, you're not thinking like that so when you do say, "You have to take care of that," you're being self defense. There's a reason they're self defense.

[Laughs]

So how do you think you could use self defense against a man who does have his ego at his chest? (laughs)

I think your ego isn't going to be there. It's going to be there. Right now, it's probably a more important thing to be able to say no, and it's one of the reasons I believe I did that. Everybody is smarter than me. All of us have a point of view on some things, so having a point of view on some things doesn't necessarily mean you're not smart. But it does get you the respect you need, which means you're kind of honest
