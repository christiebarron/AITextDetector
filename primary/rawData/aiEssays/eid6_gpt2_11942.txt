The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. To prevent this difficulty, all new planes must fit on the same horizontal plane. Some companies even chose not to include the front of the plane for their own sake. The Empire Center for New York, for instance, had to use an additional vertical plane for a passenger seat and could do with a large vertical plane for a back seat only. Newer airplanes would be easier to place on, a fact that makes a considerable difference to those who would like to dock new planes.

The new vertical planes, once again, would be placed in a horizontal or straight horizontal position, making some horizontal and others straight. However, because the planes were mounted above each other—thus making them more open and allowing new planes with a smaller diameter to enter the building—they were generally less rigid than originally thought, because they were mounted to the same horizontal plane. They also could carry more passengers.

The new vertical planes would also have more interior space and also could keep many aircraft afloat by using only the vertical plane as a bridge.

The designers proposed a number of solutions, in particular an upper- and lower-level level structure. Many of these proposals include lower-level vertical surfaces that would create two-level and a fifth level structure. Some companies, notably American Aviation in the mid-1950s, attempted to develop the upper-level vertical dimensions in
