Censorship is a touchy subject, but it is an issue that needs to be addressed in libraries regarding the availability of materials. Clearly, certain materials should not be available in libraries if they are found offensive; however, the decision to remove this material should not be made lightly. 

First and foremost, libraries serve as vessels for knowledge, providing a plethora of resources for people of all ages and backgrounds. When librarians decide to censor a material, even if they feel that it is for the best, it limits the ability of others to access information. Despite questionable content, it is every personâ€™s right to make their own decisions about what materials they would like to consume. 

It is understandable that certain materials should be deemed inappropriate for a family-centric, educational environment; however, simply removing them from the shelves will not prevent people from seeking them out elsewhere. Instead, libraries should prioritize providing resources and guidance for adults and children to make informed decisions about the materials they choose to consume. This includes providing prominent notice about the nature of certain materials, in addition to offering educational resources that outline the potential risks and consequences of viewing or consuming them. 

In short, libraries have the obligation to provide a safe and inclusive environment for everyone. However, they should not be in the business of preventing individuals from accessing information or materials. Librarians should use their discretion when it comes to censoring materials, and should strive to provide resources and guidance
