The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because there is a lot of emotion in the book. It begins the way it does, it's so different from the one books like This Is All Happening and Here We Go. For the most part, the tone and characters in this book are much less dark than in the one books that we saw. So I think I'll enjoy it.

Do you think the fans of The Last Jedi, or those of Intelligent Design, or both of them, should buy The Last Jedi if it's a followup sequel?

I find it very interesting because this book really doesn't end all that well. If you saw this book, then there is some hope of a sequel in this book. But it doesn't end well. There are a lot of things I have to fix with this book. For instance, the whole time my character is talking about how he will never be seen again (for example, with a woman he was dating). And you know, if that person is really evil then he'll do this to her too, you know? So I don't necessarily like that. I really do like that there is hope and hope and hope. It is a very real possibility in their situation. It is something that I hope they will do as well as the other books do. But as for the sequels, I love them.

How did you get here? Was it a question of what direction you want
