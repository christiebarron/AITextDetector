The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

To start with, you had to sign a pledge, which included having your name on any and every single deed you could find, a commitment to a few specific projects, and a few specifics you could include in your plans.

Your pledge must be made before August 7th, 2016 to get the permit and the right to use the building. Thereafter, this gets all you have to do:

Send your pledge to info@thecarpenters.com - we need to learn more about your project

- we need to learn more about your project Request a public hearing, or go to event.cityofchapel.com/event if you have a public comment

If you want to submit your ideas, send a check and get involved (or have any idea you think could be done in advance) by donating a small amount.

Then you can work in our community and make your dream come true, or you could just hang out, work on a project and make more money.
