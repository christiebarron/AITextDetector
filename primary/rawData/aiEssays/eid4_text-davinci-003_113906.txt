The author, Minfong Ho, wants to emphasize the idea of rebirth and renewal. The hibiscus flower symbolizes strength and resilience, and the fact that it comes back each spring reinforces this idea. By ending the poem with the protagonist planning to retake the test in the spring, Ho suggests that the protagonist is ready to start anew and that the challenges she faced in the past will make her stronger and better prepared for future ones.
