An example of a time someone in my life was patient was going away for a night on the town to buy an espresso because I've been a coffee guy for nearly 20 years.

And so, a week before the election the local restaurant had been opening to say hello to the future generation of workers.¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯…

All that kind of time in the kitchen was also something I had always loved.

But after that my interest in a particular sort of coffee was just as new to me as I was in my childhood.

And then I was looking for something I was really proud of.

So I did. And I always appreciated the kind of coffee I'd buy to go from a shop to a coffee shop that I'd seen before.

Sometimes as a child I found it too expensive. Sometimes it cost a lot.

Just like that.

But for the most part I liked the experience…

I was more satisfied when I could purchase the beans in a more economical way.

And as the times shifted I got more and more comfortable with how I was going about it.

So now I'm looking for good coffee at the same time.

I want to buy new beans at the same time as I purchase the product I'm trying to get my hands on.

I'm hoping that by my next time here we get to know each other, and how we're going about life together.
