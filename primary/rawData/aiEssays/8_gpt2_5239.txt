One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I started writing for a magazine magazine and realized it was a huge deal. I never expected people to understand that this is a book I'm excited to share with you. It is truly inspiring that you are so supportive of our mission, and with the help of your readers and your colleagues we can continue developing our books and products.

The authors are on hand for a panel discussion, with the audience discussing a new concept called "The First 3D Space Age," a timeline of all future human civilizations that have existed for 100 thousand years.

"What we are trying to do is offer a possible alternate history and timeline in which people live and die, and you can imagine, for example, what would happen if people were killed in action or if their civilizations were destroyed by nuclear weapons.

The space age begins in 2020.
