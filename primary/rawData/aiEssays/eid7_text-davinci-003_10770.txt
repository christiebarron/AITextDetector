I was waiting in line at the grocery store for what felt like forever. There were only two lanes open and the line behind me was growing and growing. Everyone around me seemed to be grumbling and complaining about the wait. But I just kept my cool. 

When it was finally my turn, the cashier was having some technical difficulties. She was working as fast as she could, but we had to wait for her supervisor to come over and help. Again, I could hear a few complaints around me, but I kept my patience. 

When the supervisor finally came to help, I was able to finish my transaction and be on my way in no time. Despite the wait, I was thankful that the cashier and supervisor were doing their best to help. In the end, I got what I needed and was able to get on with my day.
