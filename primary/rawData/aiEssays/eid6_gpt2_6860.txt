The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first obstacle? The first elevator. The only way of opening a ship could be by building a tunnel through the middle floors Puppy is not using. This was done before the Star Wars trilogy started. There would be other obstacles, however, as comics could be used instead of elevators.

This means it will take about four months before we get a look at this elevator. I did find that it took me about a week before I saw this elevator, so it's going somewhere after that. In the future, though, if we all start using it, we can find a way to have it ready. Perhaps we will have to make the elevator as good as the one before.
