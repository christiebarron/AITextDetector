The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' was not only positive but beautiful. She added, 'There is no room for negativity, since you are a real person and have seen so much.'

The book took place about two years prior to the first interview with Taylor's mother and was written by Taylor co-producer Tim Anderson.
