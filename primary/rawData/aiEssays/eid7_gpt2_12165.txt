An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I went to school in my late fifties and was a member of the board or an internist at some organization or other. And all that time that I was there a lot I was depressed and in denial about the fact that I had my career. When I got out of the labor force I found it much happier to be part of a good culture or just to be an employee and I learned to take advantage of the opportunities that came with them. That's really how these days I have a job that I get paid to be available as I am, whereas I'm getting paid to go out and work for a small company on low pay because I'm sick sick. Now, it's not like I actually have any personal savings, it's I'm not actually doing any charitable work, it's there for my children or anything to do with that. I just do it so the people on that staff don't have to deal with it.

And my hope is to do that with people I work with or with students that are students or teachers or teachers that are the young people I want to work with, not just so they can understand that I'm here and that I'm doing what I wanna do and we'll probably get there.
