The Empire State Building was the most prestigious skyscraper in the world when it was built in 1931. It was also the tallest building in the world at the time, and its designers had a unique vision of allowing dirigibles—a form of airship—to dock on its top. However, creating a permanently functional mooring mast for a dirigible to dock at the Empire State Building proved to be a complex problem.

The first obstacle was engineering the mooring mast to fit the Empire State Building, as it was designed to be a purely ornamental feature and not an effective air dock. Designers had to shape the mast to fit the curves of the building, make it stronger than a standard mast to hold the dirigible, and also make sure it wouldn’t be obstructive to the view of potential occupants. In addition, they had to ensure that the cables used to secure the dirigible to the mast were strong enough to withstand the tremendous wind pressure at the altitude of the Empire State Building.

The second obstacle was the cost of the project. The Empire State Building was an expensive venture, and the utility of an air dock wasn’t an immediate priority to its owners. The cost of creating the mast was estimated to be $2 million—an enormous sum at the time—and the building’s owners couldn’t justify spending such a sum on the feature. As a result, the mooring mast was never
