Libraries have always been a staple of public education, offering citizens access to literature, music, movies, magazines, and other materials in order to foster a more informed society. Unfortunately, in recent years, libraries have found themselves in the midst of a censorship controversy, as certain materials may be deemed offensive by certain individuals or groups. The question then arises: should libraries remove certain materials from their shelves if they are deemed offensive? 

My answer is a resounding “no.” Censorship of materials in libraries is a clear violation of free speech and limits the right of citizens to access any type of material of their choosing. The American Library Association Code of Ethics states that “Librarians should resist all encroachments upon the right of individuals to read, seek, and receive information.” By removing certain materials from libraries, the public is denied access to ideas and perspectives that could lead to a better understanding of the world around them. 

Censorship of materials is also counterproductive. By trying to censor content that some people may find offensive, libraries risk drawing attention to the material in question and actually expanding its readership. By leaving certain materials on their shelves, libraries create a climate that allows for more educated debate and civil discussion about controversial topics. This gives citizens the opportunity to develop their own opinions and understanding of the materials in question, rather than being denied access to them altogether. 

In short, censorship in libraries goes against
