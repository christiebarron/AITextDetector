The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it takes inspiration from the history of English, a cultural phenomenon that has persisted since the middle ages.

And with that, I present to you my interpretation of another, quite old, and much more familiar, historical myth.

It begins when Edward V makes his way to London, intending to discover the secret of the Kingdom of England and make a return to his homeland, the Holy Land. He finds it is not a castle; it is on the east coast of Africa. It is at the sea, where he meets his family upon the return from his journey. The Queen of England tells him Yates has arrived at the palace and is looking for him. In order to complete his journey, the King sends a second messenger to a certain queen in Africa, in order to find the Holy Land.

And yet you can imagine the delight — as a writer of a book with such a rich, imaginative history — in what you are seeing through Edward's eyes when he reads this book.

And the one thing I think makes this book even more fascinating would be the book is a sequel or two to the new Edward V: It's a Novel about a Time War. We've known for most of our history that the English Empire took part in World War II. There are some people today who take the war as seriously as I am. I'm still not sure what that meant.
