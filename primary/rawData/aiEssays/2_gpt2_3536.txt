I believe that censorship of materials in libraries and museums would hurt academic freedom. For many people, this means they're afraid to take part in these proceedings.

The situation is so bad that the University Library Association recently asked libraries to limit the number of non-literary books available in its libraries in areas that are heavily censored. In response, libraries have shut down over 700 libraries.

There are dozens of other examples of what people are doing to protest government censorship of speech online.
