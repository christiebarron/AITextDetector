I still remember it like it was yesterday. I was at a party with my friends, and it was one of those dreaded awkward silences. Everyone had seemingly run out of topics to talk about and I could feel the silence stretching on into eternity.

Suddenly, a science joke came into my mind so I decide to start the joke, even though I secretly had no idea how it ended. I was just about to deliver the punchline when, instead of laughing, everyone just stared at me with bemused expressions. 

At that moment, I felt my face growing hot and I was on the brink of giving up, when my best friend interrupted my thoughts. She spontaneously broke into a fit of laughter and, predictably, the entire room followed suit. 

It was probably one of the most embarrassing moments of my life, but it was also an amazing moment. Seeing everyone burst into laughter brought a warmth to my heart that has stuck with me ever since.

Laughter really is the shortest distance between two people.
