One of the times I have been most patient was when I expected a package in the mail one morning and it had not arrived by the end of the day. I was a bit disappointed, but I chose to be patient and understanding. I trusted that the package was on its way and that it would arrive soon. 

The next day, the package still was not there. I kept trusting that it would soon arrive and tried to practice patience. I kept thinking that the package had likely experienced some delays and that it would come eventually. I re-read the order receipt and noticed that the shipping process could take up to 10 days, so I knew I have to stay patient. 

By the 11th day, the package had still not arrived. I was feeling a bit frustrated, but I chose to stay patient and trusting. I reminded myself that there many reasons why packages get delayed: bad weather, postal system errors, or other delays beyond the seller's control. 

On the 14th day, I had almost lost hope when suddenly the package arrived. I was so relieved and grateful that by exercising patience, I had finally been rewarded.
