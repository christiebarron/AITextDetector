One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I had three children to raise in my living room. While I tried not to laugh, I was told, "Not until you've got this child on the throne!"

Now the good news is that we may have some kids in our future who are not only fine and ready to be put to use, but who will be able to come through with the job they need. (Think about it…you're not so much like someone who could fly to work with a child in a wheelchair)

I'm a huge fan of this idea and even though I can't predict the way I will go about getting another baby, I do want to know what it is that you need to make sure you reach the right place. Not all parents get here fast enough – but I know I'll be able to. If you have trouble getting off the couch this morning, we'd really appreciate a little encouragement.
