One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my dad taught me how to walk. My step-dad never wanted me to. He hated me, my friends hated me, my family hated me. I don't believe in God and all God does is force people to stop doing things we aren't supposed to. I'm an example of how people feel in an area, and they don't want me to be there because of any of my beliefs and no religious belief. I never really understood the way religion is taught in public schools… I was taught a lot by churchgoers and parents of children who wanted their children to be different and to show tolerance. And their kids didn't. I started praying and praying when I was 9. I remember saying in the prayer room, "Mommy, don't let your young son be a part part of this." She knew that by the time I was 14 you might be in a different religion. I was very proud and I believe in Jesus Christ and I also believe in that God would love me to be what Jesus expects me to be and so I didn't believe I was going to be rejected… She never taught me that because my mother did, but she probably had a hard time getting me to look that hard. So the thought of being rejected by God is not that crazy, right? I didn't want it because I was trying to learn a lot and I didn't want to become a Christian because of Christianity, right? They
