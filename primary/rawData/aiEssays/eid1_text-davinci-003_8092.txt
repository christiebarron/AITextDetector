The construction of the Empire State Building posed many challenges for its developers and designers, but perhaps the most significant obstacle was the accommodation of dirigibles in an era when planes were still relatively few. The idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was initially met with scepticism due to its height and the practical difficulties that came with it, but the developers were determined to make it a reality. 

The development of the Empire State Building’s dirigible dock came from the vision of the building’s developers, General Motors president Alfred P. Sloan and Alfred E. Smith—the forty-fifth governor of New York. Knowing that air traffic would be the transportation of the future, they envisioned that the Empire State Building’s top floors would be a docking station for Dirigibles—a type of airship popular at the time.

The first obstacle that had to be overcome was creating a safe mechanism to dock the enormous ships. This led to the creation of two steel mooring masts, which would act as a base for the immense vessel to dock safely. By 1924, the two mooring masts had been designed and erected at the top of the building. Each was 320 feet tall and 12 feet in diameter.

The second obstacle was the problem of gusty winds. To protect the dirigibles from strong prevailing winds, the mooring masts were constructed with drop-down cables for the
