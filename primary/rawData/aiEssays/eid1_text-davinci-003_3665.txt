Dear Editor,

As technology continues to advance, the everyday use of computers is becoming more and more prevalent in our lives. While they undoubtedly have many good uses, I believe that computers have the potential to have a detrimental effect on people.

Using computers can create social, psychological, and physiological damage. For instance, computers can lead to a lack of face-to-face interaction, which is vital for building and maintaining meaningful relationships. Due to the sedentary nature of using a computer, people can develop physical problems such as obesity, musculoskeletal disorders, and eye-strain. In addition, computers can have psychological effects, including anxiety and depression.

Overall, while computers can be an incredibly useful tool, it is clear they are not without their downside. Therefore, I urge readers to be aware of the risks computers pose and to take steps to minimize them. Such steps include making sure children do not use computers unsupervised, setting limits on the amount of time spent interacting with electronic devices, and allowing for breaks throughout the day to stretch and take a breather.

Thank you for taking the time to read my opinion on the effects computers can have on people.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
