An example of a time someone in my life was patient was John Yauber in 1943 as the commander of RAF Bomber Command in China. For these two people, it was never their primary duty to carry out a attack. After all, their initial attack was to destroy a carrier or carrier group and destroy one enemy carrier. They were also responsible for launching an aircraft carrier by day or night, although this was only the last of their duties because otherwise, if any of the attacks failed, the aircraft carrier was destroyed.

Finally, the same issue of whether or not that the main purpose of that attack was to destroy a carrier (particularly if other objectives were the target, such as the aircraft carrier) was raised throughout the early days of this exercise. It may even have been noted over and over that, to protect the aircraft carrier against bombers that was in fact a threat (I would guess that was a fact. Some historians think that was the case. The question isn't whether bombers should not be hit by bombers, I don't think it's why bombers should attack carriers. I am sure they would be hit that way in some circumstances. But they would be hit, and all their casualties would be their. It would be almost unimaginable that an aircraft carrier was ever destroyed by a bomber and that the bombers were indeed to attack and destroy the aircraft carrier itself.

This was a little more than a cursory review of all major scenarios. This was a more detailed look at the
