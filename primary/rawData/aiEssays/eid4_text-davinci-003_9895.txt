This ending serves as a reminder that even if things don't turn out the way one hopes, there is always a chance for future success. The protagonist of Winter Hibiscus is feeling down about her score on an important test. The ending line suggests that even if she doesn't get the score she wanted, she can try again when the situation changes (when the snows melt and the geese return) and the hibiscus is back in bloom, signifying a new beginning. This implies that the protagonist still has hope and is looking ahead, refusing to be discouraged by her current setback.
