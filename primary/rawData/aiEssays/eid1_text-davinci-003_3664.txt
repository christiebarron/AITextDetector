Dear Editor:

In today’s technologically advanced world, computers have become an integral part of our daily lives. However, I’d like to voice my opinion on the effects computers have on people. 

My experience has taught me that computers can be a great aid for education, work, and entertainment, but when overused they can become detrimental to our health and wellbeing. Computer screens emit blue light which suppresses the production of the sleep hormone melatonin, making it difficult for young people to get enough sleep. Additionally, our sedentary lifestyles are causing people to sit for long stretches of time, and this can increase the risk of health issues such as heart disease, paralysis, and even depression. 

I believe we should learn how to use computers responsibly. We should limit our usage and try to be more mindful and intentional when using computers. Taking regular breaks from our screens to spend time in nature, listening to music, or engaging in creative activities can help us to recharge and find balance. 

By learning how to use computers responsibly, we can take advantage of their many benefits without putting our health at risk. I urge the readers to take these measures and embrace a more mindful approach to computer usage. 

Yours sincerely,
