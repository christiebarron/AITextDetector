Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have had on people.

From the office to the home, computers have become a staple in modern life. Indeed, they have become essential in performing work and maintaining communication. With so much of our lives now being powered by computers, itâ€™s hard to ignore the changes they have had on our lives.

On the one hand, computers have made many tasks faster and easier. Think of the convenience at which we can now shop or research with a few clicks of a mouse. Furthermore, businesses have been revolutionised thanks to the power of the internet and various software solutions.

On the other hand, computers have made an impact on our physical and mental wellbeing. For starters, most jobs are now based in front of a computer, leading to us experiencing physical health problems such as eyestrain, back pain, and shoulder pain. Additionally, overuse of computers also results in psychological issues such as stress, attention deficit disorder, and depression.

Therefore, I believe we need to be careful when it comes to the use of computers in our daily lives and understand the possible effects they can have.

Yours sincerely,
