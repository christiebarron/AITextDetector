I believe that censorship of materials in libraries can be implemented," he wrote. "That doesn't mean that the law must be enforced in each case and that it must be enforced in each case only when a particular type of censorship is found or when a new and more controversial censorship is discovered."

"I hope that my letter clarifies the distinction between censorship of content and censorship of language," he continued.

If the government proves to Bejing's government that it has used censorship to protect a particular content on its books, then the Ministry of Education and Science would be set free, Bejing said.

The government must also notify it's libraries about its policies.
