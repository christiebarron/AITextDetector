I recently had a situation when I had to really practice patience. I had gone to a doctor’s appointment to check out a nagging issue I had been having. I had arrived a few minutes early to the appointment, and the waiting room was already filling up with other patients. I could tell immediately that the waiting room was going to be full for quite a while.

I was prepared for the wait, so I grabbed a magazine and took a seat in the corner. As the minutes ticked on, the doctors still hadn’t seen me. I noticed that the other patients were growing more impatient and anxious as the wait time continued to drag. I could sense the increasing tension in the room and I knew it wouldn’t be long before some of them started to get angry and lash out.

That’s when I decided to let out a small sigh of contentment and remind myself to be patient and understanding of the situation. I knew that the doctors were doing their best to see everyone in a timely fashion and that my time would come soon enough.

After about an hour of waiting, the doctor was finally ready to see me. While the other patients began expressing their dissatisfaction with how long it took, I simply thanked the doctor for seeing me so promptly and finally had my appointment.

I’m glad I was able to remain calm and use patience during this situation. It was a reminder of how important it is
