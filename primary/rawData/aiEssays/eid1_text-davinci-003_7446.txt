The story Winter Hibiscus is a coming-of-age story in which a narrator recalls their failed attempt at a math exam. The narrator has an affinity for a flower (a winter hibiscus) in their grandmother's garden, which serves as a source of comfort, strength, and hope. 

The ending serves as a representation of the narrator's growth and resilience, affirming that no matter the outcome of the first attempt, they will eventually make progress after some time. In the same way that the winter hibiscus will bloom in the spring, it reflects the idea that it will eventually take another chance to achieve success. The narrator's connection to the flower allows them to learn a valuable lesson about perseverance and gives them hope for a better outcome in the future.
