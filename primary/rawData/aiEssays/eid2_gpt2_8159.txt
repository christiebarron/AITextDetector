I believe that censorship of materials in libraries, journals, and other places is a necessary prerequisite for a decent and open Internet and I propose that other libraries adopt similar measures," a spokesman for the group said.

He added that the group has no intention of forcing the government to go round punishing libraries.

"In addition to shutting down their doors, they are also threatening a lawsuit and other actions they are taking that could damage the reputation, business and other enterprises of the library system."
