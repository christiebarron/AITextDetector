One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I watched a film with a woman who seemed rather sad and unhelpful. She was a very bright young woman with bright, colourful hair. She asked me how to speak to her (she didn't know me). She asked if I was ready to see a movie. I asked if that was so that she could explain to me how we could do things in the world. We looked at each other, then, and saw the difference our relationship was making. We could discuss ideas like these and understand each other to the point of madness, and I wasn't scared. All of this had made me a better human being. It was wonderful, and I could just imagine doing things to her."

The book also includes a photo gallery of the young woman behind the scenes. "What do you think?" I ask.

"She says, `I do that.' [laughter] Because this moment was so freeing. If a film were made without me, I'd almost have no idea any way how to say it. When I look at her she smiles and says 'That was so beautiful!' and that's it. As she says, `So beautiful!' Well, you know, you can do different things with a little help. We've been in this together a long time.' I like she's like [inaudible]. I know she's pretty and beautiful to look at, and not just to say she's beautiful
