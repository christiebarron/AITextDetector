I recently experienced just how important it is to be patient when struggling with a difficult situation. I was visiting my aunt in her hometown and wanted to take a long walk outside in the countryside to explore the area. The weather was beautiful but I had forgotten to pack good walking shoes so I had to make do with a pair of sandals. 

The path was much more rugged than I anticipated and after a while of walking I developed blisters on both my feet. Although in immense pain, I was determined to complete my journey. I kept going, slowly and patiently, checking my footing more carefully and making sure I didn't take any sharp turns that would put too much pressure on the soles of my feet. 

Finally, I arrived back at my aunt's after hours of careful, patient maneuvering and I was exhausted but proud of my accomplishment. It was a tough experience but it taught me a valuable lesson about the importance of patience and having the discipline to struggle through a difficult time.
