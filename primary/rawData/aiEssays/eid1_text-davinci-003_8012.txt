The builders of the Empire State Building faced a variety of obstacles when attempting to introduce docking for dirigibles in order to create an airship-accessible building. At the time of its construction, the Empire State Building, located in New York City, was the world’s tallest building, measuring 1,250 feet from its base to the mast at the very top. While the idea of making the world’s tallest building a landing spot for airships seemed promising, the project was fraught with difficulties. 

In order to create a docking station for dirigibles, the Empire State Building required modifications that included strengthening the frame, constructing an extra section of elevator shaft at the top, and installing mooring mast. While the mooring mast, the structure above the building that would anchor the dirigible, was projected to extend up to 600 feet, it wasn’t until after construction actually began that the building’s engineers realized the true difficulty of the task. 

The construction crew had to incorporate several factors, including strong wind gusts in the vicinity of the Empire State Building, when building the mooring mast. The mast had to be sturdy enough to withstand nearly 200 mph of wind on the top floor, an extraordinarily extreme gust that the designers had no choice but to acknowledge when planning their structure. To make sure the mast was stable enough to hold the weight of even the largest dirigible, they also incorporated a system of guy
