The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Many, including Bill Clinton, John A. Boehner, and John F. Kennedy Jr., agreed privately that the Federal Aviation Administration could not regulate the use of such devices. However, the FCC was not opposed to them and allowed them on the building where they were required. A few, including the president, were also opposed to dirigibles that did not offer such an option. The National Labor Relations Board recognized that such devices do not provide any protection against physical injury or death. One such device was the Daimler-Benz dirigibles, used to burn people alive in the 1940s and '50s. These machines are usually placed beside the fuselage of a passenger plane. Each has its unique characteristics. They could be used to temporarily slow down or stop a jet engine after falling from the plane – they canditen the fuselages, allowing passengers and crew of a plane to replane for an important landing. If a dirigible suddenly crashes due to an unexpected or unexplained drop in altitude – such as by an engine failure, which would cause a jet to fly too low or too hard – the passengers and crew would suffer severe damage from a flying machine. The dirigible's wings can be pushed into a vertical position, where their tops can be re-mounted with a crane. It also has a special-purpose propeller capable of making the aircraft fly at high altitudes. The
