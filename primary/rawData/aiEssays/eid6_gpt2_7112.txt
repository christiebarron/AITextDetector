The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. For example, unlike other building approaches these towers typically can support 1,000 people, and in some cases they could require a larger room, requiring three days of transportation. The new Empire State building would have had to add extra walls that would provide more space for 4,000 feet of space. As an aside, this section is not even in the final version of the finished Building 7—the only work on the site still being approved for construction, and it will have to be fully re-engineered and revised to accommodate higher volumes.

The final section, which is roughly a third taller than the original, has a second, much larger floor but an even more obtrusive, less functional, space. This part—which I would call a "fractal ceiling," or ceiling-mounted structure with a spiral staircase that can be used to descend and descend for a maximum of 1,000 feet per hour—allows the building to provide more room for 2,000 feet of volume. But only about half of the room will be fully accessible and almost all of this will come from the second level below, which the designers are now planning to develop in the final version of the building.

We still have some of these issues to address, but some of them were discussed in our earlier piece on the building, which covers some of the most important and often-overlooked aspects of
