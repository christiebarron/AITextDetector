The construction of the Empire State Building was an amazing feat of engineering, but one of the most unique aspects of its design was the fact that it had a built-in mooring mast designed to allow dirigibles to dock. Although the concept of airships docking on the Empire State Building seemed like a modern marvel at the time, the process of allowing dirigibles to dock was fraught with obstacles.

The first major obstacle was the design of the mooring mast itself. Building a mast that could hold airships was a complicated engineering problem, and meant constructing a steel structure that was strong enough to support the weight of a dirigible. The structure also needed to offer enough flexibility to accommodate the shifting of airships in windy conditions. After months of research and testing, the mooring mast was finally built, with a strong, flexible neck and an elevated platform designed to allow the dirigibles to land. 

The second obstacle the builders had to overcome was the problem of height. Dirigibles were much larger and heavier than regular aircraft, and so they needed to be able to dock at much higher altitude than the already lofty height of the Empire State Building. To solve this problem, the builders constructed a spire on the top of the building, allowing dirigibles to dock at a much higher elevation. 

The third obstacle the builders had to overcome was the turbulence created by the close proximity of the buildingâ€™s architecture.
