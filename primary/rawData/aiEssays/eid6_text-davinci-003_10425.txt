The Empire State Building presented a unique challenge for the engineers and architects tasked with its construction in 1930s Manhattan; the plan included allowing dirigibles to dock atop the building. Initially, the obstacles to such an endeavor seemed insurmountable. However, the builders of the Empire State Building constructed a mooring mast atop the building with precision and remarkable modern engineering. 

The first challenge for constructing the mooring mast was the strong winds that blew through the area. The building would have to be strong enough to withstand high gusting winds in order to protect passengers from turbulence, deflecting debris that could potentially damage the airship. The mast itself would have to be a sturdy steel column, firmly mounted at the top of the building and atop the tower itself. This presented further difficulties as the mast had to be hollow with interior hallways, allowing for freight to pass through and to disembark passengers safely when docked.

The team had to work within tight restrictions regarding the height of the building. Any visible mast above the highest point of the building had to be minimized, without sacrificing strength. To achieve this, the engineers designed a mast consisting of a large steel column that rose approximately 23 feet above the building. The body of the mast was evenly spaced apart from the building walls to reduce the effects of strong winds on the structure. This steel column was the foundation for a specialized collar-like riser that could be adjusted to the height of any dirigible docking.
