The narrator is using the metaphor of the hibiscus to symbolize themselves and their struggles with the English language. They are a non-native speaker and the English language test is a symbol of their difficulty with assimilating. The ending line is symbolic of the narrator hoping to take the test again in the future and passing it with confidence, when they have learned the language more deeply. The metaphor of the hibiscus blooming in the spring implies a hopefulness and promise that the narrator can improve their English and have a brighter future.
