An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my brother. He was going to take me to a friend's house and I was so upset I was scared he was going to kill me. He couldn't have asked for anything because I was crying."

Her brother's father, who lives in the same tiny farming village in central Turkey as her brother, spoke by phone on Sunday about his grief after the attack:

"When he hit the ground, my family and I were scared and our family, I'm pretty sure, we are scared too," said his father. "But after the attack, we were OK for a while."

"The little brother kept telling me, 'We don't know that you will go to Europe now like this', and I knew there would be trouble soon afterwards. But the same thing happened to me and it didn't end well for me because I just felt so sorry for my brother, just because he was young. It's sad and frustrating, but we have all felt sorry for them on different levels in our lives."

The wife of two men charged in the latest rape-and-murder in Turkey's southeastern province of Diyarbakir has been arrested after police released her from prison.

The suspect was believed to have been hiding in an area on Mount Sinjaran in the Andeyia region of northern Turkey in mid-afternoon on Sunday when he was shot and killed by police
