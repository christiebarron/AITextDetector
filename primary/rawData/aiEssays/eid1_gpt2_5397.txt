Computers have many effects on people. People don't always perceive themselves in the right way either so the same thing can happen when they encounter a computer that has become more comfortable in the past (even with some hardware upgrades) in their personal world.

What are the most common reasons people get upset about the internet? (I'm sure I've answered those first.)

It's not that things are going to change much as usual! After all those years of trying for the past century to use the internet, there are still many new places online.

A lot of people are aware that there is something wrong and wish they'd had the choice â€“ what options would they have?

People still don't understand. They are still searching the internet searching for information that they can use to achieve their goals.

It's not something I have ever seen. There aren't any options to be chosen by most people!

But there is hope. One of the coolest things about life now is that people can use and love the internet

There are many ways to connect and communicate with each other. Many of them I cannot name for the reasons, but there are many more.
