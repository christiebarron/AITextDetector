Rodriguez’s stories take us through his entire life and he reflects deeply on his personal and professional experiences. He is vulnerable in sharing intimate details of being an immigrant in a new country, as being the son of an alcoholic, and his struggles to find his place as a young designer in the competitive fashion world. Despite the hardships he has faced throughout his life, there is capability and strength to be found in his words. 

The tone of the memoir is unique in that it is not a traditional story of success and triumph. Instead, Rodriguez creates a tone of reflection and honesty.

His resilience is inspiring, and the details he provides bring his realities to life.

Rodriguez brings his past and present together in an engaging and thoughtful way.
