The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because each chapter is so much more nuanced than anything preceding it, and my first attempt at trying to read one before having to go back to the previous takes away the most fun.

But the book isn't so difficult as it looks now. I'll admit that I didn't exactly feel like reading it much. In fact, I would say that, a good half of my time in these early chapters was spent reading and pondering what I should buy if I was going through this new book. Some of it might have been fun. Some of it could have been too boring. A very important part of the character development goes over the characters and their own journey in the world after this novel comes out. It makes for another very enjoyable day-to-day read.

The second chapter was an almost-must-read read. Again because it was such a huge, epic story, it required such extreme characters to make it worth them. These are characters with their own histories and their own story arcs. It's a fantastic book indeed, an absolute must-read.
