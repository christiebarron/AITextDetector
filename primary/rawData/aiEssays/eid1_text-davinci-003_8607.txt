I was out to dinner with a friend at a local Italian restaurant. We had been talking about our studies and going back and forth with what we wanted to order for most of the night. Eventually, we both decided on the lasagna. 

As our dinners were presented to us, we both looked at them and had the same thought at the same time: this isn't lasagna! We looked up at the server with the same confused expression and asked if there was some misunderstanding. After he confirmed our suspicions, we let out a laugh that we couldn't help. 

The server, seeing our silly reaction, began to laugh too. We found ourselves laughing harder when he reminded us that the dish was actually called 'baked ziti'! What made it even more funny was that we never would have ordered it had we known that! 

The laughter felt so natural and connected us in a way that felt intimate. It was amazing how such an unexpected moment had brought us even closer together.
