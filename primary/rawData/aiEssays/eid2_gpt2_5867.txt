I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is necessary," she wrote. The government wants to ban books that are obscene, anti-Semitic, racist, xenophobic, sexist or transphobic, the official said.

It is unclear in how often libraries will have their own special collections, though the government says it only permits to 10,000 items. In addition to the books, the government also seeks to block certain books on an individual basis, which "seems to be appropriate under the Constitution," the court said.

The court's conclusion of the case makes it the second case where the Justice Department has called on the government to remove a book on a controversial subject. The first case involved what many see as a "banned book" containing racist and anti-Semitic books. The government asked the court to order the department to remove that book from libraries. The government said such "bans are prohibited."

The three other cases involve books that have been removed from libraries.

The Associated Press reported this week that some libraries in the Philadelphia area have blocked dozens more books on subjects such as "Islam and the Holocaust."

The U.S. Justice Department said the cases were brought in connection with libraries on the grounds that they violate federal law prohibiting "conflict of interest."
