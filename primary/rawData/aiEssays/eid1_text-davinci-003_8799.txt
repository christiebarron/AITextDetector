I was out to dinner with my best friend and her family one night and, as usual, we were all giggling and sharing funny stories. At one point my friend and her sister were competing to see who could come up with the best pun (even though neither of them are the best when it comes to telling jokes). We were all in hysterics by the time they were done.

My friend's aunt, though, was not amused and stared at us sternly. But her sternness only made us laugh harder. So much so that soon everyone's laughter had filled the entire restaurant. My friend's aunt gave up and joined in the collective laughter, cheering with the rest of us.

I think that was the moment I realized how powerful laughter truly was. That night, it brought the whole family closer together, crossing the divides between generations, in a way I couldn't have imagined. Who knew the shortest distance between people often is laughter!
