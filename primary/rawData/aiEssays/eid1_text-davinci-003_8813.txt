I was newly married and had just moved into my first home with my husband. We had only been together a few months, but we both felt it was the right move for our relationship. I had been nervously unpacking boxes in the kitchen when my husband’s little sister came over. She had been visiting us all day and had been helping us move in and unpack. We had all been working hard all day and we were all exhausted. 

At the end of the night, she made some silly joke about how the kitchen was now officially “ours”. I wasn’t in the mood to laugh, I was just too tired, but my husband burst out laughing. His laughter was so contagious that soon the whole room was filled with laughter. I had never felt this kind of connection and camaraderie before. 

It was in that moment that I truly felt like this was our home. We had successfully turned this house into a place that felt like home. All because we shared a few laughs with each other.
