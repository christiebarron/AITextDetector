Computers have many effects on people. As the computer gets smarter and better at processing vast amounts of information, it's easier and more efficient for it to make decisions and then make decisions based on an intuitive set of assumptions. Computer programming systems have more constraints or goals on computation, and this is partly compensated by the fact that they allow computer programmers to take advantage of different capabilities in a range of ways that the human brain can't.

The reason for being aware that the human brain lacks a specific set of tools for reasoning and using knowledge is in part because this brain is not particularly well adapted for learning new information. It's not a case of the brain just being too complex or too primitive and not thinking and being able to use the right tools. We're more apt to assume that even these new tools are new, even if the old ones may not be new. In our experience, this is where it's not so clear. Our experience does not support the case we were making for humans to be able to simply learn and use what they do in various ways. Perhaps that's why I've become more interested in learning these new tools than I would have been about human problems. Because I would have more confidence in saying that, in the long run, we wouldn't be in trouble because we don't use that new tool.
