An example of a time someone in my life was patient was an elderly gentleman who came to my house for a vacation. He and his wife were looking for their son who had recently died. When we arrived to his house we knew he had been shot and murdered. We were told that we were supposed to go to the hospital in good spirits. He would come home during the day to his wife and two other neighbors. All the time we were there, we were told that it would not be possible if we did not have his life or that he was not there.

A lot of the people who live, work and play in their community are not happy with my statement or the fact that if I said anything this would not be an apology. If I said anything, it would mean something. I am making a mockery at the notion that a friend of mine should be considered a murderer.

When he was in our community I was always worried about my own health. There is just no medical insurance. I have never seen doctor's bills, nothing. My health was fine until something went wrong with him and I had to go get him his health care plan and see if I can pay.

I don't want to sound na√Øve, only smart or stupid. There are also a lot of people that are not very optimistic or pessimistic about our health. If I said anything, I might be called out for how I feel. But I always knew it always would bring me tears
