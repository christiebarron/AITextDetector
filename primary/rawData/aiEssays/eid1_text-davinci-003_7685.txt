Minfong Ho ends her poem Winter Hibiscus with the line 'When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again?' This line is meant to show the resilience of the hibiscus flower and the strength and determination of the protagonist. This line is also symbolically linked to the idea of renewal, hope, and second chances. The last line of the poem serves as a reminder that spring will come and the protagonist will take the test again with renewed optimism and faith. It serves to remind us of the courage and determination many of us have to face our struggles and fight for second chances.
