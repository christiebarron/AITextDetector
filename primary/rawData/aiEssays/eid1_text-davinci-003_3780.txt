To the Editor of _______ Newspaper:

I am writing to express my opinion on the impact computers have on people today. I believe that computers have drastically changed the way people live their lives, for better and for worse.

On the one hand, computers have positively impacted our lives. They have reduced the amount of time it takes to accomplish everyday tasks, such as research, communication, and education. They also provide us with a wealth of information, allowing us to gain knowledge more quickly than ever before. Finally, computers have opened up numerous job opportunities that did not exist a few decades ago.

On the other hand, computers can have negative effects on people. For example, many people find themselves becoming addicted to the internet and social media, which can lead to the neglect of family and friends. Additionally, overuse of computers can lead to physical issues, such as poor posture, headaches, and eye strain.

In conclusion, while computers have had many positive effects on modern society, it is important to remember the potential dangers associated with their usage. We should strive to use computers as tools for productivity rather than allowing them to take control of our lives.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
