Dear editor,

I am writing to address the topic of the effects computers have had on us as people. In this rapidly advancing technological age, computers have become indispensable in nearly every aspect of our lives.

However, while computers have brought us tremendous levels of efficiency in our day-to-day activities, I cannot help but feel that there have been some rather adverse effects as well. Computers have brought us closer to one another in terms of communication, but I would argue that this ease of connection has caused us to become more isolated on an individual level.

Without computers, it would be much harder for us to access our social media accounts, and thus prevents us from relying on virtual communication as our primary means of socialization. By relying solely on virtual contact, we are in danger of losing the true meaning of connection, which can only be experienced through humans interacting in real life. If we want to continue to have authentic relationships, we must take the opportunities to connect with each other in person.

In conclusion, while computers are tools that have made vast improvements to our lives in many ways, it is important to remember to take caution of the potential pitfalls as well. Computers should not be used as our primary means of socialization, but instead should serve as an enhancement to our own social endeavors.

Yours faithfully,
