Today, the world-famous Empire State building is an iconic landmark of New York City and stands as proof of American engineering excellence. But before it was completed, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a challenge—allowing dirigibles, the lighter-than-air crafts of the time, to moor at the top. 

In the book “The Mooring Mast,” Marcia Amidon Lüsted explores this ambitious mission. The mooring mast was to be installed on the building’s top and utilized for aeronautical purposes. But many obstacles stood in the way of the mooring mast's success.

The first challenge was the task of constructing a sturdy enough mast to withstand the pull of a large air craft. At the time, no technology or equipment existed to build and install such a mast. To solve this dilemma, the architects of the Empire State Building had to design a special steel frame structure to act as the mooring mast. This structure had to withstand heavy winds and be lightweight enough to be raised to the rooftop without damaging the building.

The next hurdle was the laborious task of transportation. The mooring mast required heavy machinery and materials to be lifted to the rooftop, and due to the height of the building, this was no easy feat. To transport the mast, the architects utilized a complex system of cranes, elevators, and scaffolding to assist in the effort—
