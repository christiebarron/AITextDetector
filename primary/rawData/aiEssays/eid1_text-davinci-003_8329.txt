I waited at the grocery store in a long line, feeling my impatience begin to swell. Everyone seemed to be taking longer than necessary, and I could feel my frustration growing. I reminded myself to stay patient and take a breath. 

My thoughts were interrupted when a elderly woman came to the register. It was obvious she was confused and unable to use the machine correctly. What should have taken seconds dragged on to what felt like eternity as the customer struggled with her task. I could feel my patience wearing thin again.

But then, I noticed something remarkable. The cashier was being incredibly kind and patiently explaining the steps one by one. After a few minutes, I saw a smile spread across the womanâ€™s face as she successfully completed the transaction. The cashier thanked her for being so patient as the woman left with a wave and a thank you.

This show of patience was incredibly inspiring to me. I was reminded that some situations require a little extra patience, and that it makes all the difference in the world.
