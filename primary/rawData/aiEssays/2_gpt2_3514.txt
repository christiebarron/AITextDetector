I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is the only way to ensure good public policy and effective policies, for not just by using library tools, but by being a good citizen citizen and having a voice in making better libraries, and being able to communicate to people that this is your opinion, or at least the opinion of you. There is a clear moral imperative to preserve free speech and freedom of expression to other creators, and the U.S. Constitution recognizes that any person who attempts to censor content he or she finds objectionable, or disagrees with, may be subject to prosecution.

To that end, we will support efforts by libraries to maintain the current and fair policy and policies that are intended or recommended by the Library Board in its decision. We have also supported efforts to bring library resources to their proper locations to support educational needs of adults. We have also provided examples of where a staff member at a library may get access to libraries and resources and what information should be available, or how library resources should be kept, maintained, or redistributed. Finally, we believe libraries will have the best tools available to them of reaching and understanding their audience, so they will continue to serve the general public and will have a voice in that area of interest.


In this case, we're glad that the decision was reached and that we can continue to act to keep libraries, their patrons, and us from being harmed. We appreciate you all for voting against censorship. We know that these efforts have potential
