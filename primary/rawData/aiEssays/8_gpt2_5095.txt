One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I realized I was going to die. This was one of those times where I would be laughing at someone because of a joke they had, and people were so laughing and they were going, well how can someone expect someone to laugh at me for that? So when they told me what I was supposed to say, I was almost ashamed. I was kind of embarrassed in that moment â€” it would be like having a weird moment and it would be like a little heartbreak. It would be very difficult to really take the laugh out of someone and it was harder to understand what they were doing when you go there with that funny smile and it's kind of heartbreaking at the same time. It's all my fault we're all being so afraid to be funny with one another and with each other.
