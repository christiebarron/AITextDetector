I recently spent an afternoon with my best friend. We got together for lunch and for the first time in weeks, we caught up with each other. We were talking about our most recent travels when I brought up a funny experience I had in London.

I told my friend about the night I tried to buy a tube ticket from the automated machines. No matter what buttons I pushed, nothing worked. It was like I was playing a game of Simon Says. Then, all of the sudden, the machine started speaking in a deep British accent, asking me if I needed help. I almost laughed out loud! My friend started laughing, imagining the scene in her head.

We were both laughing so hard that my stomach started to hurt. We had to grab tissues to wipe away the tears streaming down our faces. It was one of those silly moments that reminded me why I love our friendship so much. 

After catching our breath, we concluded that laughter truly is the best medicine. No matter what challenges we faced, laughing with one another was something we could always count on to make us feel connected.
