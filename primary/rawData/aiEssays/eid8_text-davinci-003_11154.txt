I have a vivid memory of the moment my best friend and I shared a fit of laughter that had us both in tears. It was the summer after our freshman year of college. We were out for dinner at a restaurant near campus, and it had been a long, unusually stressful week. We were both tired and feeling kind of down when out of nowhere I made a comment that set us off into raucous laughter.

It was something silly and sudden, one of those comments you make without thinking — I had been going on about a reality TV show and I said in a voice full of overacting drama, “She said it! She said it with her whole darn FACE!”

My friend, who was usually more reserved, couldn’t keep it in and immediately dissolved into uncontrollable laughter. Before I knew it, I had followed suit and we were both roaring with laughter, quickly catching the attention of everyone in the restaurant.

The memory of that laughter still brings a smile to my face. It was one of those powerful moments where the feeling of pure joy and connection between us was unmistakable. It was a reminder that laughter really can be the shortest distance between two people.
