An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I took my life in 2004. The first thing I did when I found out there was nothing I could do, I decided to die myself. I told friends and family and friends and all around the world that I wanted to die, because I thought I wanted everyone else to die like me. They were all saying "no, just ask, please."

This is why I have told people "don't ask and don't tell."

Even if anyone can give you the answers to every question in this universe, the only thing anybody should know is "no."

I am in this video interviewing people who just want to tell me not to kill, because it's hard enough.

There are so many things that I find hard at times in my life. One was trying to talk to my wife and kids. It's hard right now, but I hope it gets better.

I also hope it gets better because every conversation you have at once needs to make you ask yourself those questions first, and then think it's OK.

There are so many things that I feel like I am supposed to know and I've told this story because of them.

All told, there are so many, many times I am told, "no, just ask, please." I have told people the wrong question, but I don't wanna tell anymore. I want to know why in the
