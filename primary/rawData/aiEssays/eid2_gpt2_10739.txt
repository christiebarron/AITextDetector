I believe that censorship of materials in libraries, and public libraries as well, is the best way to prevent harm to the individual and promote education for all," he added.

He and others have repeatedly advocated censorship in the arts since 1999. In 2005, then-U.S. Rep. Richard Hanna (D-N.Y.), who was one of the first speakers on the topic, published a piece in which he outlined guidelines when it came to safeguarding the rights of non-governmental organizations, teachers and others on campus. "It's important for us to know that when an organization has an intellectual or societal impact on our society and we're forced to come to terms with their creation it's our duty to stop these harmful activities as well," he wrote. "Our obligation is to defend and protect the liberty of students, researchers, and others who feel threatened and threatened by censorship on campus."

Hanna's efforts have continued over the last year or so. His organization announced in September that it was stepping down as a member of the board of directors following the passage of the National Digital Media Education Act. "I truly believe that the people who run the National Digital Media Education Act are the rightful holders of the rights conferred by the Bill of Rights, as well as the civil liberties of all of us who are citizens, not criminals, but educators," he said in the statement.
