I recently had the pleasure of going away on vacation with my best friend. While it was amazing to get to ride the airplane and stay in a new place together, we ended up running into a lot of issues. We had to check in over three times, our flight got delayed, and our layover ended up being longer than expected. 

Despite this, I remained patient. I understood that there was nothing we could do but wait it out. Instead of complaining, I stayed strong for my best friend and reassured her everything would be alright. We finally were able to get through the delays and start our trip. I'm glad I was able to be patient through the difficulties.
