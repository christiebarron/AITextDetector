The Empire State Building was a remarkable feat of engineering when it was completed in 1931, and it was seen as a sign of technological advancement. One of the most ambitious ideas was that of a "mooring mast” on the rooftop, allowing dirigibles – the massive, cigar-shaped airships of the day – to dock there. While this idea was appealing, there were many obstacles that had to be overcome in order for it to be implemented.

The main hurdle was safety. Dirigibles of the time were prone to explosions due to the combustible hydrogen gas they used for lift. These explosions had already caused tragedy, as demonstrated by the crash of the Hindenburg in 1937. In order to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, these risks would have to be minimized or eliminated.

The structure of the building would also need to be modified. Engineering and design modifications would be needed in order to create a suitable landing surface at the top of the building, and the structures that allowed the airships to moor would need to be designed, manufactured, and installed. This would require knowledge and expertise that went beyond the scope of what was available at the time.

The mooring mast would also need to be integrated into the existing infrastructure of the building. This meant that space would have to be opened up on the rooftop to accommodate the mast, and all of the electrical, mechanical, and structural components necessary for it to
