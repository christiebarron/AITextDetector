The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' isn't just an artistic decision - it's an emotional one. 'The moment of reckoning was when, over all these months of the year, the two sides had to find a way to keep moving forward without collapsing and collapsing again.'"

Tobias: "This was not the end. I've been here since I was seven. You can say it's been quite a while, but I think to this day you are still here with the same sense of optimism and hope in you. But the worst of it has always been the moment of reckoning for the people in the middle of it, for their children - because you don't know who is going to win."
