Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the implications of computers in our lives today. Nowadays, computers play an increasingly significant role in our lives. They help us in our day-to-day tasks and enable us to access information faster and much more efficiently.

However, it is important to understand that computers can also have a negative effect on people if used in excess. People who spend too much time in front of their computer can become more isolated from their friends and family as they become more focused on the screen then on the people around them. Furthermore, prolonged exposure to computer screens can strain and damage the eyes as well as cause stress and fatigue due to the long hours spent sitting in front of the screen.

Despite these drawbacks, I believe that the benefits of computers far outweigh the negative effects. Computers can facilitate communication by allowing people to connect to each other from any corner of the world. With the click of a mouse, we can access information from all over the internet in a fraction of the time it would take us to look for it in libraries and books. And computer technology has even enabled students to attend classes online when they might not be able to attend in person.
