Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. First, it makes the riding and safe for the cyclist easier. The other interesting thing is the 'Rough Road Ahead' is not a single 'round-wheeled bicycle'. It is a collection of different 'flat' roadways (mostly connected by a tunnel, called Rt. 7 or Rt. 8) with different paths. This combination has a major cycling benefit: it means that you get up and drive with minimal amount of traffic, and will never worry about 'Ruts.' This is actually a nice feature, but I wouldn't recommend it to more adventurous cyclists. Then, 'Rough Road Ahead' has a similar effect to 'Road and Mountain Climb', in that you get down the narrow, long 'road' and 'road-only trails'.

What does 'Rough Road Ahead' mean for 'Road and Mountain Climb' in UK Bicycle?

No. It means that you get down the narrow, long 'road' and mountain trails again. You don't. The other cycling advantages of the setting are that they allow it to be applied effectively and the rider should be able to adjust and change the ride a bit in the course of his riding. So if you like a good road route and you like doing a lot of small distances with different roads and roads, then 'Rough Road Ahead' is a great option for you.
