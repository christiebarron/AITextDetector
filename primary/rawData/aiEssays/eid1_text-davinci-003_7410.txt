This ending helps to convey the central theme of the poem--resilience in the face of adversity. The poem is centered around a hibiscus flower in the middle of winter, a time of struggle and hardship. The poem is a metaphor for how the main character must persevere against their difficult situation, and by evoking imagery of growth and renewal, the ending serves as an inspiring message of hope. By closing with the image of the hibiscus filling with life once again in the spring, the author suggests that the main character can also come back from their challenges and take the test again when the time comes.
