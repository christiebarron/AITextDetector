The last line of the poem is meant to evoke a sense of hope and longing. It reflects the speaker's determined attitude to take the test again. The thought of the hibiscus blooming in the spring and the geese returning serves as a tangible reminder that the speaker is determined to keep pushing forward despite the setbacks. It is a reminder that despite the winter, a new season awaits, and with it, a chance for a fresh start. In this way, the poet uses the natural world to signify the potential for a new beginning and of being able to overcome any challenge.
