I remember the first night my now husband and I went out together. We'd been talking for weeks and finally decided to meet up. Our conversation had been light on the phone, so I was looking forward to getting to spend time with him in person and see how it would turn out.

At the beginning of the night we were a little awkward, both trying to make small talk. But after a while, the conversation suddenly shifted and he started telling me the most hilarious stories about growing up. I remember laughing so hard I thought my stomach would hurt. He had such an infectious laugh that before I knew it, I was in tears of laughter too. 

The funny thing is, it didn't feel forced or scripted at all. We'd connected so well that we were just in the moment, not worried about trying to impress each other. This moment of unforced laughter was the best part of the night and it's still something we look back on and laugh about today. That day we both knew that we'd found a special kind of connection, one that would last in the future.
