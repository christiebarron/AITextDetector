The setting of “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski heavily impacts the cyclist in the story. The cyclist is preparing to ride a path that is described as “a narrow road that twisted and turned like a serpent”. This potentially treacherous route is made even more difficult by the fact that the cyclist must cross numerous rocky crevices and ridges. The terrain does not permit the cyclist to move at a quick pace, and instead, it forces the cyclist to move slowly and cautiously. 

The setting also has a psychological impact on the cyclist. The writer paints a vivid and detailed picture of the landscape, which evokes a sense of dread in the cyclist. The “dry, brown sky”, “red dust that choked the air”, and even the “screeching buzz of a small bird” all create a sense of menace. This unease causes the cyclist to approach the ride with trepidation, acknowledging that the dangers that lay ahead could prevent them from crossing the path. 

The setting of “Rough Road Ahead” has a major effect on the cyclist as they journey through the serpentine path. Not only does it make the cyclist’s journey more physically strenuous but it also causes them to approach the ride with caution. The writer’s portrayal of the setting creates an atmosphere of dread that greatly affects the cyclist in the story.
