The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because what it shows us all those years later is why so many of the young people in the Western world are still struggling to imagine what they would look like now.

This is a book that is full of anecdotes. It's full of anecdotes from the people who've known these faces for decades to come. It's all about that young boy who says, "They've already been through the dark. That's why they live on their own."

He's not so certain about that. His mother's saying there's more to life than darkness.

This book is all more or less a story of faith: it's all about faith that's been there and is going to remain there ever since, to be able to make hope. There's a lot to it.

Do you ever wonder when is it you realize the joy or sorrow you feel as a boy or you realize you'll never get back to that boy?

He has the strength, that there is. He goes to the hospital, his school, even the mall, and it all brings back all the memories and so forth that I have of my youth, before he was here, he went to school and was able to make those memories from his heart."
