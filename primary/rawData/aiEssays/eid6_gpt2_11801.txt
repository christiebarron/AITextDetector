The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

The government had approved the plan late after the collapse of World mattress manufacturer DBS, which had developed dirigibles. But the government had decided to stop development in the early 1990s as the economy deteriorated, forcing the builders to sell their shares for scrap.
