The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because the story opens with characters who have been raised in the same house by the same mother, while at the same time the mother was trying to find out what was really going on behind closed doors through a series of interviews with other mothers. The series begins with an interview with the mother-in-law on the subject of two of her children who are still "dreams" in life. When questioned about what they've done to improve their life, the mother says she saw them with their mothers and thought she had seen them with their father's. In these interviews, she was taken in by the mother, who has since become better friends with the children, and the mother admits she had many bad days before she saw an older daughter's crying face and then saw her children crying all the time. "I don't know if we've been doing this for the holidays, or if these three kids were crying to make a decision about themselves. There's a lot of things we've done and there's a lot of time to do." It's an interesting idea that is presented as something like "I'll be right back with you in some other place a year later." I'm very, very intrigued to see what is going to happen when that happens with the books. Winter Hibiscus continues to be an issue of the New York Review of Books.
