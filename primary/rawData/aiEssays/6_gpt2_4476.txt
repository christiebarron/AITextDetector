The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, they had to go through the process of building a separate room and then the whole building. Second, construction would require extensive renovations of the room. Third, the building needed a number of major renovations. This became even more a reality as the size and quality of the buildings increased â€“ so many of the towers were still too small to house the complex that the number of workers required to complete them was greater than they wanted.

Finally, the construction industry needed to cut down on the time investment necessary to complete these construction tasks. The large scale required a significant investment by government for construction of the Empire State Building. In particular, the time required to get the entire construction project funded was greater than required to complete every component of the Empire State Building.

In total the cost of the Empire State Building was $22.75 million in 1974.

The Empire State Building, constructed by the Government of China in 1924 and built in New York City in 1927, now has seven stories of glass windows on each front and second story facing each other. Four of the stories are facing outside their doors, while the rest are facing directly in front of. The front of the building features a large dome with a roof and an elevator for elevating the building.

The Empire State Building was built in the 1880s under New York City's "Hollywood Development Authority" of New York County.
