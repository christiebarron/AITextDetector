Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people, and to persuade your readers to agree with me. Recently, computers have become an essential part of our lives and play a fundamental role in many areas of society.

On the one hand, computers can provide countless advantages for individuals, businesses and educational institutions alike. Their ability to quickly process large amounts of data, combined with their accuracy and efficiency, makes them invaluable tools. Thanks to the advancements of computers, businesses have become increasingly productive and have seen improved levels of efficiency, while students can access vast amounts of information in no time at all.

On the other hand, it is important to acknowledge that computers can have a negative effect on people. For instance, the prolonged use of computers can cause physical health problems, such as back strain, eye strain, and repetitive strain injuries, while genetically they also cause emotional problems like depression and anxiety.

Given the above mentioned points, I urge your readers to use computers with caution, while reaping the benefits that these devices can bring.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
