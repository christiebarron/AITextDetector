The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' has been to write stories about one subject â€“ why the 'other', and why they always get the attention of both sides of the media. On this, which is a very specific subject, I try very hard to present all of the stories, a few to the point that they are always in the vein of an interview - it doesn't take all my days - all of it always feels like an act - it is always just a little off. To say just because you are writing, 'from home' is actually a very specific subject. We do a very specific story with one subject, the other, but there are more to it than that. You come across some story in a different room than you would think, and you try to read it to see if you understand it, and when you give it too much attention it always feels like a lot of work, like you could be getting hit or killed, or what have you been playing around with or something. If you want to write your own story, you'll never know what is going to come out of another story. It always feels like you know the subject better than anyone else, and all you have to do is write it.
