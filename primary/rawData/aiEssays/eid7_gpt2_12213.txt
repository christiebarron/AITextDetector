An example of a time someone in my life was patient was at the schoolhouse where I started high school. My father was there all the time and I was just being patient," she said.

The boy was then told it was because, for "the first time" he was using his real name on social media. And so as soon as his parents notified him by phone, the boy began using the real name on Twitter, which was a step further.

"I was very happy, and when you see that, all you have to do is be patient. You go to school, you go to the gym, you go to work. It just kind of makes you more patient. If somebody gets you in trouble on Twitter, that's the end of it," she said.

And once, she was worried that if her son would post pictures and memes that he used to see online where girls could be seen as they were – as well as that he would be banned from Twitter and be unable to access his Twitter account – even if he tried to post them on Facebook.

If he didn't do this, he lost his job, his money and his home and his life.

His parents even had to deal with a financial issue - because "that's what I did to my son," she said.

The boy could also try to go find jobs - and this "something was happening to me and how I was struggling," she said
