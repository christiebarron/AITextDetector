I was in my junior year of college and had spent months working on a final project for a psychology class. After weeks of going back-and-forth with my professor on revisions, I was getting frustrated. The project was due the following week and I still hadn't been able to get her seal of approval.

Rather than get upset or give up, I remained patient and determined. I took a few deep breaths and reminded myself that I could still make changes and I would finish this project with flying colors.

In the end, my patience paid off. My professor gave me the green light on the project and I was finally able to submit it. It was a stressful process and there were times when I wanted to give up, but if it wasn’t for my ability to remain patient, I wouldn’t have been able to finish the project successfully.
