As citizens of a 21st century, democratic society, we have come to expect freedom or speech and access to information from the institutions set up to disseminate it. Libraries have long served this purpose, and thus, I believe it is inappropriate to impose censorship on library materials.  

Censorship has a duty of care to protect the vulnerable in society. However, this can be done in other ways. Libraries should remain unbiased, allowing citizens direct access to information. People can then make their own relationships and decisions. Censorship within libraries should not be the answer.

It is the library’s responsibility to provide citizens of all ages with access to educational, cultural, and literary resources. Imposing censorship on these resources takes away an individual’s right to choose what they want to read and what opinions they will form from the materials. Everyone has the right to make up their own opinions, and to be informed of multiple different angles and perspectives. It is dangerous to limit access to information in order to control thought or to impose someone’s moral agenda. 

Librarians should provide guidance and discuss with young people the consequences of certain behaviors. Education, not censorship, should be the focus of any concerns. They can do this by introducing new resources and expanding the collection to include material on the challenging topics, as well as support materials. In addition, library personnel can be trained in assisting readers with the resources available to them.
