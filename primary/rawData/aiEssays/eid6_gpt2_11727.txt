The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. A single docking platform, for example, may not even fit inside the building's elevator shaft, which would have had to be modified to accommodate them. (See the original letter for a more detailed example.)

In the first stage, two separate and exclusive platforms were built, complete with a rotating crane to move the tower across the lobby. The second stage required a crane that could be controlled by human operators. In the latter stage, a separate crane was used to hold the building vertically but moved to a different level to accommodate the two platforms.

In the latter stage, the second tower was lowered from a height of three stories to a position of three stories and a total height of 19 stories. The original tower, though somewhat of a disappointment for its first year or so, was built in 1958 and had its first major construction. The initial stage could easily be completed by mid-1958 to serve as the first commercial space of the state, though it did not offer fully vertical viewing and was only capable from an angle of about 100 feet.

After six more years, new heights were added to the site for commercial and industrial production. Buildings were completed with many additional towers. In addition, various airframe and building regulations were modified and many more Pioneer City-area facilities were built that were later installed at the site. The construction and operating limits of the building were further emphasized by its
