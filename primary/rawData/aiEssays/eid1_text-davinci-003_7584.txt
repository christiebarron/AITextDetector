The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho serves to offer the narrator hope for the future. Despite not being able to take the test in winter, the narrator looks forward to the warmer weather and the chance to take the test again when their hibiscus start to bud in the spring. The reference to geese returning also serves to show how nature returns to a cycle of renewal, reflecting the narrator's own opportunity for a second chance. The ending reflects the idea that, no matter how difficult a situation may seem, there is always a chance for renewal and a possibility of success.
