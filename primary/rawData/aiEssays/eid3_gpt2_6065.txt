Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. However, an average 'C' value shows an increase in cycling distance from the road that reflects changes in road conditions, and a decrease at the top of the scale that corresponds with a change in the number of kilometres that one normally has to cross.

Biking

The total number of miles climbed is an important factor in determining risk but it is important that cyclists experience the most benefits from doing the hard work:

Rise in bicycle speed

Biking speed rises with increased speed at a rate of about 10 kilometres per hour - but as speed rises it can also increase. This is an important factor because it means the amount of movement people have to make on average, relative to what the average cyclist needs at the end of work day. As long as you start up slowly (the cycling pattern can get very complicated when you don't know how to set up fast brakes or a bike lock, as cycling speed tends to increase with increased speed as people age and spend more time on the bike) the speed you have climbs slowly over a longer distance.

A good example of this would be climbing hills on the street. You can do this simply with the use of a bicycle, but sometimes having a good balance between climbing speed and being able to stay out of traffic can increase your chances of making the required time.
