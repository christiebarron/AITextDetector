Dear Editor, 

I am writing to voice my opinion on the effects computers have had on people over the last few decades. It is my belief that the impact of technology has been incredibly positive and indeed, transformative. 

For starters, consider how computers have revolutionized the way we communicate. With a few clicks, we can reach people all over the world in a matter of minutes. Whether for business, pleasure, or philanthropy, computers have made communication easier and more efficient than ever before. 

Computers have also been instrumental in advancing science and medicine. Through the use of powerful algorithms and artificial intelligence, computers can diagnose diseases, forecast the weather, and analyze vast amounts of data in ways human minds never could. 

In addition to the tremendous advancement in industry, computers have also enabled us to access more knowledge and information than ever before. Through the internet, we can now share ideas and collaborate with people all over the world. 

Finally, computers have helped to foster creativity and expression. Not only can we create digital art through a myriad of platforms, but we can also post and share our work with an audience of millions. 

Overall, computers have had a tremendous effect on people and society as a whole. Although, it is important to recognize a few of the potential drawbacks, I believe the positive influence is much greater.

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
