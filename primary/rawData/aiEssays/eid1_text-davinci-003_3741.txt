Dear Editor: 

I am writing to express my opinion regarding the use of computers and how they have impacted modern life. In our day and age, many people rely heavily on computers for entertainment, communication and productivity, but there are both positives and negatives to allowing technology to take over our lives. 

On the one hand, computers have changed our lives drastically. We use them to access documents, conduct research, query databases, and keep in touch with our family and friends. They also help us work more efficiently and create opportunities to share resources in both professional and personal settings. Yet, on the other hand, too much time spent on computers can take away from more meaningful activities and can have negative physical and mental health effects. 

Given the complexities surrounding the use of computers, it is important to consider the potential consequences of their use before indulging in too many online activities. As such, I believe it is important to set reasonable limits and ensure that technology does not impede upon more meaningful activities. 

I would like to encourage readers to remember that despite the many advantages of computers, the negative aspects should not be ignored. By establishing reasonable guidelines and maintaining time away from the screen, we can better equip ourselves to make the most of our technological tools and make sure they do not overwhelm our lives. 

Sincerely,
