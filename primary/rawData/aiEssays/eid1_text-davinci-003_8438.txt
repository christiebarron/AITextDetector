I recently had to go grocery shopping, and it was one of the busiest days of the year. The store was absolutely packed with people, and I was finding it a bit overwhelming. Despite this, I reminded myself to stay patient and take everything in stride. I watched as people around me started to bunch up in the aisles, shoving and pushing each other. I could feel the frustration welling up inside me, but I managed to remain patient and just take deep breaths.

At the checkout line, I was met with a ridiculously long line; there were easily 50 people in front of me. Rather than complain, I silently accepted the fact that it was going to take a while. To pass the time, I took out my phone and started reading some news. After what felt like ages, I eventually reached the front of the line.
 
The cashier was having technical difficulties, and she was fumbling with the buttons trying to figure out what was wrong. I could sense that the people behind me were starting to get impatient and frustrated. Again, instead of getting angry, I stayed patient and understanding. I told the cashier to take her time and not worry if there was too much of a line.

Eventually, after a few more minutes of troubleshooting, the cashier was finally able to get the register to work. When I was finished, I thanked the cashier for her hard work and went on my way.
