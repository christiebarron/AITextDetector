The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the iconic structure upon its completion in 1931. Prime among the issues was the fact that steel had not been used extensively prior to the construction of the building and therefore knowledge on how to build mooring masts to accommodate the massive Zeppelins, or dirigibles, was limited. Without a secure means of anchoring the large airships, it was impossible to make use of the iconic building as a docking station for their passengers.

The engineers working on the Empire State Building drafted plans for a mooring mast, but the plans were nothing more than ambitious dreams. The original plans featured an eight-foot steel chain connected to the building to secure the dirigible and a net spread across the roof to make boarding and debarking easier. These plans, however, had to be abandoned due to safety and economic considerations. The mooring mast was deemed too dangerous due to the added weight and the extra resources required to engineer and build such a gargantuan structure.

Making matters worse, major aviation companies balked at the idea of docking their airships at the building due to the added risk associated with a new construction. Without a company committing to using the dock, the endeavor was doomed to failure. Among the critics of the plan was the eminent aeronautical engineer, Hugo Eckener, who argued that such a mast had never been built before and that the building
