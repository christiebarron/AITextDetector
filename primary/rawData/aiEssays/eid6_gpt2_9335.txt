The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Most famously, some city officials feared having to approve a new law for building dirigibles that would make the building unsafe for people.

The Federal Aviation Administration did not approve the new law and instead mandated the FAA to "make sure" that pilots who refuse to use the brakes of their aircraft do not cause their own deaths but rather that the engine, brakes and airbag systems are inspected twice a year.

In 2010, The Daily Mail obtained letters written by pilots in Chicago who complained of being refused an automatic-brake brake in Chicago. In one letter, the pilots described their experience, with some complaining that their seats failed them in the cockpit.

It was one of the last accidents in aviation history after the World Trade Center was struck by a 9-11 plane in 2001. In the fall of 2009, a 787 rescue plane was sent to recover a plane that crashed into a concrete wall on a Manhattan street.

For example, six of the nine passengers aboard the plane that crashed were killed in the crash and three took their own lives â€“ but they said they didn't want to fly to Los Angeles.

"I was one of the pilots on the airplane," said one, wearing a blue t-shirt that read 'I Love Your Love' and holding a camera.

In an interview after the verdict was announced, President Obama expressed relief.
