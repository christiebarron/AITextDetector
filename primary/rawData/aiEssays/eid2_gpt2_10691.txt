I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a threat to the free exchange of ideas and this censorship makes it very important for anyone and everyone to speak out against it," he said in a statement. "We're calling for the removal of content from libraries, even if for free. Everyone should have the right to have the freedom to freely use and distribute that content."

A representative of the American Library Association and the Department of Education has said they are "disappointed" by a recent statement by University of Maryland libraries demanding they remove a page on their website about the school's anti-bullying policy.

A Facebook post from UC Berkeley Chancellor Nicholas Dirks on Wednesday reads:

"UC Berkeley is on record as the school that has the most anti-bullying policies that include anti-LGBT bullying," Dirks said in a statement. "We support the decision to go along with the policy with other universities to include information about anti-bullying programs in its list of'safe' spaces. The UC system has a history in supporting anti-bullying programs and we are supportive. We're committed to protecting each other. We will continue to do so."

This past month, an American Library Association statement called on schools and universities to stop publishing anything about LGBT discrimination in libraries. The statement states that LGBT students are routinely harassed at school and the law mandates that "LGBT students should be allowed to speak freely without fear of having their rights and freedom of association revoked
