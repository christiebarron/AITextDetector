I believe that censorship of materials in libraries are really a form of censorship," says Tass. "I think one of the goals it has at the moment is to limit the freedom of people to give lectures, to create opportunities, to engage in public debate, but the government is now also making the use of the library more problematic, so in a very important way, to reduce free expression."

However, Tass notes that there are some important points not covered in the ruling's opinion. Firstly, the court pointed to the lack of access to free speech grounds on which the court could have ruled. "There is no case here that the public domain is to be taken away merely from those protected in some way," she notes.

It's also worth noting that the opinion contains a provision giving authorities a broad "presumption" that no one on the public domain is infringing copyright. "We can do something about this, including requiring the release of recordings and making use of information derived from the record collections of the court," she says.

At any given moment, Tass notes, someone could lawfully file a copyright complaint against a researcher or library, but this requirement is not supported by the court's view either. "[The] public domain is an important element of the freedom of the individual, something that should go beyond this narrow definition of the public domain. Without restrictions on free expression, there is very little basis for taking the public domain for granted," he says.
