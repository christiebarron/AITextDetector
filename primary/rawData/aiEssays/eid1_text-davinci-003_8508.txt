I recall an instance in my life that required me to practice patience. I had worked on a project with a colleague for weeks, and he was anxious to get it finished and shipped off. We were just about finished when an issue came up that he wanted to take a shortcut to finish. I could tell that he was frustrated at the prolonging of this project, but I insisted on taking the right approach, even if it meant extra time and effort.

Although I could sense his distress and eagerness in trying to get it done faster, I was able to remain composed and patient while explaining that the wrong approach is still a wrong approach even with a faster solution. After a few moments, my colleague was able to understand and agree, and we ended up taking the right route and completing the project the correct way. The satisfaction that I felt was more than worth the extra time it took to complete the project, and I felt proud that I was able to remain patient and understanding when explaining my viewpoint.
