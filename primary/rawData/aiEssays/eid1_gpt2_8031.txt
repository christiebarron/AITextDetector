It has long beenitto that people of different generations may go to different places more than one time. And the influence of the economy in determining people's preferences as they migrate may extend beyond the United States, though there is room for some exceptions among non-cooperators. A long-running study has shown that if one person's economic and social values can be determined with reference to a given time period and set of events, one's preference for a given destination can be maintained. In effect, if a one-time factor that affects one's preferences for one time period, and a time variable that influences a different time series, can lead a person there a great deal of time may have had other things of interest to do that would affect their preferences over time. One can point to several examples in evolutionary history of individuals who chose the destination from time to time, but it is not clear why some people would choose the destination from time to time, and how likely such preferences are to be affected.

If one is able to estimate the variation that would be required to maintain preferences for a given location, such as by determining the distance of a point from its source via historical experience, then the variation and influence of the
