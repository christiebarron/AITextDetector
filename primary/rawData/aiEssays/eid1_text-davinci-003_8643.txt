My best friend and I had been friends for years, and our friendship was full of laughter. We were always joking around and making each other laugh.

One day we were walking back from school, and we were passing by a store full of ridiculous things. We got into a fit of laughter looking at all the silly things in the window. We were laughing so hard that we almost didn't hear the store owner come up behind us. He told us that if we liked the items in the window, we could come inside and take whatever we wanted. We couldn't believe it! We laughed even harder, and quickly ran inside to take our pick. We had so much fun running around the store and picking out the craziest things we could find. In the end, we each walked out with a bunch of random items.

We couldn't stop laughing as we walked home. Even weeks later, when we would get together, we would remember that moment and just start laughing all over again. It was one of the best days of our entire friendship. I couldn't think of a better way to bring us closer!
