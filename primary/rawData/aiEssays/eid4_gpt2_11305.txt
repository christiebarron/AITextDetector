The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it is filled with what it is that is most compelling about this particular version of the story. However, there are too many of these. The book does not have enough of these stories or characters, or enough of the characters it wants to write in. There is too much of it.

Another thing that I can think of is how many of the various seasons did and did not get a proper story. So the series did not get a proper conclusion. Sometimes it takes for itself to get a satisfactory ending, but I'll leave it that way anyway. They only found a perfect ending to this book, and then it felt like there was no way it could've got an ending. There was no end at all because there was no plot to it.

And finally, there is a great ending to The Winter Hibiscus.

The last four books (and also the beginning, 2nd book and 3rd one) are just so disappointing and boring. All in all the book is a lot closer to the end of the book I already mentioned, and the final book (the whole series after that) was the one I thought I was looking for.

I don't know what's the point of a series without some nice little things, but there is something wrong with this book. The way it leaves out the important parts is to ignore the others. The whole series in this one comes down to
