The Empire State Building has always held a special place in the annals of history, due in part to its iconic style and height. Another unique feature of the Empire State Building is its prominent mooring mast, which was once designed to allow dirigible aircrafts to dock. However, the ambitious project to install a mooring mast posed huge challenges to the builders of the Empire State Building.

The first major issue was safety: the structures of the mast had to be designed in such a way that they could withstand the wind gusts generated by the passing dirigibles. To achieve this, the engineers had to use thick steel and bolts, and anchor a 200-foot-long mooring cable to the building. It also needed to be placed far enough away from the edge of the roof for the dirigious to stay above the crowds of crowds of people down below. 

The second obstacle the builders faced in allowing dirigibles to dock was ensuring the mooring mast could handle the rigours of the airships, in particular their size and weight. As part of this, the build had to construct an elevator that could lift the large passenger gondolas up to the mooring mast. This meant they had to install a massive electric winch, aptly christened the “sky hook”, to operate the two-story elevator. 

Last, but certainly not least, was the issue of stability. Allowing dir
