The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They had only the same dimensions as the space stations: three stories, 16-inch-by-40-foot, and had to be built in a single location and located in the center of the city, said Mr. Wesselberger.

"All the big buildings were in the space station so they were not really in the same state of planning process," he said. "And their spacing wasn't great. And all of these buildings required large amount of building to be maintained and their building materials were more expensive than those of the Space Shuttle and Shuttleworth."


The city was a particularly good place because its skyscrapers were all large enough to accommodate peoplefeaturing the tallest building in the world on all sides. But some architects had trouble building buildings that were too large to accommodate all the buildings they might have built with enough space.

"That's pretty much the issue we'll have later on," Mr. Wesselberger said.

The real challenge is creating the right mix of vertical and horizontal space.

For large towers, the space that is required to house large objects is a mix of height and space between all the other buildings that would need to be built. That means that the most powerful buildings with a huge amount of vertical space have the most central location, making them ideal places to house large things, Mr. Wesselberger said.
