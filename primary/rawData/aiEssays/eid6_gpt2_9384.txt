The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, there were conflicting views about whether to build the tower as a "tent-shaped" structure, or rather simply a single-window dwelling. In 1942, Robert Graves, president of the architectural firm of U.S. Insulation, insisted that an airplane deck be built on the site and that workers had to construct it using conventional techniques and materials.

The Second World War, however, was over. The government finally established an International Standards Committee (ISCC). In 1953 the ISCC, chaired by Secretary of State Robert McClellan, decided that all U.S. military installations should be used solely for military installation; it also considered military installation in many areas of the world as part of an international control. McClellan became president of the ISCC and in 1961 established the European Union, an important global organization whose members all share the same goals: to prevent the development of arms.

The second International Convention on Safety and Security (ICSS) of 1949 was agreed upon; the first came to be published in 1952, and the second went into effect in 1972. During the intervening decades the convention has become increasingly politicized and a number of international organizations have developed guidelines for the regulation of international affairs by ICSS. Here is a look at some of the best-known conventions and conventions in the history of the International Commission of the Red Cross:
