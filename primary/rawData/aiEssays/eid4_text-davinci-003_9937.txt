The narrator of the story, a young girl, is using the hibiscus as a metaphor for her own personal growth, and as a reminder to her of her fortitude and strength. By ending the story with these words, the narrator is reassuring herself that come springtime she will be even stronger and more resilient than before, and that she will be ready to take on the challenge of the test once again. The ending serves as a comforting reminder that no matter how hard the winter may seem, a new season will eventually arrive and bring with it renewed hope and optimism.
