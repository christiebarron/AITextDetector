The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock, as the technology at that time was still relatively new and untested. The most significant issue was the safety of the passengers on board the airships, as well as the safety of the building itself. The Empire State Building, due to its massive size and unique design, needed to be specially equipped with a mooring mast capable of supporting such large dirigibles.

One of the primary concerns was how to construct the mooring mast itself. In order to secure a dirigible, the mast had to be incredibly strong and built to exact specifications. Due to the potential wind gusts and the sheer weight of the airships, it was important that the mast could withstand the force of the dirigible and could keep it firmly in place. Additionally, the builders had to address the issue of the mooring lines â€“ the cables and rigging that connected the mast to the dirigible. 

The mooring lines needed to be strong enough to support the weight of the airship, but also be able to be easily detached in the event of an emergency. This was a challenge for the engineers, as they had to design equipment that could not only handle the weight of the dirigibles, but also hold the airships steady enough to give passengers time to disembark.

In addition to the mooring mast, the designers had to take into account the overall structural
