Computers have many effects on people. People move between different computers, use different memory technologies, and their lives change. We are all affected by these impacts, and often our lives change without us realizing it.

As a result, we are often made redundant when we make changes, making it difficult to do what is right for our people.

I have seen this happen with the adoption of social media. We are making changes to be proactive. We are encouraging people to share, to be open with each other, and to learn their lives (and do it for a few hundred dollars a year) with the ability to understand who they are. When these improvements are more successful for ourselves, my hope is that we will come up with some more social media systems to help prevent this. This is a process where one of our social media companies is helping us understand who we are and what we are doing together.
