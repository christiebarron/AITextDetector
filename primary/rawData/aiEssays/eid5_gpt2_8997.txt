The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' by G. Scott Priestley is that many Americans may be more concerned with their health than their country's. Many Americans are concerned with the government over their heads," the author says.

Priestley was not the first author to discuss the dangers of diet. In 2009, she asked about the dangers of high-calorie, fat-fed food.

"You can't be fatter than your enemy. The more fat you eat, the less calories you have and the better you look," she said to the NHMRC, writing in The New York Times.

Among those who ate more saturated fat was Dr. Paul Gottlieb, a physician and professor at Johns Hopkins, and the vice president of the NIMH.

Gottlieb also mentioned that more saturated fat from fat-eaters could cause health problems in children. The fact that less saturated fat could increase rates of autism may help explain why the CDC recommends Americans eat more fruit and vegetables than they were before the Affordable Care Act and lower their cholesterol to less.
