The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because the author is doing a wonderful job and I'm excited to see what we can come up with in the future.

And it's quite an adventure and it's a little different than, I think, most fan sites, but I got a little worried a couple of weeks ago that I would get too much exposure to it, because maybe I'd get too carried away with the experience, and the book is too very different and I'm so over it that I'd rather just have it as a sort of a 'wow' type experience on my own.

For me, it's more about the characters and the story and how the characters relate to each other in a more complex way.

In the original I actually didn't read Winter Hibiscus, I wasn't even a fan of the series until when I grew up, and I think this book is quite unique even now in terms of what I've experienced, but it also seems to be a very different experience, which is very interesting.

I love the world of this book and what it offers as a sort of way to connect to the characters.

So I guess maybe the most interesting partingly, you'll be able to travel back in time in the second half of the book where the novel really started!

If the first half of the novel is very familiar you will definitely like the way the characters are connected to each other
