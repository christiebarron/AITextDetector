I once had a friend who was incredibly patient. He had a roommate that was quite messy and never did their fair share of the chores. Though my friend was frustrated, he never let it show. He would often do the lionâ€™s share of the cleaning and organizing while remaining patient and polite. 

His roommate eventually noticed and began to be more thoughtful. My friend had been so patient that it had finally paid off. His kindness and patience had eventually encouraged his roommate to take on more responsibility, and in the end, made their friendship much stronger. 

It was truly inspiring to witness such patience, and it taught me a valuable lesson about being kind even when things are difficult.
