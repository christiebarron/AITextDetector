In recent years, much debate has been had around the role of censorship in libraries. Should libraries continue to provide patrons access to a wide variety of materials, or should certain potentially offensive material be removed from the shelves? After careful consideration, it is my belief that libraries should not practice censorship of materials on the basis of potential offense. 

To begin, censorship of materials can have a damaging effect on freedom of information. Libraries are the custodians of knowledge, and closing off certain topics from public discourse is an assault on the right to access information. Censorship of materials in libraries can also prevent people from being exposed to potentially thought-provoking ideas, often due to the personal biases of those in power. 

Furthermore, censorship can limit the role of the library as an educational institution. During times of unrest or when dealing with particularly controversial issues, libraries are at the forefront of providing factual and unbiased information. By refusing to offer certain materials, libraries are putting limits on their ability to educate and inform the public. 

Finally, it is important to remember that patrons have a right to choose how they want to access information. We should trust that library patrons have the capacity to make their own decisions about the materials
