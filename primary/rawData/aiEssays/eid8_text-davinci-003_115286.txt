I will never forget the first time my husband and I started laughing together like there was no tomorrow. 

We had been married for a little over a year, and things had been going well but we had yet to really get completely comfortable with each other. We were out to dinner and had been chatting about mundane everyday things as we often do. 

Suddenly, my husband made a completely ridiculous joke that I didn't see coming. I burst into rivers of laughter, and before I knew it, my husband joined in completely. We were both cracking up, completely forgetting about our meal or the other people around us. I felt so connected to him and all the stress of the day had evaporated away and made a way for an incredible connection.

It felt like all the small walls and doubts that had been building up between us melted away to a place of contentment. Even now, we look back on that moment and fondly recall the same bout of laughter. It's a beautiful reminder that laughter can bridge any gap.
