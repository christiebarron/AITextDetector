The setting of "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski has an enormous impact on the cyclist featured in the story. The scene of dark clouds, thunder, and rough terrain creates an intimidating environment that can easily discourage the cyclist from continuing on. The cyclist, who is only described as “young and small”, is probably faced with discomfort and fear in this environment. 

The darkness of the roads and the shadows created by the trees also add an element of mystery which can potentially cause uncertainty and distress for the cyclist. Even when the cyclist reaches points of dryness and sunshine, Kurmaski suggests that the heavy clouds that still linger in the hills make the terrain difficult to observe, which can be frightening to someone travelling alone. 

The environment ultimately places the cyclist in a vulnerable state as the sound of the thunder and a sense of isolation, without other cyclists to share their journey with, suggests a lack of safety for an individual who is alone. However, despite these difficulties, the cyclist continued to “roll through the winding turns and deep valleys”, which tells the reader that despite the treacherous setting he was determined enough to push through. 

As such, the setting of "Rough Road Ahead" serves as an obstacle that must be overcome by the cyclist in order to complete the course. The features of the setting affect the cyclist by creating a frightening atmosphere with numerous challenges which need to be faced head-on and with courage
