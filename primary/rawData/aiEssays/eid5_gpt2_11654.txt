The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is that while the story of this time is well written but the characters are also incredibly rich and varied. It is my hope that she feels she setup the journey in such a way which might not take place in real life.

I love that I never get to experience so much more than what you are talking about. And that is why I enjoy being able to take my imagination and see it through to a story that can be written in a different medium of storytelling.

Tanya and I look forward to seeing the new film on Netflix and Amazon.
