The author ends with this sentence to suggest the possibility of hope within the story. The repeating cycle of winter and spring represents the cycle of life. The hibiscus becoming a bud in the spring suggests potential and growth, while the "test" could be a metaphor for challenges and difficult decisions that the main character has faced throughout the story. By promising to take the test again when the buds bloom, the protagonist is indicating a belief in his or her capacity to face difficulties with courage and determination. This final sentiment of hope serves as an uplifting conclusion to an otherwise bleak story.
