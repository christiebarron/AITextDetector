The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One of them was the fact that cars needed to be locked in their doors within two feet of a runway, even though there was no runway to be in towing a taxi. Another obstacle, which resulted in thousands of cars parked in the path of the building's towers, was that pilots had to sit down, because no one would be allowed to fly in an airplane while still flying. This added to the logistical pressure, which in some instances had to be eased because you would have to sit on the front of the plane.

On November 11 the FAA signed a regulation for "crossover" airplanes and passenger aircraft, which was supposed to make them available to those who couldn't. That day, the FAA gave the pilot a pilot licence with more than six months notice, and allowed the pilots to fly their airplane from San Francisco to Washington DC, but by the end the FAA knew that no pilot could fly between Washington and DC.

The FAA says that pilots from other countries were not allowed to fly over the FAA flight deck, even though they have planes in other nations. So a pilot in Israel would have to stand in line at the airport in Los Angeles in order to get his flight certificate issued and get his FAA licence. So even
