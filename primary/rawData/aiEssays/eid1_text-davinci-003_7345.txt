In Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead," the setting of the story plays a key role in influencing the cyclist's experience. The majority of the story takes place in the desert; the hot air, sandy ground, and vastness of the landscape are all described in detail. This type of harsh, isolated environment is both mentally and physically demanding for the cyclist.

The cyclist struggles to maintain his pace as he fights against the increasingly hot and sandy terrain. The extreme heat of the sun compounded with the dry air makes it difficult to push forward into the unknown. The severity of this harshness is further emphasized by the isolated setting, as the cyclist finds himself in an area with few landmarks, giving the landscape an eerie feel.

The cyclist’s experience is made even more uncomfortable by his intense loneliness. With no other cyclists or drivers nearby, the cyclist is left to his own thoughts, which become increasingly more daunting. This further adds to the strain of the intense setting.

Overall, the features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead” put the cyclist in an incredibly difficult situation. Although he is determined to continue forward on his journey, the physical and mental strain created by the setting are too much for the cyclist to surmount. The setting’s bleakness, isolation, and harshness create an atmosphere that eventually causes the cyclist to give up on his mission.
