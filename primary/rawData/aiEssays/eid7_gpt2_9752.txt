An example of a time someone in my life was patient was in the form of my boyfriend who had a life-threatening heart attack. He had lived in NYC for a number of years. When they were married, my kids were at the funeral. My husband lived in Orlando all year and then came home and said he had heart attack. And when she came back you have to take her to hospital, especially if you had given her her heart. We went to work all year long and I'd get sick with it. We've lived the worst that could happen to us.

So what can you do to help someone like that? You should go to those people. What is most important, what do you really know about a person? Is there a life-saving thing that you can do that can save your life?

There can be life-saving things at the hospital and that's something I do from time to time. As I say Crusch says, when I have the courage to go to a hospital and if it's an emergency, I'll go here and see that and take a couple that have a severe issue out there; it's not just that when you get in an emergency, you see they're not in there, they're going out. I call it the "drowning in a deep water." If they're in there without a life-saving measure, I'm taking them out, and I would never ever go into an emergency room looking
