In Joe Kurmaski's short story, "Rough Road Ahead," the cyclist faces a challenging and dangerous journey, but the true danger lies in the elements of the setting. This is an important element of the story, as it stresses the importance of the cyclist being mindful of their surroundings and prepared for the unknown. The setting features complete darkness and silence, emphasizing the vastness of the night and the cyclist's solitude as they venture forward. This lack of light and sound creates a heightened sense of isolation and fear for the cyclist, as they continue to travel through the night, their uncertainty escalating as their fatigue mounts. 

The second part of the setting features an unforgiving, dangerous terrain. With sharp, jagged rocks and a winding mountain path, the cyclist is put through immense physical strain to traverse the road, a feat that is only made more difficult by the lack of visibility in the night and the constant threat of unseen obstacles. This treacherous landscape helps convey the difficulty of the journey to the reader, as well as create a sense of tension as the character's safety is constantly at risk. 

Overall, the features of the setting in "Rough Road Ahead" put the cyclist in an extremely vulnerable state, both mentally and physically. They must battle against their inner fears, as well as remain vigilant in the face of the dangerous terrain. The setting of the story helps effectively convey the raw, difficult conditions the cyclist must face in order to reach their destination,
