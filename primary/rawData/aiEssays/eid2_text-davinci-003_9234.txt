The recent debates over censorship in libraries have been pushing the limits for to what extent such regulation can be applied. While the legitimate concern for protecting children from material seen as overly graphic or inappropriate is important, it is just as important for libraries to have full freedom of expression. 

Removing certain materials from library shelves or preventing children’s access to said materials could set a dangerous precedent of censorship. It should not be up to library staff to decide what materials are considered too offensive or too sensitive. Libraries provide a platform for open discussion and the unrestricted access to material, regardless of whether it may be deemed suitable or not. 

Rather than censorship, libraries should employ more productive and viable solutions. This includes creating age-appropriate sections and giving parents or guardians more autonomy over what their children are exposed to. Providing warning labels and providing education tools to teach children methods for responsible media consumption are also constructive steps forward in serving the library’s mission. 

Eliminating material entirely and creating a culture of censorship is not the solution. Allowing the public and children to be exposed to various types of media, while also providing guidance and discernment, is the sensible way forward. That is why allowing full freedom of expression in libraries is important. Encouraging critical thinking and open dialogue is essential in fostering an educational environment in our libraries that will benefit future generations. 

In conclusion, libraries should support freedom of expression and remain committed to protecting it
