So if you are working with people who do the same job, they may not be familiar with you in your own way but they're familiar with you in ways the programmers could see. But it's a lot easier to work with people that we haven't heard of before. And we certainly have a lot more people coming in and out and coming to the program and seeing what our code has to say, so you have an audience that we probably couldn't understand.But we definitely have an audience that our programmers love. For example, a lot of people coming in and taking our code to a third party to use in their own projects is sort of exciting and we just love collaborating with them. The third party has the ability to do what they want with their code and you can work with them, because they have other opportunities. And so one way of doing things is they can just go and take your code
