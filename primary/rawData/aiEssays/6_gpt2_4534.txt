The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

First one was that such a device, while great, could not handle a whole lot of force and thus required a huge amount of space.

However, despite being able to do their part, the Dome of the Empire State Building was built with very little clearance by the building's engineers and has not been designed to perform these stocks of work well. Even so, with a much better design, the dome would be ready to use around October 2014, according to the National Guard Museum.

But to be fair to the government, the dome was not installed in time to accommodate the recent earthquakes in Japan, though the Navy recently used the dome to test the new amphibious fleet's mobile carrier-launched cruise missile.

In the meanwhile, the State Building is being built in an area with low temperatures that would make it
