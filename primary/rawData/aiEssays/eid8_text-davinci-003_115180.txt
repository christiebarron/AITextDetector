I will never forget the day that my grandpa and I shared a good laugh together. We had been visiting my grandpa in his nursing home for a few days and had come to the end of our trip. We were both getting tired and were taking turns combing each other's hair.

This was something we had done many times before, but as I began to comb his hair, I noticed a thick curl that had formed on the back of his neck. It was one of the most adorable things I had ever seen and it put a smile on my face. 

My grandfather noticed my smile and inquired what had caused it. Surprised he had noticed the curl, I told him that it was the fact that he had managed to make such an adorable curl. We both laughed as he placed his hand on the back of his neck to feel the curl for himself.

The moment was sweet and I will never forget the feeling of joy that it brought. I couldn't help but laugh along with my grandfather as we shared that special moment. The laughter that we had shared was a moment of joy that I will always remember.
