Dear Editor,

I would like to take the time to share my opinion on the effects computers have on people. In a time when almost everything in our world is digital – from news and shopping to movie streaming and business workflow – the role computers play has become critical.

While our dependence on computers has created efficiency and convenience in many ways, we must remember that there can be drawbacks to our use. Studies have shown that computers can have a negative effect on our physical and mental health. Too much computer time has been linked to obesity, neck pain, eye strain, and back pain for example. The emotional toll of spending too much time on computers can cause stress, anxiety, and even depression. Additionally, social media use has been found to cause feelings of envy, isolation, and loneliness.

That is why it is important to recognize the importance of balance. Regular exercise, time away from screens, and spending time with family and friends can be important in countering the negative effects of computers.

As technology continues to advance, I hope that we can all collectively be conscious of how computers can shape our lives and be mindful of our behaviors.

Sincerely,

[Name]
