The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it's really hard to do something as straightforward as read, even as the subject of love. This is something a reader needs to work hard for to know what's coming up if they want to find anything else in the book. The whole writing process is so frustrating, you're left feeling a little helpless in the face of it. Also, there's a sense of humor to be found in the author's voice, despite what she says. The book ends with a long conversation between the author and two lovers who were married back at least five years ago. This one ends quickly, but in this part of the world there's this feeling of hope. And so, I think it's an interesting story.

It seems that the next chapter will be "The First Time in Years," and it has something to do with an incident a time later where the protagonist discovers something that is potentially very important: the man who is the best at his job has been secretly dating a fellow coworker. I think the idea of being an assistant to your ex-boss, like what she calls "the person who makes me think, makes me feel good about myself," or something like that, is the way it's done for me. That's one such a beautiful concept. I haven't had the chance to read anything like it, but I loved both "The First Time in Years" and the "Winter Hibiscus" by this
