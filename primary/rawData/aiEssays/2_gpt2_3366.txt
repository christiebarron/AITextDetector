I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is, not unlike Nazi Germany, an open, decentralized way of using the Internet as a way of building a global network of connections, thus helping to build a community for information and the rule of law," the study concludes.

But such an approach does not guarantee there will always be a specific censor, says Jonathan S. Karp, a Stanford Law School professor and the paper's lead author, and his study did not offer any definitive evidence.

"We didn't make any judgments at all as a result of that study," says Karp, not including the fact that "most people would feel the same about this approach whether we were making a general or specific case on the fact that this was a real problem for anybody, particularly in the U.S."
