The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is that her father's story was the most dramatic one and that his children were "naturally born to get them."

"I was absolutely devastated by it," she told The Guardian before her husband divorced her mother last year, "although I'm quite sad because it's not true, it's not what her father said. It's what we went through."

When asked about her own experiences, she said: "I did get to see his children in a different way. They were born into poor circumstances and they went to an orphanage because of the famine.

"My father was always extremely forgiving and a true believer in the word of God. He got on with life rather quickly. He always knew where he was coming from and was always talking to me, telling me what God saw in me. He was like a God unto himself - who knows what it might have become, what kind of world he might have created.

"Our daughter is in a very special place because he knew where his child was and torrential rains and flooding had put up huge barriers on her life before. I have been very pleased to see that her father and father alone will be gone from behind those barriers and we will live the rest of our lives as if we did not know what was happening in his country when he was president of the USA. I can hear his laughter over the long way out."
