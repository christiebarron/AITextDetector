The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. While they could use some form of laser or optical sight to illuminate the exterior of the building, their laser-based systems did not provide transported materials to a building, as one of the building's three exterior staircases did. Many of the structures faced a serious shortage of high-speed cables, which were not available at the time.

Although some of the architects of the Empire State Building didn't want to use the lasers on the building as part of their work, they recognized that they were not going as far as designing such machines in the first place.

"We didn't want to build an entire skyscraper and, in fact, we thought it more to avoid building the whole building, but how do you stop a fire," said Paul Stirling, who designed and built the Empire State Building to become one of the world's most technologically advanced facilities. "The best way, as I said, to stop a fire is to use some kind of energy conversion system or power source that will work with a building like that and remove the fire."

A laser would light up the exterior surface of the building to create new fires like a hot spring, using the same laser light but to generate more smoke. Once ignited, the fire would boil off and then rapidly heat the building up with electricity to boil water.

The Empire State Building had to have lasers that could provide a whole
