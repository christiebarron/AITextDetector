The construction of the Empire State Building in 1931 represented a unique opportunity for architects to create a modern, iconic symbol of the American metropolis. However, this ambitious undertaking posed a number of challenging obstacles for the builders, particularly in regards to their plans to enable dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. 

This goal had been a driving force behind the building’s development, with Thomas Hilbert, the lead project manager, in particular, being especially dedicated to the idea of dirigibles utilizing the building. The idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building posed numerous difficult engineering challenges, however, ranging from technical issues to cost and safety concerns.

Technically, the unprecedented addition posed numerous questions for the builders of the Empire State Building. According to Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s 'The Mooring Mast', the builders were unsure of how to anchor the reinforced mooring mast near the top of the 102-story building. Furthermore, they had to take into account the numerous strain loads that would be placed on the mast due to the docking dirigibles. The builders also had to ensure that the mooring mast was capable of allowing different sizes and shapes of dirigibles, as well as accommodate the inexperienced pilots who would be tasked with handling them. 

In addition to the technical challenges, the Empire State Building’s builders also had to consider the financial implications of creating the mooring mast
