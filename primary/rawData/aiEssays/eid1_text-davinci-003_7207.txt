In "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski, the features of the setting are integral to the story. The cyclist, whose name we never learn, is presented with a challenge that tests the limits of their physical and mental endurance.

The setting of a long winding mountain road serves to emphasise the physical difficulty the cyclist faces. The steep inclines and unforgiving terrain make it difficult to maintain the pace they set at the start of the ride. It is a relentless situation, with the winding road stretching out for what seems like an eternity.

The lack of other people around adds to the isolation. The cyclist is left to face their own courage and strength, alone against the challenge before them. There is no one to turn to for assistance or to share in their victory upon reaching the destination.

The environment also plays a role. With constantly changing scenery and dramatic drops, the cyclist is provided with ever-shifting challenges. The special effects of the setting battle to become as constant as the physical challenge the cyclist is facing. 

The setting is intense and humbling. It strips the rider of their own pride and determination, as they become aware of their own smallness in comparison to the immense environment. It is an experience that will challenge the cyclist in ways unlike any other, leaving them with an appreciation for the nature around them.

In "Rough Road Ahead," the features of the setting provide a unique experience for the cyclist
