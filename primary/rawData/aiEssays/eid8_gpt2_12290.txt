One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was a kid, and that's when I learned the power of watching a group of bullies get together. I watched them come off as evil, ignorant, and selfish. This is what I like to hate about online communities, because we hate to be called an asshole.

And it was my dad who taught me to stop being the stupid bitch who is all about that (if you don't wanna be called that). I knew from the beginning that if you didn't stand for anything and stand up for something it didn't matter. I was just a smart person. I took the world by the scruff of the neck and worked together with the bully. He helped me get out of the house. I helped grow my house into something the right way at the right time. I tried to stay out of the bullying and keep my kids at home. I wasn't afraid to stand up for what I believe and fight back against bullies. I did this for me to be a part of what made me grow. I want to be there for my kids to grow up healthy and proud.
