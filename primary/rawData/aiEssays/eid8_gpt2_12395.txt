One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was doing "The Great Showman" to "Jaws." Every show is made of jokes, but it can sometimes be funny by the end. For people who work more intensively than their family, I'll say that laughter can really be a great excuse to not be having fun."

What are your favorite moments in comedy?

"The second that something that you know is coming aroundâ€¦what was funny was the response."

"The moment when someone else was laughing really, really hard."

What was your favorite thing that you've done for a living?

"I love my job and we're running the house, but it goes well with what a good life is like."

If you could go back to something that surprised you, what would it be?

"Every once in awhile, I wonder just how hard was the process of running the office and having fun."

What are your favorite laughs that never happen?

"For sure, that's one more than it's worth. But the other laugh is amazing."
