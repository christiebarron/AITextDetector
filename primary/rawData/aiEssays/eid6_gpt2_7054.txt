The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. To this day most airplanes are equipped with special "Hullock A" shaped tail fins to deflect projectiles from the fuselage before they touch ground, according to the U.S. Navy. It was a little bit of engineering that would have put an enormous load onto the construction of the building in the first place and it will remain so even today when it's being retrofitted as an official aviation exhibit.

Even a new version of the Boeing 787 is considered by many to be superior to any of her predecessors if it is built, as a high-altitude flying plane in full form.

But the design is far from complete, and it's still subject to much debate. Experts say that by the time the aircraft was put on display at a public unveiling Monday at Marietta airport, it had completed a long development, at an estimated cost of about $6 billion.

One major reason for the lack of public support for the project is what they say is the fact that it's just not considered as much of a threat to flying.

"I don't know if it's because we're at the cutting edge of aviation technology, or perhaps it's that they're having to work much faster to get this built for them," said Richard Anderson, a fellow at the American Civil Liberties Union who has devoted much of his professional life to defending the US' aviation
