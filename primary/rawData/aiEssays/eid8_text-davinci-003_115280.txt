I remember the first time I truly laughed with my husband. We had been together for a few months, but still didn't know each other too well. I had asked him if he could help me move some furniture and he arrived, all smiles, despite the fact that I had asked him to do something that he obviously didn't want to do.

At first, the job was mundane and easy, but when we got to the last piece of furniture, we realized that it was too heavy and bulky for us to move by ourselves. We looked at it for a few moments and then, without warning, he picked up the piece of furniture and started to stagger around the room as if he were an airplane. 

I couldn't help but burst out in laughter. We both laughed for what felt like hours, until eventually we were both in tears. That day, we had formed such a strong bond that laughter had no choice but to make an appearance. Since then, laughter has become a natural part of our relationship – whether it be through verbal jokes or physical comedy – and it is something that I am so grateful for.
