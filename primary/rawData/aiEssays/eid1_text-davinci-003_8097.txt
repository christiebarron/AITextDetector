The main obstacle faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock was the height of the building and the direction of the upper level winds. The stakeholders and engineers of the time period could not have known the level of difficulty it would take to manage the docking of a massive dirigible on the top of the building. It was, in essence, a monumental engineering challenge.

When it became clear that the Empire State Building was the only sky-scraping structure of its kind and the only one in the world capable of accommodating a dirigible dock, the team of scientist, engineers and architects began the task of figuring out the logistics. After all, the success of such a project would require a perfect combination of engineering prowess, creativity and innovation. 

First, the design engineers and architects had to engineer a building structure that could withstand strong winds and yet be strong enough to handle the immense weight of a dirigible dock. To this end, they made the building’s exterior walls thicker and incorporated additional steel trusses and wind bracing to ensure the building’s stability.

Second, the engineers had to determine the upper wind direction, temperature and pressure, and the thickness of the air which could affect the stability and maneuverability of the dirigible. In the end, the engineers concluded that the upper floor winds blew in the opposite direction from the docking mooring mast, making it impossible for a dirigible to
