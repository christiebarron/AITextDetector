The memoir "From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives" by Narciso Rodriguez is a refreshingly honest and inviting book. It takes readers on an emotional journey as Rodriguez recounts his family history, and his journey from a small town in Puerto Rico to the catwalks of New York & Paris.

The mood in the memoir is one of reflection, nostalgia, and a hint of vulnerability. As the reader follows Rodriguez’s story, the drabness of the Puerto Rican town of Fajardo gives way to a hazy recollection of his family’s memories, both joyous and sorrowful. These are memories that, as Rodriguez notes, have been “preserved in mental keepsakes” all this time.

At the same time, Rodriguez’s memories contain moments of triumph over adversity. This is especially evident in his journey from poverty to success as a groundbreaking fashion designer. As Rodriguez deftly intertwines his memories of childhood with recollections of his current life, the reader is taken along on an inspiring journey of perseverance. 

Finally, Rodriguez’s memoir holds a message of hope. At the end of the book, he acknowledges the importance of home, and how it can serve as a well-spring of inspiration. This is a powerful reminder that even in the face of difficulty, we can come back to the warmth of home and discover a new source of strength.
