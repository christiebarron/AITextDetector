The engineers and builders of the Empire State Building faced a unique challenge when it came to allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the skyscraper. With the invention of the rigid airship in 1900, the idea of partnering the lightweight vessels with tall structures had already been considered. However, none had come closer to realizing this feat than the Empire State Building.

In 1930, the concept of mooring a dirigible to the Empire State Building was proposed by German aviation pioneer Hugo Eckener, who envisioned it as a stopover point for airships traveling between Europe and the United States. Although the staff of the building were keen to accept the offer, after careful consideration, they realized the project was daunting. 

The first obstacle the builders had to face was finding an appropriate mooring mast. While the architects had designed the building with a relatively flat roof, they had not been expected to accommodate the large airships. As a result, a large mast had to be built to accommodate the mooring rope. This mast was ninety-six feet tall, with a found-iron ball weighing nearly three tons at the top. This heavy ball served as an anchor for the dirigibles, which were able to land and take off using a winching system. 

The next challenge was the sheer force of the wind. Even on the calmest days, the wind could gust with enough strength to move the seventy-ton airship. To prevent
