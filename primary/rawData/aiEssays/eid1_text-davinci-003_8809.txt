I remember the first time my longtime friend and I shared a real laugh together. We had known each other since elementary school, but neither of us had really opened up to each other. We were walking after school one day like we did every day and the conversation was getting increasingly awkward by the minute. Finally, I stopped walking and told him that we should be able to laugh together if we were really friends. He agreed, and we started telling each other stories and jokes until we were both in tears from laughing so hard.

At first, we weren't even sure why we were laughing so hard. It was like there was a flood gate inside us that we'd finally opened. We would just be looking at each other, then start cracking up unreasonably before devolving into an endless loop of laughter and nonsensical jokes. 

I don't think there's any better way to bond with somebody than to share an honest, good laugh. We still share a laugh every time we're together, and it only gets better every time.
