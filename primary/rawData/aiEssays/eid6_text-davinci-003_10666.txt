The Empire State Building was an engineering marvel of the early 20th century, designed and built to be the world's tallest skyscraper at the time. It was also an innovative structure, built with the intention of allowing airship, or dirigibles, to moor at one of its mooring mast located at the top of the building. This seemingly impossible goal of allowing the docking of these large, potentially hazardous airships posed a major challenge to the engineers and architects of the time, and in the end, the obstacles faced in allowing the mooring of dirigibles on the Empire State Building proved too daunting for them to overcome. 

The idea of allowing dirigibles to moor at the Empire State Building was a daring one, as such large aircrafts posed a variety of risks and dangers that couldn't be overlooked. The first was the physical size of the airships, which posed several engineering problems. At the time, the Empire State Building was built with the most advanced engineering techniques of the time, but it was not built to withstand the stresses of attaching and anchoring airships that weighed hundreds of thousands of pounds. In addition, the airships' shape and design unbalanced the building, so any mooring system used had to be extremely secure and capable of withstanding this shifting weight.

The other major obstacle faced by the builders of the Empire State Building was the potential for danger. At the time, dirigibles were powered
