I just loved spending time with my grandparents. They had been married for over fifty years and had a great sense of humour. 

One of my favourite memories with them was when we went camping with a few other families. Grandpa was in charge of entertaining the group and he was full of funny stories and jokes, which was no surprise since he was a natural entertainer.

Late one evening, when the fire had died down and everyone was getting sleepy, I heard Grandpa start to laugh. His laughter was loud and contagious, and before long the whole camp was filled with laughter!

It turns out that Grandpa had seen a big flock of geese flying overhead, and he was reminded of another funny story. He decided then and there to tell the group this story, and his laughter throughout the story made it impossible for everyone not to laugh along with him. It was a beautiful moment; everyone was connected and filled with anticipation to hear the story that was so funny it had Grandpa in stitches. 

By the end of the story, the whole group was in tears of laughter, and it felt like a much bigger family. In that moment, we all realized how powerful laughter could be, how it could make us forget our differences and bring us together in a way that nothing else could. 

Grandpaâ€™s laughter will always be something I remember fondly and which reminds me of the power of shared laughter.
