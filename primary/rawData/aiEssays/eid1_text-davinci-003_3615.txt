Dear Editor,

I am writing to state my opinion on the effects of computers on people, and the impact they have had on our daily lives. It is undeniable that computers have become increasingly integral in each of our lives, whether it be communicating with one another, our jobs, or even finding entertainment. 

The use of computers has enabled us to make huge advancements in a wide range of industries, allowing us to make groundbreaking discoveries, or finding solutions to complex problems. It has also provided us with powerful tools to communicate with each other over any distance, allowing us to collaborate on projects easily despite the barriers that physical distance might bring.

However, experts have warned us of the potential risks computers can have on individuals. A reliance on computers can impact human creativity, as we become more and more dependent on them as our data storage device. We have also grown accustomed to instantaneous access to information, and the reward-seeking behavior that comes with it can become addictive. 

Our reliance on computers is here to stay, but it’s important to always be aware of the potential consequences they have on each of us. We must all strive to be responsible users of technology, so that our advancements don’t come at the cost of our quality of life.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my opinion. 

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
