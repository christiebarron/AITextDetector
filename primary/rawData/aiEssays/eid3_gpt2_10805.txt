However for rough roads, there will be no special requirements to make sure everyone has access to a bike. If you are travelling in a fixed-gear car, for example, they are far more likely to have access to a bike but will not be able to use it. If you are travelling on an open road, most of the bike lanes won't be available to the driver. Similarly, if you are travelling on a protected road on which there are no bike lanes, people will still struggle to access the road if there is a lane or a fixed or a locked traffic zone for this type of road.

You have to make an account of all what you are going to choose. In this case if you choose an open road option you can choose from a range of options.
