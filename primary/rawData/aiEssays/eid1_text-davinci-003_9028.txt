Dear Editor,

I am writing to voice my opinion on the effects that computers have had on the lives of people. In the past few decades our reliance on computers has grown exponentially, and for many it has become an indispensable part of our daily lives.

On the most obvious level, computers offer us the ability to do work more quickly and accurately. They also offer us the means to access a vast array of information, from online texts and maps to recommendations and tips. Computers offer us a great way to communicate with other people from all over the world via websites, social media, video calls and emails. No doubt, computers provide us with a wealth of possibilities at our fingertips.

However, the use of computers can also be damaging to our physical and mental wellbeing. People who spend several hours per day in front of a computer can experience physical pain in their eyes, hands, wrists and neck. Overuse of computers can also lead to mental health issues such as lower self-esteem, depression, anxiety and addiction.

Therefore, I think it is important that we use computers in moderation. This means not spending too much time in front of a screen and taking regular breaks away from technology. When we use computers purposefully and make sure to get enough physical activity and social interaction, then computers can provide enhanced possibilities in our lives.

I hope this letter informs people of the risks of computer use and encourages them to use computers in moderation.

Since
