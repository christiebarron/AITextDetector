The Empire State Building, with its art deco structure featured at the center of the New York skyline, is part of a large and impressive legacy of architectural innovation. Not many buildings, however, have witnessed the docking of dirigibles, or airships, at their crown. Despite its lasting impression on the city, the planners, engineers, and architects of the Empire State Building faced a number of obstacles in allowing these new vessels to tie up and offload passengers.

When construction of the Empire State Building began in 1930, few thought that allowing dirigibles to dock would be possible. This was largely due to the long history of air transportation, with few dirigibles having crossed the Atlantic and regularly engaged in transport. Dirigibles require ample space for their large size, and windy conditions on the roof of the building posed a particular problem. In an effort to make docking possible, specially designed mooring mast were considered, with two such mooring masts being installed at the tip of the skyscraper. 

Aside from the difficulties posed by the building structure, safety and reliability needed to be considered when allowing dirigibles to make use of the mast. Guiding lines, or hawsers, were used to direct the airships toward the mooring mast once they arrived. To ensure the safety of passengers, these airships were equipped with special “air brakes” that could be activated in certain windy conditions to prevent the ship
