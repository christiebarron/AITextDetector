The memoir "From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives" by Narciso Rodriguez creates a mood of reflection and nostalgia. Through personal anecdotes and stories from his childhood, Rodriguez paints a vivid and often poignant picture of growing up in a close-knit immigrant family in the 1960s. He reflects on his experience of discovering his identity as an American and as a Cuban-American, and the unique challenges this brings for him as well as his family. He describes his struggles to find a balance between two sides of himselfâ€”the part that is proud of his Cuban heritage and the part that is eager to embrace American culture. The memories of his childhood speak to his need to feel accepted and understood, giving the memoir a wistful, melancholic tone. 

Rodriguez also writes about the loss of his father and its profound impact on his family, which further contributes to the somber yet hopeful mood that pervades the story. He captures the love and compassion, the commitment and unconditional support of his extended family as they come together to face this unfortunate event. His metaphor of a home being the blueprints of a family's lives echoes throughout the memoir and makes the experience of Rodriguez and his family all the more poignant.

It is through these vivid memories and alive imagery that the mood of the memoir is created. Rodriguez weaves a vivid narrative with an emotional poignancy that draws the reader in. Whether readers find themselves laughing, crying, or reminiscing along the
