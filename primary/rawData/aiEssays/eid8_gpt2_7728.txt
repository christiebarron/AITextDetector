One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was younger. But once puberty struck and I became completely overweight. I was very upset, and a lot of people took me to extremes. And I went to my parents who gave us two children. We had very different lives, and we all experienced things that would have made even myself very angry, but we all believed in God for a reason, and he helped us get through things. So when it came through to us and when she saw me growing up, she was happy too, because she felt that maybe it wasn't true. And she saw me like that now that she was doing what I wanted.

Did you experience emotional, physical, mental or sexual trauma during your childhood?

Not a lot of people know. I did hear a lot – or, it wasn't that many – what my parents say to me. But it was probably very different. My mom and dad, both of them at university, actually told me, "I think your dad just killed yourself." They just said, "He did everything to make us do it." [I heard] that that was a pretty good answer because they didn't really say it. It was just something I talked about at school that day, and they didn't really realize I was on the spectrum.

I have always felt extremely upset by what I just started. My father has taught me for about eight years the value of patience and hard work.
