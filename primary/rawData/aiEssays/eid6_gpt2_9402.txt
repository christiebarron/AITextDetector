The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They were worried about the construction of artificial gravity by aircraft, and most of these were eliminated in the mid-1950s Trying to stop the advance of aircraft in an artificially-gravityed world was considered more of an aesthetic challenge than a practical need for a futuristic home. However, some of the designs and techniques the military brought forward, and even the use of the dirigibles in the first place resulted in a significant improvement in the building process. It should be noted the Empire State Building was built on two wheels. It must have been a real estate project with many different floors, but it is actually the most popular example of the "steal" of space from outer space. One of the most famous "steal" designs by George Lucas was the use of the same 2 story, single story building in George Lucas' movie A Star Wars Story. The story was based on a story by Lucas, in which the character Luke was first raised by Jed to become a Jedi Knight. The story went like this: Luke begins his life on Tatooine with a "jedi mind", and his first assignment is to hunt down a mysterious villain named Luke Skywalker: But Luke has no choice but to go to the Jedi School. It is mentioned that the school is haunted by a "jedi girl" called Mara Jade, who travels on a ship that was not designed to be used by the academy.
