The setting of the poem ‘Rough Road Ahead’ by Joe Kurmaski is integral to the cyclist’s journey and understanding. The poem is set in a wilderness, and the descriptive language the poet has used creates a vivid mental image for the reader.

The environment is presented as open, wild, and unforgiving; a landscape ripe for adventure and danger. The imagery of the terrain being ‘scattered’ and ‘rippling’ with contours, laden with ‘low-hanging branches’ and a ‘gigantic rock’, creates the sense of a challenging and precarious route for the cyclist. The potential of the climate to change quickly is present in the poem as spring is just beginning, and birds are heralding the ‘stormy weather’ that is to come.

The features of the setting are the perfect backdrop to the emotional journey experienced by the cyclist. As a way of motivating himself to endure the tumultuous terrain and challenging conditions, the cyclist latches onto the idea of living in the now - of being present in the moment. The imagery of the environment the cyclist is travelling through encapsulates this notion by forcing him at each stage of the journey to respond and work out the most effective way to progress.
