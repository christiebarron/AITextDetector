In Joe Kurmaski’s poem “Rough Road Ahead,” the cyclist is running into some treacherous conditions out on the open road: hazardous curves and sharp drop-offs, dense fog, and an oppressive heat. These features of the setting exert tremendous influence on the progress of the cyclist, which in turn affects how the poem unfolds.

The cyclist encounters a series of obstacles due to the difficult terrain. They must remain vigilant in order to safely navigate the myriad curves and drops of the road ahead. The fog further complicates matters by obscuring the rider’s vision, making it difficult to anticipate the next obstacle and prepare for it accordingly. The oppressive heat also takes a toll on the cyclist, sapping their strength and stamina until they can barely go on.

By this point, the cyclist’s muscles are limp, their breathing labored, and their spirit at its lowest ebb. Physically and mentally exhausted, they can barely take another step. This sense of despair is furthered by the lack of anyone else around. As the cyclist trudges along alone, they begin to feel a deep sense of desolation -- something further fuelled by the void of physical and mental energy.

Throughout the poem, the roughness of the environment forces the cyclist to muster up all of their remaining strength and determination in order to keep pushing forward. The solitary nature of the road ahead makes the situation seem even more daunting and lonely.
