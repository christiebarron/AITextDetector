Computers have many effects on people. We are told by some of them that we want people to be good at the game, or at least to be fair (or even make it to the end). What the "good" person has done is changed the way society perceives us and treats us differently from what they perceive it to be. Thus, we make a decision as to whether or not to give up, or go with God's plan of liberation. On the other hand, if we want the person to do things that are different to what we are, we must be willing to change the way society treats her. She is a new person and will be different on the outside, but she will eventually be human. (1 Timothy 2:22-23; 1 Cor. 5:15-16) For one to be "good" you should be willing to change things that don't suit your lifestyle, and to change a world that you never would've imagined.

A new person's character is created in a different way, and they are subject to change as individual events unfold at the same time. This is a major problem for those who choose to turn themselves into an avatar of the Lord. This will affect their motivation, and their own personality; there is always more to the game than will appear in a person's character sheet. Because this is not a world you have created for yourself when you come into the game, it will vary based on your current game design
