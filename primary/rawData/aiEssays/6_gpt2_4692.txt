The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

Their new design included a large display unit that displayed photos and data not possible in modern spacecraft cargo carriers and the fact that it was located on its own track rather than through a vehicle's nose.

The new docking technology enables the company to keep track of the crewed vehicles of future generations without having to haul any more cargo.

But it requires a massive fleet of cargo-carrying aircraft, as well as an enormous spacecraft, and it also means that it would need a high-pressure pressure vessel on board - the type of aircraft which would be used at most space stations, such as Cape Canaveral.

Engineers thought there was no good alternatives, and the new docking system was put in place more than a year before a decision was made to put it together. Then the crew cabin had to go; as the design began to be used up it needed a second ship.

So the project changed to a new design at least from their previous design concept which featured a dock-side view of the rocket stage in conjunction with the upper deck, for now.

The second design features a lower-mounted fuel compartment on top and two more compartmented compartments on the aft, which also provides for the rocket to move to a different location when it is shut down so the ship has to leave its original location.

The new design also includes twin booster doors that
