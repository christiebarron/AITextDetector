One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was 19; at age 13, I took a stand against racism in school. I was afraid that someone would say something bad about me and I wouldn't be seen, let alone know things. I didn't know what to say or how to act. Then I experienced a moment of hope: something will soon change, and it'll be my whole world.

At about the age of 26, and with no children, I walked on a street near my home and stared at the sky as if I understood the meaning of life. That moment of hope helped me realize that all human beings are worthy of that moment of hope, and it would help me now to know all of humanity more fully.

That moment of hope has been missing from me since then. I have found that it's all in me.
