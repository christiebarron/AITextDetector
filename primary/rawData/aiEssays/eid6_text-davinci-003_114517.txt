The construction of the Empire State Building in 1930 represented a major engineering achievement. The building was intended to fulfill a wide variety of purposes, including providing a luxurious public observation deck from which to view New York City. In addition, from the outset, there were plans to enable the docking of dirigibles, or large, airship-like vessels. 

Construction of the Empire State Building is noted to have taken just one year and 45 days from its groundbreaking, and yet the process of making the building suitable for the docking of dirigibles proved to be far more difficult. According to "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted, a variety of obstacles stood in the way. 

The most significant challenge was establishing stability in the airship when docked. The building had to have a landing tower located on the roof that could be raised and lowered at will, to accommodate the height and movements of the airship in the wind. At the top of the tower, a "grappling line" would snatch hold of one of the airship mooring lines and attach them to the building. The mooring mast was built in such a way that it could be adjusted according to the wind conditions, and it was made of a lightweight aluminum alloy in order to reduce vibration.

The airship would also require an array of landing lights that could be illuminated at night when the visibility was poorer. This was difficult to implement due
