Dear Editor, 

Recent debates have arisen among communities over the issue of censorship in libraries. Libraries are traditionally seen as one of the last bastions of free speech and expression, but recently there has been pushback from the public in certain areas to filter out certain types of content. Do we believe that materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines must be removed from library shelves if they are judged to be offensive? I believe not. 

The power of a library is its ability to offer us something that is unique, something that can bring out the best in either side of a debate – in short, a place for free and open dialogue. Whether it be a classic piece of literature that some may find offensive or a modern film that is wildly popular, the library should not be the one to play the role of a censor. Far too often, attempts to censor content have been rooted in prejudice, with those who control the censorship determining what is “appropriate” based on their own biases and agendas. Censorship of this kind will not achieve an open discourse. 

Rather, libraries should take the time to provide context when it comes to materials that some may consider offensive. This could include carefully crafted and open-ended discussion guides, or even accompanying materials that explore both sides of the issue. In this way, those who are interested can enter into the discussion without being forced to abide by one opinion on the matter. 

For
