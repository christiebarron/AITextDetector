One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was 13 years old, and then this thing happened. It was a real time explosion of my life. We just thought, "If we all start doing that now we can bring some of our energy back." And we'd get so much positive feedback from the rest of the world, that's how it's always been."

On the strength of those experiences though, Bizley, with her own personal experience, hopes to make another trip into the world of meditation. "What I'm really looking forward to is trying to learn and be able to apply [that] mind. It's really about letting go, wanting to change, not worrying about any of that stuff until eventually you've gone out into the world and you've had a much stronger mind," Bizley says. "And you see people have a lot better relationships, it's actually easier to become a better person now and then to become more aware of who you truly are and to see the world through a different lens as a whole."
