Dear Editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people, and to persuade your readers to agree with me.

In today's world, computers play a huge part in our lives; we use them to communicate, work, learn, educate, and entertain ourselves. However, I believe that computers have had both negative and positive effects on people. 

On the one hand, computers have enabled us to learn more quickly and efficiently. We are able to access all sorts of information at our fingertips, which helps us to excel in our studies and research. Furthermore, they have helped us to stay connected, no matter how far apart we are. Now, more than ever, families and friends can stay in touch with each other using video chat, even when they're hundreds of miles away.

On the other hand, computers can have a negative effect on some people, especially children. They can lead to increased social isolation, with people spending more time with their computers than with their friends and family. It can also lead to an unhealthy addiction, with some people becoming overly dependent on their computers and unable to imagine life without them. 

I firmly believe that computers should be used as a tool to enhance our lives, not as a replacement for face-to-face interaction. It is, therefore, important for us to use computers responsibly and be aware of the negative impacts they can have. 

Thank you for
