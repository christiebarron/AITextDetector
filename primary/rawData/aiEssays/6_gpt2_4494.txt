The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The building was originally built in 1852 by an immigrant named Francis T. Hall. According to Henry S. Daley, who wrote about his time aboard the Empire State building: "The building was made upon the principle that all men must work together to protect and to build a greater and better world. On its east side stood a narrow street with an extensive tramway linking the two sides. On its west side stood a wide avenue to the south, which was divided into two sections which separated the street from the residential area of the building; the streets were divided into separate sections of four sides, a single section of which was to be dedicated to each block of the highway, the other sections for the main purpose of providing bridges for the construction of each side of the street, and an additional four main sections for the street and its surrounding villages. There were also a number of smaller sections of street that were open within the limits of the building, not to be placed in the front row and secured by the use of a block of roadway and a carriage carriage that could be used as a ladder as if it were an open space and where it would not disturb persons to whom it was attached."
