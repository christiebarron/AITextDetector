The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it leaves out a lot and some of the main characters seem to be forgotten from other sources. It's definitely worth revisiting with friends this year.

The Snowman Vol. 2 by David Deacon is the first book from the book series I've been following since the beginning, as far as I've seen. It is a story that, until recently, only had the best of intentions: A series story that explores the world from the early 20th century onwards, with more dramatic, sometimes violent twistings from various characters and a few unexpected twists.

The Winter Hibiscus continues the series' story by adding in a final ending.

And there you go, the good news â€“ Winter Hibiscus is a sequel book full of characters and adventures whose return will make you want to read it again. It's a lot worth revisiting. But if you don't have it, the best part is that even the authors themselves make some excellent changes to the book series while keeping the book entertaining. Don't get me wrong, when I read the Winter Hibiscus, it's amazing that it ended with a bit of closure and a few new twists or twists, but it could have served as a major, triumphant ending to one of my favourite fantasy novels of all time. It was, in my opinion, the most fun I've ever had with a fantasy novel.
