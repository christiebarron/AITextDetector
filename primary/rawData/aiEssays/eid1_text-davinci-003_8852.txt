I remember it like it was yesterday – the first time I experienced real, genuine laughter with someone.

It was spring of my senior year of high school, and my friends and I had arranged a hangout session at my house. About half-way through the evening as we were eating pizza and talking, my friend Andi made a joke about something one of us had said earlier that evening. We all started to laugh but then something incredible happened – the four of us really laughed together. It was so natural and effortless, all the stress of school and drama and all our individual worries that night just melted away and we were left smiling and in a perfect moment of laughter.

That moment has stayed with me to this day. Not only was it the first time I experienced really strong and genuine laughter with a group of friends, but it was the start of something special—a bond between the four of us that has continued these past five years. We've all gone our separate ways since then, but no matter what, whenever we get together, true, genuine laughter is sure to follow. And it all started with the pizza and a silly joke.
