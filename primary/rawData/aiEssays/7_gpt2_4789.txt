An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a young man who was walking on a street corner when it became painfully obvious to him that he had been drinking. The cops were on his back. He was thrown out with a bat on his leg then walked to the police station where he was told by a doctor that he might have suffered a heart attack. He was then questioned twice under the influence of a prescription medication. The patient managed, to his shock, to keep his doctor on drugs, not taking them. In other words, he was a man of need. He was given a cardiologist who knew what did and did not work and in turn, his friends, family and therapists, were asked by them to turn him back over to them. This man was a patient who came from the United Kingdom, and from his home, so I would say that he was a patient of substance abuse, not of physical symptoms of illness. His life was literally made of substance abuse and I think that he's more than patient. The real person was also a patient. He was always the victim of an injustice, and it was in his hands that he was robbed.
