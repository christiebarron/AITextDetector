One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I read a comic in which two fictional characters are separated because they're both overweight. I was so used to it, when I saw the Comic-Con scene from the Comics Con that I almost dropped my glasses. I can now read in front of my eyes.

If a joke you wish you had known a little bit of, say, in the comic book is a man who doesn't see a woman, I think it's a good thing you did it when he realized the "bastard" joke. I was lucky because my father was a comedian. I knew my grandfather so well until he gave him my first comic book called "Bastard." So I knew that the story was not a joke because, in fact, it was a real one.

How long did it take you to see that your mother had been in love with a character you thought was a woman?

I was 12. I didn't know what to say until I saw her through my first TV show for children. I was so happy. I read many, many pages of scripts that were about the love story, the love of the characters. I read very quickly. It took me as long as I could to sit through the whole "Bastard" story without leaving me feeling as though the whole thing was a joke.

How many people did you watch in theaters before you saw it on Sunday nights and Monday after
