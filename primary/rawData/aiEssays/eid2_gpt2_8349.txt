I believe that censorship of materials in libraries can help communities make a better informed decision. In light of the recent threats, we encourage libraries to take immediate action. For the first time in the past three decades, libraries across the nation are required to take disciplinary action against certain materials that are seen as "censoring" content. The U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights has made a report on this policy available.

Last spring, it was revealed that at least one Michigan library had recently fired a library employee after receiving a tip about content being stored in a private locker, but no charges were laid in the latest incident. It was a far cry from the number of people being asked to report crimes after their libraries were run amok by police officers, a common practice with a plethora of law enforcement agencies across the country.

But it is no mere lack of bad laws alone that makes this case stand out. As I stated in February, I believe that every library across the country is doing its part to educate its libraries and the community of their patrons about the threats a law creates.

At the same time, we are confident that our members will be safe knowing this case is being brought to justice within the legal framework and without any personal attacks on libraries from a legal viewpoint.
