The features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski’s ‘Rough Road Ahead’ greatly impact the cyclist. The terrain is described as “rough and rocky” with a “rising, winding road” as well as “sharp turns” and “sheer cliffs.” These elements provide difficult obstacles for the cyclist to overcome. Tackling the trials of the road requires strength and resilience. The winding, rocky roads challenge the cyclist to maintain balance and momentum while navigating the terrain. The sharp turns and sudden changes in elevation delay progress, and the cyclist must practice dexterity and precision in his movements. The sheer cliffs put the cyclist at risk for tumbles, which requires the utmost caution and awareness.

The environment has a huge impact on the success of the cyclist. The steepness and curve of the terrain can either challenge and invigorate the cyclist, or exhaust him. Furthermore, the physical and psychological strains can weigh heavily upon feeling of accomplishment. The extreme conditions present danger in every direction, and depending on the cyclist’s level of vulnerability, the treacherous road can be either a valuable learning experience or a formidable challenge. Ultimately, the features of the setting affect the cyclist, his success, and his experience in a multitude of ways.
