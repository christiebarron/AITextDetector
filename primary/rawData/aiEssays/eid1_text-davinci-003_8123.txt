The building of the Empire State Building presented a unique challenge for engineers and architects as to how to allow airships (dirigibles) to dock. Attempting to dock airships on a high rise building presented significant risks and unique challenges for structural integrity. As outlined in The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted, the obstacles that needed to be overcome to enable the docking of airships at the Empire State Building were considerable.

Firstly, the structural integrity of the building needed to be overwhelming for it to be able to withstand the constant buffeting of the wind and weight forces created by the airships. Specifically, utilizing two specially made steel mooring masts that were securely bolted into the frame of the building was necessary for the Empire State Building to be able to withstand airship docking forces.

Secondly, the sheer size and weight of the airships posed a considerable challenge to the engineers. It necessitated the development of two mooring masts that extended for a staggering 50 stories above the roof of the building. This extended height over the roof was necessary for the airships to be able to manoeuvre far enough away from the building to allow them to land safely.

Thirdly, practical considerations that posed risks to human safety needed to be addressed. These included the need to build a 10 story tall airship hangar on the 81st floor to enable safe airship docking within the building, allowing additional protection from inclement weather. Employee
