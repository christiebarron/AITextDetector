The narrator of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho is reflecting on how they have been feeling about the important test that they need to take. The narrator believes that in order for them to do well on the test, that they need to be in a better place mentally, which will come with the arrival of spring. The hope that the narrator has in the return of the spring is symbolized by the hibiscus, which will bud and come back to life when the snows melt with the return of the geese. The transformation of the hibiscus and the return of the geese is indicative of the narrator's own transformation, and ultimately the narrator hopes that when spring comes the change in the environment and in their mood will help them to do better on the test.
