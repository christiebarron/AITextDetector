The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is an experience I never thought I'd ever have.


"When I was a little kid in high school when you had this story about a small French town where it was common practice to paint black faces and you felt that you might be a criminal or maybe even to be an orphan, it had some significance. At that time, no-one thought that black people could be seen as being evil."


The author spent much of his childhood learning how to play, and how to communicate. The book tells the story of the journey around his life to a point where it becomes very clear to him how he came to understand how to communicate. "I remember just being in the middle of a school play session with my mum, and in the play we had to ask if we could play the next one. She said no! She said no! What if we did and she said no?! Then we'd play the final one which was a straight to the point play where we'd both agree that if we didn't, then we didn't even have a chance.

"By the time I was about eight and nine I had learned as much about the world I had grown up with. I could read, read and read. Now I didn't. But that was because I'd seen it live a pretty good life. Now I'm a big writer and this was my chance to do about it."
