Building the Empire State Building in New York City by 1931 was a grand feat made possible by advances in steel and a large, innovative workforce. As it was one of the tallest buildings in the world, it had the potential to be a new hub for international travel. It became the central focus of discussions around the possibility of allowing dirigibles to dock at the top – daring forms of transportation that could help open the world in ways previously not possible. 

The idea was incredibly exciting, particularly for those already aboard the zeppelin – a tiny island of people who could travel the world in a few days. However, there were many obstacles that expected to be overcome before the dream of docking at the Empire State Building could be realized. 

To begin with, there was the issue of space. The mast must have been incredibly tall to be able to accommodate the dirigibles, and there were practical safety considerations to consider. The structure also needed to be able to take the force of the winds when the dirigibles plummeted downward to dock and to hold the massive airship in place without any harm to the structure, the passengers, or the building itself. 

In addition to the size of the structure, other considerations included the weight it would need to be able to hold, the strength of the railing needed to contain the masses of people, and the number of dirigibles that could fit within the existing coverage of the mast. The shape of the mast required
