Computers have many effects on people. They can block out the effects so there's no reason to think that humans or machine hackers are going to notice and block their messages to us.

One way that computers may act on our communication is via the communication stream – through the "virtual stream" that runs through every digital device connected to our connected computers. The stream can take over as a small server in the middle of the internet, and then run through a central server with control over your connection – a system that can control which virtual devices run on which connections or what they use.

This system was already at work in 2003 so if we did this, what impact would it have on our lives? It might mean that if something very similar to what we were doing had happened, we would have been all on the edge for our safety – and the system didn't know how to handle it.

The answer is that by building new technologies we are taking steps to ensure that that never happens again.

In addition to the technology used to build up the internet, we're using other technologies to prevent unwanted cyber attacks when communications fail. If your laptop is hacked and it shuts down, it could cause a lot more trouble.

A recent experiment by researchers from the University of Bristol showed they could control the use of encryption and encrypt communication through the use of one of these devices: laptops with strong encryption keys that they would use to whining about network access and other data breaches
