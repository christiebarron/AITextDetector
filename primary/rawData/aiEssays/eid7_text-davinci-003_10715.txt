As a child, I remember my siblings were constantly getting under my skin. They could never seem to keep their hands off my things and would antagonize me endlessly. Despite all of this, however, I was always incredibly patient with them. I knew that they were just being kids and that their behavior was something that would eventually pass. 

Whenever they would start on me, I would stay calm and try to reason with them. My logic was usually met with resistance at first, but I never outwardly expressed my frustration with them. I figured that if I remained patient and persistent, eventually they would understand.

My patience with my siblings eventually paid off. A few years later, they developed a bit more of an understanding and seemingly matured overnight. Our relationship started to improve and we began to be better to each other. I think it was my patience and understanding that helped them to grow and understand the importance of respect.
