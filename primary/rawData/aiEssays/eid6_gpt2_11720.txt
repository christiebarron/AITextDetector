The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The plan required building two main dirigibles, the "B" or "C" (with one main and two secondary dirigibles for the first and second secondary dirigibles to dock from), a crane and a vertical deck, before building another crane and horizontal deck.

The two larger dirigibles could not be installed in accordance with schedule.

Although dirigibles are allowed to dock while sitting within walls, they require vertical walls; this could cause an obstacle to prevent the crane and the main deck from docking. It was suggested that one of the two main dirigibles be deployed to deploy some of the larger dirigibles, the only ones capable of docking.

The first single dirigible was to be located on the west edge of the tower, at the north pole of the building. This dirigible could dock and detach without any additional construction, however the east-northeast axis was limited to the building in some parts with high walls. This dirigible would then form part of a single horizontal deck.

When the original plan was abandoned, two more smaller dirigibles were installed on each side of the tower - one on the east ledge and one on the south ledge. These two larger dirigibles were to hold up to 30 liters of water when each other was retracted in a horizontal arrangement.
