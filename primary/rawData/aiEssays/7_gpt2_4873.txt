An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when my father took me to New Orleans and asked where I'd been for the night. I could hear him being quite a bit more relaxed but if I'd been more patient the first time around he might have found a moment of truth. They both had moments of silence and then a few minutes we walked over to the door.

There, a boy opened the door, got a big smile on his face and then sat behind it and I just felt really happy when they opened it, like being accepted. He was like, "Thank you so much dad, for taking your son to your favorite places he could be, and I think so." I asked him, he looked at me and said, "You look exactly as you should." He was just happy.

The fact that they were having a family reunion, like I couldn't have more of them, was the most amazing thing. Even then my mother would be crying and not taking their food, so they brought some from a grocery store and got us something.

The next morning they took us to the grocery store because I was sick but couldn't bear to go out alone. Our mom would bring some of the vegetables from her garden to her mom when it was time to go back to school. I mean my mother would bring them to me one time just for me to eat, and the same day my sister would have to bring them to her.
