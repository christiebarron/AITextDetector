I remember one day being in line for something in a store with a really long line. I was getting annoyed because the wait time was so long and I knew I had other things to do. I had been waiting in line for a few minutes when a woman in front of me got in line who appeared to be struggling. She was trying to take out her wallet but was having difficulty doing so. I could tell she was under a lot of stress.

Rather than getting frustrated, I tried to remain calm and patient. I listened as she explained her situation and how she was unable to take out her wallet. I offered my help and was able to get her wallet out so she could pay for her items. She thanked me for being so patient and understanding, and we both laughed about the situation.

I was happy that despite my initial frustration, I was still able to turn it into a positive situation. I was proud of my ability to remain calm and helpful in the face of a challenging situation. It was a rewarding feeling to use patience in such a situation.
