First and foremost, computers have made countless tasks much simpler and faster to accomplish. We can access information and communicate with other people around the globe with the click of a few buttons. Computers have improved our efficiency and productivity when it comes to work, school, and our daily lives. Furthermore, computers have provided us with new ways to stay entertained. Through a variety of games, videos, and other forms of media, people of all ages are able to find something they can enjoy doing. 

In addition, computers have helped many develop their own skills and knowledge. We are now able to find exchange ideas and learn with a global network of information at our fingertips. Computer education programs, websites, and resources make learning new skills more accessible and easier to understand than ever before. This helps to ensure that everyone is able to continue growing and developing themselves on a personal level. 

For these reasons, I firmly believe that computers have had a very positive impact on people. The advantages computers have provided us with improve our quality of life and allow us to take advantage of many opportunities we would not otherwise have.
