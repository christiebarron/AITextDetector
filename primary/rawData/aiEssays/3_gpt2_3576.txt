Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

'We'd like to add things hog and don't want it to look that great. We want those bits of the road ahead and there they are.'

The setting is one of the five items on the campaign's menu and will be added to the top of the menus of car services within the week, including online services, according to the campaign.

And for the first time, it might also give motorists an option to change their fuel use at the petrol station.

Mr McClellan said: 'The petrol stations with the number 1 spot on the map. We'd like to see them turn on that automatically.

'If you go to the roadside we'd like them to have a 'Rough Road Ahead' option on their car, too

'For sure. I think that people would want to do that.'
