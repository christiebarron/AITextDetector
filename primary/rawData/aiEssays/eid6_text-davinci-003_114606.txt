The dream of having a docking mast atop the Empire State Building for dirigibles was nothing short of ambitious. As the tallest building in the world at the time, the idea of attaching such a structure at its peak to serve airships posed significant engineering and financial challenges. However, the Empire State Building builders rose to the occasion and overcame the obstacles of the time to make the dream a reality.

The first obstacle faced by the builders was the engineering feat necessary for such a structure. Building the Empire State Building itself was no mean feat, and the basic framework of the structure would require adaptation before it could accommodate a ‘mooring mast’. The language of contract had to be precise as wind was a major factor in airships – they had to be “strong enough to resist the wind load”. An engineering design was produced and constructed that addressed this very issue by fitting into the existing steel beams of the building and creating an anchor system at the four corners of the mast for stability. 

Once the engineering structure was established, the builders had to face the financial challenges of funding the addition. Considering the magnitude of the project, funds were assembled from a loan from the Marine Activity Corporation and a stock offering from the Empire State Building Corporation. Without this financial help, the project may have been impossible to complete.

The next obstacle to tackle was raising the mast up to the 82nd floor, a height of over 1,000 feet. To
