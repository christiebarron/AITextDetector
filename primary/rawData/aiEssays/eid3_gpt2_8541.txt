Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. The more I think about it the more I want to know.

I'm not suggesting that 'Rough Road Ahead' is perfect. You need to understand as you go about your daily routine some of the details that matter.

But if your bike is poorly set up you're not going to want to break or crash your way out of the rut of these roadworks. In fact they're very likely to have worse roads where the roads are very uneven.

In the past three or four years we've seen over 40% of bicycle road accidents in Germany. Yet most drivers Rawls et al. in their latest study predict that by 2050, the number of cyclists on roadways will be 2.8 times higher than today (see chart).

So why should we care about roadside recreation when we don't care much about cyclists? Well, it may be that people who ride all day in a nice new car are more likely to use the streets (or are walking on the road) in general. Perhaps this is because the new cars tend to drive a bit more quickly, which has been shown to be a big contributory factor. The way we perceive bike paths is very different.
