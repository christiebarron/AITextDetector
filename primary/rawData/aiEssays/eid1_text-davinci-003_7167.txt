In the short story, “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, a cyclist is attempting to reach a destination while being hindered by nature. The cyclist is shown to have the ambition to strive for their goal despite the many obstacles encountered along the way. 

The setting of the story plays a vital part in understanding the cyclist's struggle. The story is set during the cold, winter months which is critical to the plot since the cold temperatures and snow make the cycling conditions extremely difficult. Not only is the cyclist dealing with the cold weather, but also a strong wind that makes it difficult for them to reach their desired speed. The roads are described as being wet and muddy, and the bicycle's tires have frozen to the street. These factors make the cyclist's journey more treacherous and difficult to navigate. 

The story also takes place in an isolated area of the countryside. This enhances the peril of the situation because there is no assistance for the cyclist if something goes wrong.
