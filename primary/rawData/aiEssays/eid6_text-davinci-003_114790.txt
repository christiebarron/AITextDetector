The Empire State Building is a marvel of engineering and design, and its construction presented many obstacles. Of the unique challenges faced by the builders was allowing dirigibles, large airships, to dock atop the building. Despite numerous difficulties, the project was eventually completed and resulted in the world's first skyscraper dirigible mooring mast. 

The main problem regarding the mooring mast was its construction. Naturally, strong winds pose a danger to any airship, and the buildingâ€™s height created an environment of turbulence and gusts of winds that seemed to be almost constantly present. To account for this, the mooring mast required thick steel to withstand the various elements it would be subjected to. To ensure it was up to the job, engineers tested the tower by having it withstand 111 mile per hour winds and moor the USS Los Angeles airship. While the mooring mast passed the test, the thick steel tower costs vastly more money and resources to build than anyone had expected. 

The engineers in charge of the mooring mast had to find a way to keep the dirigible docked to the building in windy conditions, while also finding a way to offload passengers in the time frame given. To solve these issues, the team built a great latch system, allowing an airship to secure its mooring line quickly, and also a lightweight steel bridge for passengers to cross between the airship and building.
