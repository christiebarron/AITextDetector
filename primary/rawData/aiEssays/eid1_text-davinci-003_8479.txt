Growing up, my family isn't fiercely competitive, however, my brothers and I found ourselves competing for attention or recognition. Even though it was a peaceful competition, there were several episodes between us in which our emotions flared and the air was thick with tension. Looking back, one of my strongest habits that helped my brothers and I get through these moments was patience. 

For instance, during one moment we were arguing about a video game that two of us wanted to play but couldn't immeidately due to a technical problem. I remember my brother's frustration levels rapidly rising and I calmly asked him to pause and allow us to troubleshoot systematically. 

I said, "Let's take a minute to figure out what is causing the issue and try to find a solution." Taking a breath, my brother became more relaxed, and agreed to my suggestion. 

After a few minutes of troubleshooting and eliminating potential causes, we were able to find and fix the issue in a matter of minutes. After that, my brother and I hugged each other the same way we used to do when we were younger, thanked each other, and most importantly, proceeded to enjoy our video gaming session together. 

In this situation, my patience with my brother helped to resolve a problem that could have otherwise become a deeper family dispute. Instead, my brother and I were able to develop a mutual understanding of the situation and come to an agreement.  Patience that
