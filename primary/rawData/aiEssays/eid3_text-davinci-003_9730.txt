The setting of “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski plays a major role in influencing the cyclist’s journey. The vast openness of the desert creates a feeling of isolation that the cyclist has to face, resulting in numerous psychological and physical challenges along the way. The bright sunlight and the intense heat of the day also contribute to the cyclist's discomfort – he has to constantly battle with dehydration, fatigue, and even hallucinations. On the other hand, the rocky terrain and the sharp turns of the road create the opportunity for the cyclist to display his technical skills. Each turn presents a new challenge, encouraging the cyclist to remain focused and alert. Moving through the night, the cyclist is presented with another challenge – the lack of light. The path ahead is shrouded in darkness and the cyclist has to rely solely on his sense of balance and instinct to navigate the way.

Overall, the features of the setting play a major role in pushing the cyclist to the limits of his endurance allowing him to fully experience the physical and mental hardships of the ride. The dangerous terrain, the strong sunlight, the oppressive darkness of the night, and the feeling of isolation are just a few of the challenges that the cyclist must face and overcome. With each obstacle he successfully passes, the cyclist progressively gains a sense of strength and self-esteem that can be seen when he later “beat[s] his chest and shout[s] with pride”.
