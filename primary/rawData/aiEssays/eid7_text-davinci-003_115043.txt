I recently experienced the power of patience while onboarding a new employee for my team. She was young and had only limited experience in our field, but I knew she had the potential to be a great asset to the team. 

I was excited to have her on board and so was she. However, it was taking longer than expected to get her up to speed and she was getting frustrated. She asked me why I wasn't trying to speed up the process and I calmly explained that I was waiting to make sure she was truly ready before delegating larger responsibilities.

To my surprise, she accepted my explanation and thanked me for being so patient with her. It was clear that she appreciated the way I was taking the time to teach her the right way. A few weeks later, she was completely onboarded and contributing to the team in wonderful ways.

My patience had paid off.
