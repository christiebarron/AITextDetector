I believe that censorship of materials in libraries will make libraries less free," said C. Michael F. Mearls, associate director of civil liberties for the American Library Association. "This is a big problem, but there's no good reason not to use computers to publish books."

One of the most popular ways to read books is through a special feature on the topic titled, "The Dark Reading Room," which allows readers to order books on paper and have the contents of them read directly to their eyes.

"If you're not going to open up a book for inspection in any way and don't want that information in there in the first place, you should take that one for a spin," said John M. Hahnbard, former vice president of the National Library Association. "Even in book PDT, you shouldn't go through that much time to read something that you can't even imagine. For the most part, that's how apprentice publishers decide to write. Because it's not going to be a perfect reading experience. I think it has a lot of negative effectsâ€”it's going to be very awkward."

Other ways to read include: reading through a book on the back of a book bag, or on a shelf near bedtime, or on the front of a laptop for reading through a book with other books in book at hand to read a book at a time. Most often, though, just turning on reading devices does the trick.
