The construction of the Empire State Building is a classic example of human ingenuity and ambition. While its ornate art deco style and lightning-fast construction time made it the envy of architects and filmmakers alike, the building was almost designed with a far less familiar ability in mind: dirigible docking. Despite the enthusiasm of the builders, obstacles quickly presented themselves which prevented this dream from becoming a reality.

One of the primary obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced was their location. The building was constructed in Manhattan, a densely populated area filled with tall buildings, belching smoke and soot from chimneys and industry. This air pollution made it impossible for even the biggest and sturdiest of dirigibles to maneuver safely around the waterways and in the air. The density of the area also made it difficult for the dirigibles to dock properly due to the lack of available space.

Another obstacle, which had been anticipated, was the structure of the building. Though the design of the Empire State Building allows for the construction of a mooring mast, the sheer height of the building made the task of safe dirigible docking difficult. The mast had to be built with extra supports and safety precautions in place, as well as powerful wind cables to secure the larger airships.

Finally, the cost of the project was a major obstacle that had to be faced. As dirigibles are some of the most expensive and delicate vessels ever to grace the skies,
