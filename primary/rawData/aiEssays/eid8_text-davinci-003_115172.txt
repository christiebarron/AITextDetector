I remember it like it was yesterday. It was the summer before ninth grade and I had just moved to a new city with my family. On my first day of school, I walked into the classroom feeling nervous and out of place. Everyone else seemed to know each other so I just sat in my desk in the back, waiting for classes to begin. 

Just then, the teacher called out my name. Everyone turned to watch as I stood up, nervously glancing around the room. Suddenly, the classroom erupted in laughter! I was so embarrassed and I wanted to sink into the floor. What had I done to make them all laugh? 

Turns out, my new teacher had mistaken me for someone else. She had expected the student sitting in my seat to be someone else with the same name. Everyone in the room had found it hilarious and couldn't stop laughing. 

But, even though I was embarrassed at first, I couldn't help but laugh too. Everyone's laughter was contagious and it felt good to be a part of the joke. That is a moment that I will never forget!
