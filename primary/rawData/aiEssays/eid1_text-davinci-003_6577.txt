Dear editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have had on people. I believe that computers are both a blessing and a burden, depending on how they are used. 

On the positive side, computers help us with our everyday tasks. We can now use them to get quick answers to questions, complete work assignments, and store information. They can even help us learn, as computers can provide us with educational materials and information about the world.

On the other hand, too much time spent using computers can lead to various problems. Physically, people’s eyesight and posture may suffer from spending extended periods of time staring at screens. Mentally, stress, anxiety, and depression can set in due to an unhealthy amount of technology use. Ironically, a tool that was meant to make life easier can have the opposite effect if not used properly.

Therefore, I believe that computers should be used in moderation and balanced with other activities so as not to be harmful to people’s physical and mental health. With a little bit of self-control, computers can become a source of positive influence in our lives and help us become more productive and informed individuals.

Thank you for your time and consideration. 

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
