Dear Editor,

I believe that computers have made life easier and have immensely benefited our personal and professional lives. From streamlining mundane tasks to offering an unprecedented access to information, computers have had a part to play in virtually every aspect of life.

However, with every benefit comes a downside. The amount of sedentary time we’re all spending hunched over our screens has led to an increase in physical ailments, such as back pain, headaches, and eyestrain. Additionally, too much computer time can lead to a reliance that limits opportunities for exercise and fresh air. 

When used properly, however, computers can help us stay in shape. For example, computers allow us to search for exercise videos, track our activity levels, and even search for recipes that use healthy ingredients. 

In conclusion, computers can be both beneficial and detrimental to our health. We must find a healthy balance between computer use and physical activity to avoid any unnecessary health issues. I believe that the readers of this newspaper will agree with me and take the necessary measures to make sure they’re getting enough exercise and fresh air to stay healthy.

Sincerely,

[Your name]
