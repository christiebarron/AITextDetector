Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. The first to recognize them is the young bike commuter at the end of the set. He notices both the rider and the set he's going through but doesn't realise they are both looking at him at the same time either. It makes him think that a lot have changed in terms of how they have ridden in the past couple of years with his riding style.

It also gives him a sense of what his riding style and training will be like. Being able to be a specialist and take off on a bike that is only slightly quicker than what my brother does with his friend's, gives him a great appreciation for how he rides.

I have had my fair share of people asking if I don't need a "Cycle Shoes" to ride with. In fact I don't do that at all, but I would say there is such a thing as a "Solo" style bike in which this kind of kit comes with a saddle. It has been suggested on the forums that this does not matter in the long run, as it is one of the reasons the more experienced is often the one more fit to ride. But in the end, it is good that my friend and I have decided to have a style of 'Rough Road Ahead' but we are certainly not saying so yet.
