Dear Editor: 

As technology continues to develop, computers have become a cornerstone of modern life. Their presence is everywhere, from schools to our homes and virtually all work places. However, despite the undeniable convenience and efficiency they offer, I believe that computers have a negative impact on people. 

For one, computers are often a source of distraction as they can easily take up a lot of our time. They offer countless forms of entertainment that can be accessed with just a few clicks of the mouse. This can detract from more productive activities and contribute to feelings of procrastination. Moreover, computers can disrupt human interactions. People are more inclined to communicate virtually than in person, leading to a decrease in face-to-face conversations. 

In the long-term, the overuse of computers can have significant mental and physical implications. Research has linked excessive use to a range of health problems, such as eye strain, headaches, neck and shoulder pain, and sleep disturbances. Moreover, the lack of human interaction can cause anxiety and lead to social difficulties.

In conclusion, computers make many tasks easier, but it is important that individuals use them in moderation. We should remember to take regular breaks from the computer and ‘unplug’ to engage in offline activities. I urge the readers of your newspaper to think twice when using machines and consider the impact they may have on both their mental and physical well-being. 

Sincerely,
