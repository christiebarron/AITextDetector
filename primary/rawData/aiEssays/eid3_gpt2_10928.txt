Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

One example is as follows:

In the upper right hand corner, two yellow signs or warnings indicate that the cyclist is at risk of crossing the road in a cross or on a carriageway.

The cyclist can be approached on the left by motorists who have entered the crossing area.

The cyclist might also meet pedestrians on either side of the motorway (which is very difficult on the low point of the road for a cyclocross cyclist). The sign will also indicate that the speed limit has been increased or stopped.

On the left hand side of the road, an image and/or text warning stating that the cyclist is in 'Rough Road Ahead'.

The road may or may not be marked as unsafe. The pavement is only designed for cyclists to move as they wish.

The motorway (or all roads in between) may be marked as unsafe
