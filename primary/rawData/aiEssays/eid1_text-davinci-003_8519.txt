I was in line at the grocery store today and it was taking ages. I started to get annoyed as I was feeling impatient. A woman ahead of me started to get irritated as people weren't social distancing and the line wasn't moving quickly. I had a reminder pop up in my mind - to be patient. I took a deep breath, and waited calmly. I kept reminding myself that we all have to make sacrifices to get through this time, and that the cashier was doing their best. I concentrated on my breath, and it helped ease my frustration. Eventually, the line moved quickly and I was on my way. It was a reminder to me that patience is a virtue, and by keeping my cool, I was able to help make the situation a little better.
