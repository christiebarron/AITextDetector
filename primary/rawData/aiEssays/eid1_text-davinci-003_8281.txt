The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The main challenge was to create a smooth surface on the summit of the building in order to anchor the great airships. This was extremely difficult to achieve due to a number of factors.

From a design perspective, creating a platform suitable for dirigibles was complicated due to restrictions on the architecture of the tower. Due to the architecture, the building was not strong enough to be able to support a large mooring mast, which would have been necessary for dirigible docking. Furthermore, the building was made of steel with a limestone and brick facade, making it unsuitable for attaching a platform suitable for airships.

Structurally speaking, it was challenging to install a platform suitable for the mooring process. In order to anchor a dirigible, the platform would have to be strong enough to resist the strong gusts of wind that tower so high above the ground. Additionally, the platform needed to be able to hold a great deal of weight, as the airships of that time were much larger than what we are used to today.

From a safety perspective, a major concern was the unpredictable wind and weather conditions which often occur at a skyscraper’s height. In order to overcome this obstacle, the builders of the Empire State Building had to install a “mooring mast” to act as an anchor point. This was a complex
