Dear Editor, 

As technology continues to evolve, our lives are drastically changing. In todayâ€™s world, computers are becoming increasingly prevalent in our everyday life. People are relying on computers for all kinds of tasks, from business to everyday activities. As a result, I believe it's important for us to consider the effects computers have on people.

First, computers can be a great tool for productivity. They give us access to enter and store large amounts of data, process and manage information quickly, and they enable us to quickly search and compile information. They also help us work more efficiently and make our lives more convenient. Furthermore, computers have made it easier for businesses to compete in the global market and create new job opportunities.

On the flip side, computers can also have some negative effects on people. Too much time spent on the computer can lead to health problems such as physical fatigue, eye strain, headaches, and even psychological issues, and it can damage social relationships. Moreover, computers can lead to feelings of disconnection from the real world if we become overly reliant on them for information and entertainment. It is important to remember that computers are just a tool and not a replacement for human contact.

In conclusion, computers can be incredibly beneficial, but it is important to keep in mind that too much time spent on the computer can have detrimental effects. We should strive to use computers responsibly and balance our time spent online with quality time spent with family and
