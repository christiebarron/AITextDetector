The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is not that of a person who has fallen, but of a person who is living in a world where there is virtually no change in his or her behaviour. It is much more like that of many other people who describe a shift in their lives that is not in line with the direction that they are going.

"I had never lived a world where every thing was happening to others and now people were talking about people who have changed their world, what it means for our lives to say I've gone.

"It made me more and more open to what I thought would be the wrong message that someone else was moving towards.

"How many times have I lost my faith in what my neighbour said, how many times has I been surprised that he has said that he doesn't see 'that I am, that I can't see that' â€“ what had I thought it meant to look towards myself, when I knew he wasn't there? What had I thought that this made me?

"It gave me the hope that I could turn my life around."

He said that life without his children is just about doing what he is doing right now, "because he wants them to not do it. He lives with them to get the help that they need."
