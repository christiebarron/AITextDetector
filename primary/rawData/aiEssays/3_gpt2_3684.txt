Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

The driver or cyclist must be able to move the bike through rough terrain with confidence and speed.

But as in the situation at The Grove Lane, the best choice for the bike is to make sure a clear headway is not lost or damaged at any cost to the cyclist.

However, it's still important to know which lane the cyclist must use and what direction they must go, so the final decision is what to do.

Rough Road Ahead means the cyclist must also be aware of the safety on the way, make decisions about the amount of tyre life and make the correct gear changes.

It can help to consider the speed of the wind.

There's also a benefit to being able to use the option to ride through rough terrain safely that is only achievable if the cyclist has a speed of less than 120 km/h.

The safety risk of hitting a strong wall can also be minimized and a wider headway can be built and installed just prior to a turn.
