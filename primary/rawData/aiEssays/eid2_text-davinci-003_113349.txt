As the idea of censorship affects libraries around the world, it is important to consider the implications this could have on freedom of ideas and expression. 

When a library eliminates access to certain types of materials, it is denying its patrons the opportunity to explore unique and often controversial works. This restriction can lead to a limited perspective of the world, leading to an unhealthy intellectual environment.

If a library were to censor materials found to be offensive, it could prove to be a complex task. How does one decide what should be considered harmful to patrons? Everyoneâ€™s opinions differ, and therefore, there is no universal standard that can be applied in this situation. 

Censoring materials can also prove to be a slippery slope. Once people start to consider the implications of removing certain materials, events in the past have indicated there could be a dangerous potential to continuously expand the list of books and media to be censored.

Rather than removing materials deemed offensive, libraries should provide a balanced selection of materials that may include those that some find objectionable. This allows everyone, regardless of their opinions, to explore different viewpoints and be exposed to a variety of ideas without feeling censored.

Additionally, libraries should add materials to the shelves that reflect multiple perspectives, such as books written by authors of different races, genders, and orientations. By doing so, libraries can give patrons access to a variety of perspectives, and encourage them to think critically about the works presented to them.
