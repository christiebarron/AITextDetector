An example of a time someone in my life was patient was with one of my patients. I asked whether if I knew what the woman's condition was or had not done anything for so long it was getting worse. I made my best impression. The person said I should try an ointment as that was helpful, but then I began giving it to her. So I said, "You know what? My patient told us you've done better since then." When I told her I knew for some reason she would look at their condition and say, "You know, I'm on something. It makes her happy or does it don't?"

At the end of our conversation she asked if we did something that could help her feel better about those little things. This is something that's important to us. What we've discovered is that when you say you want to help others in need, you are not making you that person. Your goal is to help your own person and to make them happy.

Here's how this works: when you do this, if she seems to have a problem, go ask her how she's doing. Don't ask her what it is she's struggling with. Instead ask her whether she's dealing with another problem or not. After that, give her an ointment. Ask how she feels. Tell her that her issues may be less of a worry, and that she is better able to move forward to make his or her situation better
