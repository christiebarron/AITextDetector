Computers have many effects on people. People in China have a very limited life span. All that time there was people going the wrong way about how they did things and how to treat people without looking after them. To create this game I needed to design a simple and scalable system of programs from scratch using computer code. So I asked a few people to submit their own project, and some of them got involved.

I first tried out a code base, which is also how your game works. I used a Python program, which lets you put together any kind of logic code you want, for example you can draw on graph paper, you can draw blocks, the blocks you put on paper are created by a computer, you can send the result to the computer on disk, and then you are able to modify the code in some way to keep up with the execution. The programmer did not try to cheat me or me and tried to create a machine that could do it all while using the Python programming language. So the whole process took a few more years. We also had the first programmer come to work for us, who gave us the responsibility for coding the game, and the first program we wanted to make came to a complete halt. But there is a real danger of this happening when working on a program because of all the complexity involved (the computer does not know how an algorithm works for it when it needs it) and it will not recognize a way to handle this problem.
