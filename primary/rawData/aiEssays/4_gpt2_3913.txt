The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it's the last story of the "I'm not a ghost but the world is broken up like this" era. In its heyday, "the universe was not perfect and it is being broken up," with its "vicious, dark, horrific creatures" and "stealing from one and all," we're talking about what the first two books were meant to say, elaborately.

(A lot of you probably already understand how I feel about Harry Potter and how I feel about James and Jane.)

The world is broken. He's destroyed, as the Wizard of Oz had told us in a moment after his death. The world has been shattered, and when all hell breaks loose, Harry will get out. And when all is said and done, the only ones who will stop him are himself. There is no one else, who can get Harry out, he knows and loves he's in here and he's willing to do whatever it takes to get him out.

The problem is that we only know about the world and not about himself, the story told in which we live. The more important part of the book, though, is on the outside. We see Harry as being a kind and compassionate human who will help others, but he will find himself Gray in the thick of it, and that's where, I don't know, his life ends.
