I believe that censorship of materials in libraries has had profound positive effects on the quality of library access. It has prevented people from making critical decisions about the kind of materials that we're using, and has also reduced the number of people who think they know the right books for children, especially if they have children with intellectual disabilities. To me, the most significant of all is those books in this public library," Harris explains.


The library says she has been advocating for changes to the way libraries are used for research. She says she wants to open libraries to the new standards so those who use library to learn can get a clear picture of how well their research is doing, rather than reading into a paper. She also cites the book "On the Limits of Language," an online book that she co-founded with her husband, Michael, a former IBM technical assistant. Michael says when they had this book, he'd always heard people say "that book says that everyone should learn computer science," but he didn't know that it was what he was saying. "When I looked at the book and when I looked at the picture, it had this weird feeling. And I think that is what gave me the strength and courage that I feel today." She says she hopes to be the first person to use the library to educate people about computers without putting it above the physical library.


In its most recent report, the British Library put its focus on the impact of digital technology on scientific discoveries.
