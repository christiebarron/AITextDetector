Computers have many effects on people. The most important is that they are unable to respond without being forced to respond to stimuli. We think that the need for brain power is to help us think better. We have several systems of control centers and mechanisms for regulating thought processes through the use of different types of devices, but we are not sure of the precise nature of these systems. If we study what does affect human thought, it can seem that the physical systems of control center are the hardest to understand because they contain many functions.

There have been lots of books published on our brain. Some of them have focused on things we perceive as our body. Others are on things you might associate with the brain. It may seem as though these systems, which control what other people perceive as our body and affect what the world sees, are an accident. But it seems to me that most of these kinds of systems will be very difficult to apply to other human beings. In fact some of them become a kind of mental constructs that we might consider as an individual. It may seem that we have only a partial understanding of other human beings.

On something called the "brain", there are two kinds of phenomena called the "brain-power field". One was a word we use frequently. It means that humans are able to understand and analyze thought. It meant that we are able to think about our lives and our choices, our relationships with our friends, our family and the things that we enjoy
