In the poem “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, the cyclist is literally and figuratively navigating a rough road. The purpose of this poem is to emphasize the physical and mental struggles cyclists experience while traversing a road that is filled with obstacles and complications.

The setting greatly affects the cyclist in “Rough Road Ahead.” To start, it is a “rugged road.” This indicates that it is physically and mentally challenging for the cyclist, with bumps, dips, and turns that make it impossible to easily avoid obstacles. It is further described as “a landscape alive with thorns,” which implies that the cyclist’s journey is fraught with danger and potential setbacks.

The terrain also affects the cyclist. It is described as “rock-strewn,” illustrating that it is also comprised of obstacles that the cyclist must maneuver past. In addition, it is stated that the cyclist must “struggle through unyielding sand,” indicating that the cyclist is making slow and laborious progress as they bridge the gap between the beginning and end of the road.

Finally, the finality of the journey is depicted as being “endless,” how it will take “all day” to finish. This shows that the cyclist’s struggles will be continuous and not easily vanquished. The length of the journey is often an important factor for cyclists,
