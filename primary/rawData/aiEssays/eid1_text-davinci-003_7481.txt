The author is using the metaphor of hibiscus' budding in the spring to represent the main character's hope of being ready for the test the next time it's given. The metaphor of the weather and geese returning are symbols of renewal and hope. The phrase is saying that just as the winter hibiscus goes dormant in the cold season, only to bloom again in the spring, the main character has dealt with adversity and has the hope of becoming ready to retake the test when it's offered again. The line serves as an uplifting ending to the story that is reflective of the main character's journey and gives the story a feeling of resolution.
