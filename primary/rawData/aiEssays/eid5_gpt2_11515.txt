The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is such that any self-respecting feminist who identifies with the anti-male/anti-trans narrative finds it rather sad and depressing. However, even after the film is released in 2017 I'm still grateful to many of my fellow feminists who are involved, and to friends and colleagues on social media for their generosity and for being part of this great movement, in which I see that my role as a feminist is to be a role model and I see that all women deserve to be as feminists that make life difficult for themselves.

As I was reading the book you mentioned, how had you found out where feminists were in all the different parts of the globe?

From home is a story of empowerment and love â€“ it explores a few of the ways that they have been and are now, and a bit of a paradox that many of us are not, both politically and economically. It's also the story of how all that can be done to make this space where we live for all women and for all of us feel free now. The book has been extremely productive in taking me into all the different social and political contexts which are currently being set up by those same political actors to provide an inclusive place where all women could work together.

I'm sure the book is still coming through, but have you started reading the book?
