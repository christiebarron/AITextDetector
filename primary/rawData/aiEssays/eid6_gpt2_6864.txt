The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. For one example, it could not be installed at 100 feet low. With the collapse of the Tower of London in 1804, the Empire State Building sank with the building's collapsed wing doors. As an extra safety measure, it opened at the top of its deck.

Although the Empire State Building is a classic building, it is different in many key respects. First, it is not located at the edge of the tower. Rather, it is far from the base of the building. On the east side, when the tower collapsed there was much of a wall that is often seen as a safety measure to prevent fires. The Tower of London was built on the lower floors of the Empire State Building. While the towers are much thicker than on the West side of the building, it is an advantage to walk over that edge of the building on the east side for safer storage. On the west side of the building, it is often found to be a fairly safe safe building.

The Empire State Building is often described as a "big brick building," something which was built on the eastern side of an open field with a long porch (i.e., with wide ceilings). However, the structure was built by the Royal Engineers in 1587, which was still in its infancy and was an unusual construction, in which a brick structure was built by hand. The Royal Engineers designed the tower to have
