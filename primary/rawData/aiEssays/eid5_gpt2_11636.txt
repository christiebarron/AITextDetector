The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' shows the resilience of the human soul that has been shattered under the influence of a relentless and relentless corporate onslaught. This is the subject of the book "From Home is My Book: The Last Days of a Modern American Culture," published by Simon & Schuster on September 6.

"From Home is My Book offers a powerful and moving examination of our society's ongoing struggle not only with the economic and social power of the United States, but also at the hands of a seemingly endless network of corporate capital that includes the major media, the government, industry, the media conglomerates, and even, most important, the very establishment press itself. By telling a vivid portrait of the globalist system of capitalism, This Book will provide a vivid portrait of the American public's desire to live in a modern American Culture, one that is at last being restored and the public's desire for free expression and freedom of expression that continues to inspire much of the media."
