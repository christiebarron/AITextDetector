In Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead", the setting plays a large role in how the cyclist fares. Sol Duc Hot Springs is an isolated location set in forests and mountains that emphasizes how far away and alone the cyclist is. The dark and quiet atmosphere causes a sense of dread, as the cyclist is immersed in a strange area with no sign of life.

The terrain also affects the cyclist. The hills and rugged roads require hard and tedious work, breaking the cyclist’s adrenaline. The cyclist finds himself in an area with a notable lack of pavement and smooth surfaces, forcing him to use every ounce of his strength to get up the many difficult hills. It also creates a sense of danger - it’s easy to see how a single misstep could lead to a serious injury.

The weather is also an important factor in how the cyclist fares. The wet and cold conditions combine to sap the cyclist’s energy and compound the difficulty of the seemingly never-ending road. The weather also contributes to the overall atmosphere of loneliness and isolation, as the mist and wet fog seem to swallow everything around it.

Overall, the features of the setting in "Rough Road Ahead" affect the cyclist in many ways. The terrain, dark atmosphere, and inclement weather all work together to create a difficult and dangerous journey that the cyclist must brave. In spite of the challenge, though, the cyclist persists and is eventually rewarded for his efforts.
