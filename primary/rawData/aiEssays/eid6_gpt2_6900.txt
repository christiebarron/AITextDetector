The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One was the limited way the pilots could have one-off rides. The second problem was that they hadn't used all the materials required to use one-off rides.

Another would be the lack of safety features for pilots. The plane used "drag lights" that blocked one side of the cockpit from touching ground. Another would be the lack of controls and wiring for pilots, plus that they'd have to use a radio tower of different sizes in each cockpit.

Some of these obstacles were insurmountable. A pilot should have known better.

"There's just no way for anyone to do this," Poe said. "I'm gonna go back to piloting a plane like this."
