I remember the time my mother was patient when I was learning how to ride a bike. I was just a kid and I kept on struggling. Every time I tried to pedal, I would fall over or wobble too much. My mother stayed by my side, never getting frustrated or angry. She would calmly remind me when I had lost my balance and offer encouraging words. She was so patient with me, giving me the time and space I needed to get it right. After a while, I finally managed to ride the bike on my own. I'll never forget her patience and dedication in helping me learn something new.
