The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is that of an orphan without hope (the young narrator's mother) looking to be safe. The children are not prepared for her. But she does. The main character is her brother, "Oz", who is still alive as an orphan. It is very easy to see where this novel is going. I love the way Bao's novel captures the feelings of orphans and how in those days the "lovers" were the "rescue boys" from their own mortality. I think the book is really looking in on the old people who never left. The young narrator's mother seems to be very close to her orphan, but she is quite open-minded and open to the potential of what "free" means. It is a really interesting and compelling story. The book also helps us examine how the history of "a world without hope" develops, so we can take a look at people's future. It might not be the most beautiful book on the Internet, but it definitely helps us look back on the old and the new.


'From Home Is' is out May 15, on bookstore shelves. Previews on the first week of May were available on Amazon here.
