I’ll never forget the first time I shared a real, genuine moment of laughter with my now husband. We were both at a friend’s dinner party, and for the first half of the evening, I had kept my distance - I had only met him a week or two prior and wasn’t sure if I should invest any energy into the budding friendship. But, as dinner conversation turned to funny stories from everyone’s past, I noticed the corners of his mouth turning up. He started to open up and share a laugh, and soon my mouth couldn’t stay shut. I found myself joining in, feeling silly yet completely comfortable in his company.

The evening turned into the night, and time flew by in an instant of laughter and jokes. We ditched the dinner party and headed to the neighborhood pub for more shared laughs. We eventually shared a cab home, too shy and too scared to admit what we had already figured out - that we were meant to be. But in that cab ride, the laughter kept going. For the first time, I saw his dark eyes twinkle and I knew I was in for something special.

I’ll always remember that evening and the laughter it brought us both. It was in that moment that our relationship started blooming and will continue to flourish to this day. Laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people, the best way to break down walls and open yourself up
