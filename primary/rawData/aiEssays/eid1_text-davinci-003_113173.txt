Dear Editor,

In todayâ€™s world, computers are an integral part of our lives. We rely on them for communication, access to information, and even entertainment. However, their use is not without consequence.

The effects computers have on us should not be taken lightly. We have seen a significant increase in time spent on the computer, leading to less physical activity and more time spent in front of a screen. This may lead to problems such as increased potential for obesity, neck and back pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, even sleep deprivation.

Furthermore, an addiction to the Internet is a very real problem, as it takes away from healthier activities such as socializing, exercising and even proper nutrition. This type of lifestyle could have a detrimental effect on individuals, leading to symptoms of depression and anxiety.

It is also important to note the influence of computers on our personal relationships. Social media, online forums, and other activities on computers can act as a crutch when it comes to face-to-face interaction, wearing away at the ability to truly connect with one another.

For these reasons, I believe it is important to consider the effects computers have on us. We should understand the risks associated with extended "screen time" and be aware of the potential impact it could have on our overall well-being.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
