I remember a time when I was feeling really overwhelmed and frustrated. I had a lot of school assignments due the next day and no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't focus and make progress. 

At first, I felt so discouraged and thought there was no way I was going to finish them in time. That's when my mom came in to check on me and noticed my distress. She saw that I was feeling helpless, so she stayed with me and sat beside me on my bed.

My mom didn't say anything; she just stroked my hair and let me cry. She patiently waited for me to calm down and eventually I did. 

When I was feeling better, my mom talked to me about the importance of staying positive and encouraged me to keep trying.

I ended up finishing my assignments late that night with my mom's support. I'm so glad I had her patience to pull me through. It taught me the importance of not giving up when times get tough.
