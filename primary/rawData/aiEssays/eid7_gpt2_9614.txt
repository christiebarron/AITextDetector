As he says with such "troubling findings there is no question more important than ever," the findings will be published in JAMA Internal Medicine and accepted for publication in "a peer-reviewed journal."

If a major cause for the illness is a lack of sleep or not having time for sleep deprivation, a recent study published in the Journal of Sleep Medicine will say.

"It's not clear that sleep loss causes a greater degree of depression or suicidal ideation due to that short or no sleep," said study author, Dr. Richard J. Kupcema, of the Boston Children's Hospital.

The same is true when patients have missed three out of 10 hours of sleep, he added.

"A recent study that looked at the effects of sleep Comments found that the sleep loss from both medication and exercise was greatest among adults who lost at least 5 hours of sleep per week and lost 2 hours of sleep a week or less," Kupcema said. "It seems that a longer long stay on this medication might have been the cause of these reductions in depression among adolescents."
