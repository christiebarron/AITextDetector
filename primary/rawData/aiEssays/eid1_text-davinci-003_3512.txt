Censorship in libraries is a highly debated issue, with both sides of the argument having valid points that need to be considered. It is important to remember that libraries are places of knowledge and access to information, and attempts to restrict this access should be done with caution. 

Although I understand the desire to prevent certain materials from being exposed to vulnerable readers, I believe libraries should allow these materials to remain available as long as they are placed in a responsible manner. By allowing censored materials to remain in libraries, children and teens have the freedom to choose for themselves which materials they want to explore and consume. Censoring certain materials in a library sends an inappropriate message to young readers that they are not capable of making their own decisions and that their choices must be monitored and approved by adults. Libraries should be places of learning and personal expression, not locations of restricted access and restricted ideas.

It is also important to remember that adults and teens are the ones using the library, not young children. Libraries should not be imposing their morals on adults and supplying censored resources to any age group. Removing materials from shelves can often be seen as disrespectful to readers who highly value these materials and use them for diverse reasons.
