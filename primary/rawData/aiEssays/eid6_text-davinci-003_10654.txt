The construction of the Empire State Building in 1931 presented a unique problem for the builders—the design would require allowing dirigibles, more commonly known as airships or blimps, to dock. This would be a major challenge, as the ship’s design posed several difficulties that had to be overcome.

The most significant obstacle was the design of the Empire State Building itself. The building was built to be 100 stories tall and over 1,200 feet high. The mooring mast, which was to be used to secure the dirigible, needed to be at least 250 feet long to accommodate the size of the airships. The difficulty was that the Empire State Building did not have the necessary amount of space to build such a tall mast. Engineers had to come up with a way to construct the mast in the limited space available.

After much deliberation, engineers devised a plan to construct a “spiral staircase” of support beams starting from the 85th floor. This winding support structure would be strong enough to support the weight of the mooring mast, and would reach 250 feet in the sky.

The next challenge facing the builders was the construction of the mast itself. It had to be strong and lightweight, and able to withstand the pressures of the airship docking. The solution was to build the mast from a combination of steel and cement. This design was sturdy enough to allow the airships to moor safely on the Empire
