Censorship in libraries has long been a controversial issue. It is understandable to worry about what materials are accessible to our society’s younger generations, however, censorship goes beyond broader implications of morality. Telling people what they can and cannot read, watch, and listen to is in direct violation of a person’s right to freedom of information and expression. 

Books, music, movies, and magazines are all amazing tools of education. They can provide insight into cultures we may not know of, can introduce ideas and expose injustices, and can broaden our understanding of the world. To limit the scope of what we can access is detrimental to our learning process and perpetuates a feeling of oppression to those already in vulnerable positions. For example, the censorship of books by authors of color does an enormous disservice to our youth by silencing their voices and perpetuating a message of inferiority. 

Censorship does not make society cleaner or “better”, it does the exact opposite. If anything, it should be used as a call to action: when someone is exposed to topics, images, and scenes that shock them or that make them uncomfortable, it should be used as an opportunity to educate and inform. By sheltering our children from ideas we disagree with we are doing them a disservice by keeping them from a proper education and true understanding of the world. Information should be separate from personal beliefs; difference of opinion should not limit someone
