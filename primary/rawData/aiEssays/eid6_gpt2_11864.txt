The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The structure's ceiling was so thin that the building's main staircase was too high and the ceiling, used to draw light from a nearby window, blocked out the view of the roof. The elevator shaft opened to a wall of dark red metal after a long fall.

The building was once owned by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and was located at the edge of the National Mall. This building was also the first home to have an interior elevator. Its elevator shaft was also built into the ceiling, forcing them to put one-piece metal into a steel structure to meet the building's standard elevator height.

Efforts by both local authorities and visitors to find the building to allow dirigibles to dock reached a dead end and, after four years, no one was willing to let a dirigible dock in it. With no one else around to see who would be able to dock it, nobody did anything. The only way to get a free dirigible was to use the elevators and the same would happen with the building itself.
