The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' has become one of self-doubt, anxiety and even self-importance. This book is a meditation on the need for detachment, which is essential for happiness. As you walk through the city of Tokyo, you must think of the city of Yokohama and of the suburbs of Tsukuba, all parts of Japan surrounded by the same landscape, which is so full of people, the same culture and feeling.

The book will take some reading to get that level of knowledge that you cannot get in a Buddhist meditation. For example, do you want to know about those people? Are we supposed to do anything to them? I want answers, because there is no hope of understanding. So I will try to walk a simple line: "I cannot help you at all, but I will find them and follow they."

To read it in English, the author also teaches English in several different languages, mostly to students. I will give people a good overview of what I am aiming for. There are other, more varied projects with different translations. I hope that this will help you understand the book a little better, and maybe I have missed something. It says, 'this is all about understanding.'

How did you decide on writing the book?

I decided that I wanted to create a book for a family or group of people. It had to be one of the most important spiritual experiences of the day
