The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is about how she was forced to live in rural Kentucky, where her stepfather, a farmer, was killed after fighting against the Union soldiers.

In a memoir released on Tuesday, she says, "I spent 11 years with my family in the trenches while my father died fighting back against a hostile takeover. I am absolutely devastated with the sadness of having been the only person able to reach any part of the world that could be my home. He had so much faith and a commitment to that cause that no-one wanted to return from the war to the land that he and his family had been trying for hundreds of years and to live somewhere they could return to. My whole life I have known these soldiers because I fought in the trenches, but nothing has ever been as perfect as this. I love to do the things she says. Those are the moments we can remember."

Her memoir was published in the month after she left for Europe and she hopes to write an autobiography called 'Life. Not The War.' In it, she recounts the hardships of life on a "real" road, with two former soldiers still fighting at the camp.

She is also inspired by the role played by her mother, "Talia," in her book and says she is "one of the most determined and courageous people I have ever met. She taught me how to think big, and how to see things through a person's eyes
