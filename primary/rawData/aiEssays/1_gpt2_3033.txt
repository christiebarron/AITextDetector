Two different ways of measuring a person's productivity are the way you measure their income or the way you measure their productivity. If you have a well-established income stream, like a house with a great deal of value, then you can see how many people actually work in your household. In an economy where people live together, and work hard and efficiently, these differences are lessening.

Second conferring this information on people also implies that they are more efficient than others. But if you add together the way you measure people's performance, it's easy to see that the benefits can outweigh the difficulties. We know that people feel more effective by working with different people, at different times. In order to be able to say, "I am better, or better because of you," you must be able to predict what person will be better in this setting. (We might say this to each other as a joke.) In order to do this, we have to know who people and what they pay the most for are in those settings. And we must not forget that these choices shape people's expectations that help them make good decisions.
