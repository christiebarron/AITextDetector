The idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building during its construction was a controversial one. Several obstacles had to be overcome in order to make it a reality. First, the docking mast had to be tall enough to accommodate the dirigibles, which meant that it had to be constructed even taller than the Empire State Building itself. This was challenging as the technicians had to work within the confines of the building's existing floor plan and within the weight limitations of the structure.

Second, the mooring mast had to be strong enough to withstand the force of the wind created by the movement of the blimp, as well as the weight of the blimp itself. To ensure that the structure was up to the task, engineers designed a series of heavy-duty cables constructed from steel, which were connected to the building at various points. The frame was topped off by a small but stout tower, which allowed the dirigible to moor safely in its sling.

The final challenge was to create an efficient system for loading and unloading the ships. The challenge here was two-fold. Not only did technicians have to develop a safe and secure way of transferring people and cargo from the dirigible to the building, they also had to take into consideration the movement of the blimp in strong winds. In order to overcome this challenge, engineers designed a system of pulleys and rollers which allowed the tower to move when necessary, allowing the dirigible to
