One time, I had a flight that was absolutely packed with passengers. It was so uncomfortable with barely enough room to move around. We were sat on the tarmac before takeoff and the flight was already running an hour late. It got later and later and the other passengers began to get restless and quite irritated. I even overheard some people start to complain and argue with the crew members.

I just kept my cool and remained patient. I reminded myself that there was nothing I could do about the delay, and it was just a matter of sitting tight and having some patience. Through deep breaths and slow counts, I managed to keep my peaceful mindset.

Finally, after a whopping two hours, the flight took off. As uncomfortable as it was, the patience I had paid off. I was able to eventually make it to my destination on time, and enjoyed the rest of my trip.
