I was recently at the grocery store picking up a few things for dinner. It was a busy night and the line at the checkout was quite long. However, when it was my turn, the cashier had a bit of trouble dealing with the system. She was visibly frustrated and after a couple of minutes, she paused to take a deep breath. I assured her that she didn’t need to rush and that I was in no hurry. Even though she had never served me before, she thanked me for being so patient with her. I could tell she was embarrassed and she was trying hard to get the job done.

It was a pretty simple thing to do, but I was glad that I was able to keep my calm despite the fact that I was running late for dinner. After about 15 minutes, she had successfully checked out my groceries and I thanked her for her hard work. We both had a good laugh at how long it had taken and I went on my way. It was definitely an experience I won’t forget.
