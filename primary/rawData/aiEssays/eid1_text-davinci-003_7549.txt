The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho returns to the theme of perseverance and how it is possible to overcome difficult times. By referring to the hibiscus plant, which is a symbol of resilience and strength, Ho is alluding to how difficult times will eventually pass and how there is still hope that things will get better eventually. By having her narrator, Karen, refer to taking the test again in the spring, Ho is suggesting that if we are persistent and stay hopeful, even difficult situations can lead to a brighter future.
