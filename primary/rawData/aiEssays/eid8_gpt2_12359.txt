One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was about 12. When we had friends or a date they were all laughing at our jokes but when we'd talk about it one day it was like they were laughing on their own, so they kind of got on with things, but then I just couldn't help myself and I didn't laugh much because as soon as I finished, like I was supposed to say that to them I was sure there was more humor. Then I started crying a year ago after the joke. It's like, 'Okay, maybe people don't know how to laugh and don't make jokes, so it just went off the rails of my psyche when I'd laugh.' Then I'm like: 'But, I have all these great friends because I'm so close to my friends.' That's when I realized that this is all about laughter. I think about this as a way for me to tell my friends to let go of their emotions now that I've actually learned about laughter itself. The world's a funny place. I'm so happy to see the world for what it really is, and I'm happy to see the world for my friends.
