Dear [Editor],

In today’s world, computers are almost ubiquitous. We use them to communicate via email, to stay organized with calendar and to-do lists, and to finish difficult assignments. But are we aware of the potential negative impacts that computers are having on people?

Recent studies have shown that long hours spent on computers can cause eyestrain, headaches, neck aches, vision problems, and more. Prolonged use of computers has also been linked to the development of mental health problems like anxiety and depression. When we spend hours and hours each day staring at a screen, it cuts us off from interacting with people and the environment around us. It’s no wonder that we’re becoming increasingly isolated and disconnected from the world around us.

I believe that computers should be used wisely and sparingly as they carry the potential to have a tremendous impact on our physical, mental, and emotional health. We should step away from the computer screen for at least a few hours every day so we can reconnect with the things that truly matter in life, things like spending time with family, cherishing friendships, and indulging in hobbies or physical activities.

I urge your readers
