I had been out with my friends all night, and soon it was time to say our goodbyes and go home. We parted ways, and as I stepped outside the club I had my coat pulled tight around me to keep out the chilly night air. Out of the corner of my eye I noticed a figure in the alley, huddled against a wall and trying to stay warm. 

I hesitated for a moment, not sure what to do. As I started to walk away, I heard a small laugh coming from the figure. The sound was so unexpected that I couldn't help but stop and turn around.

I took a few steps closer and could make out the figure more clearly. It was a small child, probably no older than seven or eight, with a brightly coloured hat pulled down low over her eyes against the cold night air. Despite her situation, she was still smiling and laughing.

I wasn't sure what to do. But I felt compelled to do something, so I walked towards her and squat down in front of her. "Hi," I said softly, and she looked up at me with a broad smile.

We talked for a few minutes and quickly realized that we had a lot in common. We laughed and joked about silly things and soon my cold was forgotten as the laughter warmed us both up. 

After a few minutes, we had to say goodbye. But I'll never forget that unexpected moment of laughter
