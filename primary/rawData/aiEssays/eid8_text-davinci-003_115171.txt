I remember walking towards my friend's house one day, a little anxious about how our conversation would go. I hadn't seen him in a while, and we had both gone through a lot of changes in the time since we had last seen each other. As soon as I walked up to the porch, my worries started to dissipate. We both burst out laughing. The sound of it was so familiar - the same laughter we had shared for years - and I couldn't contain my joy.

His knuckles were skinned up, and when I asked him what had happened, he told me the story behind the painful welts. I'd heard the tale a million times before, but it never got old. He had been attempting to jump his bike over a small ramp, and he had ended up eating dirt instead. I laughed louder than I could ever remember, and tears streamed down my face.

We talked about what I had been up to, and we talked about what he had been up to, but the conversation never got quiet. We laughed about everything - from family to politics - every few minutes. We laughed until our stomachs ached, our faces turned red, and our cheeks hurt from smiling so much. 

And while there have obviously been some changes in our lives since that day, I know the one constant in our friendship has been laughter. Laughter has been the bridge that binds us through the years, and it has never failed
