 

Dear Editor,

As technology is rapidly advancing, computers have become a huge part of our lives. But what effect does this have on us? 

It can be argued that computers have a positive effect on people, such as making tasks easier and providing more reliable resources at our disposal. It is also true that computers can make us more productive, as we can efficiently organize, save, and process data.

However, I believe that computers also have a negative effect because of their addictive nature. We live in a world where people keep their heads buried in their devices and they don’t interact with each other. We lose communication skills as we rely more and more on computers. Another problem is the effects that the overexposure to blue-light has on our eyes, leading to a reduction in vision clarity, mild headache, and insomnia. 

Therefore, I think that computers should be used in moderation and balance should be preserved between people’s interaction with their devices and people’s interaction with each other.

I urge your readers to think about the balance between technology and personal interaction and work to preserve that balance.

Sincerely,
[Your name]
