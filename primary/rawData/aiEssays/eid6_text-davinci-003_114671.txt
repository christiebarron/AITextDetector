The building of the iconic Empire State Building posed a unique challenge to the builders during its conception. One of the more interesting technical issues they faced was allowing dirigibles to dock atop the building. Dirigibles were a popular form of air travel during the skyscraper's construction and the idea of allowing them to safely land on the Empire State Building generated considerable public interest. However, the task wasn't easy and posed a challenge to the builders.

The first obstacle was space. Dirigibles were very large and would require a large dock to land on the building. The mooring mast, which was designed to allow dirigibles to tether in order to allow passengers to safely disembark, was very tall, standing at over 250 feet in height and was connected to the building by a 91 foot catwalk. It needed to be constructed in a way that ensured it wouldn't be damaged by strong winds or the weight of the docked dirigibles.

The second and greatest obstacle proved to be wind. Even with the height of the mooring mast, wind could cause the large dirigibles to sway and drift. Special equipment would later be developed that would allow pilots to tether the airship to the building more securely, but at the time the builders of the building faced the challenge of creating a mooring mast strong enough that a dirigible could land and then remain fairly steady in the windy conditions.

The builders worked hard to construct a m
