Censorship in libraries has been a contentious issue for many years. Library Genesis is often cited as a major battleground in the war over what can and cannot be viewed, but censorship goes beyond book availability. Music, movies, magazines, and other materials can also be removed from library shelves on the basis of offense. 

The opposing sides in this debate have generally pitted public safety and morality against the freedom of speech and the right for individuals to access any materials of their choosing. Practically, the issue can arise from both sides of the spectrum; for example, a library can be asked to remove books that make pernicious claims related to race or gender, or argue against popularly held scientific theories like evolution. However, censoring any material is a slippery slope. Even popular books can be rejected on the basis of alleged immoral content, like graphic sexual scenarios.

The answer is not to censor material, but to provide balanced access and to offer clear guidance when it comes to accessing potentially offensive content. Libraries should provide resources that explain the viewpoint of each work, such as reviews, critical articles, and context-setting discussions. These methods should be used to provide additional information to the reader, and not to dictate how they should interpret the work. To take censorship further by actually removing materials is ultimately a violation of an individualâ€™s right to access information.

Censorship in libraries must be strongly resisted, and instead replaced with a balanced approach that offers guidance
