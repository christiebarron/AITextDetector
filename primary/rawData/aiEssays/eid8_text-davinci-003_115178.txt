My family had just finished eating dinner when my dad suggested we all go out for ice cream. We hopped in the car and drove down to the local ice cream parlor.

When we got inside, I noticed that everyone in the place was staring at us. I waved and smiled, and they all started smiling and waving back. It made me a bit uncomfortable for a moment, and I wasn’t sure why.

Then my oldest sister spoke up. She said, "Dad, you know we always get the same flavors. Let’s each get something different today so we can try them together!" Everyone got excited about this new idea, and my dad agreed.

We all started making our choices. My youngest sister decided to try something with gummy bears mixed in, and my dad decided to get green tea ice cream. My older sister chose mango sorbet.

When it was my turn to order, I chose a flavor called “Party in Your Mouth” ice cream. As soon as I said it, we all started laughing. The name was too funny, and even the people around us in the shop were laughing with us.

The ice cream ended up tasting great, and that night remains one of my favorite family memories. We were all sitting around the kitchen table laughing, and it felt like the shortest distance between us. That night, we all learned that laughter does bring us closer together.
