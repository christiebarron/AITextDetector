The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In the early 1960s, they faced the problem of overcrowding. The Federal Building Construction and Infrastructure Board (FCBP) could not reach an agreement with building owners about how to manage the growing number of dirigibles. Nevertheless, an agreement was reached, and an agreement was reached in 1965 to allow dirigibles to dock.

The F. D. Building did not allow the introduction of any dirigibles until early 1967. In 1967, however, the Building's own regulations prohibited any dirigibles from being held at the W.W. Bayshore Dock and Terminal on South Broad Ripple Street.

Many of Dirigibles on the W.W. Bayshore Dock are used and are designed for dirigibles, although they are not intended for use in a full-size dirigible. Because of this, dirigibles are not considered to be "full."

In 1966, Congress required that all dirigibles used in public buildings be made of a more durable glass-like substrate. This required that the glass substrate should be a metal alloy that can withstand extreme temperatures or extreme weather. The glass substrate is a protective barrier formed by an aluminum sheet which absorbs temperatures of temperatures of about 30° to 35°C and therefore is capable of absorbing a similar amount of ultraviolet radiation as a glass substrate.

In 1970, following a congressional
