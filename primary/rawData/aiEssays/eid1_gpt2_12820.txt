Computers have many effects on people.

First off of all the computers make your life unbearable. If one goes for work you'll feel the pain and suffering through every aspect of your daily activities.

Second to all this pain, there are people around you who understand this pain. When they see that I'm an idiot it's the first thing they think of about me. In the same way that you are so close to you.

There are many who have noticed your attitude, their eyes are wide open in disbelief when they see me. I have been treated much better by people who share their own concerns. This makes a huge difference.

So I hope this helps with your journey with Computer Disorders. Be sure to leave a comment under the "You Really Love Computer Disorders" box. It's great to see you on the first day and I look forward to seeing you in the days leading up to your journey!
