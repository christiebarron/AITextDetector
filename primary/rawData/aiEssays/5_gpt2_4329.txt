The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is very similar to that used to narrate the fictional character, with many familiar aspects of the real Man-Thing set to the scene.

While some other characters' interactions (e.g., the aforementioned Alistair Hirst), as well as their personal and professional interactions make for familiar story-telling features, 'From Home is' only shows that while their family and colleagues may not be the same in life, it is the type of relationship that enables 'From Home' to make a statement.

When considering the different ways Man-Thing communicates on and off the screen, it is helpful to consider how characterisation will influence their interactions in 'From Home,' given their personalities and roles in the world of Man-Thing. The way characters interact in this 'From Home' world can be seen as the key to understanding the life of Man of the present day.
