One of the difficult times that required me to be patient was when I was caring for my aging parents. As my parents got older, they needed more and more help. I would take them to doctor's appointments, help them with their errands, and be there for them to get extra support or companionship. Even though it was often mentally and physically exhausting, I was understanding and tolerant of their needs and never complained. 

One particular day comes to mind when my dad lost his patience. I had been trying to get him to finish his errands but he was slow, stopping to chat with his old friends and lay down for little breaks. I knew that he was overwhelmed by the mountain of tasks that needed to be done and was beginning to doubt that we would be able to finish in time. I could see that he was getting frustrated so I remained patient, calmly encouraging and reassuring him that we would get it done. In the end, we managed to finish his errands with just a few minutes to spare. My patience helped defuse a stressful situation and made a difference in our day.
