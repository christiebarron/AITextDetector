An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a child with autism. Our son was very ill and we were trying to get him to get a CT scan. My doctor and medical team decided he wasn't well enough and let him go.

The next day he was awake for 11 hours and needed 8 hours of rest for a CT scan. I put the CT scanner over my head, sat down to watch his face and took a picture. A few nights later, he woke up on a Monday and went to bed with a fever of 40 degrees. His doctor recommended he have one more CT scan and I gave him one!

As the rest of the world took notice, my family and I were able to do everything in our power to save or prevent his death. He was given a life sentence in the state prison system and sentenced to prison probation, probationary work and a part-time working arrangement.

His wife and two sisters were brought to Florida to have the day but the doctors did not think he would get the time. The families lost all visitation rights that came with visitation. Most had limited legal rights, most had no recourse to sue the state or its taxpayers.

It was then that he learned about his disability. Our family members could send a letter to the state attorney's office about what happened on that day and the attorney could write nothing â€” not a notice.

Unfortunately, my disability was not something we were able to do
