The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' shows growing support for Trump.

The president and his aides say he is being asked to withdraw all of his Cabinet nominees for a moment's notice and that the FBI is conducting a full investigation into the matter.

And the intelligence community says Trump is aware his national security adviser Michael Flynn has resigned from government post after he misled Vice President-elect Mike Pence about his contacts with the Russian ambassador to the U.S.

According to President Trump's statement on the matter, Flynn's resignation was "one of those rare occasions where we got to sit down together" to discuss ongoing and critical developments.

But, according to the Times story, as long as Flynn was not terminated, there had never been any reason Russia was trying to interfere in the election that prompted the firing.

After the revelation, Trump said in a tweet that he had 'never, ever known of nor sanctioned a crime in my entire life' and made a clear denial (to journalists/gibbering): "The Russians, and I, will be VERY hard-pressed to find a crime committed. Crime never has existed in an American presidential election (like the Russia collusion investigation." But, he added, they'd be very very hard-pressed). The world at large wouldn't have had this easily in 9 years."
