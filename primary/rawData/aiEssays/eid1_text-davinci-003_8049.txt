The construction of the Empire State Building in New York City presented a number of unique challenges, not least of which was a need to accommodate airships that could dock on the building’s spire. When the building was designed in 1929, air travel was an exciting new prospect, and the designers of the building wanted to take advantage of it by allowing dirigibles an easy access point to the building. The idea of allowing airships to moor at the building’s peak provided both a unique transportation option to passengers and a one-of-a-kind opportunity to its tenants. In order for the Empire State Building to accommodate airships, the engineers and contractors had to overcome a number of obstacles during its construction.

The most pressing obstacle was the design of the Empire State Building’s antenna. Dirigibles are large and require a sturdy mooring point to avoid any kind of damage, and the antenna of the spire was not designed with them in mind. In the book “The Mooring Mast,” Marcia Amidon Lusted writes that the engineers compensated for this by constructing an internal elevator lift between the 86th floor of the building and the spire. This eighty-two foot mast was designed with thick steel cables and a crossbeam as well as a retractable platform, upon which the airship tethers would be secured during docking. 

In order for this design to work, however, engineers needed to
