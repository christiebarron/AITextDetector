Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my opinion on the impact that computers have on people today. While I understand that computers are an invaluable tool, I believe that too much reliance on them can be detrimental to the individual, and even society as a whole.

First and foremost, computers have replaced human interaction in many areas, creating a more isolated society. We conduct more and more of our business online and avoid having meaningful, face-to-face conversations. This can lead to a sense of alienation and disconnection which can detrimentally affect personal relationships.

Secondly, too much reliance on computers has lead to an over-dependence, such that we no longer have the skills to function without them. For instance, many of us need to use a calculator for basic mathematics tasks, whereas before the 1970s almost everyone could perform calculation on paper or in their head. Research also shows that people with too much screen time experience sight and overall health problems.

Finally, computers have played a tremendous role in slowing down our productivity as multitasking has become the norm. We try to reply to emails or messages while attending meetings or even talking with our family: how can we expect to give our fullest attention and attention to any one task?

I therefore urge people to set limits and use computers in moderation. Our lives depend on efficient use of technology for both personal and professional purposes: but differentiating between necessity and excess is vital.

Sincerely,
