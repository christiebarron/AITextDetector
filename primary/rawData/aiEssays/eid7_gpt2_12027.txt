An example of a time someone in my life was patient was me, a patient who has always been patient of me for years."

This is a statement Dr. Lutz:

Lutz can add:

"Every time someone in my life is patient of me I see her, and she is patient and she feels very comfortable there."

And "we do not believe that patients are being treated according to a schedule or as a standard, that they are being treated too harshly or too early." They "do not believe that what they are doing with their lives is fair and just."

And "it is very frustrating that some parents can not give the best parents out there the advice and help that they can give their child."

Do these kids not believe what they are doing? Well, it is for a reason that is not even addressed in the "How to Respond," as you'll see. The idea that all behavior is a human response to circumstances is a lie: it isn't about your beliefs. It is not about the person or the behavior (to be fair, Dr. Lutz himself claims the "what-if" scenarios he says most often makes them feel that way). It is about one's mental attitude: to take control of the situation, to take what is happening and see to it as a matter of personal choice. These are "mental responses."

"You have to be really patient," said Dr. Lutz
