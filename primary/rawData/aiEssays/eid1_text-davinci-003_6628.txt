Dear Editor,

As computer technology continues to evolve, it’s clear that the impact computers have on how people live and work is massive and growing. From smart phones that enable us to stay connected with the world, to laptops that make working from home a reality, the conveniences of computer technology cannot be overlooked. However, it’s important to also consider the potential negative consequences computers have on us.

For one, the ease of having so much information at our fingertips could contribute to a decrease in critical thinking skills. We are now in a world where someone can press a few buttons on a computer and instantly have the answer they are looking for, as opposed to having to think deeply for the solution. Further, there is a dark side of technology that enables people to participate in activities online without ever having to meet or truly interact with another person. This lack of first-hand human contact could lead to a lack of social skills and the psychological effects of feeling isolated, disconnected, and lonely.

Computer technology certainly makes our lives more convenient. However, it’s important for us to be aware of the potential health and psychological implications of relying on computers too much. We should strive to find a balance to ensure that we are living our lives to the fullest and not using computers as a substitute for actual human engagement and meaningful experiences.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
