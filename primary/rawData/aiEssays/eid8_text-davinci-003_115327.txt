I hadn't had a good laugh in a while. I was feeling a little down and had been having a rough few days at work and at home.

My best friend, who knew me all to well, came to the rescue. She told me to take a break from everything and come spend the day with her. 

It was just what I needed. We spent the day talking, eating ice cream, and walking in the park. But the best part of the day was when we started talking about our most embarrassing moments from Middle School. 

I felt my cheeks turning red as I recalled the time I wore a bright purple suit to the eighth-grade formal and nearly everyone laughed at me. Thankfully, my friend didn't let me get too embarrassed, and soon she was laughing, too. It wasn't long before we were both in hysterics with tears running down our faces.

After days of feeling sad and overwhelmed, it was a much-needed release of emotion. Laughter had, once again, brought us closer together and connected us in a way only laughter can.
