The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the building. The most pressing issue was the sheer size of the building. At 1,454 feet and 102 stories high, the Empire State Building was one of the tallest structures in the world in the 1930s, towering over the New York skyline. As such, docking a dirigible to the building was no easy feat.

The docking process was incredibly complex. On the building's 86th floor a mast elevator was constructed which would lift heavy loads to the roof, so they could be installed in place. British engineers designed a tube-like mast with guide pins that would help to secure the moorings of the dirigible. This mast was then connected to an elevator that would lift passengers and cargo up to the mooring level.

Given its height, the challenge was then to ensure the rigidity and stability of the building while a large, floating vehicle was attached. The engineers consulted wind experts and aircraft designers to determine an appropriate number of mooring cables, and strengthening girders were placed in the building’s frame to counterbalance the additional weight of the dirigible.

The design of the mooring mast also posed many challenges. Marcia Amidon Lüsted wrote in The Mooring Mast that the mast’s elevator had to be large enough to accommodate passengers and cargo, yet short enough so that the mast stopped far enough below
