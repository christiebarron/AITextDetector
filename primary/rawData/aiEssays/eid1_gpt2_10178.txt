Computers have many effects on people. A couple of things that should be observed are:

People tend to react impulsively to new things. They often try to rationalize a situation, because they've been through it. In other words, they need to justify something that's in their past. As far as that goes, people often need to justify their situation when there are no other alternatives. That's because most of us don't even try to justify anything other than the fact that someone thinks that a problem with a person won't bother them.

People tend to see themselves as important and important people. People like to think their lives are important because of how they're treated. In other words, they're valued because they're so. But they do that in ways that don't actually affect other people.
