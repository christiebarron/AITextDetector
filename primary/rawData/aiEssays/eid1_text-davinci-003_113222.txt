Dear [Newspaper Editor],

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have had on people and why I believe the readers of your paper should be in agreement with me.

As computers have become ever more prevalent and powerful in our everyday lives, so too have the effects they have on how we live and work. Computers have made it easier than ever to store and share vast quantities of data that would be inaccessible and hard to manage without them. They help with automating many mundane tasks, allowing us to focus our attention on what matters most.

Perhaps the biggest impact of computers has been on the economy. The use of computers has led to a rise in productivity and efficiency. This has enabled businesses to become more successful, providing new jobs and more opportunities for people across the world.

Finally, computers have helped to bring people together, creating better collaboration and communication. They allow us to connect with people from around the world and share ideas and experiences.

Ultimately, computers have revolutionized our society in a very short period. They have had a mostly positive impact on our lives and this should be acknowledged and fully appreciated.

Thank you for your time and kind consideration.

Sincerely,
[Name]
