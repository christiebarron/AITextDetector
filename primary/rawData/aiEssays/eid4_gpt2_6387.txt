The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because "at its birth, it never had any real hope for survival. In order to escape to her homeland, a great man fell into great distress. All that he had ever done was drive his car, to create the fear and doom of the world and turn the whole world into chaos and bloodshed." And he did.

Now we can all forgive him and agree that we should never abandon the hope for survival that so many good people are dying every day of starvation, and we should never throw a few of them off the road to famine with too much food. We can all agree that after all the terrible things that have happened, the world can all still remain peaceful and free. But you can also admit that the world is an imperfect and even more tragic kind than those who try or fail to survive. Because when a human family is killed, the world is "broken up," and a family of people is lost, where is hope, where is hope without hope? (For some reason, there is no hope for other people.)

What do we do about the terrible things that are going on around us every day of the year? What kind of efforts do we make to end our misery just in a quick, simple way? What kind of strategies do we use to prevent the worst from happening? And will you take that in your daydreaming or reality and do something about our past?
