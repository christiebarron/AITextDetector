The building of the Empire State Building marked a monumental step in the development of the modern metropolis. A technological development that was being explored during its construction was the ability to dock dirigibles at its rooftop. However, the introduction of this idea brought a slew of daunting technical and legal obstacles. This essay will discuss the various impediments the builders of the Empire State Building faced in regards to allowing the docking of dirigibles.

One of the most difficult issues was engineering the aero-marine mooring mast to serve as a landing pad. The mooring mast was an unprecedented invention—an intricate engineering feat—and its mere presence raised many questions. For instance, the mast must be securely bolted and its parts securely latched together in order to prevent it from being pulled down in gusts of wind; it also must be constructed resilient enough to withstand the constant pressure from docking airships. Moreover, the powerhouse of the mooring system must be sufficiently powered to accommodate ships of different sizes, as well as offer a strong enough infrastructure to act as a safe and efficient landing pad.

The second major issue was the legal ramifications of this unprecedented docking system. Even if the engineering and construction of the mooring mast met all safety standards, the makers of the Empire State Building would still need to receive federal approval and certainly reassure all the parties involved in the safety of dirigible passengers and crew. Airship crews creating contracts with private real estate, while common
