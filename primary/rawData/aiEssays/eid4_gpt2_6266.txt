The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it tells the stories of how you find yourself in the end.

If it doesn't start with the book, this book should, but its in need of that title change.

Winter Hibiscus is about the story of a guy who learns of his daughter's death but does not know why her remains are there.

I am happy to know Snow's is a good book for young children, and that they do not have to worry about missing out on something too big to forget.


I have been thinking for a while about how this book is going to fit, and of its contents being from the first books I read, the first book that I have ever read, that makes me think back to reading that earlier. It is such a good book. It can be found in most schools this week, on Amazon, Barnes and Noble, if you happen to be in the States, or at least in your local newspaper. There is a large overlap with the best. My wife is an avid reader, and I know that I would like to give her that.


Also, this book contains many interesting historical facts that were added by readers. I will add them after the spoilers hit if anyone is interested.


Snow is a story set in the 1940s in a country with an insane, totalitarian government, the only member of the ruling class, is killed, and her daughter is left behind
