In Joe Kurmaski's story “Rough Road Ahead,” the features of the setting have a direct impact on the cyclist. The environment in which the cyclist travels is hilly and dreary, covered in rocky terrain and bleak weather—all of which prove challenging for him. The twisted and uneven roads are difficult to traverse, and the cyclist is forced to use every ounce of his strength to manage to climb the steep hills. Further, the relentless downpour of rain adds an extra layer of difficulty, as the rain makes the roads slippery and dangerous for cycling.

The cyclist's age is also an important factor in the setting. Due to his advanced age, the cyclist moves slower on the ascent and descent, and his body becomes easily exhausted from the journey. The hostile environment, with its steep hills, slippery terrain, and inclement weather, exacerbates his physical condition even further. As a result, the cyclist is pushed to his limits and learns to utilize all of his strength to keep going.

The setting also contains undertones of a moral and spiritual struggle for the cyclist. The journey’s treacherous characteristics are symbolic of the cyclist's personal challenges, which he must overcome in order to reach the end of the road. By facing his own physical and mental limitations, the cyclist is able to come to terms with his own mortality and come to a greater understanding of life and death.
