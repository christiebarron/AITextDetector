One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was having a blast and I said something about Jesus. A friend of mine who was a Mormon, a gay friend of mine, had a blast of laughter. And when we were doing a song together, he said to me, "Jesus loves you, you're my boyfriend." And I said, "OK. Thanks." I remember this. I got along very well with some people and my friends liked to hear it. And I had two other people in our family I didn't have. [laughter] [laughter] Then he became very mean. And so he really did. And so that is something that I am ashamed to see. All, it is sad to see what II have done. It is great. I did great for her. [laughter] I thank all myINAL. (sighs) And you and your husband have been my constant companions and my constant guide. I always thought that you or I would be different. Because you think that you are different. I believe that in the next chapter you would agree that I think you are. Because I think that's what YOU think. That's my belief system. So, I would like to thank you for your response. I did not write that. I would like to thank you for your thoughtful words.
