The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. When they attempted to build an exterior dirigibles in the 1940s, they encountered obstacles like:

1. Not finding any airship or plane to dock

2. Not needing to install new parts

3. Unnecessary repairs that made things too expensive and uncomfortable

4. Too much maintenance like putting out a fire truck

5. Not being able to get parts in while people were building

6. Not building a tower when people were doing the work

When the Empire State Building was opened, the workers had a long list of things to do. Each worker had to have an empty workshop and take care of his or her needs. They made sure all the necessary parts were installed, built and painted by people they knew.

After about 20 years, the Empire State Building was closed down. It wasn't until 1973 that new structures began to get built.

The Empire State

The first Empire State Building was built in 1889 on the northeast corner of East and East Madison. It has now been a part of downtown Albany in more than fifty years. The Empire State Building opened its first building in 1885 as the State Art Center on Lake Geneva. Today it is the largest building in the National Capital Region.

History shows us that the Empire State Building was the first private building in New York City and was one of the wealthiest.
