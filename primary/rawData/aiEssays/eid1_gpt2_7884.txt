Computers have many effects on people. For example, when the CPU gets overwhelmed with its needs, it may cause it to lose focus. It's easier for you to avoid being distracted than to be overwhelmed by the physical world, which tends to push your mental capacities into overdrive.

The effects of your actions on others might be equally great to you, and that's actually very valuable to your business. I know firsthand how much work a company spends on developing technologies they call "smart phones." But how many of those days are in fact spent on development of smarter phones that will make it possible to build systems like Apple's Siri that make your business simpler or faster?

So what do you do?

Try out and learn what makes you happy. I often recommend doing a couple of things at once to get you started. Start early. You can help your network to have a better idea of your goals and challenges. You can start with a few simple tasks every day.

The next time you do something new, make sure you're always on time and in front of deadlines.

You also can learn about and adapt to other times and situations. If an app is really useful for you, get a copy and learn how to use it to get it back into the app store.

The next time you get a feeling that you're frustrated that things aren't working out, take a look at someone else's experience for a glimpse of an improvement.
