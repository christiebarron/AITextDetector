Minfong Ho ends Winter Hibiscus with this line to symbolize the resilience of the protagonist, Koji. Throughout the story, Koji struggles to pass a math test that will prevent him from being sent back to Indonesia. Koji's determination is personified in the hibiscus, a plant that he initially thought could not withstand the freezing temperatures of winter. However, the hibiscus survives and Koji's hope is renewed. The phrase "when the snows melt" conveys the idea that Koji is awaiting a chance for a fresh start and this gives him motivation to try and pass the test again. The spring symbolizes new life and possibility, and Koji is determined to not give up.
