There I was, walking on the beach with my best friend. We had been friends for as long as I can remember and there was a level of comfort between us that comes from sharing in all those special moments growing up. 

But as we walked along and took in the beauty around us, we started to get on each other’s nerves. It was nothing major, just little things that seemed to add up. 

After a few moments of awkward silence, I finally decided to break the tension and told a joke. As I said the punchline, I was worried that my joke would fall flat, that I was about to make things worse. 

But instead, there was a hint of a smile on my friend’s face which quickly grew into a full-on burst of laughter. We were both laughing so hard, the laughter echoing down the beach. I felt as if a weight had been lifted. 

We continued on our walk, both now feeling that same level of comfort with each other that had been there at the start. I had forgotten how laughter could bring two people so much closer together.
