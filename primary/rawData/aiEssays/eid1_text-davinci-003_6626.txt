Dear Editor, 

It’s no secret that computers have revolutionized the way we live, work, and play. From communication to shopping, computers have made life vastly easier and more efficient. But have computers had an effect on people in other ways?

I believe computer use has had both a positive and a negative impact on people. On the plus side, computers have made communication with family and friends far more accessible. Chatting online, sharing family news, sending photos, and more have helped keep us connected. Computers have also made learning convenient, giving everyone access to a wealth of information. 

On the other hand, computers have caused a decrease in physical activity. Many jobs that used to require manual labor have been replaced by computers, meaning a lot of us are sitting at desks all day. Additionally, entertainment sources such as streaming services, gaming consoles, and social media have encouraged people to stay inside and avoid getting much-needed exercise.

Computers have provided us with amazing opportunities for convenience and connection, however, it’s important that we use them in moderation. We need to be conscious of our physical health and take regular breaks from technology in order to stay active.

I urge readers to consider the good and bad effects of computers and use them mindfully, in order to avoid any of the negative side effects.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
