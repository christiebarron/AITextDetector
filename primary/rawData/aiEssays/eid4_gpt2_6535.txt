The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because there isn't much of a new plot to go through there (unless you count two other stories, which of course are pretty standard). It takes place over three and half years of his life in the New York neighborhood of Harlem. He falls in love with an elderly woman called Barbara (Shannon Mowrick), a local girl. Their first date is a little less exciting than they expected. He later discovers that Barbara and Howard play for money in a park. All we know is that in order to get on an elevator to an early-morning drive, she gives up the "lick of the hand." What we do not know is that the story starts in the city of Harlem, where you can catch the movie "The Little Prince" in theaters on December 7, 2005.
The book doesn't get a whole lot of attention until they talk about their story to each other, but they all speak and feel the same way. This is probably one of the rare stories where everyone is talking about one other character being the hero at some particular moment in time, which is interesting, given that it's so short but certainly has a strong story line behind it. In any case, I'm going to go ahead and give that story at least a couple of paragraphs to work with from there...
