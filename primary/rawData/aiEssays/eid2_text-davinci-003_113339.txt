In recent years, debates around censorship in libraries have become increasingly heated. While some argue that certain materials should be removed from library shelves if they are deemed offensive, others strongly reject this notion. Although it is impossible to please everyone all the time when it comes to deciding which materials should be included in libraries, censorship as a form of censorship should not be tolerated. 

First of all, the freedom to access different points of view is a fundamental human right. This means that people should always be free to explore different thoughts and opinions without fear of censure. By censoring certain materials, we are robbing individuals of their ability to access diverse materials and attract their own conclusions. This can be damaging to society, as it prevents people from developing a full understanding of the world they live in. 

Secondly, censorship in libraries detracts from the core values of library services. Libraries are for all, including those who may not have the same interests or opinions as those in power. This means that mechanisms for censorship may unfairly discriminate against the opinions of minority groups, creating a smokescreen of selective censorship. In essence, censorship is the antithesis of fundamental principles of impartiality, neutrality and inclusiveness that guide librarianship.

Finally, and just as importantly, censorship in libraries can increase inequality. Many libraries are already under-resourced and underfunded, and so any imposed restrictions can further reduce the availability of books that would have been of benefit to library patrons
