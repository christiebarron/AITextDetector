The Empire State Building, nicknamed the "Empire of the Sky" or 'Lightning of the Skies' was the world's tallest building at the time of its completion in 1931. It was designed with the intention of allowing dirigibles to dock at the top spire of the building. However, the venture was fraught with numerous obstacles and ultimately failed to materialize. This essay will illustrate the range of obstacles that the builders faced in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, as outlined in Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted's 'The Mooring Mast'.

Firstly, the mooring mast had to be able to withstand the structural strain of being tethered to a huge airship. For this, engineers initiated a complex process to determine the precise dimensions of the mooring mast and equipped it with safety features such as an anti-sway system to reduce the swaying motion of the airship, and also "anemometers" to measure wind speed. To ensure the durability of the mooring mast, the engineers also carefully evaluated the load-bearing capacity of the building. Unfortunately, despite these steps, the mooring mast was ultimately deemed to be structurally inadequate as the size of the airships had greatly increased since the building was erected. 

Secondly, there were significant legal and regulatory constraints that needed to be addressed. Initially, the plan was to form a joint venture between the city of New York and a commercial
