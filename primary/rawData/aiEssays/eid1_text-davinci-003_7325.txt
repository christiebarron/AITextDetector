The setting of Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead” plays a significant role in the story. This setting impacts the cyclist in multiple ways. 

The cyclist first experiences this setting as they are on their route, heading up a hill. This hill is described as long and treacherous, with protruding boulders and narrowing curves. The cyclist finds this route physically demanding and tiresome. The physical features of the setting such as the terrain and altitude contribute to this cycling challenge, adding to the story’s suspense and the cyclist’s struggle. 

The cyclist also experiences the setting emotionally. As the cyclist navigates the hill, their physical and mental exhaustion take a toll. Kurmaski uses this passage to illustrate the fatigue and frustration of cycling up a hill. He selects language which reflects the cyclist’s internal struggle, such as “treacherous terrain” and “demanding route”. These words invoke a sense of difficulty and frustration that the cyclist faces and, as the story progresses, this emotion has a further impact on the cyclist and the story overall. 

The setting further impacts the cyclist’s will and determination to complete the ride. The cyclist initially sees the hill as an intimidating challenge, yet they persevere and find the strength to reach the top despite the difficulty. This determination is exemplified in the cyclist’s triumphant reaction upon reaching the peak of the hill
