One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I came to Canada, and I felt this weird feeling of relief, knowing this was okay. I had this feeling of, 'Fuck this.' So I thought, 'I'm going to make this a part of my life and let my friends and family experience an emotional and special experience.' And so after a month of going without a phone when I came to Canada, and then the phone calling started and my friends and family were in my room, they said 'you can't do that! How can this be a part of your life?' It was a great idea, and it took four different people, I think it took two months, really.

Katherine: It's interesting to me that it has taken a real, long time to show this to people. So, you're trying to make sure there is a way in which you can still feel your true feelings. Did you really start out with this when you were in London or any other place?

Peter: Yes, there was a time when there was a moment. I have no idea if I remember that and then people who I'd known for 10 to 15 years did it. I don't know if it was because their families were so supportive of me, but it's definitely in retrospect. Like you mentioned before, it took me a year of figuring out why certain songs were too emotional and how, and this is a good place for that.
