Dear Editor,

Technology has made its way into our lives in many ways, with computers being one of the most common forms of technology that we encounter every day. We use our computers for communication purposes, to do our work, to be entertained and even to socialize, but how do they impact our lives?

The use of computers can have both positive and negative effects on people. On the plus side, computers can help us become more productive and efficient. We can use them to handle deadlines more quickly, to make sure our work is done accurately, and to automate processes that would otherwise be too tedious to do on our own. Computers also give us access to an unlimited amount of information, allowing us to acquire knowledge more quickly and thoroughly.

On the other hand, the pervasive presence of computers in our lives has caused some problems, from physical health issues such as eyestrain and repetitive stress injuries to the potential for more serious psychological issues such as cyber-bullying and depression. Computers can also reduce the amount of physical activity we do, which can lead to obesity and other health issues.

In conclusion, computers are no doubt useful tools, but their use must be done with care and consideration. Taking periodic breaks from working on the computer, exercising regularly, and limiting excessive use of social media can help us to maintain a healthy lifestyle while maximising the benefits that computers offer us.

I hope that readers of this paper will take these
