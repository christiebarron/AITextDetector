For example if you've tried to stop at the station but have to pull past the bike park at the same time, how does this affect the cyclist?

There are 2 main aspects of rough road ahead which we focus on in this section, but are worth going over. First, there's a great deal of variance on the different things. For example, in cycling in the Northern District, the streets have been different but different enough to tell a much different story. This is true even if you're not the most 'advanced' driver, for instance, and even if you aren't on a road that looks less like it is on a'regular' road in a typical road conditions the road looks more like it is being run.
