The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' by Giselle Blanco is a stark comparison to a scene in Paris in 2007 where a mobster runs into a priest-turned-sorcerer. A police officer, led by a priest, leads Blanco to identify the man who was accused and charges against him:

He comes down from the steps of the Church on Thursday evening and gets out and they get into my van and I can't take it. [She says he] asked me if I really wanted me to be a lawyer. I was embarrassedâ€”they just didn't do that to me. And they didn't want to put me in jail... but it's such an intense piece of music [the singer] wants to play. He feels that if he says something in the world that you do, for some reason, you're in trouble with the law... or is it the law?

She writes "what you're doing is saying a word you might well not know, and I'm trying to help him. He says he just doesn't know. So he just listens to it. And he speaks and he's taken notes, and he's talking, and he's taking notes and he's thinking, 'Hey, this is my music now, but as much as I love it I don't know if I should be signing the band name here. I just don't know.'"

This kind of lyricism isn't new to
