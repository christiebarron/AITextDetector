I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is bad," he told BuzzFeed News on Monday, adding that he did not plan to take the move over censorship complaints.

He also said he hopes to continue pushing for the library's reinstatement to include " OVERWATCH " in its name.

"In the meantime, I'll keep pushing for a real book on the Internet if need be," he declared.

Last week, a major tech firm sued the United States Department of Labor, alleging it was discriminating against LGBT people, and an earlier, high-profile case involved the government suing the U.S.-based National Center for Lesbian Rights for allegedly blocking services for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students. The complaint was based on a letter the Federal Bureau of Investigation sent to several of the companies, and it is expected to eventually lead to a class action lawsuit against many of the companies involved.
