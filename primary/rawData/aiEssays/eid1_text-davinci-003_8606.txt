We had been dating for two months, and the relationship was going well. We talked often, shared stories, and had a lot of fun together. One day, my partner and I decided to take a walk in the park. We were both feeling a bit silly that day, so we laughed our way through the park. 

As we walked, we started to make up funny names for the nearby ducks, which made us both laugh even harder. I was in tears by the time we left the park, not from sadness or exhaustion but from pure joy. 

We both had an incredible time, and it was the laughter we shared that made it so special. It felt like the laughter had created a connection between us that had been missing before that day. We knew that no matter what, we would always have that laughter to rely on.
