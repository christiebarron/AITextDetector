The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

1.) Unusual equipment had to be invented.

2.) Some designers and architects had to keep the space separate.

3) And on and on the project continued. More and more builders became impatient. In 1977 the Federal Government was pressured into adopting the Empire State Building as its building code. As the building codes were more and more different, the builders started to find ways to create their own versions of skyscrapers.

The Empire State Building was not all that different from the three-story (4 story) skyscrapers of New York City. Building codes were never as complex yet. But still, they were. One of the first examples was the New York City Building. Although nearly identical to the Empire State Building, the model had two main features: 1.) It was composed of a single flat-topped facade of stone and sandstone, with a four-story building at the base of the building; 2.) It weighed an impressive 400 tons, and was a three-story building with a total height of 300 stories (two floors). In the early 20th century the Empire State Building was demolished so that it was a low-rise building in the city's skyline.
