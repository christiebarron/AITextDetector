 

Dear Editor, 

As a lifelong resident of this community, I would like to express my opinion on the growing presence of computers in our lives. Computing has undoubtedly improved the daily lives of many and revolutionized the way we access information. That said, I am also concerned about computers’ potential negative influences on people. 

First, there is the risk of people becoming addicted to their devices. Being constantly connected to the Internet creates a sense of connection and belonging, leading people to spend too much time on social media and neglecting other, more important commitments. Moreover, it can be quite damaging to our mental health, with people exposed to a toxic mix of cyberbullying, hate speech, and lies, which can sometimes generate feelings of insecurity and inadequacy. 

Second, there are physical risks, such as eyestrain and fatigue due to the constant use of screens, as well as lack of exercise due to spending too much time sitting down. Except in certain cases, our bodies were not designed to sit for hours; they need physical activity.

Finally, there is also the risk of cybercrime and losing data due to viruses and malware. This can cause significant financial losses and even threaten the security and privacy of individuals’ activities.

To summarize, computers are undoubtedly essential to our modern lives, but we need to be careful with their use and ensure that we are not exposed to unwanted, and sometimes risky, situations. Technology
