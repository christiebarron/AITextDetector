An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was a little girl. I was always very optimistic in thinking of the future. I always knew I could hope for something. The person that came over took me on a day trip where I had a couple of beers in the hot water. And she was so happy. So much that we talked about it and she always said this is a time to work.

What do you enjoy doing?

One day I saw a movie because I felt like it was better to do something I could do on my own. So I put together that little movie as a way to support myself and show them how much you do. It's also my second movie. I'm going to do three. I'll be back around four to six months. I still have plans.

How's it feeling right now?

I'm working better and hopefully getting stronger. I feel strong.

Do you know if it's working?

I love making films. I still did all the stuff I did back then that I love now, that I'd love doing with a friend. It is a lot of hard work, but there aren't a lot of hours wasted. It's good, no fear. This is a big part of what makes this project successful now. We are just trying to finish it before we get back to work. It's been crazy. But this is all been going very well.
