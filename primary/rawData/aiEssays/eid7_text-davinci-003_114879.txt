I remember when I was in the third grade, I got in a fight to another student for making fun of me. My teacher, rather than scolding or punishing us, asked us to talk it out. We disagreed and the student refused to apologize. We stayed in the room for about an hour and although I was very angry and impatient, my teacher just stayed there with us and patiently waited. Eventually, the student apologized for his actions and we both hugged it out before going back to our desks. I was really impressed by how patient my teacher was, she understood it was a tough moment for both of us and let us talk it out until we were ready to let go.
