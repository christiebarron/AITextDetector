An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I started working at Facebook on the day of the Olympics in Sydney last year. It's a place where many of us had a bad experience. We'd put out messages in which we thought our post might be more appropriate to give out. Some people would make sure our posts were good enough for a post, and some would make sure that their comments were better to give out. It was a different experience. The real problem was how we worked with Facebook."
