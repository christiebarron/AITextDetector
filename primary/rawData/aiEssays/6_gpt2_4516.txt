The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

As part of the U.S. Department of Energy's Joint Spacecraft and Rocket Defense Program, the Defense Department spent $9.5 million on four dirigibles during construction of the Empire State Building. The D.E.A.'s second-generation dirigibles -- known as "batteries in the building" -- are more expensive than standard dirigibles and are less reliable than any kind of mounted laser. Also, the batteries, which are attached to a central core mounted on either end of a rocket, require more space in order to use.

The D.E.A. proposed two more dirigibles for the U.S. Army's 5th Corps, which include a two-part version of the 811-inch Ellington. These dirigios, installed on the 1st Armored Division's new 7th Infantry Division. The first dirigios are similar in shape to the 811-inch twin. One of the new dirigibles is called the 740, but the two versions are far more similar. All three dirigios, as well as an Ellington-based one built by Boeing, are also named for the 740 and its twin design that is still in development.

The 5th Corps will build the two D.E.A.s as part of a $1.5 billion
