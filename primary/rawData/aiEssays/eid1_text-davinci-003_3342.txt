Dear Editor,

It is now indisputable that computers have altered the lives of almost everyone in todayâ€™s world in one way or another. Unfortunately, while there are many benefits to owning and using computers, there are also potential negative effects that must not be overlooked. 

For instance, the extensive use of computers has created a variety of health problems. People tend to stay in one position for long hours while operating a computer, leading to neck and back pain and eye strain. Additionally, these individuals can suffer from obesity as a result of a lack of exercise.

Another aspect of computers posing a potential hazard to users is cybercrime. Unscrupulous individuals can access personal information from computers, whether it be financial or simply just personal. In some cases, computer viruses are installed by hackers in order to gain access to sensitive data.

With regards to children, there is evidence that frequent time spent playing games and browsing the Internet can have an adverse effect on their development. Studies have also shown that there can be an increase in cyberbullying, which can lead to low self-esteem and depression.

In conclusion, it is important to acknowledge the potential harm that computers can present if not used responsibly
