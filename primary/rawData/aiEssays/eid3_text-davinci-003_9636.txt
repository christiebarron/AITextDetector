In Joe Kurmaski's story "Rough Road Ahead," the features of the setting significantly affect the cyclist. Despite the cyclist's self-discovery journey, the environment determines the physical and psychological challenges he encounters.

The cyclist travels through a harsh and unforgiving landscape. With only a few stops in between, the cyclist must endure both rough, rocky terrain and winding, uphill climbs. Without many points of respite, the cyclist must remain focused in order to survive the treacherous journey. When the cyclist must stop, he is met with strong winds and heavy rain that batter him unrelentingly. The hazardous conditions force the cyclist to confront his innermost fears and self-doubts. 

The isolated nature of the setting also plays an important role in how the cyclist deals with his struggles. Without the distractions of modern technology, the cyclist must rely solely on his own internal strength to push forward. He has to draw on his determination, courage, and resilience, or risk being overwhelmed by despair. Even when he does find temporary refuge, such as when he scratches animals or listens to the song of the birds in the nearby trees, it serves as a reminder of the 'long and rocky road' ahead.
