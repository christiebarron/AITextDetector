I'll never forget the moment I shared a laugh with my boyfriend for the first time. It was a beautiful summer day and we were enjoying a picnic together in the park near our apartment. We were both sipping from our mugs of tea when he made a silly face and burst out laughing. I couldn't help but start to crack up too — his laughter was so contagious — and soon we both had tears of joy rolling down our cheeks.

It felt like a real moment of connection between us. I knew from that moment on that we would be able to share a lot more laughter together. It was amazing to feel so connected to someone through something as simple as funny faces and laughter. It was so powerful and special that I'll never forget it.
