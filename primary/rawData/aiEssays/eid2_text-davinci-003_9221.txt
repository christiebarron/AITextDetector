Censorship in libraries has been a topic of heated debate in recent years. Proponents of censorship argue that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from library shelves if they are found to be offensive or contain inappropriate content. On the other hand, those against censorship argue that such a restriction of materials limits freedom of speech and access to information.

I am writing to argue in favor of censorship in libraries, as certain materials can be both offensive and harmful, especially in regards to vulnerable members of society, such as children. It is important to consider that libraries are spaces open to all, and allowing certain materials that portray behaviour or language that would be considered unacceptable in ‘real life’ can be damaging. For instance, some books can contain certain language that perpetuates racial stereotypes and normativity, which can be distressing and offensive to readers. Providing an opportunity to remove such materials can help protect both children and adults alike.

Moreover, censorship of materials in libraries is an acceptable form of restriction when done with responsible processes and considerations. Censorship should be carried out with careful consideration given to the standards and values of the library, and all decisions should be unbiased and objective. Libraries should assess the context of each material and take into account the audience the materials may appeal to, to ensure appropriate and responsible decisions are made. Libraries should have clear guidelines and policies that provide information on the expected criteria when assessing materials.
