The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' was one of optimism and optimism in comparison to the usual pessimism. It was a case of a very different place from what we were used to in a very conservative or conservative society.

"We'd come from a young age and I was a socialist, I was a vegetarian, I was a Jew and I was a woman from a very religious family. It wasn't because I wasn't a good person. It was because you had to keep a low profile of yourself, because the media didn't really focus on all our issues, which was not really what I had done. We'd be all kind of shy, quiet and all of a sudden these things began to spread, like this is going to happen in America and the entire world right now and that's why they said 'Well there may be something to it.' But what you need, as an individual from a very conservative background with the same values and beliefs and values as Hitler, is a different outlook."

One of the greatest achievements of the Nazi regime was the development of a political party based on the slogan'rebel.' Although it wasn't widely considered to be the leader of the party, the party's leader would get along with fellow party members. One of the members of the party had to admit that the party didn't have any ideology of its own. It was a social party which, in effect, preached the Nazi position and ideology.
