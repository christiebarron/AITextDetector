I remember a time when I had to be extremely patient. I was in a long line at the grocery store. It was the weekend before Thanksgiving and it was extremely busy. I was in line for an hour before it was finally my turn to be checked out. During the wait, I was starting to lose my patience and get frustrated.

That's when the person in front of me turned around and gave me a kind smile. She said, “It's ok. We will all get through this.” Her words of encouragement helped me to remember to be patient. Even though I was still annoyed with how long the line was taking, I was able to take a deep breath and remain calm. Her act of kindness and understanding was enough to make me feel better. 

Eventually, I was able to check out and was thankful to the woman who reminded me to remain patient. It was a small gesture, but it truly made a big difference in how I perceived the situation.
