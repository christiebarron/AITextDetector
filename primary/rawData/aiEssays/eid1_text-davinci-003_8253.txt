The Empire State Building was a marvel of engineering when it was completed in 1931, and one of its most incredible feats was the ability to accept dirigibles to dock at its upper spire, giving travelers the opportunity to arrive atop the 102-story building. Despite the difficulties involved in building and running the docking site, the Empire State Building's designers and builders were able to achieve this feat, albeit with a few obstacles along the way.

The idea of a building docking site for dirigibles was an incredibly complex one, as the focus on proper placement of the mooring mast was paramount. The mooring mast needed to be tall enough to accommodate the dirigibles, as well as structurally sound in order to withstand the tremendous force from their engines. The mast also had to be placed far away from any danger, such a large steam engines and open-air electrical equipment. The designers of the Empire State Building were unable to fit the mooring mast onto the building’s main lobby, and were instead forced to find room on top of the building’s 85th floor.

The engineers faced other challenges as well, mainly dealing with the actual construction of the mooring mast. The deep foundations underneath the building were a major concern, as any structural failure would cause the entire mast to fail. In addition, the fact that the mast was built on top of the building made it more difficult for the engineers to monitor any changes in
