The Empire State Building, erected in Manhattan, New York City in 1931, was designed with the intention of docking dirigibles. However, the architects faced a series of obstacles in allowing dirigibles to securely dock at the top. The biggest obstacle they faced was how to utilize the mooring mast, designed by aeronautical industry expert, Dr. Hugo E. Eckener, in order to safely dock the massive airships.

The biggest hurdle to overcome was the engineering of a mooring mast suitable to dock a large dirigible. Dr. Eckener proposed the idea that the Empire State Building use a mooring mast on the roof, or "spar deck". However, there were numerous challenges to overcome in order to make the mooring mast safe. The mast had to be light-weight, so as not to add additional weight to the already heavy Empire State Building. Yet it had to be strong and durable enough to support the entire weight of the dirigible. The engineers had to determine the appropriate height and diameter of the mast, as well as make sure the mast was properly secured to the building.

The engineers also had to consider a number of other factors. For instance, the mooring mast had to be flexible, since the dirigibles themselves were not rigid structures. It also had to be aerodynamic enough to not create drag that would slow down the dirigible or cause turbulence when docking. Additionally, the moor
