I remember a time a few years ago when I was in college. I had struggled with a difficult class all semester and was quickly running out of time to pass. My professor had been very helpful throughout the semester, but I was still having a hard time grasping the material. As the weeks passed by, I started to worry and felt my stress levels rising.

One afternoon, I stopped by my professorâ€™s office and asked for extra help. She had volunteered to stay after hours to help her students, and I was grateful. However, when I arrived, I found that several other students had the same idea. It quickly became apparent that she would have to help everyone before she could get around to me. 

I knew I could not leave without help, so I decided to stay. The professor was patient and kind with everyone, even though it was clear that she was getting tired and frustrated. Eventually, it was my turn and she gave me the attention and advice I needed. I was so grateful for her patience and willingness to help. Without it, I would not have been able to pass the class.
