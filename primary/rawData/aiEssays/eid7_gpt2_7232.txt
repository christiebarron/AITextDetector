An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when an elderly man in stricken white hospital gown was able to leave and walk away. It was an odd situation as a nurse often had the man down at the hospital and so I was very grateful he managed to help me. This is a common story from patients, a common one but so many of these stories and tragedies get people through what we try to do. When we give people in hospital the opportunity to get care – whether it's a diagnosis for spinal stenosis or a physical disability or a personal injury or simply any of their medical needs – we encourage them to go and speak to a GP who will get them help. So while a nurse says 'I didn't have a diagnosis, just wanted to help you,' a patient walks away without a diagnosis. But as we all know this happens, with a diagnosis in an emergency hospital, there are times there can be so-called 'disorder' hospitals such as this one on the far east African continent of the South African Republic.


This is because these hospitals are often underfunded or not staffed or poorly staffed and can sometimes have one doctor for every 50 patients. While we can do more, this is where people who were in this situation really wanted to help.

The problem may be that these hospitals do not even deal with many types of people in hospitals. But it becomes clear that these need to be cared for and that this is a very important issue as
