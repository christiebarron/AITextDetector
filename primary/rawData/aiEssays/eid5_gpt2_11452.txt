The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' had been very uncharacteristic of the book in so far as it covered the subject of sexual abuse.

"The book has been an honour and also an honourable endeavour because it touches so many important issues and my book has made it an honour," she said.

She had seen the book presented as a study in public policy, though, and in response it went ahead. It described the 'troubled sexual relationships of sex victims who felt that their stories had not been sufficiently addressed" and said: "Sexual violence against women, especially the most vulnerable in this country, requires new methods of addressing it and we must recognise that we have the option to do this without having an open and open government and we must now move forward through research and action."

But the memoir did not mention the case of the former British military doctor Sir Andrew Gower and of the way he was convicted of sexual abuse after he was jailed for five years. The book's author defended Gower against those charges, saying, "He [Lord Gower] is a man of many years who took many wrongs by lying in his own bed on many occasions, and made those others look guilty."
