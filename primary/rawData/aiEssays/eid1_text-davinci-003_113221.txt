Dear Editor,

In recent years, computers have become increasingly intertwined with our daily lives. They are now used almost universally across all professions to increase efficiency, connectivity, and data storage. However, while they have their advantages, the effects computers have on people are not all positive and should give us cause for concern. 

One of the main issues with computers is their addictive nature. Many users spend countless hours plugging away on their screens, often without proper breaks to rest and recuperate. This not only leads to mental health issues such as depression and anxiety, but can also lead to physical problems, such as eye strain, neck pain, and carpal tunnel syndrome. Additionally, computers can be a major distraction, taking away from time that could be spent on physical exercise or interacting with friends and family.

We should all be aware of the potentially harmful effects computers can have on our lives. To combat this, it is important that we make sure to take regular breaks from our screens, ensuring we take the time to properly unplug and enjoy the world around us.

Thank you for your time,
