I used to work in a customer service role for a major company. It was my responsibility to respond to customer emails to assist with any queries or complaints they might have. 

One particular contact really stood out to me as a particularly extraordinary example of patience. 

The customer had emailed with an unexpectedly complicated query. I felt bewildered and confused as to the answer. I was aware that time was of the essence so I felt a little discouraged, but still determined.

I looked for the answer, but I couldn't find it. I took a deep breath and gave myself the time needed to be sure of the answer I gave them. Eventually, through a lot of patience and research, I found the answer. I emailed him with a detailed response, carefully outlining how to resolve the query and included a few extra helpful bits of information.

The customer responded with utmost kindness. They praised my persistence and due diligence and thanked me for my patience and understanding. I felt incredibly proud to have been able to resolve the issue to his satisfaction. 

I learned a great deal from this experience. I now know that having patience often pays off. It may take more time and effort to really understand a problem and find the solution, but it's definitely worth it in the end.
