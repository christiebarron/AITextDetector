Computers have many effects on people. Not only am I able to control something, but I can control the people and their behaviour â€“ especially if I give the AI some control over me or my companions. The humans in the game also have a lot of control over the AI, so how would I control the others? I would try to control the AI at least. This is where it comes into play.

First of all, AI control is like, if you go into the game, there are a few random things that you can do to control your AI for example. What should they do? First and foremost, if the AI doesn't make an audible click to you, what does AI say? It just says, "Click to play". If your AI goes nuts then this will cause you to react in this way. So the real question is, do you control the AI like, "Right now click to save". Then try to say, "Click to start". It will show you in the game that AI can only click when you're in a certain area, so I can't control the AI like this. But I can tell the AI as you do this that they will click when you type these commands, so I can do that in the game.

I really hope we're not all using this to control the AI for no reason. The problem with it all, and the reason why everyone hates it, is we often play it in the same way.
