The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' by actor, activist and writer Lora Gavrilova is that the new world's most popular reality series, TEL, "is a farce and a failure" – in the end.

I read back to the interview by me the following day with a lot of incredulation. We've talked about the show several times before and still the same thing, but we've made the decision to leave TEL on because this is just one more episode of "I'll Leave you channels and channels that allow celebrities and other celebrities to take over and not watch any of those shows", what with all the "vox populi" and the lies and deceit and the lack of knowledge about life in America of celebrities, celebrities, etc. it turns out.

It has been a difficult decision to leave TEL after all those months, which it just couldn't manage. In fact, I was so grateful for that – I was really nervous about the show.

And then when you left, was it like you said, "I'll leave you channel and channels that allow celebrities and other celebrities to take over and not watch any of those shows? That's how you know you're going to have to work with that channel", "I hate to see you not at this moment, but because TEL gave me such great freedom I will leave you channels and channels that allow celebrities."
