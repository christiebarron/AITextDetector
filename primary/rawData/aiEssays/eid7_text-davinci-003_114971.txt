I vividly remember the day that I was preparing for a special job interview that I had been anxiously awaiting. I was nervous and uncertain about how it was going to go and had done everything possible to ensure I was as prepared as possible.

As I stepped onto the elevator and pressed the button for the tenth floor, my phone rang and immediately, I knew something was wrong. It was the interview administrator, telling me in a hurried voice that they had to reschedule my interview as one of the interviewers had to leave early due to an emergency.

I already had it all planned out, and I felt so disheartened since I had spent so much of my time and energy preparing for it that day. I could have been angry and frustrated, but I took a deep breath and told the administrator that I understood and that it was totally fine. I was patient and understanding in the face of this unexpected situation.

After that, I worked with the administrator to quickly reschedule my interview for the following day. I'm happy to say that I ended up getting the job and looking back I realize how important it was that I was patient in the face of an unexpected change.
