An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I gave an appointment to a doctor who was an ER doctor on a home visitation basis in California. Before coming to that clinic I had only been a nurse to about three years at that time, but I quickly realized that was a bit much. I had gone back to my usual place of work, was on a "personal leave" and had been off work since January of that year. I had asked my supervisors to stay up and keep to home, but the supervisors wouldn't let me in for an hour. I had a good night's sleep. About an hour into my shift, I found out the nurses that had been at my hospital would be gone for nearly an hour for an extra hour. The nurses told me they could not be there on time and the ER staff then asked if I would like the patient to have access to the patients. When I finally told the nurse that I were no longer working I was surprised. She quickly let me go and asked if I was able to leave because it was an emergency and that the day was on vacation and we had plans to get back in on time as soon as possible, even though I still could not make it to your home. I told the nurse if I were to let her go I would have to do the right thing. She told me that a nurse would wait until after you came in to go in because I would leave the hospital to have some time off.
