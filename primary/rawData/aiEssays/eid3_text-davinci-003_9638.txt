The setting of Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead" plays an important role in the story of the cyclist. The main character, a cyclist, is faced with a variety of physical and mental challenges on her journey along the winding, rocky terrain.

The rough road itself is a prominent feature in the piece. The cyclist must push her limits to make it over the difficult terrain, and the journey is quite daunting. The constant bumps, big rocks, and steep inclines add to the difficulty of the journey, serving to both physically and mentally challenge the cyclist.

The cold weather also plays an important role in the story. The cold weather leaves her wearing a hoody and a hat, and the wind chill from reaching the high mountain passes. Vivid descriptions of her freezing hands and cheeks paint a picture of the hard physical effects of the cold on her. Mentally, the cold works to heighten her sense of fatigue, making it more difficult to focus on pushing herself and completing the ride.

The setting of "Rough Road Ahead" also serves to mentally challenge the cyclist. With darkness setting in, her sense of uncertainty grows as she continues along her journey and navigates unfamiliar terrain. The cyclist must overcome her fear of the unknown and find the strength to continue.
