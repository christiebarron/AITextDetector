My friend and I had been out at the movies one night. We were laughing and talking the entire time, like two silly school girls with nothing better to do. After the movie finished we went out for dinner and soon found ourselves in a state of uncontrollable laughter. 

It all started when the waiter brought us our drinks. I attempted to take a sip of my soda to which my friend yelled "don't do it!" Thinking it was some kind of game, I quickly pulled my glass back and we ended up bursting out laughing. We couldn't stop for what seemed like forever, drawing glances from all the other diners. 

We then continued our conversation, occasionally breaking into fits of laughter that could be heard across the restaurant. Our evening only went downhill from there as our laughter was contagious and very soon everyone in the restaurant was joining in. While it was an embarrassment at first, it was also an amazing experience - one that we won't soon forget.
