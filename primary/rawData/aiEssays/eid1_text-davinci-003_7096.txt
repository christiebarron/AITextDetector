To The Editor,

Censorship is a subject of great debate. Many people believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from library shelves if they are found offensive. I believe that libraries should not censor the materials available for public consumption.

First of all, libraries should not be an arbiter of morality. What is seen as offensive to one person may not be seen as offensive to another. It should be left to the viewer or reader to decide if they would like to engage with the material or not. Libraries should not be policing what individuals can and cannot view or read.

Second, censorship goes against the core values of freedom of speech and expression as outlined in the American Constitution. People should be allowed to have access to any materials they choose, and the only way to do this is to not censor material. People should have the freedom to make decisions about what they will view or read. Libraries should not infringe upon the basic right of freedom of speech and expression.

Finally, censorship sets a dangerous precedent. If one type of material can be censored, then it sets a standard where other materials can be censored in the future. This means that eventually, libraries will not be able to provide a full range of materials for the public to consume. This would be a disservice to their patrons, as they would not have access to the full range of information they could potentially benefit from.

In conclusion
