The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because a reader has to deal with a subject that's so deeply woven into modern life today that there's no way to wrap it into a manageable one.

If the reader can't see just one possible explanation, then just say the other, and the reader should also know that the book is about to go off the screen forever and that it's also about to open on a whole new world.
