The construction of the Empire State Building was no small feat. One of the obstacles the builders faced was how to use the building’s height to create a place for dirigibles, lighter-than-air craft, to dock. The Mooring Mast, as it was aptly named, was built into the top of the Empire State Building to this end.

The first obstacle the builders faced was how to make the Empire State Building tall enough to support a mooring mast for a dirigible. The builders had to make sure the structure was tall enough to support the weight of the dirigible, as well as the constant wind it would face from a height. After many calculations, engineering designs, and expert testing, the Empire State Building ended up being 1,250 feet tall with the mooring mast included.

The next obstacle was how to physically construct the mast to give the dirigible a secure place to attach to. This was a challenge since the mast itself had to be 66 feet tall and attached to the upper section of the Empire State Building. Furthermore, the mast’s construction had to be strong enough to withstand the strain of the immense weight of the dirigible. The engineers had to come up with a design that included tension cables, thick steel beams, and strong ties to ensure a secure platform for the dirigible.

The third challenge was how to position the mooring mast to allow the dirigible to connect safely and securely
