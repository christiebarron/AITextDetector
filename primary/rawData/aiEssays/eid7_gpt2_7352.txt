An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my child.

And we are going to get through this one very well. We are going to get through it but I will tell you this – you can watch this entire episode on tape here – not by yourself, or the other participants do. It's part of our show at The Art of Watching.

I won't give away the exact numbers, but I would expect that the show goes through more than 200 episodes over the next 18 months. That should be enough to make up the difference between your current season or anything coming in later this season. But for now, let's just start. The truth is the show has done something that you may not have predicted for years. So in case I were wrong and I said things about myself and others I was just kidding about – well what might have caused this to happen? Well it does, if you will but I feel that now we know the real truth about it.
