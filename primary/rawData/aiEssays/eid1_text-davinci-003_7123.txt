In Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead," the cyclist is profoundly affected by the features of the setting. The cyclist is riding a narrow mountain path that is covered in jagged rocks and has hairpin curves. The environment is unforgiving and the cyclist must remain completely focused or risk disaster.

The cyclist must anticipate and then react quickly in order to survive. Because the road is so narrow and covered in razor-sharp rocks, the cyclist must carefully control their speed and avoid overcorrecting in order to make it through tight spots without injury. Even a simple shift in balance can cause a crash and put the cyclist in danger of suffering serious injury.

The cyclist must also pay careful attention to the road ahead and constantly be on the lookout for areas that can be difficult or dangerous for riding. This includes monitoring the edges of the road where loose soil can cause the wheels to slip, or obstacles in the road, such as fallen branches and overhanging branches.
