Dear Editor, 

I am writing in regard to censorship in libraries. The right to access to information is a requirement of an informed and open society, and libraries play an important role as free providers of information both in print and electronically. While I understand that materials that can be deemed offensive by some readers should still be made available, I suggest that the best practice is to provide information with appropriate warnings.

Censorship of materials in libraries is not only unacceptable, it is also unnecessary. Libraries must respect the rights of patrons to access a wide range of materials, regardless of how objectionable certain materials may be. It is also not feasible for libraries to monitor the reading habits of patrons or what materials are in circulation. In addition, by censoring certain materials, libraries can inadvertently influence what information is accessible.

Rather than outright censorship, library directors must ensure that patrons, especially minors, are aware of the content of certain materials. This can be achieved by providing appropriate warnings and placing sticker labels on the materials. Libraries can also provide better access to educational materials and produce events and programs to encourage a healthy view of communication and expression. 

Ultimately, censorship should be avoided in libraries so that patrons have access to a wide range of views and ideas. Granted, some materials can be deemed offensive by certain readers, but library directors must ensure that patrons are provided with the right to access to all types of information with appropriate warnings.

Sincerely,

[
