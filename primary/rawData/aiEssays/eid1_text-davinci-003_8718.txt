It was Friday night, and Steve and I had just finished dinner. We had been there for hours, chattering away about all the little things that had happened to us throughout the week. We laughed and re-told funny stories, our moods light and carefree. 

As we were getting ready to leave, Steve commented on how we hadn't had a good laugh in a while. That's all it took for us to break out into an infinite fit of giggles. We had just been talking about a particularly funny incident from our high school days, and soon enough we were laughing so hard that we were nearly in tears.

We couldn't stop! Even after we had finished recounting the anecdote, there seemed to be some kind of magical energy that kept us going. We had taken a few steps out of the restaurant, but it made no difference -- we just couldn't seem to stop.

It was the oddest yet most wonderful feeling at the same time. I felt as if all the worries and stress of the week had just melted away into nothing. We were able to connect on a deeper level in that moment, as if laughter itself had brought us closer together in a way that nothing else could. 

This was a moment I'll never forget, and one that changed our relationship for the better. Laughter, indeed, was the shortest distance between the two of us.
