Dear Editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have had on people. As technology continues to expand, the use of computers in our everyday lives has become increasingly pervasive. Many people rely on computers to complete a variety of tasks, from shopping to managing finances, and even communicating with family and friends.

On the one hand, computers have been beneficial to society in many ways. For instance, computers have allowed us to automate routine tasks, saving us time and effort. Additionally, access to the internet gives us instantaneous access to an abundance of information that can be used for educational and personal growth.

On the other hand, increased use of computers can lead to dependency. Too much time spent on the internet or playing video games, for example, can lead to physical and emotional health problems. Furthermore, computers have made it easier for people to be dishonest. As a result, our society is at risk for fraud and other crimes.

For these reasons, it’s important for us to use computers responsibly and to ensure that they are used for productive activities that contribute to our physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing. Let’s agree that computers can be great tools if used properly, but if put in the wrong hands, they can definitely have a negative impact on individuals and society. 

Sincerely,
