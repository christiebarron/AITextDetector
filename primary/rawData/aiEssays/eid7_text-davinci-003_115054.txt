I was on a beach with my family on vacation. Our day had gone just perfect up until then. We had planned to stay for the night, watch the sunset, and see the stars come out. But of course, that is when Murphy's law decided to kick in.

The wind was getting stronger and the waves started to get choppy. As the sun was setting, the sky turned a dark gray and it began to pour. Of course, we had forgotten our umbrellas and were instantly drenched. My younger brother started to cry about how he wanted to stay and watch the stars come out, but it was obvious that we wouldn't be able to do so.

Despite the circumstances though, my parents handled the situation with grace and patience. They put their arms around us and told us that it would be okay. We tried to enjoy what of the night that we could by going down the beach and looking at the crashing waves. We stayed until it was too dark and the rain had stopped, then we walked back to our hotel in the dark, soaking wet, but happy to have still made the best of the night.

My parents' patience on that night made all the difference. The weather was out of our control, but they remained level headed and made sure my brother and I were still able to enjoy the night in the best way that we could.
