From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the memoir by Narcisco Rodriguez, is one of the most memorable books about identity and culture in the 21st century. The powerful stories it tells of the Latinx experience and the ways in which home plays a pivotal role in our lives is both moving and inspirational. 

The mood of the memoir is reflective and nostalgic. Throughout his memoir, Rodriguez reflects on his childhood in New Jersey where he lived with his family and close friends who were all immigrants from Cuba. Through his experiences and memories, we are often drawn further into his life and gain insights into the complexity of his life and identity as a Cuban-American. 

Another important theme of the memoir is the importance of creativity and self-expression. Rodriguez is, first and foremost, a fashion designer, and the love for what he does is apparent in every page. This is reflected in the joyful yet also melancholic mood of the memoir which celebrates creative expression, while ultimately invoking a longing for a home that is long lost.

The overall sense that this memoir leaves on readers is one of admiration and reverence for the power of culture and storytelling, and the ability for us all to call somewhere home. It also teaches us that our home is deeply entwined with our sense of identity and the love of family and friends, and that even if that home is lost then it can still exert a strong influence in our lives. This message of hope and comfort is
