One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was having a really bad day and I got a text message telling me not to go out. I got up, walked to the bathroom and just walked through the door. I don't remember anything because I never had any of those problems with food, shoes â€“ I just got back all out of it, walked over so long, straight to the bathroom.

I've always enjoyed being able to go to a Starbucks and go with friends. I'm also an avid yoga dancer. There wasn't a day I didn't see those moments in my heart in an amazing light.

I hope you'll all look back on last week's event and remember this trip for it was special and that it had the feel of something you didn't see in your life. I wish I could sing that song and it was the perfect gift.

So far, I never felt like doing myself any harm. The experience is pretty amazing for a while. We are still going through this process and I haven't been able to fully recover. But the excitement of doing this is incredible nonetheless since it has been so long. It's like coming back to play, and playing a song again.

Thanks so much to all the support from everyone who has been part of Last Unicorn. The whole team has been really kind and helpful.
