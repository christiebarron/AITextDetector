The building of the Empire State Building in the 1930s marked an amazing achievement in technological advancement, but the builders’ ambition to provide a mooring mast for dirigibles proved a challenge. Dirigibles, or airships of the time, presented unique obstacles due to their size and varying wind conditions. As described in Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s article “The Mooring Mast”, the builders of the Empire State Building had to account for both the weight and the height that the mooring mast would need to be, as well as the vulnerability of the airships to wind and weather.

For the mooring mast to accommodate the length of the largest dirigibles – up to 800 feet – it would have to reach a total height of at least 1,250 feet. Not only would this height add considerable cost to the project, it would also create a need for substantial engineering ingenuity. The mast had to be tall enough to accommodate the dirigibles in calm air, but it also had to stay stable in windy conditions. This proved to be a great challenge for the engineers, who used special mathematical formulas to work out the forces that their mooring mast would have to withstood.

Still, the sheer weight of the airships further complicated the problem. The Empire State Building’s mooring mast had to be built to hold up against both the weight of the ship and the tension of
