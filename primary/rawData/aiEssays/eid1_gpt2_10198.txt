Computers have many effects on people. One of the biggest was a decrease in family sizes in the family that may mean the parents are no longer in the workforce.

Another one took a significant bite out of their pension costs while also allowing their child to continue work in a non-union way.

"The results are the same for working parents. They get to pay the same living wage as working parents who have children," said Dr. Bynar.

These results show that the parents who have family obligations and living expenses for their child can still make more money in the short term, whereas the people who are not in the workforce will.

Some of the effects of the impact of the family are already being felt. In January, the National Bureau of Economic Research reported that households in New Zealand were no longer making as much as they should to keep up with rising costs.

"It was an incredible amount of the economy that was destroyed, and that was not reflected in some of the people being pushed out of the workforce, it was reflected in other factors, and those were very important factors," said Dr. Bynar.

There are also large national and international effects. Dr. Bynar said children coming from poor families in Africa may be given an easier path to their successful careers by being able to join jobs without paying to have a father.

New Zealand was well known as a place where working families can find equal opportunities regardless
