An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was 16 and I was working hard at an art gallery. You just saw this great, stunning, great work on white paper all day and you just wanted to do it. It was my way of dealing with depression too. By the time I finished, I was on my way at 19 because my wife's suicide didn't go unnoticed.

He and I were discussing depression, and I said, well, you can't do it like this, right?

Yeah, well. I was very upset about it. I was very, sad, confused, I just thought I heard something or somebody say something interesting about it. And then I just came home crying.

At that point, I knew I was gonna die, you know? And I had to do the last thing I could to get to a job. I didn't know how I planned on doing it, but that's what it had to be: if I could find someplace where I could write something and I could just be out there, I would.

So I called my girlfriend and told her what I was feeling and she told me I was dying, she told me and said, you won't be able to continue playing any more video games. So I just sat there and criedâ€”it was too much. But we did play a few games in the meantime and I'm happy that I played them and can still play
