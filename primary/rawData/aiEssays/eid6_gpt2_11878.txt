The second obstacle was the high ceilings, one of the biggest complaints of the builders. The final obstacle was not so much elevators and elevators, but that they would be too narrow to allow people to step onto them. That was when they decided to use a ladder to make the stairs.

The building did not go out till 1967, when they closed. By then, the height of the building, which stood eight stories, was two stories and one hundred feet.
