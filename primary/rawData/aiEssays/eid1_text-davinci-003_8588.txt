I recently volunteered to help out at a local senior center. One day, we were having a bingo game and I was in charge of calling out the numbers. It was going well, but as I got further into the game I noticed that an elderly man was getting increasingly agitated at his lack of luck.

At first, I was starting to get frustrated. I wanted to call out the next number quickly and move on. But then I remembered that the elderly man probably had a lot of tensions built up inside, and I changed my approach.

Instead of going on as quickly as I could, I decided to be patient. I slowed down my pace and put more emphasis on the numbers so that the elderly man could hear them better. I also smiled and made regular eye contact with him when I spoke so he could feel more comfortable.

The patience I showed by slowing down was rewarded. By the end of the game, the man was smiling and thanked me for my time. It was rewarding to see how patient care and understanding can really help people relax and enjoy themselves better.
