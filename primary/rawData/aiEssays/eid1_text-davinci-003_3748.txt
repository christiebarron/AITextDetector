As technology continues to shape the way the world works, computers are becoming a fixture in our daily lives. The ubiquity of technology has made computers an integral part of many people’s lives. However, I believe that the more people rely on computers, the more isolated and disconnected they can become from the world around them.

When people start to think of computers as their primary source of information and entertainment, they risk becoming out of touch with their own ideas and other people’s perspectives. By relying too heavily on computers, people lose the rich interaction that comes with talking and connecting with other people, as well as the chance to explore unbiased sources of information. In this way, computers can increase the lack of empathy and understanding in our society. 

Furthermore, computers can be detrimental to our mental and physical health. Studies have suggested that our use of tech gadgets can interfere with our sleep, in turn having a negative effect on productivity and creativity. Other studies have linked too much computer use with physical fatigue, headaches, stress and eye strain. 

I believe that people should be able to enjoy the convenience of computers while maintaining a balance between tech use and interacting with the physical world. By reducing excessive computer use and stepping away from constantly having our eyes glued to a screen, we can help reduce emotional and physical strains. 

We should open our eyes to the potential pitfalls of too much computer use. By
