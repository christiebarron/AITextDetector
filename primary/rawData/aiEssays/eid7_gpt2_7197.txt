An example of a time someone in my life was patient was in my hospital - one day, you are a child, you do something interesting you have to do. You wake up in the morning and you know that you have one more week ahead of you. And that's what you did with your kids. So, you did what you wanted to do.

It is a pity that this will never happen, but I do not believe that if you take what you want. This generation has shown they can do whatever they want and as long as they keep this mindset, we know that, you can find a 💍💍.
