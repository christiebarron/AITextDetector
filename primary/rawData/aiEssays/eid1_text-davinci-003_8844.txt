I remember the moment I met my best friend like it was yesterday. It was during our freshman year in college and I was sitting in my dorm room scrolling through funny cat memes on Facebook. Suddenly, my door burst open and in stumbled an adorable, wild-eyed girl with neon hair and a hilarious shirt. 

We starting chatting and it was like we had already been friends for years! We just clicked from the very beginning. Before I knew it, we were laughing and carrying on like nothing else mattered. It felt like time had stopped and we were the only two people in the entire world. 

I'm so thankful for that moment because it was our laughter that brought us together and kept us bonded throughout all these years. We now know that no matter what happens, we only need to share a few laughs and everything will be alright!
