The ending of the poem ties the events of the poem to the cycle of life and renewal. The poem talks of how hard it is for a young immigrant student to adjust to the new culture and to do well in her studies. By ending with the thought of taking the test again in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return, the poem suggests that the speaker will be better prepared for the test when given the chance to start over. Through the ending, Minfong Ho is suggesting that with the change of the season comes a sense of renewal, and with it, a new beginning and a chance at success.
