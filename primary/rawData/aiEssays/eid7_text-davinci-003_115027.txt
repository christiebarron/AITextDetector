I was at my favorite cafe, waiting in line to order my coffee. I had waited a long time and it was very hot in the cafe. Ahead of me, there was an older man who was struggling to figure out what he wanted. He was confused and having trouble deciding between a latte and an espresso.

The barista seemed to be getting frustrated and was trying their best to keep their cool. I could tell they wanted to help the man as quickly as possible, however, it seemed like the man wanted to take his time. 

Rather than getting frustrated, I chose to be patient and understanding. I could see the barista was struggling to remain calm. I decided to step forward and help the man. I asked him a few questions which helped him decide what he wanted. 

Eventually, the barista was able to take his order. As he walked away, I noticed the barista thanking me, impressed with my patience and help. It was a small gesture, but it made me happy that I was able to stay calm in a situation that could have easily become heated.
