When the Empire State Building was commissioned in 1929, builders intended it to become the premier moored dirigible-docking station in the United States. Despite considerable financial investment, building the requisite infrastructure posed many technical and safety challenges. In Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s article “The Mooring Mast: When the Empire State Building was Built to Handle Airships,” several of these obstacles are discussed.

Architects had to develop a mooring mast capable of sustaining the weight of a moored airship. This presented a difficult engineering problem, as the mast needed to be both strong enough to withstand winds and flexible enough to prevent a crash in the event of takeoff or landing. Complying with newer Federal Aviation Administration rules often necessitated modifications to the mast. In addition, the building itself had to be reinforced to prevent damaging vibrations and prevent its foundations from sinking. Once these issues were overcome, the mast was jutted out of the north side of the tower and secured in place.

The Empire State Building moored mast also had to be properly illuminated. To accomplish this, one thousand watt lamps were constructed and affixed to the perimeter of the building. Although visible up to twenty miles away, the lamps had to be constantly adjusted and tested to ensure safe navigation of the airships. Furthermore, communication systems needed to be developed to transmit messages between the dirigible captains and the ground station operators.
