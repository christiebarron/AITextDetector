Everybody has heard of the phrase "patience is a virtue." Growing up, I never fully understood what it meant until one particular event in my life when I was forced to put it into practice.

As a high school student, I had always wanted to be part of the musical production crew that worked to put on our yearly performance. I was finally a junior in high school and I got accepted as a lights technician. But I soon realized just how difficult the job was going to be. I was put in charge of operating the light board and all the spotlights our school had to offer, and it was like stepping into a completely new world.

I felt overwhelmed at first by all the buttons and levers, and I could not figure out how any of it worked. It seemed like our director had forgotten to give me thorough instructions, and I was stuck trying to figure out how to get the lighting right. I was frustrated beyond belief, but I kept reminding myself to be patient.

I decided to focus on mastering one area of the lighting at a time. I practiced how to operate the lights and how to adjust the spotlights so that the mood for the stage was just right. By being patient and taking it one step at a time, I got much better at my job and was able to complete the production without any major issues. This experience taught me that patience is indeed a virtue, and if you take your time, you can achieve great things.
