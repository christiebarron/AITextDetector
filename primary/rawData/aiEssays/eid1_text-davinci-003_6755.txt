To The Editor: 

I write today to offer my opinion on the impact that computers have had on our world. As a society, we are increasingly dependent upon computers to interact, work, and entertain ourselves. These machines can have both positive and negative effects on our lives.

The advantages of computers can be seen daily. Computers have made our lives easier, more productive, and more enjoyable. We can communicate with people around the world, store and access almost any kind of information in seconds, and digitally entertain ourselves with movies, games, and other activities. Computers have also changed the way we work, allowing us to automate tasks and increase efficiency.

While there are many benefits to using computers, there are also some drawbacks. Too much time spent in front of a screen can cause eyestrain, headaches, and fatigue. In extreme cases, computer addiction can even take hold and reduce the userâ€™s ability to interact in a meaningful way with other people.

Overall, I believe that the advantages of computers far outweigh the disadvantages. That said, it is important for us as a society to recognize the potential pitfalls of technology and develop habits that promote healthy interactions with computers.

Sincerely,
