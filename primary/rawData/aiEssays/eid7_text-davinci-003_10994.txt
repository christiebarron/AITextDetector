It was a hot day in July and I was tasked with helping out a co-worker with a task that was complicated and new to her. She was unfamiliar with the process, and as the person who would teach her how to do it, I could tell she was frustrated and overwhelmed. While her frustration was understandable, our deadline was quickly approaching, and I needed her to complete the task in time.

I did my best to remain patient and focused. I could tell she was having a hard time grasping the concepts, so instead of rushing her, I eased her through the instructions and showed her how each operation worked. After her third attempt, she was able to complete the task.

I believe my patience gave her the confidence to try again and eventually succeed. I thanked her for her effort and congratulated her success. Despite the tight deadline, we ended up finishing the project in time. In the future, I know I'll need to remain just as patient if I ever run into another challenge with her or any other co-worker.
