The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' was that for many years, many young journalists from Western and Asian countries, had taken a similar turn with regards to the press. This trend continued as the two Koreas, at the time ruled by two presidents who supported and supported the two Koreas (Mongolia's Bismarck and Indonesia's Kachin), began to become more and more close-knit and this led to a growing number of national correspondences, which became known as "Koreans". According to the journalist Kato Kurz, the relationship between Western and Asia was a "triangle of trust, co-operation and mutual confidence" despite their differences.

However, the American, South Asian and Japanese-origin press was increasingly more vocal and even more aggressive against the government, and began to grow stronger as well. One report at a time in the Japanese media commented on news organizations, which they said were increasingly willing to allow news organizations that were sympathetic to the Japanese government to operate abroad, as well as in Japan. In addition, journalists were seen as having become close to the Japanese government in Asia and in the Middle East.

The American and Japanese media organizations, were often accused of being hostile to or even hostile to certain nationalist and anti-American political parties or ideologies and the Japanese government, because of their close relationship. These media organizations felt that the government and the government both sought to take advantage of the American citizenry.
