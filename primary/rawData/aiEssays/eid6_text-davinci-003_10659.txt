The task of enabling dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was one of the most difficult engineering feats undertaken in the early 20th century. From the very start, this project was beset by a number of obstacles.

The most significant challenge the engineers faced was the sheer height of the building. At the time, the concept of mooring a vessel to a place more than 1,500 feet above sea level was unheard of. This meant that ordinary mooring towers used in ports for ships simply wouldn't do; a more creative solution had to be developed.

The first thing engineers had to consider was how to keep the dirigibles steady and prevent them from drifting away from the dock, as the winds near the top of the Empire State Building were significantly stronger than at ground level. The engineers developed a plan for a pair of 80-foot-long steel arms which could be extended beyond the observatory and used to grab onto a dirigible. These arms were designed to be able to securely hold the massive airships without crushing them, even under the most vigorous winds.

The next obstacle was figuring out a way to safely get passengers down from the airship when it reached the observatory. With the vessel held in place by the steel arms, a suspended staircase was constructed to provide the necessary access. This staircase was designed to sway in the wind without breaking, allowing passengers to disembark even in the chilliest of winds.
