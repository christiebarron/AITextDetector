Once, I was waiting in a long line at the grocery store. The line seemed to be taking forever and just when it seemed like I was about to move up, someone would end up getting in line behind me. I felt my patience slipping, but I took a few deep breaths and reminded myself to be understanding and tolerant. 

It had been a long and tiring day, but I knew that getting frustrated wouldn’t help the situation. I tried to just focus on a task that didn’t involve waiting in line, like organizing my shopping list. As I waited, I even had an opportunity to strike up a conversation with the person in front of me. 

Finally, the line started to move faster. As I walked away with my groceries, I felt proud of myself for staying patient throughout the experience. It wasn't always easy, but I'm glad I was able to be understanding and tolerant of the situation.
