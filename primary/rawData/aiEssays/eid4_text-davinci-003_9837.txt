The speaker in Winter Hibiscus is a young student whose parents have just immigrated to the United States. The speaker is feeling overwhelmed by their new culture and language and is struggling with emotions of insecurity and anxiety. The student is planning to take a test in order to prove themself to their new community, but at the end of the poem the speaker comes to terms with the fact that they are not ready to take the test. By ending the poem with the thought that they will try again in the spring, it is a way for the student to look to the future with hope and to put off the intimidating test until they are ready and more comfortable in their newfound environment.
