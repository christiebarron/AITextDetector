The Empire State Building was world renowned for being the first building to be able to dock a dirigible, allowing it to moor and passengers to disembark on its roof. While it was a pioneering feat at the time, the builders of the structure faced a number of obstacles in making this ambition a reality.

One major obstacle was the construction of the mooring mast itself. Many builders were unsure of how to build the cable that would connect the gondola of the dirigible to the mast. As the mast was located 460 feet away from the main tower, and was over 500 feet tall, the strain the cable would have to withstand was immense. Innovative engineering and testing were needed to ensure that the mast could withstand the force a moored airship would create.

In addition to the engineering solution, the building committee needed to create a plan to ensure the safety of the public when large airships began arriving at the Empire State Building. Several of the early reports regarding dirigible travel warned of potential dangers posed by moored airships, and the Empire State Building needed to be prepared. As a result, they had to consider installing an intricate system of lights to signal the dirigiblesâ€™ movements to ensure the safety of those on the ground.

Finally, the builders of the Empire State Building needed to consider how they would maintain a dirigible once moored. A strict environmental system needed to be in place to keep the airshipfunctional, safe
