Dear Editor, 

I am writing to share my thoughts on the effects that computers have had on people in the modern age. After much reflection, I firmly believe that these machines have had a largely positive and beneficial effect on us.

First and foremost, computers have revolutionized how we access information. Thanks to the internet, we can access a wealth of knowledge and data in cluding news, research, and educational materials. The internet, in general, has opened up our eyes to the world and given us the opportunity to easily collaborate on larger-scale projects.

Moreover, computers have made our lives easier. They have automated much of the tedious, labor-intensive work that was once required to complete various tasks. Computers have also helped streamline communication. We can now easily send emails, transfer files, and even make video calls with just a few clicks of a button.

Computers have also opened up a wide range of opportunities. We can use them to enhance our skills and gain valuable experience. We can also use them to develop our own business ventures and create job opportunities for others.

Therefore, I believe that computers have largely made our lives better. We have gained access to an unprecedented amount of information and found innovative ways to use technology to further our success. 

I stand firmly behind this opinion and I hope the readers of this newspaper will do the same. 

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
