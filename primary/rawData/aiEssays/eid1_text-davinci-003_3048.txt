Dear [Name of editor],


As a longtime reader of your newspaper, I am writing to share my opinion on the effects computers have had on people. I strongly believe that computers have had a huge positive impact on society, from increased accessibility to educational resources to greater connection with faraway family and friends. 

The most evident example of the advantages of computers is the digital classroom, where students from anywhere around the world can access education, remain social, and develop important skills as part of a real-time virtual learning experience. For many, the ability to partake in lectures and seminars from the comfort of their own homes has made getting an education easier than ever before. 

The benefits of computers extend beyond academic learning, too. Families separated by long distances can stay in touch through video chat services, while online shops and other services have made it simpler than ever for people to access everyday goods. Computers also make it possible for people to find entertainment through streaming services and connect with likeminded people in online forums. 

At the end of the day, computers provide us with tonnes of convenience, giving us easier access to not only educational resources but also entertainment and communication. The world is becoming more connected than ever
