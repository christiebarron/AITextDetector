I was recently helping my best friend move into a new apartment. It was a long day, and there were a lot of changes to be made. She had been through a tough break up and was feeling pretty low. 

As we worked, I could tell she was getting overwhelmed. The apartment was full of boxes, piles of clothes, and furniture that needed to be put together. It was a bit chaotic. 

I knew I had to work patiently to help turn things around. I worked alongside her, helping her to slowly unpack, while reassuring her that things would get sorted out soon. We laughed and joked along the way, and I made sure to keep things lighthearted. 

At one point in the day, we were both exhausted but had accomplished a lot. She was so relieved to see all that we had achieved. She thanked me for being so patient and understanding and I was glad to see her spirits lifted. It was a long day - but it was completely worth it in the end.
