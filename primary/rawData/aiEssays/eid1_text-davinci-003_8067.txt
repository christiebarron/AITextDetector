The dream of dirigibles docking atop the Empire State Building was, perhaps, one of the most ambitious engineering projects of the 1930s. The very notion of allowing a large airship to dock at a skyscraper some 1,250 feet high was an engineering marvel, and one that presented many obstacles along the way. This essay will explore these obstacles as they are featured in Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s book The Mooring Mast, which details the plan to build a landing pad on the Empire State Building for dirigibles. 

One of the primary challenges facing the Empire State Building was the choice of materials to construct the landing pad. Because of the unique location and size of the skyscraper, it was required to build a landing mast of extraordinary strength and rigidity, yet still light and buoyant enough to keep the building itself stable. After careful research, the team settled on a composite of steel and aluminum for construction. The resulting mast, topped by the Empire State Building's iconic spire, weighed about 30 tons, with a fortitude strong enough to handle the stresses of airship landings. 

Of equal importance in constructing the mooring mast was the question of wind strength and turbulence. High-altitude winds can be extremely unpredictable, making landings difficult to accurately judge. Hence, the Empire State Building had to be equipped with a system of stabilizers and guiding elements to help track the airship and decrease the chances of
