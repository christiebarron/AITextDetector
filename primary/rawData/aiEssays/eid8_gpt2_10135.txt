One time I experienced laughter in my life was when it was during the first two episodes of True Blood. I had been involved in a bad fight with a girl. I cried and cried and cried and cried and cried, but I still held on to my friends, and all of a sudden I felt a huge sense of happiness. This experience only helped me to do this. I felt like the character in the show was my friend when he is my father. When you lose a family, things aren't easy, and after watching another family fall apart, it only gets harder. Some of the episodes had more people on it than others. So if you're like me, you're not going to have the same kind of feeling I had with True Blood, so these episodes with the right characters, with good friends and a good ending feel wonderful to watch.

My favorite food.

I remember one day I was on the set of the first season, there was a scene where I was standing off to the side with a pair of pants in front of me budging a couple of tables. I took those pants down and laid them out on that table. I was looking at the table and thinking, "Oh my god." The next thing I remember was my friend's face on hers, like she was going, "Oh my god, you looked so beautiful!"

Your character is named "Lazy Daddies" in an episode of True Blood.
