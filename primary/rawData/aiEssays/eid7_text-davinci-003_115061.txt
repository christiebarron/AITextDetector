I recently had to go to the dentist for the first time in a long time. To say I was feeling anxious and nervous is definitely an understatement. I was scared and feeling overwhelmed. 

Fortunately, my dentist was so patient with me. She told me it was okay to be scared and encouraged me to take deep breaths. She took time to explain everything to me in detail so I could understand the procedure better. She even gave me breaks in between and let me take my time.

Without her patience and kindness, I don't think I would have made it through the appointment. I'm so thankful for her and her willingness to go the extra mile.
