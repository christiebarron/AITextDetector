Computers have many effects on people. People think they are smarter than their brains because they're so focused on trying to get anything done. Most of your computer science research is done with computer programming. Sometimes you have to write software to put software grinning at you on a computer. Most of it gets you into trouble, and it's hard for you to prove how well the programming works. Most of your computer science research works by saying what to do if you want to get ideas faster: work faster. In the lab, you have this question. Do you think it's possible that all of the computer science experts would try to explain to you the mathematical problems they have in mind, or have they said to you, "Man, there's a simple way to find it." They can say, "Well, I've spent enough time that I'm convinced that all I need is a little bit of time to try."

Some people can make a big difference. There are a few things that people that can make a big difference in the field of computer science.

You can say, "I read a lot of computer research in my junior year. My grades aren't great. I'm trying to figure out how to solve some equations in a program that is designed for me. I want to learn a couple things at once." It becomes almost an obsession. For people who are trying to find out more about the workings of computers, you have to see what they're using.
