The Empire State Building was a marvel when it was built in 1931. Not only did it become an iconic landmark, but the architects also incorporated a unique feature into the design - the ability to accommodate dirigibles. However, the ambitious idea was not without a number of challenges, and the builders encountered several obstacles in their quest to allow the lighter-than-air ships to dock in midtown Manhattan. 

Perhaps the greatest challenge was the structural integrity of the building itself. The anticipation of dirigibles docking at a mooring mast atop the building meant that an extra layer of structural tension was required that the building was not originally designed to handle. Fortunately, the engineers were able to modify the design to bear the additional load safely. Another difficulty was the necessity of making the building tall enough to accommodate the larger sizes of the most prominent airships of the day. Luckily, the Empire State Building ended up towering above the rest of the skyline, more than suitable for a successful docking. 

Security also posed an issue, as installing and maintaining the necessary equipment to adequately monitor the movements of the airships was another unforeseen hitch. Tessa Trevivian, the author of “The Mooring Mast”, wrote that the engineers “added sophisticated communication and navigation devices” to the mooring mast, looking much like “an oversized antenna” with a “cranelike apparatus”. This crane was installed to help guide
