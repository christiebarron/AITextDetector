Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion about the effects of computers on people. We are living in an age where computers have become the main tool for almost all aspects of our lives, from work tasks to leisure activities.

While computers provide immense benefits, it is also undeniable that they have negative effects on people as well. For instance, due to the easy availability of computers, it is becoming increasingly common for people to while away their precious time on the Internet. This can lead to physical inactivity and a decrease in interpersonal communication, as many people are now substituting face-to-face meetings with conversations over the Internet.

Furthermore, computers can be a cause of addiction, especially with addictive computer games, and this has been linked to psychological problems such as depression. Additionally, more and more people are now using computers to create fake identities, carry out fraudulent activities and generally behave in a cyber-bullying manner.

It is therefore my opinion that while computers offer many advantages, people need to be mindful of the potential negative aspects of them as well. We must use computers with caution, so that they do not become a threat to our physical and mental well-being.

Sincerely,

[Name]
