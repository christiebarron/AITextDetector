It started as a normal day. Sitting at the table, my partner and I were enjoying some breakfast together. The conversation was pleasant, but nothing particularly interesting was being discussed. That was until I made a joke about one of us having a particularly large appetite.

My partner gave me a surprised look and then started to chuckle. Soon enough, we were both laughing uncontrollably at the joke. 

The moment felt incredibly special. The air around us seemed to lighten, and we connected in a way we hadn’t in some time. We joked around and the laughter kept coming. It was a moment I won’t soon forget. 

Restoring that connection of being able to share a joke and share a laugh brought us closer together in those few moments. It made us feel more connected than we had in months. 

Laughter certainly has the power to bring two people together and lift the mood of any situation. It was a reminder of why we were together in the first place and what a great relationship we had.
