I believe that censorship of materials in libraries may be counterproductive in limiting access to critical literature.

1.1. The primary objective of the present article is to provide a perspective on the limitations of censorship. The present study seeks to summarize how we might improve the impact of censorship in scholarly works. The goal of this study was to analyze the social media presence on the Internet to learn more about the effect of censorship on scholarly works.

The average quality of these works was excellent [7â€“14].

Results show that the percentage of articles being censored varied from 3.13% in 2000 to 4.11%. The proportion of articles in the same category, based on this measure or in the number of articles censored, increased from 50.17% from 2000 to 2006 to 91%, although the number of black and Hispanic authors decreased from 7.29% of 50 to 13.43%. Authors are expected to report increased usage of
