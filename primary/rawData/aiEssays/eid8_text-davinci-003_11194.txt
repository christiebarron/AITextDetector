I went on a blind date a few weeks ago and I have to say it was probably one of the best dates I have ever been on. 

The chemistry between us was undeniable, but I think what made our date really special was the amount of laughter we shared that night.

We both laughed uncontrollably throughout the whole evening, starting at the restaurant. We couldn’t stop making jokes and poking fun at each other, it felt like no matter what I said or did, he had an amusing comeback!

We decided to take a walk in the park after dinner and our conversation was effortless. We kept talking and laughing until it was dark and the stars had appeared in the sky.

Eventually we both said it had been such a great night and we had to end it with a hug. With that, we both started giggling uncontrollably and couldn’t let go!

That night was a perfect example of how laughter can bring two people together even more. In that moment, I felt incredibly close to him and it left a special memory that I won’t ever forget.
