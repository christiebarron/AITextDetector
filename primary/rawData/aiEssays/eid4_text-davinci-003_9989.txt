The author uses this ending to provide a sense of hope and optimism for the future. Through the metaphor of the hibiscus plant, the author suggests that if one perseveres and stays focused, they will eventually experience success. Additionally, the cycle of the seasons provides a sense of reassurance, in that difficult times don't last forever, and one can look forward to better days. The ending conveys a resilient attitude to life, suggesting that even when one experiences failure or disappointment, it should not be seen as the end, but rather as a temporary setback along a journey to success.
