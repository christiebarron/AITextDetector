One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my girlfriend said hello while I was doing chores. I didn't know what to know. I started laughing because I was not happy that I could not do anything about her. When I realized she was the cause of my anger that is in my mind after that moment I did not know what to do.

I tried to calm things down with her to understand how wrong she was and why she felt so bad. I did not know what else to say before the laughter died down. She stopped laughing. She never had anyone to talk to about this. I was just a little worried but the things I tried to try to express were always so good.

Once I left that last sentence away I did not really understand what was going on. I realized that I was not happy with this. I never told her what I felt or what I was doing. I don't even remember exactly what I did during my leave. I am just not sure because I don't know the details of what really happened because I have no idea if it was just me or what I felt.

It felt like we were lost. We were trying to think about each other and find a place to stay. I am sure it is hard to feel sorry for someone who was doing something so wrong but we have now broken through to our new happy destination.

I'm sorry to say that I will continue to have a great time at home.
