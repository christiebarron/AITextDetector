I believe that censorship of materials in libraries in general is a violation of the Fourth Amendment. I think that banning materials in libraries may allow the government to remove material from the Internet, at least under certain circumstances, and probably, under certain laws (I know about this) when it can be done over the phone or over the Internet."

Higgins also argued "that the government's need to ensure that these materials are kept safe and private is the essential justification for censorship. He and his co-authors argue that a reasonable public would believe that if a material were taken down in a manner that would, in fact, deter violent crime in some of the United States' most dangerous communities, it would have an adverse effect on law enforcement resources and ultimately hurt public safety in the United States."
