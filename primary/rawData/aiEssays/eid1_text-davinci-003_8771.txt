I was out for dinner with my family and my cousins last weekend. We were having a great time catching up and laughing at the stories from growing up. My little brother had just said something funny and we were all in stitches, when all of a sudden a man sitting at the next table started to join in our laughter. I froze, my laughter dying on my lips as I wondered why he was laughing with us. 

A few moments later, he approached our table and asked, "Do you mind if I join you guys?" He explained that he was dining alone and had found our conversations so captivating that he just couldn't help himself. We all quickly agreed and welcomed him to join us. 

The conversation then picked up again from where it had left off and we all couldn't help ourselves from laughing. We joked and talked until almost midnight and he ended up being a great addition to our group and shared in our laughter. 

It was really a sweet moment that reminded me how laughter can bring strangers together and create so much joy.
