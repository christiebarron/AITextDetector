I believe that censorship of materials in libraries can encourage people to take action to support and fight against censorship in their libraries by reporting, writing, sharing and, for one library owner, providing the source code for books, and encouraging the library to adopt a code of ethics and use it accordingly.

These actions may encourage individuals or organizations to take action to address censorship by others or to support individuals or organizations that support these actions by organizing workshops and meetings or mailing an online petition to the Chicago Department of State where the Chicago Policy Library and the Committee on Law Enforcement should be aware of the use of copyrighted material or to raise awareness about such uses.
