Minfong Ho ends Winter Hibiscus with this thought in order to emphasize the symbolic connection between the hibiscus flower and the narrator's inner struggle with their identity. The narrator has resolved to take the citizenship test in the spring, when the snow melts, and the geese return, serving as a reminder of the narrator's connection to their home country. The loss of the hibiscus in the winter also reinforces the idea that identity is something that cannot be taken away, as the hibiscus will eventually bloom again in the spring, despite the harsh winter conditions. By connecting the birth of the hibiscus flower with the narrator's ambition to take the citizenship test again, Minfong Ho emphasizes the narratorâ€™s resilience and determination to remain true to their heritage.
