Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects that computers have on people. With each passing day, the presence of computers in our lives is increasing, and this can be both positive and negative depending on the way these machines are used.

On a positive note, computers promote global connectivity by providing people with a platform to communicate with one another from virtually anywhere in the world. Furthermore, they enable us to remain productive by making everyday tasks easier. Additionally, computers can create a space for creative expression, giving individuals the opportunity to share their work with others.

On the other hand, computers are having an especially detrimental effect when it comes to the mental and physical health of many people. An increasing number of us are working on computers for long periods of time, leading to higher levels of fatigue and physical discomfort. Prolonged use can also reduce our ability to concentrate, as well as potentially robbing us of idea-generating moments of spontaneous inspiration.

I urge your readers to recognize and embrace the potential of computers while also taking into consideration the potential downsides of relying too heavily on these machines. Computers have the potential to do great things, but it is essential that we are mindful of how our relationship with them could be impacting our wellbeing.

Sincerely,

[Name]
