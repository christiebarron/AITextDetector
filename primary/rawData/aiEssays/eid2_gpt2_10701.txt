I believe that censorship of materials in libraries, in fact such censorship is prohibited, simply because, as the writer, as the publisher, as the journalist and, from this perspective, as the artist, it is a way that the public is taken into account (as opposed to simply because it is too intrusive).

In a word, I'm absolutely not doing this, because these things are really what the public wants. I've tried to make it clear that the very same kind of information and information (particularly what I say on Twitter and who I read) might have something to do with censorship in libraries or museums. Also, I hope that's not one of those things. It's just a question of what are the public's needs, and if we're going to have freedom of speech.

But do that. Do you support those other things that are available to the public in library books and film/video games? Also do you think that, under the current media censorship regime, you're going to see less and less video games being made these days. Is that okay?

That's OK.

Do you support such censorship as well?

We support it.

Now you're saying, "Yeah, yes, yes it is."

Yeah, we've been very clear that there's just not that many games being made nowâ€”to me, that's not fair. I think a lot of that stuff goes in the hands of gamers
