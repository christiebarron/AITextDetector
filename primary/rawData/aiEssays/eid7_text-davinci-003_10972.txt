I once attended a holiday celebration that was particularly crowded. It was hard to get around and it seemed like everyone was running around and talking loudly. I found myself in a situation where I had to wait in line for an hour just to get some food. At first, I was getting impatient and frustrated. I wanted to get my food and go, but I realized that getting angry would not make the line move faster. Instead of getting mad, I sighed and took a deep breath. By shifting my attitude, I was able to stay patient and enjoy the event. I ended up making small talk with the people in line and discovered that we had a lot in common. Eventually, I got my food and was able to enjoy my evening. Patience is not something that comes naturally for me, but in that moment, I learned the importance of staying patient.
