One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my wife and daughter were visiting our home, which took place on the roof of their home and it turned nasty. I had a great time, but did not get what I was expecting. I had to have the house recharged and get a room. I felt pretty angry. They were so desperate to make it work that I tried, like with all my friends in there, and was just so upset. However, I didn't get any money and got the house back and it was done.


The next time I came home my daughter gave me my wife's phone number, but no reply. I got through some mail and sent my phone to my mother, who didn't want to hear anything on her other calls. I called her back and they did not get the number. So a week later, my wife gave me her number again. I had to get my father in trouble for sending me the information on an unauthorized phone. He had said that they had a record of my number every day on phone (which I don't know anyone from who used it at night).

When I was finally able to make it, I was taken to the local bar by my family, and it was there I told myself I understood. So I did, but just with the wrong address. I called the police, but just to make sure it was my call and that they were coming to the right place at the right time.
