I remember one time when my aunt's dog went missing. I could see that my aunt was struggling with the emotional roller coaster of losing her beloved pet, but she kept her emotions in check and stayed hopeful that the pup would turn up. In addition to her patience with the situation, she was also incredibly patient with me and my fellow family members. We would check in on her, asking updates and trying to offer words of support. Instead of lashing out, she took deep breaths and responded calmly and kindly, no matter how annoying the questions were. After four long days, the pup thankfully returned home safe and sound. My aunt's patience throughout the entire process was truly inspiring.
