The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The need for space for multiple platforms gave way to a requirement that "a large number of cars" could be connected — most importantly, that "the cars would have to have enough powerdrops in the way that would allow the elevator snakes to push you into the platform," and so on. The answer was to make a separate set of vertical columns, each with 20 feet of powerline and 15 feet of track. There were also some other technical problems — they required more concrete, and required fewer columns and floors.

The final prototype was built at the time, and it's now officially known that the first units were completed in 1957, and that it was only one of more than 2,200. By now, the Empire State has long since been the world's largest public park. (Its only significant building — the Empire State Building — is still called the Empire State Building in London.)

In any case, what's left is a more accessible, high-speed rail system that's been tested all along Europe, and even the United States, where a system is a significant feature.

Why isn't it built in the USA?

Most people would have expected the Empire State at the time to be somewhere in the middle or middle of Europe — in Switzerland — but it didn't seem that way. The National Transportation Museum in Manhattan, in collaboration with the National University of Singapore
