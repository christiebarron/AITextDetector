I recently had an experience that tested my patience. I had invited a few of my neighbors over for dinner and was in the middle of preparing the meal. Everything was going smoothly until I realized that I had run out of salt. I was about to give in to my frustration and cancel my plans entirely, but then I remembered to take a deep breath and stay patient. 

So instead of letting my anger take control, I decided to walk to the store to buy more. It was a nice evening so I didn’t mind the extra errand. It didn’t take me too long to pick up what I needed and I was soon back in the kitchen to finish cooking. 

The meal was a success and everyone enjoyed it. Being patient had its rewards that evening and in the end, helped to ensure that the time with my neighbors was even more enjoyable.
