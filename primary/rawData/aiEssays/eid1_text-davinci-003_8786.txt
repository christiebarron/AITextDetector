I remember the moment I will never forget. 

It was a few years ago, when my best friend and I had decided to go to the beach for a few days to relax and have some quality time together. We had been friends for years and had grown up together, so when we arrived, we already knew that those couple days were sure to be filled with plenty of laughs.

The first day was sunny and bright, perfect for a day at the beach. We decided to grab a drink before heading off to the shore and it was while we were sipping our drinks that we started to look back at old memories. We soon found ourselves laughing about some of the silly things we had done when we were younger and before we knew it, we had everyone around us laughing.

It was in moments like that when I realized how important laughter was to our friendship. No matter how much time passed or what changes we went through, we could always rely on laughter to bring us back together. 

With that moment, I knew that laughter was the best bridge between two people. It was the connection that kept us going strong.
