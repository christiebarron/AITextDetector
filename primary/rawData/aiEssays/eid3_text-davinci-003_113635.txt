The physical environment of the story includes a road which is described as a winding, steep road that turns and twists, giving the cyclist a difficult goal to achieve. The terrain also affects the cyclist's progress and the speed of his ride since it is full of obstacles such as rocks, mud, loose dirt, and steep inclines.
