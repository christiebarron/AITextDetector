The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' has sparked a debate about their status in the gay community, their future and, possibly, their prospects in the public eye. At events over the past few years, some say an emotional backlash has been generated against critics, and some are using the book as an opportunity to distance themselves from their sexuality. Others believe their lives are in danger because gay groups are too entrenched in the LGBT community. What many people in the gay community need to do is reconsider their political beliefs and their relationship with the media.

The book is available for purchase from the online shop Gay Voices for Free. For more information, go to www.GayVoicesForFree.ca.

The author of the memoir, Sarah Schaffer, currently lives in South Carolina with her husband and their three children, while her husband is a student from the University of Georgia. Her first book, The Heartbreak, was written as a result of her experience of being forced to confront the impact of LGBT people on a campus. The new biography follows her up as she tries to move forward with her work as a writer, activist and former media executive.
