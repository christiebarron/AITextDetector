In Joe Kurmaski’s short story “Rough Road Ahead”, the setting plays an important role in determining the fate of the cyclist, creating an inciting incident for the protagonist and further cementing the theme of struggle against a difficult landscape.

For starters, the setting of this story is a small mountain road—a terrain largely uncongenial to the cyclist. The difficult terrain is made clear by the fact that the cyclist expends great effort simply to move up the road: “[he] pushed hard, getting a few more yards of the upslope behind [him]”. The cyclist’s difficulty on the road underscores how treacherous it truly is, emphasizing the feat of simply completing the journey.

In addition, the fact that this mountain road is isolated, surrounded by a thick forest, contributes to the cyclist’s struggle. With nowhere to turn for help—and a deep sense of fear when a storm approaches—the cyclist must rely on his inner strength to persevere and complete his jouney. The isolation of the cyclist serves to remind us that he must be self-reliant in order to survive.

The combination of a demanding, mountainous terrain and a secluded environment help paint a portrait of a man struggling to survive; they create space for a story of challenge and ultimately of victory over adversity as the cyclist faces the rough road ahead of him.
