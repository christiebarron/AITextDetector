To the Editor: 

Technology, and computers in particular, have changed the world in many ways. Unfortunately, not all of these changes have been beneficial to society as a whole. I would like to share my opinion on the ways computers have been impacting people negatively.

First, as computers become more and more integrated into our lives, people are spending less time outdoors and interacting with friends and family in person. The convenience of social media and online gaming can easily replace face-to-face interactions, leading to people feeling more isolated and disconnected from the world around them.

Second, computer use can also encourage sedentary lifestyles. People can do everything from shopping to communicating on their couch or desk chair. This can lead to serious physical health issues such as obesity and heart disease.

Finally, computers can lead to cognitive changes as well. Constant exposure to fast-paced stimulation can lead to shorter attention spans and a feeling of being overwhelmed. People can become addicted to technology, losing sight of the importance of balance in their lives.

These problems can all be addressed by limiting the amount of time spent on computers and emphasizing outdoor activities, face-to-face interaction, and other stimulating and restful activities. I hope that readers will use this information to make decisions that prioritize a healthy lifestyle and thriving relationships over excessive computer usage.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
