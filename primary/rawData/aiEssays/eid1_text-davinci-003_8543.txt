One time I was having a really bad day. I had overslept, so I was running late for work and things were already off to a bad start. When I finally got to my job at the grocery store, I was met with a long line of impatient customers who were already frustrated. Despite this, I made sure to keep a calm and collected attitude, and managed to make each of my customers feel valued and heard. I was extra patient as I answered their questions and completed their orders, and several even thanked me for my patience with them. I was eventually able to leave and go home with a sense of accomplishment.
