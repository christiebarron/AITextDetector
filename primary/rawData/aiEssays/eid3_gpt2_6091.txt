Although the conditions are similar to those in Rotherham, the situation around Rotherham is very different to the rural communities around Heathrow and London.

We've put together a list of all places where people are closest to pollution hotspots. Some of these places may be considered by the LWA, so the cities to visit that may be more "well-known
