An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was in cancer remission, and after seeing my GP he was able to give me a blood test, and that worked out that I was cured. So it was a small wonder I had gone on an early stage because I've got my old blood working, but when the time comes when I'm trying to get into the field of medicine and start my practice I don't want to die at 60.

My friend was just on the verge of starting chemotherapy when I started taking her on. I was so shocked. I don't know what to do. That was the shock at first. I've got to learn to deal with things with this stage, the normal stages, and the pain and I've never really been one of those to ever get up in the morning or fall off something, and it was really challenging, actually, when I began to try to learn how to interact with people without putting the whole idea of 'You can do whatever you want to as long as you care for every person in the world, just like you never do in life' down. It was really hard for me.

"I took about three weeks off at that point. I'm doing three months a year on top of that, so I needed to do different things. I didn't have any idea that we were going to meet. I didn't know if I'd get through it and get on with my life."
