Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the current effects of computers on people. After almost five decades of computing, the implications of computer technology are both positive and negative for our lives.

From a positive perspective, computers have revolutionized the way we interact with each other. Communication has never been easier as the world wide web connects people from every corner of the world. Computers have also helped us become more productive and efficient in our work. They have enabled us to streamline operations and automate tasks that were once done by hand.

However, computers can also have adverse effects. The more time we spend in front of a computer or using our digital devices, the less time we spend with each other. In some cases, this disconnect can lead to isolation and depression. Additionally, computers have made us more dependent on technology which can also be detrimental to our development and knowledge.

Ultimately, computers are here to stay, and they offer us numerous benefits. That being said, it is also important to keep in mind that computers should be used in moderation. This way, we can remain connected to society and avoid the negative consequences that come with overuse of digital technology.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
