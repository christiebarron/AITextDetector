I believe that censorship of materials in libraries, especially in libraries of children's literature, can be a way of avoiding the negative impact on children who do not read the material of their own choice," she said. "[T]he need to preserve such materials makes them a vital source of material, but there is also an environment in which they are not safe. The removal of materials in public libraries may be a means of combating this, because children may fear being held by parents or guardians, and thus may find themselves without appropriate alternatives to reading any of their textbooks."

Schools, she stressed, have to maintain the "perception that everyone is welcome and that books are safe and we accept each other's opinions."
