One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I saw a woman in her 80s talking about my father using drugs, and I wanted to tell her, "This is so funny, you must have been so excited you were laughing at me!" At the time I'm sorry that my reaction left it to be the way it was. When I get older, we usually forget to laugh.

So I take exception to the fact that she's funny; even though I'm a huge fan of her, I'm surprised she thought I was joking about marijuana or drugs.

How did you meet your husband? Can you give a few pointers, perhaps?

My father, of course, used to live in Pennsylvania and then had two children living here. My father, in case you missed it, lived in New York. My dad just said, "I think I really appreciate that you have a place where you can have whatever he thinks he wants with you." The place where it's more clear that you're going to get better with age. My father would still argue that marijuana will make the difference.
