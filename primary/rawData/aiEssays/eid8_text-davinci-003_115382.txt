It was a sunny Saturday afternoon and my friend and I had decided to go to the local park. We brought a picnic and settled down on a picnic blanket in the shade of a large tree.

We had been chatting for a while when I started to tell her about a funny incident that had happened to me the other day. I couldn't help but laugh as I retold the story and before long the two of us were laughing together.

Just then, a bee flew past us and my friend jumped up in surprise. I started to laugh even harder and soon we were both doubled over in laughter, tears streaming down our faces.

We shared many happy moments together that day and I will never forget the laughter that filled the air. It truly was the shortest distance between us.
