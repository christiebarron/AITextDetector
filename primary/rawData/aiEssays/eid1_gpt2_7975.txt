Computers have many effects on people. Many say there are more people in the world that have one basic ability, that they know about every single thing, every single thing and have the ability to communicate all over the world. It makes you think that they have to be so sophisticated Dick Clark. We're going to create a world of people and information and there are a million different things to do in a world where all of these inventions from China, for instance, are happening all over the globe and all of the other big inventions are happening elsewhere in the galaxy, all over the world. Even though people don't use computers to think so much anymore, they're still using them as a way to communicate.

What happens when you get to the point where they start to talk or you start talking or you start talking and you're just so focused on things you're starting to listen or you're listening or you're listening and then suddenly you're listening to the person with this wonderful computer and a computer with other things that were never there but are now. You're not listening or just waiting to hear what they say. Or you don't have an open mind that's not listening at all. It's like someone who's watching a movie, they know that you're going to read this on Tuesday night. So they come down to you and they read it on Tuesday night and try to think logically after watching it on Tuesday night as if you thought that you were going to read it.
