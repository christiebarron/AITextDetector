It did not really matter that the Empire State Building had a huge fire pit, as long as people were not inside during the time of fire. There were no laws on burning any buildings, the only problem was that the engineers who designed everything in New York knew nothing about building methods.

"My first idea was that if your building gets to that place you are going to get burned. Of course, that's not what we tried, we tried different buildings with different levels of fire and everything turned out fine. And then there was one time during the entire building construction where we had it on a tree branch and it was cut down to an average height of only 24 feet where we had to re-build it to do the same thing we would have to do on a new level on a different structure".

The buildings were so large it was almost impossible to create a solid and solid foundation. Therefore, it was hard to control the type of building and how it was going to perform. Buildings, even if well built, could fall down. There were no solid foundations on the New York City skyline. Instead, the buildings were extremely fast and very flexible.

All the buildings in New York City in 1950 were in an advanced stage of construction. There were no concrete foundations. However, there were a number of buildings in development at that time that were in the process of construction and there
