The construction of the Empire State Building posed many challenges for the engineers planning to allow dirigibles to dock on the building's mast. The idea of creating an air dock on the skyscraper first appeared in the architectural plans for the building dating back to 1930, and for years the idea of having a floating dock above the thicket of tall buildings was a tantalizing prospect.

However, the practicality of the project was another matter entirely. Dirigibles proved tricky to dock due to their immense size and tendency to get caught in unexpectedly strong winds. As a result, visionary builders were tasked with the challenge of ensuring the Empire State Building’s mooring mast would accommodate dirigibles without risking disaster.

The first challenge the builders faced was to create a lightweight structure that would not be too heavy for dirigibles to land on. To achieve this, Gregory Aurie, a naval architect, suggested a mesh-covered honeycomb structure that would be lightweight yet strong. This honeycomb construction was tested and eventually employed in the Empire State Building’s rooftop dock.

The next challenge was to safely moor the dirigibles. To do this, the builders of the skyscraper used a powerful winch system, capable of gently bringing hundreds of tons of metal into its mooring mast. Additionally, the mast was outfitted with specially designed berthing arms that curved at the end to allow the dirigibles to slow down and maneuver softly
