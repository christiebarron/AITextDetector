An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a girl with a severe depressive disorder with OCD so the next time I go for a physical appointment I ask to see a doctor and a therapist. They will take my notes. No one ever asked for a mental health specialist because I am on medication.

I have made a few friends who have a lot of other things going on with me just in case I make them have a mental health appointment so my therapist will see.

I love to share my life experiences with men who are dealing with depression. Men who have depression through social media. Men with eating disorders. Guys who are having issues with alcohol abuse. Boys who are having issues with drugs. Guys who are struggling with mental health issues. Depression is not a medical condition. It's a disorder of the nervous system. It affects everything you do.

I'd like to tell my clients a few things:

If you're coming into my office to talk to a real man or woman about it. I'm not saying stop talking, just talk to the man you want to talk to.
