The mood created in the memoir ‘From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives’ by Narciso Rodriguez is one of nostalgia and reflection. The memoir does not shirk away from the hardships Rodriguez has experienced, but instead shows a strength in being able to reflect and move forward. In doing so, Rodriguez creates a unique sense of hope amidst his struggles.

Throughout the narrative, Rodriguez often pauses to reminisce about his past, which allows the reader to connect more deeply with his experiences. He often describes his childhood home in a vivid and evocative way that paints an image of nostalgia. For instance, Rodriguez mentions ‘the stairs creaking under the weight of our shared memory’, and ‘the smell of Cuban coffee in the morning… wafting through the window’. It is these descriptions that make the memoir so engaging and create an emotion of wistful longing.

However, Rodriguez ultimately frames these reminiscences in a positive light and uses them to reflect on how strong his family is. The memoir pays testament to the power of family and unity, and we see this most strongly in the memories of Rodriguez’ mother and her unwavering strength. The memoir conveys a sense of resolve in the face of all Rodriguez has experienced, and a determination to carry on. The overall effect of this is a mood of hope as we follow Rodriguez’ journey of resilience and self-discovery.
