The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock, a lofty undertaking for a structure that had yet to be constructed in 1931. The primary challenge was designing the massive structure to accommodate a docking mechanism that would enable large airships, such as the Hindenburg, to attach securely and efficiently to its side.

The most pressing technical issue was solving the inherent instability of the dirigibles when fully fueled, making them difficult to maneuver and cumbersome to moor. To overcome this, the engineers designing the Empire State Building included a feature called the "mooring mast" at the top of the building, which allowed the airships to dock securely. This mast was made of steel and extended 200 feet in length, with a steel girdle at its base to ensure that the airship had a safe, strong point of attachment.

Another issue was the strong winds that often encircle a tall building, making it difficult to keep the airship in a safe stationary position. To address this, a series of guide wires, stretching from the mooring mast to the ground, were installed to ensure that the airship did not sway too far away. Additionally, a landing platform was constructed that could be used to station the ground crew while the airship was docking, and automatic elevators were installed to help the airship crew disembark as quickly and safely as possible.
