The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because if a man cannot find a good life in such a short space of time he will end up in war with himself. The books that help to bring this to completion. This last book will give up on hope for a future where humans, humans. This series would be wonderful if there were a better universe for the humans. There are only two people in the world that have the right to live there. These people are all trapped in this world where it is no longer worth fighting a war with another race. They are stuck, unable to move. No matter what we do, there will be one last hope and nothing will ever change that. We can only hope that we do not end up fighting each other. There are many more books that I hope to read soon. I also hope the first one is a masterpiece. Thank you for reading here!
