I recently experienced first hand what it means to be patient. I treated a woman who had been waiting to see me for about an hour and a half. Even though she arrived after her appointment time, she remained gracious and polite throughout her entire wait. She apologized for the delay and asked me politely if I could still see her. She was so understanding and patient that I never felt rushed when she was with me. She thanked me repeatedly for my help and even gave me an encouraging smile before she left my office. I admired her attitude and I appreciated how patient she was, even though she had a long wait.
