The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. A few bridges, such as the Imperial Bridge, were built along the waterfront to accommodate dirigibles rather than docking operations. This resulted in a lot of engineering headaches.

The designers also struggled to accommodate the increased cost of building a new city:

"It's a pretty amazing situation. We already have a whole lot over the edge," says Chris McNeill, co-founder of the Center for the History of the Imperial World, which helps to build the State Building.

"We're only 20 miles south of Boston," he says. "We can have a few other skyscrapers if we can keep it in our home. But the issue with the Empire State Building — and this is a city built on bedrock – is it doesn't fit our plans."

They started by building another 100 foot high tower. The same idea was applied to the Empire State Building, which the Empire State Commission agreed was too high, but that proposal was quickly rejected. This new building became the City of Boston, the first residential building in Boston. This means two skyscrapers will replace the Empire State Building, and it'll be smaller and simpler.

Boston is still an impressive city, but it's also got a slew of advantages. At the very top of a skyscraper (and for a brief period of time in the 1920s), there was a building boom by the
