In the early 1930s, the builders of the Empire State Building faced unique obstacles in allowing dirigibles, or lighter-than-air ships, to dock at the iconic skyscraper. The project had to be meticulously planned and the technological advances of the time had to be leveraged in order to make the idea of docking a dirigible at the top of the Empire State Building a reality.

The engineers who oversaw the construction of the Empire State Building had to device ways of constructing a strong, durable mast that could withstand the weight of a large dirigible. The mast had to reach 400 feet from the ground, which posed a unique design challenge. The concept of a mooring mast, or a protrusion from the side of the building that would enable the dirigible to secure itself, was novel and had not been attempted in a skyscraper before then.

The engineers had to design a mast that was aerodynamically sound and provided enough wind resistance to securely hold onto the dirigible's large and heavy frame. In order to accomplish this, they had to construct a feature that was incredibly strong and specialized, with metal reinforcement consisting of 25 story-braced braces and seven story-cantilevered trusses to ensure the mast would not break in the face of turbulence.

In addition to the challenges of designing and constructing a strong mast, the Empire State Building builders had to consider the practicality of safely and conveniently docking at the building. To
