The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is even more sinister.

Ms Macdonald, who also writes the memoirs In the Jungle and In the Jungle Out, says that her husband had recently fled the area of El Capitan, a historic village along the Mediterranean coast, where he believed he might be captured by pirates.

But when he had seen the pirates again, he saw and heard their cries and he started barking in anger.

Mr Macdonald told the British media: "'I was terrified but I was happy I was saved. That was the worst I'd experienced, that they shadowed me.' He was so upset, 'You've taken yourself into their hands and made my life miserable and now it looks as though they're going to kill me?' They were going to kill me, and he's now going to go on to kill all his family, everybody that he's ever met in his life.

"He knew they were out to do him. When he went to them, it was because he knew they had been coming, and he realised we weren't safe any longer.

'All over Europe there were so many people that were fleeing - from the East, from France to the north west - so I had to make a decision whether or not I had to leave, whether or not to come home'.

While in El Capitan, Miss Macdonald and her husband were taken by a ship into the sea.
