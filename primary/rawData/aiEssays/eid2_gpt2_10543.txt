I believe that censorship of materials in libraries, the media, the public schools and of political movements are necessary to ensure that there are still and adequate avenues for public discussion, the understanding that there is content among people, and the use of technology in a manner that is fair and responsible."

It should be clarified that this statement wasn't directed against the organization. The statement was made in response to silly remarks which were made about "dishonesty".

Danish Radio said it was aware of the situation, but took any allegations not linked to Diaspora seriously.

However, the Diaspora group had not come under any scrutiny, but rather a question about how it made those comments.

Last year, they were sued in Sweden over their use of language in their content; however, it was found that their language was no longer available and that Diaspora are not eligible for Swedish law on defamation.
