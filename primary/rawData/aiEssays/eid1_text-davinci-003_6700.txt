Dear Editors,

The advent of computers in the past few decades has changed the way many people live and work. As a result, computers have had far-reaching effects on human beings. 

On the positive side, computers have revolutionized the way people communicate, work, and access information. From email and instant messaging to the software and cloud technology used to create products and services, computers have become even more critical to our everyday lives. 

But computers can also have unintended negative consequences. Increased usage of computers can lead to physical problems such as carpal tunnel syndrome, neck and back pain, and eye strain. Moreover, hours spent in front of a computer can lead to psychological problems such as stress and anxiety, as well as cuts in sleep and social life. Even more alarmingly, for many people, computers can be addictive, leading to a host of negative consequences.

To limit the negative effects of computers, people must recognize the risks and take active steps to protect themselves. This includes regularly taking breaks from computers, creating ergonomic set-ups to reduce physical stress, and engaging in various forms of physical activity (such as yoga and walking) to reduce overall stress.

In conclusion, computers have had a great impact on our lives, both positive and negative. However, with adequate foresight and proper precautions, we can minimize the potential harm that increased computer usage can cause. 

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
