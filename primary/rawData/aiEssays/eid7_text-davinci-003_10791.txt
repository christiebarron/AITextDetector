I recently went on a trip with my family and some friends to a beach town. I was looking forward to having a great time, but I knew it wouldn’t be easy. We had to deal with many logistical issues that were outside of our control. With so many people trying to travel together, there were bound to be delays and frustrations. 

When the rental car we had reserved wasn’t available, we were all anxious. I took a deep breath and said calmly, “Let’s take care of this problem before it gets out of hand. We’ll get another car, so don’t worry.” I stayed calm and patient when everyone else was losing their patience and that made a huge difference.

We ended up finding a new rental car and off we went! Sure, we got to our destination a few hours later than originally planned, but the important thing is that we all got to the beach and had a great time. I’m proud of myself for staying patient when things were going wrong, and life was definitely made easier as a result.
