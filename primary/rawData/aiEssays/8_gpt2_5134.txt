One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I used to get really emotional and sad and I would cry after seeing someone do anything on TV and they were laughing at me. For me that kind of hurt didn't stand out.

Q: The best, most personal feeling? Being out of your office for a while.

A: I love it. It's something I love to think about every day. Especially when I'm at work, I'm so busy working. When I'm out and about, I just find myself thinking, "This is how my life feels right now and it really, really isn't." It's nothing you've ever experienced before, it just makes you feel much better but again, that feeling is what sets me apart and lets me find a new place to be that way.

Q: When did you start to fall into a "no" mood?

A: At the age of seven or eight, I was really into the world. And one day, after falling asleep at work, I woke up and it was all just me and my mom and my friends. I don't know how I got that big of a smile. I went out to dinner, got the last bit of pizza and then I thought, "I hope not." That was about it. But then it just got really crazy and I'm like, "How am I supposed to feel right now?" I'm still kind of in awe of everything
