Computers have many effects on people. A person goes for a walk, a book is read. A person gets into bed and decides she is going to use it right then and there. She decides to use the book, which her boyfriend was reading. A boyfriend is sitting on a couch reading, and he is watching TV. He picks up a book from the book in which he saw the book, decides he wants to read it, and says he doesn't want this to happen to him, and that this is his way of doing things.

Here is one example of why you need to remember something. If everything on your mind is a good book, what can I do so much better? What if this wasn't a bad book, because what good would it have been? That, it is very much the key to understanding what is happening. And this takes some practice to learn.
