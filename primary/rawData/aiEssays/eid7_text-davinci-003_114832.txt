I recently had an encounter with a difficult customer at my customer service job. The customer was adamant about wanting a refund yet they had only made the purchase the day before. I tried explaining this to the customer, but they refused to listen and kept speaking over me. Though I was becoming frustrated, I stayed calm and patient. I reminded myself that it was my job to stay professional and help the customer out as best as I could. 

So, I took the customer's details and asked them to patiently wait while I contacted the supplier to resolve the issue. After a few minutes, I was able to explain the company's return policy to the customer and the customer finally accepted it. Despite the customer's attitude, I remained calm and patient in order to make sure they were satisfied with the outcome. In the end, I am glad I was able to handle the situation with patience.
