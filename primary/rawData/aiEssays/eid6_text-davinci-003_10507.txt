The Empire State Building is one of the wonders of the modern world, but when it was constructed in 1930-31, its designers faced an incredible challenge: to allow dirigibles to dock at the building's top. The ambition was incredible, but it was not without its obstacles.

The most pressing challenge for the designers was the sheer size of the building, which was unprecedented for its time. Commercial dirigibles, which were large helium-filled airships, were approximately 800 feet long, but the Empire State Building was over 1,000 feet tall; even if the dirigible were lined up perfectly on top of the building, it would only reach halfway up. This meant that the mooring mast, a system that was necessary for the dirigible to grip onto the Empire State Building, had to be built specifically for the undertaking.

The design of the mooring mast was critical in ensuring that it could properly hold onto the dirigible. Different designs had to be tested for their strength and resilience against weather, such as strong winds, and for how much weight it could bear. One particular design, a steel frame with cables extending from the platform and reaching all the way to the ground of the building, was ultimately chosen as the most successful. It was an incredible feat of construction and engineering that had to pass several stress tests before it could be declared complete.

The mooring mast also had to be able to withstand the impact that would occur
