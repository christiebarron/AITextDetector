Dear Editor,

I recently read an article in your newspaper about the effects computers have on people, and I think it's an important and relevant topic. I believe that while computers can offer many benefits and advantages, they can also have some adverse effects.

First, computers can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, which can be unhealthy. Bad posture, prolonged screen time, and a lack of exercise can all lead to poor physical and mental health. Furthermore, digital addiction is a growing problem, and people can become too reliant on technology, which can be damaging.

Second, computers can also lead to the erosion of social skills. People may be more likely to stay indoors rather than going out and meeting new people. Additionally, reliance on online communication can lead to a lack of face-to-face interactions, resulting in a decline in communication skills. Lastly, computers can lead to a decrease in creativity. While computers can increase efficiency, they can also lead to a less imaginative approach to problem-solving.

I believe that while computers can certainly have some positive effects, the less desirable outcomes should not be underestimated or ignored. It is important to be aware of the potential pitfalls and to use computers with caution.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
