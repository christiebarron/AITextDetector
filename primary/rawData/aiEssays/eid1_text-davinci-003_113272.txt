Dear Editor,

I am writing to give my opinion on the effects that computers have on people today. There’s no denying that computers have changed our lives in many ways - they are incredibly powerful tools that can be used for both work and leisure, and they’ve allowed us to connect with people from around the world.

However, computers can also have a detrimental effect on people’s well-being. With the rise of social media, concerns about the effects of screens on our physical and mental health have come to the fore. Excessive use of computers can lead to eye strain, a lack of physical exercise and difficulty sleeping. It can also affect our relationships, as social media can lead to feelings of isolation and anxiety as people compare themselves to others.

Therefore, I believe it is important to practice moderation when it comes to computer use. It’s important to set limits on how long we spend in front of a screen, find alternative activities to pursue and ensure that we maintain healthy relationships with friends and family both in person and online. There is a balance to be struck between our lives online and off it, and we should take care to ensure we make the most of both.

I urge your readers to take care of their mental and physical health and consider the impact computers have on their lives.

Regards,

[Your Name]
