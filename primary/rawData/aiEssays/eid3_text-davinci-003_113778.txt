In Joe Kurmaski's poem, "Rough Road Ahead," the cyclist is brought to life through the vivid description of the setting. The cyclist is faced with a road full of "deep divots and horse droppings," a "raw wind from the North," and "frosted trees against a cool sunken sky." These features of the setting immediately create an atmosphere of struggle and challenge for the cyclist as they travel ahead. 

The abundance of obstacles on the path makes the journey difficult and exhausting, and the raw wind pushes the cyclist further and further from any sense of comfort or security. The frosted trees in the cool sky symbolize the harshness of the environment, further pushing the cyclist into a state of vulnerability and disorientation. The fact that the journey is being taken on the back roads of a rural location makes the cyclist's experience even more removed from protection and safety, creating an extreme sense of desolation and helplessness. 

The features of the setting in this poem are integral to Kurmaski's portrayal of the cyclist. These sensory images of the road create a vivid sense of the cyclist's emotional and physical hardship, making the poem engaging and impacting to the reader. By combining the physical and emotional struggles of the cyclist into one vivid image, Kurmaski creates a powerful and enduring picture of the cyclist's journey.
