Dear editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Over the years, computers have become an integral part of human life—from home to the workplace—and, while they have made life much easier, their pervasive presence has not been without some measurable costs.

For one thing, extended use of computers can lead to physical and mental health issues. Excessive exposure to EMF radiation, which is emitted by many electronics, can cause headaches, fatigue, and even insomnia. Additionally, sitting in front of a computer for extended periods of time can lead to serious back and shoulder pain. Furthermore, studies have linked the overuse of computers to anxiety, depression, and stress.

Another cost to consider is the impact on our social lives. Spending too much time using computers to do work, communicate, or play games can lead us to become isolated from those we care about, including family and friends. We miss out on vital physical and emotional contact as well as real-world experiences that might otherwise be beneficial to our relationships.

For these reasons, I believe that it is important for everyone to be aware of the potential dangers of overusing computers and be responsible with our computing habits. We need to seek balance through breaks from electronic use and by making time for our relationships. Only then will we be able to reap the benefits of computers without suffering the costs.

I urge all readers to take these matters into consideration and
