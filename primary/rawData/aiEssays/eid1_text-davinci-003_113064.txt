Dear Editor, 

Today, computers play an integral role in the lives of many people. As technology advances, computers are becoming more and more accessible and they have a real impact on our lives. While some of the effects may be beneficial, increasingly increasingly, the use of computers has been linked to a number of negative outcomes. 

One of the most concerning effects of computer usage is the risk of developing physical health problems. Many hours spent at a computer screen can lead to problems such as computer vision syndrome, repetitive strain injury and carpal tunnel. In addition, the use of computers can also lead to psychological problems such as stress, anxiety and depression. As computers become more and more prevalent in our lives, it is essential that we make sure that we use them responsibly. 

The other problem with computers is that they have the potential to be used for nefarious purposes. Computers are the tools of hackers and other cyber criminals, making it easier than ever for criminals to access data and commit cybercrime. Every day, more and more people are falling victim to cybercrime, and the consequences of this crime can be severe. 

From these effects, it is clear that computers can have both positive and negative impacts on our lives. As computer usage becomes even more widespread, we need to be aware of the potential risks associated with computer usage and take steps to mitigate them. 

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
