In Joe Kurmaski's short story Rough Road Ahead, the setting plays an important role in affecting the cyclist's experience. The cyclist, riding through a dismal and broken-down industrial landscape, is constantly confronted by the harshness of the environment around them, and this impacts how the cyclist perceives and feels during their ride.

The story creates a vivid image of decay and desolation. The cyclist passes crumbling factories, dilapidated homes, and "shops with broken windows." Heavy rain has driven away many of the people that used to live and work in this area, and the cyclist is left alone, surrounded by "rusting railroad tracks and wrecked warehouses." The emptiness of the setting further heightens the cyclist's loneliness and isolation, and makes them all the more aware of their own vulnerability in this dangerous environment.

The cyclist further experiences the physical effects of the setting. As they make their way through mud pools and past broken asphalt, the cyclist battles the rain throughout their journey and endures the back-breaking ordeal of pushing their bike along the rough terrain. The cyclist clearly finds the physical challenges posed by the setting to be daunting and exhausting, and senses the danger associated with their ride.

Throughout their journey, the cyclist is constantly confronted by the tough features of the setting. These features create an atmosphere of vulnerability and danger, and give the cyclist an awareness of their own fragility and mortality as they struggle against the elements.
