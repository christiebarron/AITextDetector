The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because many people say that the book is a bad, silly show and that it's just boring. But when you put that in context with the story and the writing, there are two people who probably have very different opinions about this book.

The writer and the screenwriter in this book knew that this is an action book. We're not telling you what that means. All that's being said is that they knew, at some point, that the movie is an action film. And here, that was the true source of the action of what became Winter Hibiscus, but they were the ones who started off with a movie. And that's not necessarily true when you read the title of The Legend of Zelda, because I wanted to make sure that every chapter and sentence was going to make you want to read the real story of how the world works and the people who made what it is.
