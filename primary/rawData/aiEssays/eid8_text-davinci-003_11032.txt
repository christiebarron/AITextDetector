I remember when my ex-boyfriend and I were still together. We had a kind of love that made everything feel light and fluffy. Everyday was like a dream come true and I wanted it to last forever. One day, after a particularly long day of work and commuting, we were both exhausted. We had just sat down on the couch and I glanced over at him. He caught my eyes and we had a moment where we both had that silly grin. Without either of us making a sound, we started to laugh so hard. We probably laughed for fifteen minutes straight, holding our stomachs, pointing and laughing at each other. 

It was such a beautiful, innocent moment and I was so happy. These days, I can't help but think back to that moment. That burst of laughter brought us as close to each other as possible. That one moment reminded me that despite all of our problems, we still had each other. That one moment was a reminder of why we were together in the first place. 

Now, even though we can only be friends, I'll still remember that moment forever.
