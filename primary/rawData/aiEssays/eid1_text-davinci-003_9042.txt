Dear Editor:

It is clear that computers have become an integral part of everyday life. Whether at home or in the workplace, they are everywhere. This is why it is important to consider how computers impact us as people.

The influence computers have on us can be divided into two categories: physical and mental effects. Physically, spending too much time in front of a computer can cause eye strain, posture issues, and, in some cases, carpal tunnel syndrome. Additionally, computers can lead people to become less active. Mentally, some studies suggest that excessive computer use can lead to personality changes, anxiety, and depression.

However, if used in moderation, computers can be incredibly useful tools. Not only can they help businesses stay organized and efficient, they can also provide educational opportunities and act as essential sources of communication.

It is necessary to remember that if computers are used responsibly, they can be a great asset. However, if used in excess, they can cause negative physical and mental effects. Thus, it is important to be mindful of how much time you spend in front of a computer each day.

Sincerely, 
[Your name]
