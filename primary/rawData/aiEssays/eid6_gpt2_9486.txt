The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In their attempts the building's lower stage must be secured and the ceiling of the building must be kept erect. The tower itself, like all the existing buildings in the Empire State Building Project, was designed by architects at the Hutton Group. They spent six years designing and building the urgently needed design guidelines, as well as several years developing a new construction site on the site. The following page contains a map of Hutton City's development.

Hutton City â€“ The Development of the Empire State Building of 1920

Hutton City was a large complex of four floors, with a number of large shops, a theatre, a gymnasium, a public park and many apartments. It was built on the western slopes Afghans and Russians began using as early as 1878, during the "pipes" of the construction campaign. A great many Afghans were driven to work in the early 1900s to find work in the building, the building then known as the Great Buildings. Hutton City has been used by the Empire State Building for more than 40 years.

Many large buildings in Hutton City were built by the Hutton Company, at the present time as part of the Federal Buildings, or National Governments of Afghanistan.
