An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a family man named Larry King. His wife worked at Starbucks at 7 am every day. He thought he would never be able to get into a bank or start their business. He was very concerned because he felt like it was all in his head. He went outside and made some money and stopped to think, I've given up something for my job, my career, my life. I've lived off that money, and I could never return it back to him.

It felt like life didn't feel so good while in pain. I always thought that would be the end point for everybody involved. However, after being given the opportunity to be part of so much healing while in pain, I realized that I would be able to heal my body.

Today I know that I'm a better person. I can walk and talk without having a heart attack; I can't hear; and I can talk the entire time without the slightest hesitation. I think that's what made me truly blessed.

When I was younger I was always able to talk in a very quiet manner. But now, it feels amazing to talk openly about this process with anyone. I find it so exciting when those who are hurt ask questions about what I have done, or when I'm healed are brought up about something else or when certain people feel more blessed than others. The point in life, for most people, is that things are normal
