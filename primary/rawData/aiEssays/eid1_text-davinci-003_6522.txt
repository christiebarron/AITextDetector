Dear Editor,
As someone who is directly affected by computers and their presence in our lives, I write to share my opinion on the topic. 

I believe that, on the whole, computers have had a largely positive effect on people. Computer technology has enabled us to communicate with each other in ways that were never possible before. Social media links us to friends and relatives, allowing us to keep up with each other despite our busy lives. Computers have also enabled us to access information from all over the world almost instantaneously, and with better accuracy than before. 

At work, computers have revolutionized the way we work. Businesses are able to use technology to increase productivity and efficiency, resulting in a more productive and profitable workforce. Computers have also caused wages to increase, as businesses are constantly looking for ways to save money and increase efficiency.

At the same time, computers can also be detrimental to people's lives. They can contribute to isolation and disconnection, as people may spend hours in front of a computer without connecting to anyone or anything. Computer technology can also lead to complacency, as people become used to relying on technology to get tasks completed, and can lead to a lack of innovation. 

In conclusion, computers have enabled us to achieve and to connect with people in ways we never thought possible. However, they can also have adverse effects on peopleâ€™s lives. While there may be no easy answer, I
