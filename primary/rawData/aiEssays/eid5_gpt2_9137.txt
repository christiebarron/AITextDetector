The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' and the other two, 'Revenge of the Sons of Zodiac', a thriller about a gang of serial killers accused of murdering a woman's best friend, have been reworked in the film by David Cronenberg and Gary Cooper.

In her latest interview about her new novel, The Girl who Dances, Ms O'Sullivan describes all nine scenes in the book as an "open world game".

"There's a lot that I'm looking into and I'm talking about how my novel works. There's this sort of dark-horse idea that I have something that I've been working on for years and years but it's only recently and not for many years. It's exciting, with all the characters involved.

Dressed in a black suit and with tight white hair, Ms O'Sullivan is wearing a long, black-tie dress which says "I'm a serial killer". She has also created a t-shirt to hide her scars and tattoo on the right part of her body.

"As some of you might remember, last year I started thinking about something else that I'd like to say about my life, and so I went into the production of this novel and I was really excited about it. Then then it was like, 'Where are we going with this?' and I got it. But that was about six years ago," Miss O'Sullivan tells The Independent.
