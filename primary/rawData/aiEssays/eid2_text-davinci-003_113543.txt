It is no secret that libraries are home to all kinds of materials; books, music, movies, and magazines can all be found on library shelves. With this large selection, it is inevitable that not all materials available will be agreeable to everyone. In this day and age, censorship is an issue that cannot be avoided, and libraries are no exception. 

Censorship in libraries has long been a controversial topic, as those in favor of it argue that libraries should uphold certain standards to keep materials free from indecent content. On the other hand, opponents argue that it is wrong to deny patrons access to material on the grounds of morality. 

In my view, libraries should not be suppressing the intellect of their patrons, no matter how offensive the material may be. To deny access to certain materials could just be reinforcing more harmful values. Censorship sends the message that only certain kinds of thoughts and ideas should be visible, or even acceptable, and that all other dissenting voices should be stifled, something which I believe is both unreasonable and unjust.

Rather than banishing certain materials on the grounds of decency, libraries should instead be providing a safe platform for people to engage in honest dialogue about controversial topics. To do this, libraries should not be eliminating potentially offensive works, but should instead be encouraging patrons to consider and express diverse opinions. 

In conclusion, libraries should not bow to societal pressures and remove books, music, movies, and magazines in the name
