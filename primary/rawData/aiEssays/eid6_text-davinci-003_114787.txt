When the Empire State Building was built in 1931, it was the worldâ€™s tallest structure and the idea of using it as a dock for dirigibles was quite a challenge. It was a massive undertaking, especially considering the fact that the very concept of docking a dirigible was completely new and untested. There were numerous obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome in order to make this daring endeavor successful.

For one, the construction of the Empire State Building posed a unique problem for dirigibles attempting to dock. As the building was so tall, the mooring mast had to be constructed an additional 200 feet above the roof of the building to reach the necessary docking height. As a result of such a height, the Gust Load Factor, a measure of wind force that affects the mooring of a dirigible, would render landing almost impossible. To combat this problem, extended steel cables were hung from a tower of steel to reduce the Gust Load Factor and to give the pilot a sure footing during mooring.

In addition, the Empire State Building spanned a full five city blocks. As a result, the mooring mast had to be spaced out up to 600 feet apart to cover the entire area. In order to make mooring possible, it was necessary to extend the length of the steel cables and to add additional supports and braces to the mooring mast. As these longer cable lengths increased the risk of sway
