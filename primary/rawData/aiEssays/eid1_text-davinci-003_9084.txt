To the Editor of [Newspaper Name],

I am writing to share my opinion on the impacts that computers can have on people’s wellbeing and quality of life.

As someone who has personally experienced the many benefits of technology, I cannot deny that computers play a huge role in our daily lives. We use them for practically anything—doing research for school, shopping online, even learning new skills. There is an immense amount of knowledge and entertainment accessible online at any given moment.

But as with every technological advancement, there are some negative effects too. I believe that when using computers for extended periods of time, it is very easy to become overwhelmed and overstimulated. It is also easy to become socially isolated and disconnected from reality. Excessive use of computers can lead to problems such as anxiety, headaches, eye strain, and repetitive stress injuries.

Therefore, I believe that the effects of computers on people should be taken into serious consideration. We should strive to create more responsible and balanced computer usage, and take breaks from screens as much as possible. This would help us to stay connected to the “real world”, and improve our overall wellbeing.

I hope I have convinced you to agree with me on this important issue.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
