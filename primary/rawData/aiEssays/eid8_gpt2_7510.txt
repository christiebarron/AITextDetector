One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I saw my daughter taking her day off work and talking with my grandpa about a plan to make a little boy play with his grandmother. I have never seen a toddler who walks on their own with no father. I can remember thinking to myself, "Why isn't an orphan the only child who gets along with everyone?" I always find it frustrating when I am not able to see kids whose parents are often absent. In fact, even though I had so much fun interacting with my younger children, I still felt lonely. I was afraid to even talk to my grandpa, because I thought it would become uncomfortable until he finally came over and asked me to help him get his daughter to play with her grandfather while she had a baby. My grandpa told me to do it, because it was a very special time for my little boy. My momma was such a good friend that she even gave me some extra money for every two tickets to the game. I still have a feeling that my child is going to be there for me when I finally get home.
