The mood created in the memoir “From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives” by Narciso Rodriguez is one of nostalgia, warmth, and understanding. From the very opening of the book Rodriguez uses his own relationship with home as a metaphor to capture the feelings of memories, emotions, and a home’s influence on one’s life. This type of nostalgia allows the reader to connect to Rodriguez’s experience, allowing them to tap into their own experiences and empathize with how each memory can draw a lasting impact.

This sentimental and reflective mood is further reinforced by Rodriguez’s intentional utilization of language and imagery. His writing is poetic and full of vivid descriptions that transport the reader into moments in time. He uses detail to evoke feelings of longing for the past, inspiring readers to reflect about their own homes and what it means to them. He also purposefully uses personal stories and anecdotes to further build on the emotional impact of his memoir.

The creativity and depth with which Rodriguez writes about his memories of home creates a mood that not only captures the feelings of nostalgia, but also stirs feelings of hope and inspiration. By highlighting the lessons he’s learned through his experiences, he reminds the reader of the beauty of home—rather than only focusing on the memories that were ingrained in him. His writing invokes a feeling of understanding combined with an appreciation for the complexity of life — emotions of both deep sorrow and profound joy.
