The narrator of Winter Hibiscus is an immigrant student who is struggling in school and taking an exam that will determine her future academic opportunities. The narrator is worried about taking the exam and feels pressure to perform well, so she imagines a hibiscus that blossoms every spring, a symbol of hope for a better future. The ending of the poem serves as a reminder of the resilience of nature and the opportunity for rebirth and transformation. It is also a reminder that, just like the hibiscus, the narrator can also bloom again if she works hard and tries again.
