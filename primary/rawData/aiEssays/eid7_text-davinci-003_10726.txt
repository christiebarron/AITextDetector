I recently had a job interview for my dream job. It was the opportunity of a lifetime and I was extremely nervous. I made it to the interview only to find out that I was an hour late due to the traffic. I was embarrassed and was sure this would be a strike against me.

The interviewer, however, was remarkably patient and understanding. Because of the traffic, he had extra time that day and asked me to come back later. I apologized profusely but he waved it off and said, “Don’t worry about it. Take your time and take a few deep breaths before you come back.”

Needless to say, I was relieved and was grateful for his patience. I took his advice and came back ready to give my best performance. Not only did he forgive my lateness, he was also very encouraging and gave me helpful advice for the next round of interviews. 

The job ended up going to someone else, but I was quite impressed by how patient the interviewer was with me.
