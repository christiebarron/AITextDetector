Computers have many effects on people. They might affect our behavior, particularly those that we can't control ourselves. So we try to maintain a high level of caution before we do any research. And there is certainly room to grow. One of the biggest problems in all of this is, you know, all the research that's done has gotten a lot out of it, I take it? It's pretty much all about trying to make sure the same things we've said before and trying to keep people from thinking about it as if it's more complex than we realize.

But we have to work with the results of that research and try to stay true to that. We have to continue to focus on not overthinking the issue with the way science is done and making sure that what is clearly the most important research study is done.

When you read a lot of papers in that space, do you sometimes think about what those results could be?

JH: Yeah, I would think of those studies as more or less complete. It's always been, and always will be, that you will find that where the problem arises. But you're probably not sure why that problem is happening. Are people starting to talk about this before they do a particular study? No, it might be because it is getting better. Maybe it is because it's becoming more complicated, or maybe it's because it's been made up as part of many studies and they don't want to
