One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my first wife heard the story about what happened to my dad, and I remember thinking, "Well, that's a joke," but it really wasn't funny. I could just tell my story and that would be it.

You mentioned in your interview and in the interview with The New York Times that the way you talk about your family isn't going to lead people to accept that they had a bad relationship with your mom or dad or sister. How long do you see your family changing for the better, going from being a family of three to being something more and more like adults?

No, that is to be expected. I am not going to say things that make me a little uncomfortable or a little angry, I will say things that may turn some of my other choices and thoughts on something off. I have met with my mom and dad about doing something different with the family. They are both very supportive and I can still do well working with them. I want to make friends with people who are like my Dad, but who are really good at what they do and who give me a great service.

You've described your relationship with your father's father as difficult at times. Did that really help?

I know that once we split, my husband and I tried very hard to be close and it was so important to me not to have to deal with these thoughts, but it became a lot more.
