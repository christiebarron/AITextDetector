Dear Editor,

I write to express my opinion about the effects that computers have on people. It is my belief that computers can be both helpful and harmful to society.

On the one hand, computers have become an essential tool in our daily lives. Computers are used in many areas, from work to school. They can help us save time and become more productive. They also provide us with access to a variety of information and resources.

However, overuse of computers and the subsequent information overload can be damaging to our lifestyle. It can lead to physical issues, such as eye strain and headaches. Furthermore, people can develop mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression, as a result of not spending enough time in physical activities. Additionally, cyberbullying and online harassment are on the rise due to increased computer usage.

For these reasons, it is important to strike a balance between computer usage and physical activities. Computers are an integral part of our lives, but we should be mindful of how we use them and keep our usage in moderation. We should also keep an eye on our children and make sure they are not spending too much time on the computer.

I hope that this letter has opened your eyes to the potential effects computers can have on society.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
