Narciso Rodriguez’s memoir, From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, does an excellent job of conveying a deeply contemplative and reflective mood. This feeling is established right away, with the description of his childhood home as a place of solace and comfort. As readers, we are given glimpses into the author’s innermost thoughts through his portrayal of home as “a place where one’s guard can come down”. 

Rodriguez’s candid and thoughtful telling of his past is a major contributor to creating a reflective atmosphere. For example, when describing his first job, he reflects on the feeling of being overwhelmed that “accompanied most of his steps”. His susceptibility to crippling anxiety allows us to relate to him and empathize with his experience.

His lyrical language further helps to set the tone of the memoir. His beautiful imagery of sunset views from his grandmother’s one-bedroom home, accompanied by vivid memories of conversations he’d had with her, displays a tinge of sadness that hangs heavy in the air. These melancholic visions are only broken when he attempts to make sense of his own narrative by exploring his cultural heritage, ethnic traditions, and personal stories, all of which serve to add a layer of complexity and mystery to the text.
