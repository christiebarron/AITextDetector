Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have had on people. Over the past few decades, computers have become an essential part of our lives. They make our lives easier, faster, and more efficient.

But there are also some negative effects we must consider when using computers. For example, computers can easily become a source of distraction. We often find ourselves browsing the internet instead of focusing on important tasks. In fact, a recent study found that more than half of millennials spend over 3 hours on their phones per day – downloading apps, looking at social media, checking emails – reducing productivity during the workday.

Additionally, computers have also had a damaging effect on our mental health. The use of technology has been linked to anxiety and depression in people as young as teenagers. Constant distractions from screens, however small they may seem, can lead to an inability to stay focused for long periods of time and ultimately lead to disrupted sleep and mental exhaustion.

Therefore, I strongly believe that computers should not be overused and should only be used for productive tasks. We should strive to use our time, energy, and resources in better and more meaningful ways instead of getting lost in the virtual world.

I hope you take these points into consideration and agree with me that computers can have both positive and negative effects on our lives. 

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
