The builders of the Empire State building faced tremendous obstacles when proposing the inclusion of mooring masts to allow large dirigibles to dock. Initially, it seemed the building would become the headquarters for commercial air transportation, as the design included four mooring masts of over 600 feet in length running from the 102nd floor.

The first obstacle the builders faced was the limited technology available. Building a structure with mooring masts of such length proved to be a major engineering challenge: the steel frame of the building had to be both strong to support the weight and nimble enough to accommodate the winds and movement of the dirigibles. Calculations were also necessary to determine the exact size of the mooring mast, as small variations could have huge impacts on the navigation of the aircraft.

The second obstacle was convincing the public and authorities that the mooring masts were a safe idea. Though dirigibles had been flown for some time, incidents of crashes and fires made the airships a source of fear and instability. By the 1930s their use was limited to sporting events and other special occasions, and the idea of allowing large airships to dock in the center of New York City seemed impossible. Despite this resistance, the builders of the Empire State Building worked to demonstrate the engineering and safety considerations taken in constructing the mooring mast, as well as the potential benefits of allowing large dirigibles to docked in a city at the heart
