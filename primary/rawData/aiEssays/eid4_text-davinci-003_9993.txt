The narrator of the poem is reflecting on the cycle of life, and the fact that life is process of changing, learning, and growing. The situation where the narrator must take the test is a metaphor for life, in that life is a never-ending cycle of challenge and growth. The narrator is recognizing that no matter how difficult life can be, there is always hope for growth and renewal, which is embodied in the blossoming of winter hibiscus. By choosing to end the poem with the thought of taking the test again, the author is showing that no matter how hard life can get, there is always a chance to start anew.
