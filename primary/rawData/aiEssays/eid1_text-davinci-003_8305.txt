I remember the time when I was working as a cashier at the grocery store. One day, the store was extremely busy with long lines at every register. It was the middle of the week, but it felt like the weekend. 

After working for a couple of hours, my manager came up to me and asked me to switch cash registers with one of the other cashiers. Although I was exhausted and really wanted to stay at my original register, I reluctantly accepted.

I started my new position, and the customer I was working with had a huge cart filled to the brim with items. As I began to ring up her items, I noticed there was an error with the machine and the barcodes weren't registering properly. As a result, I had to take more time to enter all the items' prices manually. 

I expected the customer to be irritated and impatient, but to my surprise, she was incredibly patient with me as I figured out the technical error. She was understanding, and even cracked a joke to lighten the mood. 

In the end, I was able to get the machine to work properly and the customer left with a smile. I was incredibly grateful for her patience, and it helped me get through the long day of work with more tolerance and understanding.
