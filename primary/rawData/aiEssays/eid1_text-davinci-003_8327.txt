 

I recently had the pleasure of working with my elderly neighbor on a DIY project. She had some basic tools and needed help getting the job done, so she asked if I could lend a hand. At first, I was a little hesitant as I didn't have a ton of experience with the task and wasn't sure how much help I'd be able to offer.

But then, as we began to work together, I experienced her patience firsthand. She showed me the basics of what she was doing and then gave me time to practice and make mistakes. She never grew frustrated or complained; rather, she answered my questions with kindness and let me take my time to learn the process. After a few hours, the project was done and we both walked away feeling proud and accomplished.

I'll always remember my neighbor's patience and understanding on that day, and it's something I will aim to have more of in my own life.
