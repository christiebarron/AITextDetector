I pride myself in having an often unbelievable amount of patience, regardless of the situation. I remember one particular instance where I was put to the test.

I was at the store trying to get some groceries for the week. I got in line and the cashier was very slow and unresponsive. It felt like it was taking forever, but I didn’t get impatient or lose my cool. The woman in front of me was getting frustrated and started to complain about the cashier’s slow speed, but I just kept my composure, smiled, and waited.

Slowly, but surely, we made our way through the line. When I finally got to the cash register, the cashier apologized for the delay. He had been having a particularly bad day and was struggling to keep up. I thanked him for his hard work and told him that I hoped he was feeling better soon.

The woman behind me in line was clearly not as patient as I was. She started yelling and cursing at the cashier, and it ended up causing a huge scene. The cashier was embarrassed and upset, but I comforted him with a kind word.

I think it says a lot about a person’s character to remain patient under difficult circumstances. Patience is hard to come by these days, and by showing it, I was able to put the cashier’s mind at ease.
