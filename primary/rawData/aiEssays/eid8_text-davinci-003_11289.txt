I still remember the time my friend and I had the most uproarious laughter over even the silliest things. 

We had been planning a surprise party for my uncle on his birthday and had been running around town looking for just the right decorations and items. We ended up at the local thrift store and I was so excited to find a vase exactly like the one my aunt wanted for the table centerpieces. I was about to grab from the shelf when I noticed my friend was hysterically laughing and pointing in my direction.

I turned around to find someone trying to sell me a particularly weird looking t-shirt. It had a giant smiley face on the front and it read "I'm Sorry For What I Said When I Was Hungry." I couldn't help but start laughing as well and we both ended up doubled over, tears flowing. 

It was then that I really noticed my friend's silly personality and couldn't help but admire how unashamed he was of his hilarity. That moment had us both feeling lighter and in a way, closer. 

I'm grateful for how laughter can bring two people together.
