Dear Editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. I believe that computers have had both positive and negative effects on people, but overall they have had a huge positive impact. 

First, computers have made communication much more efficient and accessible. Through email, messaging, and video calls, it is much easier to stay connected with anyone around the world. At an affordable cost, we are able to communicate with ease.

Second, computers can provide an educational edge to those seeking more knowledge. With online courses and educational material, people can learn a subject in great depth in a short amount of time. This has the potential to bridge divides in educational opportunities, especially in areas with limited resources.

Third, computers have increased access to entertainment and leisure activities. With streaming services, social media, gaming platforms, and an abundance of other resources, users can easily access entertainment.

Overall, computers have had immense positive effects on peopleâ€™s lives and I believe that readers should take a positive outlook on the role of computers. Computers have revolutionized the way we live our lives, and I believe that this should be embraced.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
