Wilson, a retired surgeon at the National Institutes of Mental Health who worked closely with Drexel in developing a drug, MCP-1, which would eventually lead directly into his treatment — also reveals the inner workings of Drexel's health care system.

"We also had to shift our culture. It takes time to build a really powerful community, and that's just how in Drexel we built it."

After Drexel decided in 2006 that it should not develop another drug to treat depression, it took the federal government eight years to develop a clinical trial to study the effectiveness of MCP-1.trip.

One of the first experiments, conducted by a team led by the Medical Center of Chicago in Chicago, gave a randomized, double-blind, randomized trial of taking MCP-1 to 50 adults who suffered from a wide range of anxiety, insomnia, and other symptoms. But even then, the trials did not prove its effectiveness against any kind of treatment, not even antidepressant, or even a long-term intervention, which is to say if a patient developed PTSD, depression, or a specific disease, which makes the therapy
