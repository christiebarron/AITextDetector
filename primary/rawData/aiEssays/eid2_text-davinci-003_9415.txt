Censorship in libraries should not be encouraged. Libraries serve as communal spaces where readers can explore different topics, subjects, and genres, without fear of being reprimanded. Removing certain materials from library shelves because they are deemed offensive can be extremely limiting and lead to suppression of dialogue and ideas. 

It is vital for libraries to be open forums for exploration. With the internet being used for a variety of tasks, including retrieving information, libraries have become increasingly important for providing access to knowledge to those who cannot access the internet. To censor library materials would be to limit access to that knowledge, and deprive those without internet access of the tools they need. Instead of removing materials in the name of censorship, libraries should focus on increasing access to materials by providing resources and making use of technology to provide increased access to knowledge.

It is also important to recognize that some materials may not be appropriate for all readers, and that parents or guardians should have the right to make decisions for minors when it comes to library materials. Instead of censoring unpopular materials, libraries should instead provide resources to inform parents and guardians of library contents and offer guidance for parents when selecting appropriate materials. 

Censorship has no place in libraries. Libraries should be seen as places that encourage informed conversations and exploration, not fear and suppression. By allowing access to controversial materials, libraries foster intellectual exploration, dialogue and the free exchange of ideas. As such, censorship in libraries is unnecessary and should be discouraged.
