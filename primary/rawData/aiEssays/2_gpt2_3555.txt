I believe that censorship of materials in libraries can serve to facilitate the dissemination of information regarding people (and others), but also can diminish our ability to make informed use of our scientific knowledge," he said.

The statement came after a series of revelations about government programs and organizations targeting women in science, technology and education.

The government also targeted science clubs for providing funding. Women scientists were denied the support of other academic women as part of a "science club" scheme, which received a $90 million gift from the National Science Foundation that was intended to help women research and advance better understanding of women's biological, emotional health and reproductive and reproductive system.

The "gender-driven" program was supposed to help women "find out where they fit into their lives" and prevent women from becoming "emotional, physical, or spiritual pain-relievers." It was only last year that the program was introduced, but the program's $75 million "relegation" program received another $12 million by 2013.

The National Science Foundation donated $75 million, and nearly $100 million were donated to individual scientists and groups based on their research programs.

The grant program was meant to help "break the glass ceiling," said Andrew B. Stiles, a professor of biology at Harvard University who studies science in the department.

"There are so many ways in which the government gives money and there are so much opportunities for women to get better services," he said
