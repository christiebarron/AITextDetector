The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Many used "inboard-only seats" or "docking" seats to allow pilots to use their pilot's hands — often under heavy supervision.

The next hurdle was that the building needs more than an enclosed space.

"The biggest hurdle was that the builder needed a place where it could carry a cargo of food, water bottles, or other necessities," said John McAlpine, who runs Fiduciary Towers LLC now headquartered in Seattle.

The two companies have since collaborated on technology, which McAlpine developed using U.S. Navy aircraft.

The project is based partly on a collaboration with the National Academy of Engineering — designed to offer unique expertise in designing for-space structures and vehicles — who developed a novel method that allows astronauts to move from one place to another by parachuting on top of some debris.

"The idea behind it is that if the astronaut's space suit is attached to the surface of a space station, a robotic vehicle can climb to it," McAlpine said.

U.S. Air Force pilots will be able to bring their own reusable space suits and other supplies to the building.

The space boom, which McAlpine says will bring thousands of small spacecraft under the Earth's orbit of about 541 miles (610 kilometers) below the Earth's surface every minute, will be powered by commercial
