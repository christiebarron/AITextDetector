In the poem "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski, the features of the setting have a major influence on the cyclist. The poem is set in the Nevada desert – a vast, desolate landscape of dusty roads, dried-out riverbeds, and baking heat. This setting immediately creates a feeling of challenge and hardships for the cyclist. She must battle extreme heat, extreme dryness, and strong headwinds as she pedals through the emptiness.

The cyclist in the poem is trying to reach the coastline, but she is met with resistance and difficulty every step of the way. With the hot sun beating down and the endless mountains blocking her path, travel in this setting is often more grueling than more convenient terrain. Additionally, the sound of the wind throughout the poem symbolizes the strength of the obstacles she has to overcome in order to find her way.

The cyclist perseveres despite the difficult setting, however – her determination and focus on reaching the ocean make her determined to make it through whatever may come her way. The characteristics of the Colorado desert are integral to the poem's meaning and motif – without the harsh environment and winds, the impact of the poem would be diminished. The physical challenges of the environment bring out the strength of the cyclist and underscore her determination.  Thanks to the features of the setting, the cyclist in "Rough Road Ahead" is able to demonstrate her courage and will to reach her destination.
