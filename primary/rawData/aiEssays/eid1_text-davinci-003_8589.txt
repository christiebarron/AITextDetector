I remember the time I traveled to India to visit my grandparents. My flight was scheduled to arrive late at night, and the only transportation I had was with a taxi driver who did not speak English. As I gestured what I was looking for, the driver, being extremely kind, managed to determine my destination. 

On our way there, the driver got lost several times. Instead of getting impatient, I stayed patient and tried to reassure the driver, sitting calmly and watching the journey with curiosity. 

At the end, he managed to find the address without getting angry, and we both sighed with relief and gratitude. I paid him extra for his kindness and patience and thanked him for bringing me safely to my destination. It was this experience that taught me the importance of being patient even when things get tough.
