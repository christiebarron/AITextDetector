Earlier this year, I had the chance to volunteer with an organization focused on helping those in need. I was passionate about the cause and wanted to do my part in making a difference.

During my time volunteering, I met a lot of people. One of these was a young boy, about 8 years old. He didnâ€™t have anyone to look after him and was often shy and reserved.

At first, it was difficult to get him to open up, but I was patient. I took the time to build a relationship with him, getting to know him and getting him to trust me. We talked, played, and did many activities together.

Slowly but surely, I could see him coming out of his shell. He started trusting me and I was able to observe the bubbly personality he had been hiding before.

Being patient with him was definitely worth it and I was so happy to have seen him grow into a more confident and outgoing young boy.
