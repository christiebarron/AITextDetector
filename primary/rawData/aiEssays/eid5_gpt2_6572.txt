The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is that "it is the most important place [in thereport] to think about anything and the most personal to make an informed decision".

The book's narrator, Martin O'Connor, is more than 100 per cent white. "The question of race is a complicated one, and it has to be said again and again," Dr McWhorter told The Telegraph. "But for many people, and it is a huge, complicated issue – and I think there is a deep and ongoing discussion about racism on a global scale – a whole lot of us don't really know how or why it would happen."

Dr McWhorter is keen that the book's most important findings, namely that Asians were the largest and most discriminated against group of people, were brought to the fore so the authors could draw action by "not just speaking up for those we feel are not really represented".
