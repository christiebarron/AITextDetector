Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. Firstly, they are: 1. A cycle path or route can be laid over the road with the added benefit of providing a clear route to the nearest place (or two points) to which a designated cyclist may make an immediate return. This means that on or beyond one of these routes it is possible to cross it. So far it's only been feasible to take two or three on-wides on very narrow routes.

2. Cycling routes are often much more difficult to access in the warmer months, especially if the road is paved, rather than lined. However, they are certainly less stressful when compared to walking.

3. The choice to take a route in the winter means that a cyclist may have to cycle quite a few times before they can be sure of the outcome of the route.

It seems that some cyclists are very reluctant to make an immediate return, and are even less likely to do so on very narrow streets which have long narrow streets.
