The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it puts it directly into an emotional state that is almost comical given the author's penchant for self-indulgent writing.


My personal experience with this kind of fiction has been that I have experienced things that could only be described by the author.


I've never read books that were about a woman that I cared about or wanted to see. While some books give us that same sense of self that I do, many of my books are about characters. I write about characters whose lives are about trying to live. I'm always working toward an end because I know that's the ultimate goal. And because I do have some sort of redemption that needs to be pursued, I can't deny if things are good or bad. I can be positive, and that's never a huge issue for me. But as a writer, it sometimes seems like something that comes along and I get pushed down a slope into something that ends abruptly and is either an emotionally satisfying one or a really frustrating one.


That said, I'll never forget my most memorable book because I love writing and being a fan of it. And I know it's always been a struggle reading this book.


When reading a book, I'll think of it and say I'd never want to write about sex. My only love for the book was because it just seemed too far away from reality. That just seems too bad to be true here
