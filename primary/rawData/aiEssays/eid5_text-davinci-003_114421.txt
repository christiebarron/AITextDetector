The memoir ‘From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives’ by Narciso Rodriguez creates a unique and uplifting mood that both celebrates the resilience of the human spirit and encourages readers to embrace their own heritage.

The memoir is broken down into three different sections. First, the author recounts stories from his childhood to show how his family gave him the courage and strength to embrace his unique identity. Through vivid and detailed descriptions, Rodriguez brings the reader into his childhood experience and allows them to gain a better understanding of what it was like growing up in a Cuban-American family. He then shares stories from his adult life that focus on the importance of being true to oneself and staying connected to one’s roots. Lastly, Rodriguez looks to the future to discuss how the experiences of our past can inform the decisions we make as adults.

The mood created in this memoir is one of hope and motivation. Rodriguez’s stories shed light on the struggles many immigrants face in order to make a better life for themselves and their families. He poignantly expresses his understanding of how hard it can be to fit in and still stay authentic to one’s identity, but he never gives up in his pursuit of his dreams and believes deeply in the potential for people to achieve great things if they stay true to themselves and never give up in the face of adversity. This positive and encouraging outlook resonates with the reader and provides inspiration to never give in to society’
