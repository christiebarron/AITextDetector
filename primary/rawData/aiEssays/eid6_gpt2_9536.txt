The first one was the limited amount of land in the city — including city squares — that could be used for a dirigible, while city property owners could block them if they wanted to, he said. By the early 1970s, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated that there were 20 to 30 dirigibles floating in U.S. waterways.

It took the builders 30 years to put together the state-of-the-art city grid. Building the 1,300-square-foot building on the former East Central train station for 50,000 feet on the waterfront at the end of Washington Square Park was like constructing a large-scale office tower. But just in time for Hurricane Katrina and other disasters, a new line of building was opened to enable people to transport their mail by car.

An engineer on patrol on the runway saw a propeller, which meant it was heading toward the horizon.
