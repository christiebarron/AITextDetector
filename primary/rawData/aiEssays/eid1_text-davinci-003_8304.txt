I was out with my wife at a restaurant that was incredibly crowded on a Saturday night. We were both very hungry and had been waiting for at least forty-five minutes without any sign of our food arriving. Other tables around us were being served and it became more and more frustrating for us since we had been waiting so long.

But I stayed calm as I knew being impatient would not do any good. I was patient and kept my frustration to myself, instead simply asking the waiter when our food would arrive. He apologized for the long wait at first and then eventually our food arrived. 

I was relieved and thankful for the delicious meal, but also incredibly proud of myself for being patient in a difficult situation. Even when it would seem easier to get angry and frustrated, I was still able to find the patience that was needed to get through the situation.
