Dear Editor:

The growing influence of computers in our lives has been both revolutionary and controversial. Of all the debated topics surrounding computers, how they affect people is perhaps the most important. In my opinion, computers have had a largely beneficial impact on people. 

First and foremost, computers have made our lives easier. In less than a century, they have gone from bulky mainframes to tiny handheld devices, and they can now be found in almost every household. From online banking to ordering groceries, computers have helped us streamline everyday tasks. Time is money, and the time saved from these tasks can be put to better use.

Additionally, computers have greatly improved access to knowledge. With just a few clicks of the mouse, people can now find information quickly and conveniently. Countless datasets and documents have been made available to us, allowing us to understand our world better than ever before. From job skills to financial advice, computers are helping us learn in smarter, faster ways.

Finally, computers are essential to modern communications. Social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have helped us connect with distant family and friends. Without computers, the world would be a much less connected place.

For these reasons, I believe that the effects of computers on people are, on the whole, extremely positive. I hope that my fellow readers agree and understand the value of computers in our lives.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
