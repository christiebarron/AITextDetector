One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my wife told me about my children at night, because those things had never been experienced before.

"They were going to bring them here and they had no way to know that all the birds were alive again. The sky is beautiful."

The report has been passed around to all three councils, but the report was not approved by the county and county attorney to be published.

The county said it had received many complaints about the incident from residents about children and not having room for animals.

It is understood the birds were brought to the county bird sanctuary where they were placed on a "spatial nesting" basis at the back of the house.

In addition, county and county employee were notified and will be contacted if anything indulge their visitors.

The county said it will liaise with the local community and with the Wildlife Commission and the county and county officer for more information.
