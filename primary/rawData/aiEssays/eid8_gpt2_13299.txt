One time I experienced laughter in my life was when one of my friends yelled "Merry Christmas", my sister commented on the fact my boyfriend's face looked so sad and his smile wasn't even on-camera, and other friends were smiling back and forth for a moment while I went and stood there with them because I never used my 'Happy Christmas' as a 'thank you' or 'thanks you'. I wish we had been a little more comfortable with our smile, I still don't think it worked, but I think it was awesome.

The good thing is that everyone is there and the laugh was really good. I always used to be disappointed that laughter didn't get to me. I remember crying when I was really young when I told my parents that laughter was not so good. It was almost like being on the autism spectrum, when we weren't happy. I still didn't get it, but it really worked out so well.

I know it is sad for some of you, but I believe that all people deserve equal opportunities to express their passion, for all to feel like everyone else has made a huge difference in their lives for a good day and for the world to enjoy them again. And that's the point, it's a great time to be alive and I've helped so many people in many different ways. And with that being said, don't do your own damnedest to keep all of us happy or make mistakes. Don't stop. In
