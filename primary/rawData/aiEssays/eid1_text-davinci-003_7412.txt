The ending of this poem serves as a metaphor to illustrate the idea of resilience and growth despite adversity. The speaker has failed a test, which can be seen as a difficult moment. The winter hibiscus, despite the cold and snow, is resilient and strong enough to survive. In the same way, the speaker will also be able to weather the difficulty of failing a test and be able to try again and achieve success. The hope that spring will bring, along with the return of the geese, serves as an encouraging reminder that a difficult moment does not last forever--the speaker will be renewed and able to try again.
