It is no surprise that libraries are facing an ongoing debate about the role of censorship. All libraries should strive to provide an environment that is respectful of the diverse needs, stories, and values of its readers and patrons. In order to achieve this goal, libraries must choose the materials they include in their collection in an informed and responsible way. 

Censorship is only acceptable in libraries when the material being challenged is found to be offensive to an individual or group of individuals on the basis of their gender, age, sexual orientation, race, religion, or ethnicity. Limiting access to materials on these grounds is a reasonable and necessary step in order to protect the community and make sure libraries are providing a safe and respectful environment for everyone. 

However, it is important to distinguish this type of censorship from those that are based on personal preferences or opinions. It is not the responsibility of librarians to remove any material they find objectionable from the shelves due to their own moral views. To do so would limit the public’s access to a wide variety of potential information and hinder the library’s role in a community as an open space that encourages the sharing of ideas. 

Instead, libraries should prioritize the safety of their patrons and provide access to material that is not found to be offensive or dangerous. Libraries should also strive to create a space that is free from bias or discrimination by providing materials that seek to represent all perspectives and opinions objectively and respectfully.
