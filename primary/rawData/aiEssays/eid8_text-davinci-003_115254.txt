I had been friends with Mark since grade five and he had always been the life of the party. He was always making jokes, cracking funny puns and generally entertaining everyone around him. We were in the car one day, driving home from school together, when a light mist started to fall.

I heard Mark start to chuckle and he pointed up at the sky.

“It’s raining and I didn’t even bring my umbrella.” He said.

I couldn’t help but laugh. “It’s not funny!” I replied.

He turned to me with a mischievous smile and then answering his own question.

“Yes, yes it is!”

We both burst out laughing as the rain started to come down a little harder. We kept cracking one another up all the way home, telling silly stories, poking fun at each other and generally having a good time. By the time we got out of the car in the driveway, we were both in tears from laughing so hard.

That moment was the beginning of a really special friendship. To this day, whenever we’re together, laughter is never far away. I’m so thankful for Mark and all the laughter he has brought into my life.
