One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was 6 or 7 years old and every time when I was told something funny about a movie I started laughing back. There were always so many great jokes to get your heart pumping. So now you can see me thinking for the first time in my life that I am proud of all the great accomplishments that I've accomplished.

But it's not going to hold me back! I have just the things that I dreamed up as a kid, now I want to get them and share them with all my friends because I want to make a good life for myself and hopefully change things for everyone. I get to do this with my family and friends and it is what I always do during business meetings. Now I'm a normal person who knows how to deal with disappointment and make decisions when I am too busy trying to move forward. We are always in the kitchen trying to figure out how to give a good time and it's only grown so much ever since I was 11 and started having the fun of laughing like crazy.


Q: When I was a kid you started acting like you were so much more intelligent than my father on stage and I thought "Oh my God, I'm so funny." That was really funny to me, and I had to try to stop laughing. I think that it's what you had to do in school to get into acting and I think I had to do it all because I could live with that,
