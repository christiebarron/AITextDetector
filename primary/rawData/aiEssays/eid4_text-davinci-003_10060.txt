The ending of 'Winter Hibiscus' by Minfong Ho emphasizes the main character's hope for a better future. The character is preparing to take a test that could determine her academic future. However, she is worried about her lack of knowledge and studying due to her home life and cultural pressures. In the final line she expresses her hope that she will take the test again after a period of growth and renewal. The image of the hibiscus returning in the spring as the snow melts and the geese return serves as a metaphor for this renewal, and provides a hopeful resolution.
