The mood created in Narciso Rodriguez’s memoir, ‘From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives’, is that of nostalgia and reflection. Through anecdotes shared about his family, friends, and upbringing, he reflects on his Cuban-American identity and the values and emotions instilled in him from his home in New Jersey. 

Rodriguez’s memoir brings us into his home, specifically the kitchen, which is described as a place where a sense of joy, creativity and connection comes alive. We learn how he and his family were brought together through healthful dinners made together which contained the flavors of Latin America. He also recounts stories of his grandmother’s homemade dishes and the influences of their Cuban ancestry. 

These treasured memories bring us into the loving embrace of his mother’s home. The vibrant colors and rich texturesRodriguez uses to paint a picture of the interior of his family’s home evoke a sense of nostalgia, transporting us to a time of warmth that is both comforting and peaceful. 

The sentimentality of Rodriguez’s recollections creates a mood of appreciation and connection that resonates in the readers hearts. This rich and moving memoir is a testament to the power of food, family, and culture to bring us all together, unite us, and create memories that lasts a lifetime. We can’t help but feel the joy, laughter, and love that emanates from
