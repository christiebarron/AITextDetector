Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. Some might feel more excited to run the 'Fast-Travel' setting than 'Biking for Long Distance', such as when running or riding along the same road. A cyclist might feel less comfortable to take a long time, whereas a fast-travel setting may allow him or her to ride slower than 'Safe' and 'Wet' paths, in a similar way that cycling to the next stop may not be affected. If a busy cycling partner is taking up more and more time, they may prefer the quieter 'Fast-Travel' setting to 'Fast-Travel'.

This variation of running route may provide a better effect as running time is also more concentrated in the 'Fast Travel' condition of running.
