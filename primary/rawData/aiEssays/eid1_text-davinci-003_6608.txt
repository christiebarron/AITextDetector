Dear Editor,

I am writing to voice my opinion on the effects that computers have on people. With technology becoming ever more ubiquitous, it is essential to evaluate the impact this has on our lives.

The potential negative effects of computers are clear to see. Increased screen-time is a risk factor for depression and anxiety and the overuse of computers can have a detrimental impact on mental wellbeing. Physical sedentary behaviour has also been linked to cardiovascular problems and musco-skeletal disorders. 

Despite this, computers can also have very positive effects on people. The internet can enable access to both education and information in remote locations with limited access to physical resources and to people with reduced mobility or resources. Working online through devices such as laptops and tablets also provide opportunities to enable flexible working and improve work-life balance.

Overall, I believe itâ€™s important to set clear boundaries on computer use, both for adults and children, and to ensure that the benefits of the technology are maximised whilst avoiding the risks.

I hope readers will agree that an appropriate use of computers can bring many advantages but that cultural values must be upheld to ensure negative impacts are kept to a minimum.

Yours Sincerely, 

[Name]
