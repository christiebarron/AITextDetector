I always knew my husband and I had a connection, but it wasn't until one particular night that I truly realized just how deep it ran. 

He had come home late from work and had nabbed some Chinese takeout for us to eat. We decided to sit out in our back yard to enjoy the last of the sun's rays and the tranquil energy of the evening. We were chatting away and joking when suddenly, he jumped up and ran inside, leaving me to my own devices. 

Completely puzzled, I went in after him, but when I entered the house, I found him doubled over in laughter. It turns out, he had gone into the kitchen to get us some plates and had noticed a funny message left on our fridge by our sons. It read "Wash My Dirty Plate or Else!" 

The sight of those words was such a simple thing, but my husband's infectious laughter was enough to light up the night sky. His joy was contagious and soon I was laughing just as hard. 

We spent the rest of the night in hysterics telling jokes, swapping stories, and creating memories. That was the night I really understood the special bond my husband and I shared â€” laughter had connected us in a way nothing else could.
