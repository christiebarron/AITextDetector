Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Automation and the use of computers have become embedded in our lives, from our workplaces, homes, and classrooms.

I believe computers have largely been beneficial insofar as they support productivity and enable convenience. Computers have significantly improved the speed of our day-to-day tasks, increased efficiency, and given us access to vast amounts of information online. Thankfully, with the rise of information technology, many people are now self-sufficient and self-reliant, as computers have become indispensable to many aspects of life.

At the same time, however, computers can also have adverse effects. Exposure to prolonged blue light from the screens of computers can cause eye strain and headaches. Additionally, computing can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, as it involves long periods of inactivity with little physical activity, which can be detrimental to our physical and mental health.

I believe that the most important factor is to ensure we maintain a healthy balance between the use of computers and other activities. Computers should neither become our only source of entertainment or become our way of life.

Finally, I believe computers are here to stay and we should take a positive attitude towards them. After all, computers are useful tools that will continue to shape our future in ways we could have scarcely imagined.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
