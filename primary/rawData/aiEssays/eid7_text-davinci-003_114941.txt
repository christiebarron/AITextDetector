I recently met a girl at the park who was incredibly patient. She was walking her German shepherd and had just started to train him. She was trying to get him to understand how to walk without pulling her down the street.

I watched as she worked with her dog. She continued to be calm and encouraging with him, despite the fact that he kept getting distracted and not listening. After a few minutes he finally seemed to understand what she was asking of him, and they started walking more smoothly down the path.

I was amazed by the patience this woman showed in dealing with her pup. I was also tremendously impressed by how determined she was to not lose her temper despite the difficulty she was facing. Her patience and understanding made me feel so inspired. I'm sure her pup was able to sense that she was calm and felt secure, making it easier for him to learn.

It was an amazing reminder for me to always stay patient and understanding in situations where I'm having difficulty. This girl was a true inspiration and I know that with her patience, her pup will turn out to be an amazing companion.
