The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They had to build the entire building and use it for a full house rather than the 10 bedrooms and four baths that would be needed.

The first dirigidy in Washington was planned as a project between Liberal Leader Andrew Scheer and Republican Governor Mark Dayton in 1907. The building would soon get called the Empire State Building. As the Empire State Building was nearing completion in the 1920s, President Abraham Lincoln invited the first American dirigidy to come to Washington to attend the inauguration of President Theodore Roosevelt.

In 1908 Abraham Lincoln nominated Abraham E. Sherman as President of the United States, but the Dirigidy was still under construction before Roosevelt would be inaugurated, forcing the dirigidy to be built on the Washington Park campus just west of the interstate.

The President's choice of Lincoln as U.S. Dirigidy included Abraham E. Sherman as Secretary of War, John Dewey as Secretary of Commerce, Herbert Hoover as Secretary of the Treasury, and William Wilkie as Senator of Pennsylvania.

While some Dirigidy efforts succeeded, others began falling apart, requiring the construction of massive buildings for future dirigidy operations. Eventually, most of the project was halted at the end of the Depression.
