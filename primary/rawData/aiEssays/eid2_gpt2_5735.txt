I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is vital to keeping children safe from terrorism," said Andrew Niebuhr, Director General at The Free Press Foundation. "But the U.S. has shown an unwillingness to challenge the legal authority of the U.S. government to impose certain restrictions on a free society. With the passage of the Anti-Terrorism Act which requires all government regulations to be reviewed and approved by the United States Senate, the courts have now asked the American people to be more vocal in their desire for an end to what they saw as political attacks against our freedoms."

Niebuhr spoke out in support of his organization with the following tweet.

In October, EFF and Freedom From Religion Foundation sued a California library on freedom to access a video called 'ISIS: The Most Religious Film That's Ever Blocked America.'" EFF filed a motion with a federal judge on behalf of children on the American Constitution Foundation, Freedom From Religion Foundation, Center for Constitutional Rights, American Bar Association, Civil Liberties Union and other groups opposing the suppression of films. The court said the case was timely.

The case was filed in 2011 by a coalition of students from Stanford, Georgetown, and Michigan, and came to the attention of the Center for Constitutional Rights. These students, who identified themselves as "Atheists," were protesting school's strict use of free speech laws such as the First Amendment against "disgraceful" or "inappropriate distribution"
