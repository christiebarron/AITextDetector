For example, in Greenwich Village, the public library has one officer designated "the designated 'person of interest' and another designated 'person of interest' at the front desk, and a third designated [person of interest] at the back desk." The list can grow to three when the new system is rolled out.

The other person designated, "the official library officer whose duties must be to ensure and protect, and to serve the public's safety, the library system's independence and national security interests while simultaneously being a strong supporter of and supporter of the arts," were listed to occupy six positions. One of them was used for writing a letter to the director of the Boston Center for Scholars. Another, who has no formal duties, was used for "rethinking" the Boston Library's history.
