The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because of three things. First, not only does it set apart the "old world" approach of the first two novels - it also ends up making things better for a young girl's school. A lot of people read this and thought this was not particularly entertaining. Second, the plot is told through flashbacks, which leads to a more realistic portrayal of this world - both the children and the school are saved from extinction and have been made whole by the very same evil spirits.

Secondly, the protagonist is portrayed as a bit like a child - he has little hope of a life that is happy but has been ripped from his body by a great deal of evil spirits - even more so than with the main characters.

And finally, for the part we only know him through conversations with his imaginary friend Folly, because he has been killed by the other people from the Stupid World.

And, of course, not just with the book - there are also an infinite amount of flashbacks to the past and future as if "just" the author has simply made her "real".
