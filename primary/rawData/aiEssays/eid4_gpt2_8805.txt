The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because its opening is very much a collection the author's personal thoughts and feelings about the story in general. There are no great philosophical revelations or great philosophical debates, but the fact that the chapters present interesting examples gives me a sense of the strength of this book. In short, you should check out the ending.


The main problem with this book is the lack of an emotional punch to it. Some parts of the journey are very emotional and emotional. This also helps in getting over. The book is also rather dull. We don't have to spend all our effort on being the heroine, much less the protagonist. However, our main characters are not there. It's impossible to follow them, and a lot of these characters end up not being there at all.


While there is some of this (or a lot of this too) in this book, it's not great on any level. It lacks both charm and depth but it's not at all deep and at times not interesting at all. I think maybe that's because there are only a handful of places to go in this book. It's the end. It has the depth I expected from most stories of this genre, but if you start to get over the initial feeling that you aren't important in the story it's kind of hard to get over so I felt it was much better paced than anything else.


I should mention that I enjoyed this story.
