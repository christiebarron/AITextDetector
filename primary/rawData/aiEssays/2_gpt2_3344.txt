I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a violation of copyright," said a spokesman for the New York State Library Association. ''I understand that some people have done that.''

The NYSCA has issued its own guidelines for copyright law, which it says reflect the law on this and other countries ''which apply a less stringent standard in cases of infringement.''

But in a statement released this month to The Post, the council's legal staff said that the guidelines ''tend directly to the protection and welfare of individuals exercising their right to a fair use.''
