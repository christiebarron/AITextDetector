The ending of the poem serves to emphasize the narrator's hope for a better future. The imagery of the melting snow, returning geese, and budding hibiscus are all symbols of renewal and rebirth. These symbols contrast with the winter season which is traditionally seen as a time of sadness and depression, especially in the narrator's case due to her struggles with an academic test. By ending with the narrator's desire to take the same test again in the spring, it conveys a sense of optimism and hope that things can and will get better.
