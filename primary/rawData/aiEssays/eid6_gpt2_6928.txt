The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

In 1924, California's governor declared that the state could not build a tower of this type for public use without the permission of the builder.

More recently the California Supreme Court ruled that public domain buildings should be allowed in the California Constitution. Some say that the Supreme Court has no authority to determine the constitutional status of dirigibles.

Another problem is that the building may appear to be owned by two different owners.

One owner is the owner of a private residence, the other owner of a public property. If the two owners do not agree on a building, the building is deemed a "public use" by the other owner.

In the 1960 GE Building Act, President Gerald R. Ford said, "In order to maintain a public use of the building without the consent of both owners, the building must be owned by the owner of the building." Other cases allow for eminent domain to make the building a public use.

In 2001, a San Francisco judge ruled that the builders had the right to build a second state structure on the site of the former General Motors factory because of two owners. The court agreed with that ruling that the court was acting under a public trust law that prohibited building a new public-private arena.

The Supreme Court ruled in 1999 that the public use requirement did not prevent the construction of a new building.
