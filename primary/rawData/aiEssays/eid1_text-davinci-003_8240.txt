The Empire State Building was built in 1931 as a marvel of architectural design. It was the first building to have over 100 stories and became a symbol of American prosperity. In order to make the Empire State Building even more remarkable, the builders wanted to include docking for dirigibles. However, the inclusion of docking for dirigibles came with numerous obstacles.

The first obstacle was the location of the Empire State Building and the city of New York in general. New York has a number of other tall buildings, bridges, and other structures that could potentially interfere with dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building. Furthermore, the windy conditions of New York posed another challenge, as strong winds can be hazardous for dirigibles. The windy conditions of New York, in addition to the tall structures, made it difficult to determine the exact height and width of the city that would be safe for dirigibles to navigate.

The second obstacle was the height of the Empire State Building. At 1,454 feet, the Empire State Building was too high for a dirigible to dock at the buildingâ€™s rooftop. This meant that if a docking solution was to be created, it would have to be designed such that the dirigible could dock safely and securely on an alternate level.

The third obstacle was the weight of the dirigibles. Dirigibles require large amounts of helium or hydrogen gas to stay afloat, meaning that the dirigibles are very light
