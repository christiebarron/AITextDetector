The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' may be the same as in "From the Fence, From the House", but with the added bonus of being written by her mother as well.

In addition to helping with the story's focus on the mother, Mrs Smith is considered "a model of the girl most beloved by the world and the most popular celebrity in the world!"

According to The Star, the book is due out February 5th.
