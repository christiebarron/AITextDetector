I was recently helping my elderly grandmother move into a new home. She had been struggling to keep up with taking care of her old place, so we knew it was time for a change. But my grandmother is not someone who is easily convinced. She gets very set in her ways and doesn't listen to anyone else's opinion.

We had been going back and forth about different house options for weeks. It seemed like no matter how many places we looked at, she just wasn't having it. My patience was really being tested, but I tried my best to remain understanding and tolerant. I kept reminding myself how much this move mattered for her future and that it was important for me to be patient.

Finally, after the umpteenth visit to a new potential home, my grandmother said she liked the place. We spent the next couple of weeks figuring out the logistics of the move and transitioning her furniture and belongings over. 

It was a lot of work but I'm glad I was able to stay patient throughout the entire process. It was definitely a reminder that things can work out if you just take the time to be kind and understanding.
