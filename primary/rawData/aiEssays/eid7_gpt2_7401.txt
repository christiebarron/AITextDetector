An example of a time someone in my life was patient was at the hospital. I have to take care of all my family members. When I am away from my home and my family members are sick, I don't have a good time with my friends, friends that I know at home. So now that I am here I need people that are sick, people that are not sick.

This is not the first time that I have had to go in for an ER stay.

How long do you think it takes for an ER to be able to say they're here?

If you have an ER, we are trying to fill our beds for you until the point we need more beds. Our team of nurses are here to help you, so please be patient.

I'm guessing that's why you're coming from New York?

Not exactly. We are in the Bronx, so there's a few more stops I can think of in the vicinity. But we are in Brooklyn and you would've thought we would. But we have a great staff and that's why we're here. It's a great community, where we have a great job, which is what you want at your hospital so that you will feel well and comfortable there.

Any updates on your schedule? Are you happy?

I am not. I have been enjoying my time here. We are in the hospital about 5 different days. It's such a wonderful day
