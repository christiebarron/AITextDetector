The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it goes through a lot of changes, but alsoirginizing and turning into a girl-in-the-making.  You could use this as a reference to some other books like Puella Magi Madoka Magica or Star Wars.  It's also possible to go back to a different book as well or write your own version of this to add some new ideas, so it's a really interesting read. But again, a very big change, just like the above books. 
I'd be remiss if I didn't say I did love this story and the author (or her boyfriend) who published it.  One good mention I could get from her was that her best friend is a pretty bright and talented girl.  She was able to figure this out for herself the next day and the next day, not as a reader but as something very cool to see happen, something to do at school and maybe even in my house.  Not to mention I love that her parents are kind in their time and have many things on my mother's mind (they did talk about the idea of finding some romance books and that I had such a blast doing so).
Of course there's a few people out there who have not read the book before now and I know this is my own.  One of me has been so lucky to have someone I know as close as I am to write what I do and
