I remember it like it was yesterday. I had a close friend from college who I used to chat with all the time. We would talk about anything and everything under the sun. We would make jokes and laugh together about silly things, especially in the middle of stressful assignment deadlines.

One day we were on a video call and the conversation had been dragged out a bit longer than usual. We’d been talking for a good hour or so about different topics; when I finally mentioned that I had to go and finish some work. That’s when the laughter started.

My friend started with a slow chuckle and then increasingly got louder and louder. Pretty soon, I couldn’t hold it in anymore. I started laughing with her. We laughed so hard that tears were streaming down our faces. I felt so relieved and happy that we were both able to be in such good spirits despite all the stress that was going on.

Our laughter was contagious, and we were laughing together for what felt like forever. I’ll never forget that moment between us and all the other times we made each other laugh. That moment was a special reminder that laughter can solidify relationships and truly bring people together. It’s the shortest distance there is.
