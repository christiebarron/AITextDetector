The building of the Empire State Building in New York City was a major engineering project during the 1930s. One of the most interesting features of the building was the project to build an aerial mooring mast, which would allow docking of dirigibles—the large passenger-carrying airships of the time. Despite the ambitious plans, the construction process faced numerous obstacles.

Material was one of the biggest obstacles to building the Empire State mooring mast. The materials needed for the mast included four massive steel mooring cables, which initially proved difficult to acquire. Before these were found and purchased from the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, the costs of procuring materials caused a major delay in the construction project.

Design was also a major impediment. The mooring mast itself had to be tall and strong enough to hold a large dirigible—but it also had to shut down so that strong winds would not blow it onto the building itself. Initially, engineers encountered difficulties installing the pneumatic cylinders needed to open and close the mast. To solve this problem, they had to design an additional large protective dome to house the cylinders, adding complexity to the design.

Safety was another issue, since the mast was a very tall and dangerous structure. To prevent accidents from occurring, engineers had to add both guides and a fence along the sides of the mast to keep the dirigible away from the building, as well as additional cables and lightning rods to dissipate the
