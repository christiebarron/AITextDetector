I was walking down the street with my best friend. We had been friends since we were children, and we always found something to laugh about.

One day, we were walking and talking when, out of the corner of my eye, I noticed something strange. It was a weird, colorful bird perched on the window of a building.

My friend immediately said, “Let’s go talk to the bird!” I laughed and replied, “What in the world would we even say?”

So, we approached the window and knocked on it. The bird just stared at us, but something in its expression made us laugh. We asked it silly questions, like “Where did you learn to fly?” and “Do you like worms?” and it kept staring at us.

We both started to crack up, and that made the bird tilt its head to the side, just as if it was joining in the fun. It made us laugh even harder.

We returned to the same spot the following day, hoping to find the bird again, but it was gone. However, I’ll never forget that day we spent with the bird and laughing until our sides hurt. It was one of the most special moments of our friendship.
