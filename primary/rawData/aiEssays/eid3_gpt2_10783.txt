Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

Tuning: The 'Rough Road Ahead' feature will offer two ways to control the device – turning it either on or off without the cyclist's knowledge or permission – or starting it off in one direction.

Cycleparking: The use of cycling parks and cycling routes.
