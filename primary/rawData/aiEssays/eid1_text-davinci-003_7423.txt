The author of Winter Hibiscus, Minfong Ho, is trying to convey a theme of resilience and hope. The protagonist, Linny, was disappointed to learn she had failed her exams and had to leave school in the winter. The passage suggests that although she may feel defeated at the moment, she will have the opportunity to try again when the conditions are more favourable. The image of the hibiscus budding symbolises hope and new beginnings and suggests that in the spring, Linny can begin again and take the test with more confidence and determination.
