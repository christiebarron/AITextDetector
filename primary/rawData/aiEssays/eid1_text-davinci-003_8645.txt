I was sitting in a restaurant with my brother, when the waiter came over and asked us for our order. When he heard my brotherâ€™s request, he cracked a joke and we both started laughing. We laughed so hard and for so long that it felt like we had known each other for years. We shared stories about our childhood, made funny faces at each other, and laughed until our sides hurt.

The other diners in the restaurant started to look at us with curiosity and smiles. We felt like we had taken the whole restaurant with us on this unexpected and joyful ride. People started to join in with their laughter, until the restaurant was full of mirth and hilarity.

When the waiter finally came back with our order, he commented on how good it was that laughter could bring people together in such an unexpected way. We agreed, thanked him for the service, and as we left, we exchanged a glance and smiled. That moment is one I'll always cherish, not only because our meal was delicious but because of the simple reminder that laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people.
