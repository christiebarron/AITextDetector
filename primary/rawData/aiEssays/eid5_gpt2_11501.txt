The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is that "the life I took in life isn't always that good."

"You are born good and poor and it always takes you some time to recover. But, no matter how well you stay healthy, you are always good. You are a real champion. It takes nothing from you. You will never be bad."

Bobby's journey to success and happiness is an example of what he calls a "very personal road."
