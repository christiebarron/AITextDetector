I believe that censorship of materials in libraries and museums is a way to keep the word out of libraries and museums for personal gain. It also helps to keep things from being used as an excuse for mass abuse of people who have little interest in the subject, and are thus subject to all kinds of horrible negative stereotypes. But censorship, in my opinion, would not be the only problem. I am talking about the way I feel that a government should act on the needs of their citizens, especially when they want information about those citizens not to be used by the government.
            If I had my own money, I could use it to buy a house, get a wife, but that wouldn't make them any longer family or money; it would only make them less relevant and more useless to my life. I wouldn't feel any longer at my home as if the government were doing real harm because I did not have as much money or my health or my education at all.
            They wouldn't like me because they think that I am making money from the government. I think they hate me because I am putting on some sort of facade of me wanting to make money, for a variety of reasons. They also have a problem because their primary purpose is to make money for the government, and that is to hide the fact that they are being a total taxpayer of government resources.
