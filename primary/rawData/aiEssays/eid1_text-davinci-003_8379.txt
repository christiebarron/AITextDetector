I remember the time I was going through a really tough patch in my life. My job was unreliable, my finances were in turmoil, and my relationships were strained. It was the kind of situation where it felt like everything was caving in on me.

One day, I was out at a restaurant having dinner with a close friend, and everything just kind of spilled out of me. I was so overwhelmed and upset that I ended up breaking down into tears. 

My friend did not try to rush me or tell me to pull myself together. Instead, they just held my hand and offered me a tissue. They stayed with me until I was composed again.

Through that simple gesture, my friend showed me how to be patient. They allowed me to go through the emotions I was feeling, without trying to force me into a certain state of mind. It was an incredibly meaningful moment and demonstrated to me the power of patience.
