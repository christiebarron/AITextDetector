The features of the setting in 'Rough Road Ahead' by Joe Kurmaski, are a major influence on the cyclist's experience throughout the story. The type of terrain is especially important, as the cyclist is described as 'fighting desperately against a steep, relentless climb'. This suggests that the cycling is physically demanding, as the cyclist is struggling due to the incline of the terrain. To make matters worse, the terrain is also described as 'rock-strewn', which suggests that the surface is uneven and potentially dangerous. This creates a more difficult challenge for the cyclist, as they must navigate the obstacles while managing their energy and efforts.

Additionally, the setting of the story is a rural mountainous area. While such a setting may appear picturesque, it also suggests a lack of resources or a lack of infrastructure to help the cyclist. This implies that the cyclist must rely solely on their own strength and resourcefulness to reach their destination. Furthermore, the rural nature of the setting may create feelings of loneliness and isolation for the cyclist, who is likely used to the support and supplies available in urban areas. 

Overall, the features of the setting in 'Rough Road Ahead' by Joe Kurmaski strongly affect the experience of the cyclist. The terrain is physically demanding and potentially dangerous, and the rural environment is lacking in resources or assistance. All these aspects create a challenging and daunting journey for the cyclist, which they must overcome to reach their destination.
