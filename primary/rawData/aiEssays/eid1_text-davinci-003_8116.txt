The Mooring Mast was a specialized feature allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building, a feat that was unprecedented at the time. But builders had to overcome multiple obstacles to make this unique engineering achievement possible and safe.

The first challenge presented to the construction team was finding a way to make something as large and as heavy as a dirigible stay in place atop the building. The solution they decided upon was to install a giant steel mast, known as the Mooring Mast, that would be able to hold the tremendous weight of the airship. The design of the Mast included a winch that ran from the top of the building through the interior to the roof lobby, allowing winch operators to maneuver the dirigible and keep it partially tethered.

The next obstacle to overcome was to create a structure strong enough to withstand the strong winds the dirigibles experienced at such high altitudes. The Empire State Building's designers created a unique triangular frame structure that was elastically rigid, strengthened by the addition of spring struts. This frame acted as an anchor for the Mooring Mast and allowed it to stay in place despite the powerful gusts of wind.

Finally, the designers had to make sure the Mooring Mast was safe to use. To accomplish this, a system of brakes and tension cables was installed around the base of the Mast. This system provided additional stability and prevented the airship from shifting or sliding due to the wind.
