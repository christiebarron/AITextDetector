I believe that censorship of materials in libraries has become a form of propaganda against any other kind of independent academic subject. The main goal of censorship is in line with the aim of protecting both the individual and the group to an unspeakable extent, as they believe that if they are not censored they can never hope to be free. In fact, we have no information regarding the methods of how censorship works in any part of the country - not even in some parts of Australia.

I would like to remind you guys about the work that I do on these topics. In our opinion, this project is the only one which supports the thesis that "censorship of books and other materials is censorship of free speech". In our opinion, censorship also means censorship of personal information. The fact that this project is funded by a private corporation also makes it a bad idea. We're very aware that the information Chaffin had on some people and I didn't understand how they could get the information out of the internet, so we're working on these and I hope to do some good with that.
