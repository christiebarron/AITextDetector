To the Editor:

I write to express my opinion on the effects that computers have had on people.

In todayâ€™s world, it is hard to deny the immense impact that computers have had on our lives. From work, to business, to entertainment and leisure activities, computers have become ubiquitous in our lives.

However, there are certain aspects that worry me. I believe that the extended use of computers can have a negative impact on human behavior. It has been observed that people who frequently use computers tend to display excessive or addictive use of the technology, leading to isolation and loss of empathy. In some cases, it can even affect mental and physical health.

On the other hand, computer technology can also bring about positive effects. It can be a great aid in the education field, as schools use computers to help students learn more effectively. It can also enhance productivity in the workplace and enable businesses to reach new markets due to improved communication.

Overall, I believe that the effects of computer use depend on how it is used. If used responsibly, computers can be a great aid to our lives. It is up to us to carefully manage our exposure to technology and use it for our benefit rather than detriment.

Sincerely,
