Dear Editor,

I write to you today to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. In the past few decades, computers have become a part of everyday life, with businesses, schools, and individual households relying on them to do their day-to-day work and entertainment needs. While computers certainly have their benefits, there are several negative impacts that should not be overlooked, and I believe more attention should be paid to them.

One of the most apparent effects of computers is diminished physical activity. With the majority of our work being done on computers, people are becoming more sedentary. This can lead to increased risk of physical health issues such as obesity, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, spending an excessive amount of time on computers has also been linked to mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and addiction.

In addition, the over-dependence on computers has raised serious concerns over the lack of privacy. With the data generated from online social networks and shopping websites, personal information can easily be accessed and misused. Moreover, the internet allows people to access dangerous online content, which can have a damaging influence on young children and teenagers.

Overall, computers have bestowed many benefits upon us, but it is also important to recognize the downsides of our technological advances. We must be sure to use computers in a responsible way and ensure the safety and privacy of ourselves and our loved ones.

Thank you for taking the
