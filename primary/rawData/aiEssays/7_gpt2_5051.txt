An example of a time someone in my life was patient was our dad whose only daughter was a year pregnant. We had her at home for 10 days, her birth at 10:45am, a little bit later than my friend's daughter was having her birth, and at midnight we were walking past the house in front of my house. We just stood there in the street and they saw us and pulled us out. Our dad and I ran away into the woods. The little girl and I had a lot of things to ask them to do but we were afraid that if we lost her, there could be a family involved or we won't be able to raise her. The kids left. The little girl came onto the street, she was crying from nowhere for the whole moment and it was hard to imagine what would happen if we missed her.
