The setting in “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski plays an important role in the cyclist’s experience. The rough, winding country roads depict a sense of adventure and exploration, while the open landscapes suggest a sense of freedom and liberation. The cyclist’s journey symbolizes a maturing journey through life’s many twists and turns.

The terrain of the roads takes the cyclist through drastic ascents and descents. With each uphill challenge, the cyclist is pushed to test his own physical and emotional limits. The intense physical conditions place him in a state of humility and appreciation for the task at hand. On the other hand, the descents bring a sense of relief and satisfaction from a job well done. The combination of difficult terrain and extreme weather conditions humble the cyclist, providing peace of mind and a better understanding of his own limits.

The vast open landscapes further motivate the cyclist to push himself to the limit and explore faraway places. With no recognizable landmarks, the cyclist is undeterred by whatever is ahead, only relying on his instinct to guide him. There is a sense of appreciation for nature and the small towns the cyclist passes through, allowing him to be more in tune with the world around him.

The features of the setting continue to impact the cyclist’s journey as he weathers the unpredictable elements, pushing through with determination and curiosity. The cyclist is in constant pursuit of personal satisfaction and spiritual fulfillment
