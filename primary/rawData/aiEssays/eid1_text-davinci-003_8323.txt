I was walking down the street when I saw an old man struggling to cross the street because of a disability. He had a cane and was moving very slowly. I paused for a moment, thinking whether or not to offer my help. He was so close to the other side already, so I decided to just wait. 

As I watched, he stopped and paused several times, then slowly traversed the street with an enormous amount of effort. I waited at the crosswalk for a few minutes, not wanting to rush him and observing his amazing strength and determination. As he reached the other side of the street, he gave me a grateful smile and nodded his head in acknowledgment. In that moment, I realized the importance of being patient and understanding.
