I remember it like it was yesterday—the laughter, that is. It was my third date with the most handsome man I had ever seen, and I had a plan to show him my charming, goofy side. We had just arrived at the park, and I had a single goal in mind—to make him laugh. 

I started out with a few silly jokes, but it was no use—he just wasn’t getting into it. I tried to be witty and play to his interests, but to no avail. I was just about to give up when I had a stroke of genius. I ran to a nearby tree, grabbed a few leaves, and threw them in his face.

He looked at me, confusion written all over his face. And then he began to laugh—a deep belly laugh that lit up his face like the Fourth of July. I joined in, and before I knew it we were both collapsed in laughter, lying in the grass.

We lay there under the stars for what seemed like hours, our laughter echoing on the night air. That moment has stayed with me for years—it was the moment that I knew deep in my heart that this man would eventually become my husband.
