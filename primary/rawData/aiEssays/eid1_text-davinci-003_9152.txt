Dear Editor,

I'm writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Since computers have become ubiquitous in all aspects of culture, it's important to evaluate their impact on this generation.

For years now, many have argued that computer usage is detrimental to our society. While it's true that compulsive computer use can lead to depression and other kinds of psychological and physical issues, I believe that computers positively impact people's lives.

Computers provide us with powerful tools and resources that make our lives easier. They help us stay connected with friends, family and the world around us. Computers also provide an immense amount of data that can help us make informed decisions and enhance our productivity.

Most importantly, computers are a catalyst for creativity. Technology enables us to explore new ideas and create amazing things we never thought were possible. From software development to digital art, computers can help individuals express themselves through their own medium.

In conclusion, computers are one of the most powerful tools of our generation. They provide numerous benefits that can positively shape the lives of people.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
