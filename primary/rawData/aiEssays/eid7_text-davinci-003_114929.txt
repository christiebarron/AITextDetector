I was recently waiting in line at a very busy grocery store. I had been in line for over fifteen minutes and I was starting to get a bit impatient. Then, an elderly woman approached the line and asked if she could be let in. The person in front of me hesitated, but eventually stepped aside to let the woman into line.

At first, I was a bit annoyed that I had been forced to wait longer. But then, I realized that the woman was elderly and likely had limited mobility. I was so impressed with the kindness of the person in front of me, and I quickly decided that having a few extra minutes of patience was the least I could do.

I took a deep breath and decided to try and make the most of my extra few minutes in line. I read a book, checked my email and chatted with the person around me. Before I knew it, the elderly woman was at the register and the line had moved forward an additional 5-10 minutes.

In the end, my patience allowed me to make the most of my wait and taught me a valuable lesson in kindness and understanding. Patience is clearly an admirable quality and itâ€™s something that I can strive to practice going forward.
