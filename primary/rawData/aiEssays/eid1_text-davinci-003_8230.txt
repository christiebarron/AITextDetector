The task of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was a daunting one. From the planning stages to their construction, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a variety of obstacles preventing the safe mooring of airships atop the Manhattan skyscraper. 

The most obvious challenge was the height of the building. Standing a full 1,454 feet tall, the Empire State Building was already considered an impressive feat of engineering for its time, making it a difficult structure to build to withstand the unique forces of a mooring airship. Furthermore, the size and strength of the building’s steel frame had to be taken into account, ensuring that it could support the additional weight of an airship.

On top of these engineering challenges, the airship’s crew faced unusual binding and mooring conditions due to the unique nature of the site. In order to create a safe anchor for the airship, a specialized device called a mooring mast had to be erected atop the building. This massive steel column, standing at a whopping 116 feet, had to be placed on a relatively limited space—and it had to be just high enough so that the airship could clear other nearby buildings while in flight. 

Finally, even after the building’s planners succeeded in crafting a secure and robust mooring mast, they had to consider the challenge of high winds. Due to it’s elevation and open air
