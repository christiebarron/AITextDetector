Dear Editor, 

I am writing to voice my opinion about the effects computers have on people. It is no secret that computers have changed our lives significantly, but we must be conscious of their implications.

On one hand, computers have become invaluable in staying connected to the world. For many, they are an essential tool to access information and knowledge. This has enabled us to communicate and collaborate with people all around the world, enabling us to come together in ways that we couldnâ€™t before. 

On the other hand, computers have had negative effects on our mental health. Research has shown a correlation between excessive computer use and impaired decision making, impaired memory, distracted attention, increased impulsivity, and decreased sleep quality. These effects are particularly serious for younger individuals, as their brains are not fully developed.

It is important that we are aware of the effects of computers on our lives. We should be conscious of how much time we are spending in front of screens, and ensure that we are taking breaks and following the recommended limits. We should also be aware of how our usage has changed our day-to-day lives, and ensure that we are using computers in a way that is not detrimental to our mental health.

I am confident that if we embrace the power of computers responsibly, their effects can be consistently positive. 

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
