Censorship in libraries is a highly controversial issue. Many believe that libraries should always provide unfettered access to materials, while others are quick to call for censorship of materials that they deem inappropriate or offensive. 

It is widely accepted that censorship of libraries is inherently wrong. Everyone should have the right to access information and materials without fear of censorship. Libraries are often the only source of information for people who cannot afford to purchase books and other materials. Censoring material limits those personsâ€™ right to access information and knowledge that is not available elsewhere.

It is difficult to create a definitive list of materials that should be subject to censorship. Every person has his or her own personal standards and may be offended or disturbed by different materials.

Censoring materials also sets a dangerous precedent, as there is a risk of censorship spiraling out of control and leading to complete repression of information.
