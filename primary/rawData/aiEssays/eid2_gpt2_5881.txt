I believe that censorship of materials in libraries contributes to a system where people have a voice in decision making when it is important for them to find new ways to communicate with parents or friends, perhaps in a place like my apartment.

When I was younger I thought I was just being a kid who had no understanding of science. Now I think I am a science geek and I can use my scientific thinking to help my parents grow and become more creative and knowledgeable about their children's education.

I am also a feminist. I believe if the world were not run by men, where would women be, and where would men rule the world?
