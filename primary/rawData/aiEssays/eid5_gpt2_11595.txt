The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is a strong reminder of the challenges ahead of the Indian political scene and of an essential role the media is playing on the issue, says Madhu Shingal, India's leading expert on social media. It also highlights the need for a broad debate on "digital media," which offers a forum for discussing the cultural, political and economic power of the Indian state and the challenges associated with it.

Mudan was awarded the Pulitzer in 2013 by the New York Times

In his memoir, "From Home is," Madhu recounts stories of people whose lives have changed by using the online platform, including friends, colleagues, relatives, the public and others who have used it to document their lives. It offers a sense of the interconnectedness of the online world that many Indian and foreign bloggers still encounter, one that can lead them to some of the best writers in modern India.

In addition to its ability to tell the stories of people in critical and personal positions in the Indian political debate, Madhu's book also helps to dispel old myths about the role of "media" in Indian politics. According to his book, these myths also appear in stories circulated around the world, though most people understand the message better than to listen carefully to an old-fashioned propaganda game or the stories that they hear in other media. They are, he argues, "more likely to bring up issues that remain largely unexplained."
