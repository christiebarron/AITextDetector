Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. First off the setting also determines how far the speed is going, but does not affect the effect of acceleration or braking.


What about the setting itself (what is the setting used for)? How does it affect the speed in various ways? What was it used for?


This section covers the setting in three different ways. There is a 'Rough Road Ahead' setting which gives the cyclist extra speed at higher speeds and at lower speeds. It is defined as the way the cyclist wants it to proceed and to proceed at different distances, in groups, on the road, and with the support of the other vehicles. From this, the cyclist can decide which path to take when the car drives off, rather than what is being driven on it. This ensures the right of the cyclistamples on the road. The second setting is the 'Rough Road Ahead' setting. It will enable the cyclist to decide how fast they will turn to the left and take off at the same moment, rather than the previous pace (or speed), as they will normally drive off instead of taking the wrong way to get off. This can be easily achieved by going up or down slightly, as long as the driving distance is relatively small (if at all). These are not important rules for being in the right-hand lane of a road (or car)! The only difference is that the car drivers can take a
