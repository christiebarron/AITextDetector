The final line of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho is meant to provide hope and optimism in the face of the narrator's impending exams. By connecting the winter season, the return of the geese, and the future blooming of the hibiscus to a reappearance of strength and capabilities, Ho suggests that no matter how challenging life may seem in the present moment, everything can—and should—come back to a place of beauty and renewal. This idea is reinforced throughout the poem, with natural imagery such as the narrator's frost-rimmed hair and sunbursts, which offer a reminder of the power of life's cyclical nature. By ending the poem with these hopeful words, Ho encourages readers to find optimism and resilience in the face of any struggles or challenges they may face.
