The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock above the skyscraper. The project was a daring endeavor, and the creators of the building had to overcome numerous obstacles and challenges to make it a reality. The most significant obstacle was the need to install a 200-foot steel mast, nicknamed the “mooring mast,” at the top of the building in order to moor a dirigible in place while it landed.

The mooring mast was a complex engineering feat; not only did it need to be incredibly sturdy, but it had to be constructed and raised to the top of the building quickly and efficiently. As Marcia Amidon Lüsted explains in The Mooring Mast, engineers had to partner with a team of plumbers to construct the mast from lengths of steel pipe, drilling holes through the beams and welding them together. To raise the mast to the top of the building in such a way that it could support the weight of an entire dirigible, the designers had to attach the mast to two separate locomotive power engines and pull it up with a system of pulleys and heavy cables.

Another obstacle was the mast’s location. Dirigibles were powered by air and they needed room to maneuver in order to land safely. As a result, the mooring mast had to be positioned at the building’s highest point - the 86th floor - which meant the building
