Dear Editor,

As we enter the digital age, it is undeniable that computers have changed the way we communicate, conduct business, and even the way we think. While computers have become essential tools in our lives, they can also have a negative impact on people if not moderated properly.

For starters, computers can be socially isolating. In the past, people gathered around the dinner table or at the local store to interact with each other. Nowadays, computers create a virtual world where people are no longer required to meet face-to-face, limiting meaningful human interaction. Additionally, with the widespread of virtual activities such as online gaming, people are increasingly spending more time engaging in solo activities than they are spending meeting and talking to others. 

Moreover, spending too much time with computers can lead to physical health problems. By sitting in one place for extended periods of time, computer users are more prone to suffering from various health issues such as neck and back aches as well as vision problems. While modern technology has been successful in providing convenience for many tasks, extended using of computers can be detrimental to a person’s physical wellbeing. 

Nevertheless, computers are a valuable tool that should be utilized wisely and in moderation and using them in a responsible manner can have positive influxes to both individuals’ lives and our society as a whole.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
