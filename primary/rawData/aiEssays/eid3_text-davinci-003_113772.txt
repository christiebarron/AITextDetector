The setting is a major factor in Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead” as it has a significant impact on the cyclist’s experience and the overall tone of the poem. The setting is described as “rusty, broken, and cold” which creates a feeling a despair, setting a gloomy and ominous tone. This is reflective of the cyclist’s circumstance and serves to illustrate his difficult journey. The roads are “so broken that every curve seems a surprise” which reflects how hard and unpredictable the cyclist’s journey is, never being sure of what lies ahead. The fact that the roads are “scraped and pitted” emphasizes the difficulty of the journey and the challenge the cyclist must confront. This is also related to the feeling of trying to overcome obstacles, which is seen in the line “Every mountain can be climbed”. 

The fact that the skies are “dark and deep” reflects the inherent danger of the situation, representing the darkness and fear that the cyclist must confront. Moreover, the mountain mentioned in the poem is “black and large and silent”. This could be seen to represent the obstacles that the cyclist must face, such as the physical and mental hardships that must be confronted in order to reach the end of the journey.

Ultimately, the setting is integral in conveying the feeling of overwhelming hopelessness and struggle experienced by the cyclist.
