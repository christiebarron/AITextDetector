To the Editors of The Newspaper: 

In recent years, censorship has found its way into libraries and sparked debate over whether or not certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Libraries have traditionally served as a source of knowledge, entertainment, and growth for individuals. Therefore, it is extremely important that these spaces remain open to a variety of different materials in in order to ensure that this goal is properly fulfilled. 

Censorship, in many cases, can have a stifling effect on growth and education. For example, if certain books deemed “offensive” are removed from the library shelves due to censorship, this can prevent individuals from broadening their perspectives, gaining knowledge about controversial topics, and forming their own informed opinions. Furthermore, censorship can interfere with personal freedoms, as individuals should have the autonomy to decide what is or is not appropriate for them to read and consume. 

Furthermore, the censorship of material should not solely be determined by the opinion of one person or group. Material deemed offensive should only be removed after a thorough review of the entire community, with all opinions taken into consideration, and in order to protect safety or legal issues. The addition of a parent-teacher review system could be a suggested option for materials that could be deemed offensive, as this system is often utilized in schools to ensure that all students have access to suitable material.
