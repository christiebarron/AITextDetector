The building of the Empire State Building presented many unique challenges for the engineers and architects of the time, including the need to build an accommodation for dirigibles to dock. The Mooring Mast was built atop the Empire State Building in order to do just this, but the obstacles that the engineers faced in creating such a structure were numerous.

The engineering team had to contend with several issues in order to construct the mooring mast. First, the mast had to be as tall as the Empire State Building itself, standing 1,250 feet above sea level. Secondly, they had to design a secure way to attach the dirigibles to the mast given their immense size and weight. Lastly, the mooring mast was subject to severe weather and gusts of wind that could cause potential accidents, requiring the engineers to build a sturdy structure that could survive storms and turbulence.

The Titan diabolo steel rods that make up the mast were designed to be lightweight yet incredibly strong in order to resist wind shear. To ensure stability in wind, the mast was connected to the Empire State Building by two immense 72 ft steel cables. Additionally, the mast was constructed with a platform at the top, enabling crew members to have access to the dirigible when needed. This platform featured a steel “Y” shape truss for securing the mooring line to the dirigible.

Finally, to ensure the safety of the crew, the engineers designed a system that
