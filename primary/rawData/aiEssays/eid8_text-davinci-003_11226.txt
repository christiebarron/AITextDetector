I remember the first time I saw my husband laugh. We had met at a mutual friend's birthday party and while I couldn't help but be struck by his good looks, I didn't expect much in terms of conversation. It was a career-focused group and awkward silences seemed almost inevitable. 

But then one of my friends started telling a joke and the whole room erupted in laughter. Everyone was laughing except for my husband, who had a bemused, yet contemplative look on his face. It actually seemed like he had not understood the joke and was more interested in figuring it out. 

I was absolutely mesmerized watching him. He furrowed his brow and scrunched up his nose; thoughtfully pondering the punch line and then, Boom! Out of nowhere, a great big laugh that shook the entire room.

It was at that moment that I knew I was in love. All I could think was, this is the man I want to be with, even if he doesn't quite get all the jokes. That laugh was contagious and I haven't stopped laughing with him since.
