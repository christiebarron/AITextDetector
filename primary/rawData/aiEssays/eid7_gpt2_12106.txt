An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was 19. When I was a 19-year-old, a group of students and I went to picket the playground and at a park, and I told my parents that I am going to go there and have some fun, but no one stopped. I was 17 at the time and this happened because of a parent's refusal to come down to my place. I was 15 and it was so crazy, and then my friends and I went down that ramp to get to my place and I am still there.

There were some other things.

My whole life I have been the only one of those people in any one of those places who could go somewhere where you could get a little life break. And yet, when I lived in that place in the 50s and 60s and 70s I would play music all the time because it was fun. I would play rock music, I would play dance music, I would play piano. I would come on tour like it was my whole life, like that was my life and it made the song more interesting to me. The rest were so weird.

You're an indie singer and you have an album out and the record is named after you. Would you put out another record now that it's going out?

Not at all. It's a great record and we're happy to do it too.

Can you tell us
