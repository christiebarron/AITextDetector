The memoir, From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, by Narciso Rodriguez is not only an exploration of Rodriguez’s life, but it provides a deeper insight into the power and freedom of home. Rodriguez’s vivid words and imagery create a mood of warmth and familiarity, while also evoking a sense of longing and nostalgia. 

The memoir begins with Rodriguez retelling his childhood memories of his Puerto Rican-Cuban roots and the Dominican Republic, these memories paint a picture of warmth, joy, and being surrounded by his family. He reflects on the delicious smells of fresh'arepas', the independence of roaming the neighbourhood with his pigskin ball and the feeling of security of being surrounded by kin. This sense of warmth pervades throughout the memoir as Rodriguez reflects on his journey from the Dominican Republic to the United States as a child, as Rodriguez writes with such detail about his experiences, you can’t help but be filled with admiration and warmth as you read.

As Rodriguez recounts his journey to self-discovery as he adjusted and adapted to the US, he acknowledges the comfort and safety of home. While Rodriguez recounts the details of his struggle in a world that was often hostile, he does not forgo the beauty of his memories of home. He refers to his home as having a “light, mystic, misty haze”, this sentence alone gives you the warm and relaxing feeling of being home. Home for Rodriguez is
