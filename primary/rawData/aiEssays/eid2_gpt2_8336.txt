I believe that censorship of materials in libraries was only initiated by the police," he said, according to a press release.

In an accompanying story in The Diplomat, a German tabloid, the newspaper Dagbladet, published an account from the police's internal investigation as part of its story this week.

The report said a senior police officer told local officials that a case, which involved a case of child sex abuse, would be reopened in February unless there was proof that the victim had been abused by someone other than his or her parents. According to the report, the officer said the police wanted to open a case against the suspect because there was evidence that he had sexually assaulted another child.

Dobson told The Diplomat: "I personally knew someone who could be a source. We were in contact. It is a lot of paperwork, for sure."
