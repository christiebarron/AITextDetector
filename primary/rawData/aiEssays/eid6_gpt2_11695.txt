The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

The designers chose the same approach to the design of the main building site. "It's not annon-commercial space," explained E.L. Schoonmaker, the principal architect on the project, which is being led by Schoonmaker Construction, a firm headquartered in Minneapolis that focuses primarily on office buildings and large residential buildings. "But an alternative to such a major public space has become possible with this space that is open to the public while being accessible by walkways and under the city limits of Minneapolis."

After several years and nearly six prototypes on the project, E.L. announced in July 2012 that it had selected its first designer, E.L. Erikson III, to design the new city-owned parking garage. But Schoonmaker said it "remained on track" to finish the building without a redesign.

"We have worked hard to make sure that the place gets the necessary proportions to ensure our current building remains as attractive, inviting, and safe as possible and, ultimately, in keeping with the current and the public's interest," Schoonmaker said in a statement. "It's great to be working with Erikson and his innovative design team and building partners because he is a visionary architect. Our goal when this process started was to ensure we made the right decision while still putting the building on the right path to reach the right level
