The ending of the poem, "Winter Hibiscus" by Minfong Ho, emphasizes the message of perseverance and self-confidence that is threaded throughout the poem. By ending with the narrator determined to take the test again when the hibiscus flowers return, the poem reinforces the idea that a difficult challenge can be faced again with a changed perspective and a stronger sense of self-assurance. The imagery of winter's snows melting away as the geese return in the spring provides an optimistic metaphor for how the difficulties of the world can be overcome. This imagery helps to imbue the narrator's determination to succeed with a sense of optimism and hope.
