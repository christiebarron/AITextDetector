The setting in Joe Kurmaski's 'Rough Road Ahead' has a significant effect on the cyclist. The cyclist is riding along a road with harsh terrain, which makes for a challenging journey for the cyclist. The rough terrain is difficult to navigate on a bicycle, and the cyclist is forced to maintain a slow and steady speed to successfully traverse it. The lack of light on the road also harms the cyclist; without any street lamps or visibility, it is difficult to detect any potential obstacles along the road, making the journey even more challenging. 

The cyclist has to make sure they're paying attention to the road, and the cyclist must constantly be vigilant in order to avoid any obstacles or potential dangers. Furthermore, the cyclist is limited in their ability to gain speed on the road, as the terrain discourages any high speeds. This limits the cyclist, making the journey longer and more difficult than it would've been if the roads had been smoother. 

Overall, the setting of 'Rough Road Ahead' has a great impact on the cyclist. The challenging terrain and lack of visibility forces the cyclist to be extra cautious, as any mistake can have dangerous consequences. The cyclist is unable to ride at a fast speed, and must remain vigilant at all times on the long journey, making it an arduous task for the cyclist.
