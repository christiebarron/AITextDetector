The story Winter Hibiscus is about a young girl, Sylvie from Myanmar who struggles to learn English as her second language and to adjust to life in the United States. At the end of the story, Sylvie decides that she will try take the English exam again in the spring when everything around her is in bloom and new life has returned. The metaphor of the winter hibiscus is seen throughout the story - a hardy flower that struggles to survive the winter months, but still blooms. In the same way, Sylvie struggles with the cold and loneliness of being in a new place, struggling to learn English, but she still persists. The end of the story suggests that the spring will bring a period of growth and renewal to both Sylvie and the winter hibiscus. It shows that the adversity and challenges that Sylvie endured throughout the winter do not define her; instead, she has the capacity to start anew and come back strong.
