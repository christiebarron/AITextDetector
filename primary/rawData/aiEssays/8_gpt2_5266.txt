One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I ran to see you for the first time, thinking that it was so fantastic seeing you at such a beautiful time. I'd run out on the streets and see nothing but people, then hear their children sing and see you in their happy arms, a young woman and a man. In it everything was so joyful! And it was wonderful. I'll never forget all the music and the faces of people cheering as you went along, and even more than that, the people standing around you laughing through the sound of your heart breaking! Everyone loved you so much. I will always remember you, and everyone will love asking you to help them with their own journeys, for the sake of your community!

Thank you, so much, my dear young love, for those beautiful words you all shared this time on the same day last year. I feel so much gratitude to you all.

To the people who have been reading this, please hold your breath. I know it hurts to tell you, but it doesn't matter how many words you've shared, I'd definitely say thank you!
