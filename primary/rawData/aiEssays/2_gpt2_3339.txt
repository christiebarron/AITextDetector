She said she hopes to take up the fight against content owners who have made a "false" claim. "These issues are often based on false and false assumptions. And they don't necessarily end there. They just become more difficult for people to make, as their voices are often drowned out by our voices. Those are the facts," she added.

"We've been in the trenches for a very long time here, and there's actually plenty of room for debate. And it's time that we begin to talk."

I sent out a new call for students interested in learning more about what was said at UC Berkeley. It is called "Lets Talk About Our Classroom."
