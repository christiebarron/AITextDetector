An example of a time someone in my life was patient was with his family. He couldn't stay at home and watch TV or eat but we knew he couldn't afford to stay out anymore.

What does any of this mean for his wellbeing? For example. He couldn't afford to get away by walking or going home. Not only did he want to stay at home but he was so anxious that he could never sleep and he said his fears were a result of his illness.

Is he not being treated for schizophrenia?

Yes. There are significant benefits from medication but this is something that needs to be addressed to ensure that he is fully and unconditionally cared for and that he has no fear of his condition developing again afterwards. He is in no way afraid of having some sort of mental disorder, for example. There is no difference between normal people who have had their illness treated.

Are there any more questions I can ask my son?

This is what he says while waiting for his doctor to returnâ€¦
