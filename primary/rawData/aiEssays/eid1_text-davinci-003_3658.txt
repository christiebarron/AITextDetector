As technology rapidly advances and becomes more accessible, the effects of computers on our lives has only become more apparent. Computers are a necessary component of everyday life, yet their influence can be both beneficial and detrimental.

Most people are familiar with technologyâ€™s positive impacts. Computers make our lives easier through instantaneous access to information, the ability to communicate with distant friends and family, and the convenience of navigating our modern global economy. According to a recent survey, 93% of employers believe computer skills are essential for success.

However, computers have also caused a variety of behavioural problems and social issues. Recent studies suggest the overuse of technology has resulted in high rates of anxiety and depression among children and young adults. In addition, the internet has exacerbated the spread of misinformation and digital addictions, leading to negative impacts on our social lives and education.

It is essential that we consider the potential risks of using computers, acknowledge our responsibility in educating technologically literate generations, and strive to minimize issues caused by computer use. To effectively address these issues, more resources must be devoted to helping people establish healthy relationships with technology.

In conclusion, computers can have both positive and negative effects. We must remain fully aware of the potential consequences of our reliance on technology and strive to promote its use for good.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
