One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was 16 or 17 and I felt so sad about my life and my sister. My sister and I had been together for four and a half years and she had told me what I meant, which is: I'm not an idiot, I'm actually not an idiot. I wanted to kill myself now and that's all I wanted."
