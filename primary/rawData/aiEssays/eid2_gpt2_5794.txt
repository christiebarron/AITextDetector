I believe that censorship of materials in libraries are necessary to safeguard against the illegal and repressive actions of the Communist Party," the letter said.

In March 2004, Communist Party activists protested at an open-air library in Cairo in which a man was held on a conviction for insulting Islam. The group then arrested him while they were discussing "religious content," the letter adds.

Al Jazeera and other media outlets reported that a similar case happened in London in 2003. In the late 1990s, a 17-year-old girl who received a rape note from her abusive boyfriend took her to the Metropolitan Police for the rape-cursing incident, but was arrested for trying to take her to his house by posting pictures of an adult man's penis under an innocuous sign.
