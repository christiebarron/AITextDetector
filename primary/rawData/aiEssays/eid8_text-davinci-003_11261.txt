I remember when I was in college, I was hanging out with my roommate, Amanda, and a couple of our mutual friends. We were joking around and having a great time, when suddenly Amanda did something so comical that we all burst into laughter. She had started singing the wrong lyrics to the song that was playing. Suddenly we all started laughing so hard, almost shaking the room with our laughter. Her mistake was unintentional, but was so funny that we could hardly contain ourselves. 

Amanda was so embarrassed by her mistake, but she started laughing too, and then it was like a chain reaction. We just laughed and laughed, until tears were streaming down our faces. 

After that, whenever we hear that same song, or any other one with similar lyrics, we all start laughing in remembrance of that moment. In that split second, something so simple connected us and created a bond that will last long even after we have all moved on from college. 

Laughter is a powerful thing; it can make something as insignificant as messing up a few lyrics into something truly memorable and special.
