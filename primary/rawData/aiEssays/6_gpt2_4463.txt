The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The most basic of them were constraints on how much air space to allow to the engine after a collision. Many other devices, including the windshield wipers, worked fine during crash trials after the planes collided with each other.

A few notable exceptions: a former United States president who won't be making a comment; and two Russian-built airliners which landed the Soviets in the Russian Black Sea. But there are a multitude more.

"Boeing will keep us safe, no question," said John T. Meehan, president of Airbus. "Our biggest security challenge is dealing with the aftermath of these accidents."

The Boeing 747, which had one of the world's most powerful engines but faced serious delays when it plunged to the ground in the 1990s, is now the fastest-flying aircraft on record. But there's still a huge amount of work to do. There are no plans to buy an airplane by 2019 or at least two decades from now. Nor do they plan to have full commercial operations, and Boeing is not buying American cargo, as they did in 1995. It's just not practical as it was during the Cold War. But the company has worked on a number of different technologies that might be a safer option than U.S. companies, and to use them, Boeing recently paid $25 million to use the Boeing 757 as of 2010, according
