It was our first date and I could hardly contain my excitement. We had gone to the movies, but I had suggested we follow it up with a game of mini-golf. I had always enjoyed playing mini-golf and was eager to see if he was as competitive as I was.

When we got to the mini-golf course, it was almost deserted. He offered to let me go first and I eagerly took him up on it. My first shot was pretty terrible and I groaned in frustration. I was so embarrassed that he must have been thinking I was a terrible player. But instead of looking disappointed on the outside, he burst out laughing. Not a gentle laugh but a loud, hearty laugh that he couldn't contain.

His laughter was contagious and soon I was joining in as well. We were both so ridiculous as we giggled and I was so relieved that I hadn't embarrassed myself. Instead of looking silly, we had simply shared a moment of really great laughter that I will never forget. We continued to laugh throughout the whole game and I knew right then that I had found a special connection with him. That moment of laughter was the start of a beautiful relationship.
