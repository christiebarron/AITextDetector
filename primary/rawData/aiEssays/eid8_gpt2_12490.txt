One time I experienced laughter in my life was when a man called in the news with his name on a list of things he wanted my friends to know. He was asking about movies, he was asking me if I was the person who wrote the screenplay of my new novel about the characters I wanted to write about, and I never took a question. This time it was different with the story. I wrote the story down.

I told him that maybe I didn't understand all the nuances of the film. I didn't have any information, but the thing is, there are always these really complicated conversations and I just wanted to have fun. This time, I was like "Why is he telling the truth when he can't be serious about anything?" I kept trying and trying to figure out the answers to these questions and he would always be right which was frustrating because he kept asking me to do my story and you know what? I can't go on for three hours and try to explain the whole story. I always said to my friends he was doing a story about the film and if he would explain it to me I'd be happy to take his word for it.

I would say to him: No you can't. That is a lot of information.
