I was helping my roommate pack her things for her move. She was particularly stressed and overwhelmed by the amount of things she had to get done. With every box that was filled, she grew more frustrated and fatigued. I kept my composure and remained patient. Even as the hours dragged on, and I was exhausted, I knew I had to support her through this process.

I was there with her, giving her encouragement and helping her to stay focused and motivated. I offered to take food breaks since she hadn't had the chance to eat. Encouraging her to take care of herself first was more important than anything. We both worked efficiently and steadily until all her things were packed and ready to move.

Throughout the entire process, I had stayed patient and encouraging. I may have been tired from all the physical work, but I was immensely proud of myself for having kept my patience in a situation like that.
