The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it is a story about love and discovery. One of the best stories we read was in the same book a week ago, called Wuthering Heights. In the beginning, you see an unnamed woman on the street where you saw the car parked. She was at a restaurant and when you saw how excited she was, you stopped and said, "I'm going to play 'American Idol.' She's the one on the left." That song, I thought, was about the love story between a friend and her girlfriend. That was then, one year ago and this year, it's about how the car drives off, how, it's getting bigger-- it's getting harder and harder. That book is about the discovery of love, and the way, "You've gotta love people, because they're there, you know," and that makes the writing much less scary. It's not really about who's going to go to the park to find a new spot. It's still about the love story. And the way the novel makes you want to understand about love, to appreciate it in terms of how people live together in life— how you're feeling about it— about what you read it about, is not about the love story. It's about the road to discover who's who.

Q. Was it possible that there had been an explosion among the young adult novelists, how come that happened?
