Once I was invited by a close friend to dinner at his house. His mother had spent all day preparing an elaborate meal for us and I was really looking forward to it. When I got to his house, his mother greeted me with a warm hug and a big smile. She took me into the kitchen and showed me all of the food. She mentioned that the dinner was going to take a bit longer than expected due to a number of unforeseen complications but I was very understanding and patient. I reassured her that I was fine with whatever time it took for her to finish.

We went back out into the living room and waited. It took longer than expected but I didn't complain. I simply enjoyed the company and conversation of my friend. After a few hours, she finally announced that dinner was ready. We all sat down at the table and I couldn't believe the spread she'd prepared. A small part of me was still a bit frustrated due to the wait, but I was happy to have the meal and grateful for my friend's mother's hard work. I showed my gratitude to her with compliments about the food and thanked her for her patience.
