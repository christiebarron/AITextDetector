The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it brings some of the best storytellers in the world together, which adds some interesting new characters and a few fun new story lines. It also gets to the heart of that book and has some great characters who I thought would make an interesting addition to the collection that goes up in price. What I didn't expect was the kind of series which takes place in a time which is very important to the overall story.

The cover itself is gorgeous, the artwork is as beautiful as it gets so it could really be used in a movie. However for me all those 'bad guys' were actually created by those who were already a part of my favourite anime franchises. I'm sure that the book would be very well received within my collection and it would be one of the best anime releases I've EVER seen.

The artwork for Volume 2 also is spectacular, there are lots of beautiful, beautiful color choices showing off all the backgrounds. Volume 2 ends with a beautiful set of three mountains which are very impressive and even more so in an actual setting like Snow White's palace. The main character in this series who is featured in the second part of the book is the Princess of Wales. This is her sister who is the first half of Volume 2. If you're looking for an original story, this is your chance to find it. Snow White is in her first season and is on course for her debut while she's waiting
