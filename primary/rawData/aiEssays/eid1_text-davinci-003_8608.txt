I was recently visiting some old friends for a weekend away. We were all relaxing on the back deck, sipping drinks and discussing our lives, when one of us made a joke about our group of friends being so 'happy and successful' these days. Everyone started to laugh, and I could feel the laughter bubble up out of my stomach as I tried to keep a straight face.

The joke was a little mean-spirited, but the way the group reacted to it made it all the more hilarious. We all shared a moment of solidarity, laughing together about how far we'd come in the past couple of years. That sense of camaraderie was contagious and lingered in the air long after the laughter faded away.

I felt a connection with everyone as my laughter settled down to a smile, and I think that moment sparked something between us all. We could all feel the energy between us that had been created by that statement and the laughter that followed it. We shared a bond that might not have been possible without that moment of laughter, and it’s something I’m grateful to have experienced.
