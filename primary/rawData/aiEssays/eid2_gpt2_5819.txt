I believe that censorship of materials in libraries and other places is a dangerous and pervasive aspect of the Internet. The First Amendment and its protection over content must be balanced against the government's legitimate authority to restrict or restrict speech and expression." But as David Boies, editor of New York Magazine, observed, "Many of the most prominent anti-censorship advocates of our time are anti-technology opponents."

Perhaps it was the book's final critical remark that struck me most:

I write often of those who, while at home, find the most disturbing content, as a result of their personal viewing habits. They believe that they should not view "content that comes from a political party." Their work has been found shocking and disturbing in several places, including, most recently, the Washington Post, which is now so reprehensible that its editors are being imprisoned and in prison for "shouting threats and making threats that might harm others."

I am saddened to learn of a book published in January 2016 called "Don't Be Afraid," the cover of which said "The Internet is a great place for people to talk, but that we need to have a free Internet" and that "People's Lives Matter at our national, national and local level need to demand open Internet access and a debate about the kind of information that should be freely, legitimately allowed in our public places."

But these are the facts, at the time, and it is troubling to read them again.
