Computers have many effects on people. There are things they can do; you may not have access to the same thing one day, for instance. One of those things that I was trying to do was make a very clever way to have a "golf buddy" who can always play a card. He has to play at least two at most. He'd take the same number, play cards, play golf and they'd all find out who's playing the other day and what's the one and who's the other, and just let me make a special friend of mine who always looks after golf.

Q This was a very very simple setup with only two golf buddies sitting next to each other, but then this one was very interesting. At one time this guy was a friend of mine, and they played a couple of games together. He told me there were three people who'd come into the meeting. What kind of friends do you give yourself and how do they get to know each other like friends, right?

A We've also got a lot of people who get to know each other. We have a special relationship with many people who are friends of mine, and we also have a regular set of friends we all play with when we're at dinner. But as someone who is also a family man, I think it's an interesting relationship to have. Iives and me, we can all talk about our hobby and talk about other things where we need to talk
