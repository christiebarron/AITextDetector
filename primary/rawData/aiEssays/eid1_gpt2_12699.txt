Computers have many effects on people. This is not to say that they don't also control their actions. But we can make an assumption about the things that matter to an individual. (Think of the person who will tell you it's bad when she makes a mistake after a conversation) But if she and you both act in the same way, things will change, and we will have a better understanding of what's making our interactions and perceptions different.

It's only natural, that way everyone will be aware of the impact something has already had on them. In a more ideal world people would feel empowered to do both – to express themselves. We understand that a change would make things better – even if it's just a temporary drop in the bucket or small tweak in remix. But as time runs out we will run the risk of seeing a lot of changes in people, as opposed to just one. The end result is that no matter whether you want to do it yourself in our world or others', if you don't do it yourself and don't understand what it means now and if you don't feel strongly enough about what you've seen then don't. You will grow.
