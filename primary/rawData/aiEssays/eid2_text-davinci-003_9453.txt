Censorship is an important and much debated issue that deserves attention, especially in the context of libraries. Libraries are a place of knowledge, culture, and growth, and while certain materials may be deemed offensive by some, they should remain available to Library patrons.

The American Library Association (ALA) has been an arbiter of censorship issues since its creation in 1876 and is the most reliable source for information to combat censorship. While its mission is to provide access to information to every member of society, that access comes with a caveat that an individual library can decide what is or is not appropriate for its users. This means libraries can decide to cover topics deemed offensive based on their discretion and responsibility to their community. 

In the case of libraries removing materials that are deemed offensive, this is a slippery slope, as it is subjective and liable to change on a whim unless the library enforces an audit process with clear policies on what can and cannot be presented. With censorship, some libraries will reluctantly accept the removal of books and other material that are offensive to some patrons, while others will remain steadfast in their belief that all materials should remain available. 

Censorship restricts the right of individuals to access information. It can result in books being removed from the shelves, magazines not being stocked, and movies that are only available on streaming services. This prevents library patrons from accessing materials that they might find informative or entertaining, removing the freedom of choice of what to read
