The author ends the poem with this thought to emphasize the main point of the poem - that one should take life as it comes and not let fear of failure hold them back. Despite the challenges of the harsh winter and the difficult test ahead, the protagonist is determined to take the test again when spring comes. The imagery of the returning snow geese and budding hibiscus further shows the promise of a new beginning and the determination to try again.
