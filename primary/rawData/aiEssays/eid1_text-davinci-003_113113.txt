Dear Editor,

It is indisputable that the introduction of computers into our lives has massive beneficial effects. From making life simpler and easier to boosting communication and productivity, computers have already transformed the way we live. However, there is a darker side to this technological revolution that we all must consider. 

As we become increasingly reliant on computers for day-to-day tasks and activities, our personal relationships and social interactions may suffer, and our well-being may be put in jeopardy. With the amount of time most of us are now spending in front of screens, our physical health is suffering from lack of exercise and exposure to outside air. We may also be losing our ability to effectively interact and communicate with others in person. 

On a deeper level, we are facing the danger of losing the unique part of our humanity and replaced with a robotic-like, more efficient but emotionless way of life. Is this really the kind of technology we want our children to be exposed to?

With these things in mind, I am proposing a more mindful approach to computer usage and the embracing of technology while taking precautions to protect our social, emotional and physical health. I urge readers to reconsider the amount of time they spend on computers and to find other ways to connect with family, friends, and nature.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
