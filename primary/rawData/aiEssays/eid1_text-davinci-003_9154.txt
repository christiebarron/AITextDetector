Dear Editor,

I'm writing to express my opinion about the effects computers have on people. The rapid development of technology has brought us rapid advances in computers. With this, comes an increasing reliance on computers, which has caused major impacts on individuals and our society. 

To begin with, computers enable us to interact with people from all around the world. Through the use of emails and social networking, we can communicate with anyone, regardless of distance. This has allowed us to learn about different cultures, gain new perspectives, and form relationships with people we would never have encountered before.

On the other hand, however, excessive exposure to computers can be both harmful and addictive. There are a growing number of people who are spending too much time on their computers, resulting in physical and mental illnesses. Computers are also having an impact on our language and form of communication. People are becoming increasingly reliant on autocorrect, resulting in a lack of knowledge of proper spelling and grammar.

In conclusion, I believe that computers are a helpful tool when used in moderation. It is always important to remember to take regular breaks from the computer and to remain socially active. Only then can we reap the benefits computers have to offer.

Sincerely,
[Your name]
