I went on a blind date with a guy I had met online. From the moment we greeted each other, I knew there was a special connection between us. He had a great sense of humor and we were able to make each other laugh.

At one point during the conversation he made a joke that I found particularly funny. I couldn't help myself and burst into laughter. He immediately saw the funny side to the joke and started laughing too.

We were both in tears from laughing so hard. This moment brought us so close to each other in such a natural and effortless way. It was like the ice had been broken and from that moment on, we both felt more relaxed and comfortable with each other. We ended up going out for a few more dates and eventually went on to become great friends. 

It was through laughter that we connected on such a deeper level, and I'm so grateful for that unforgettable moment.
