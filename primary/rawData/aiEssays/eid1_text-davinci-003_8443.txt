I recently experienced one of the most difficult times of my life and it was a true test of my patience. I received news that one of the closest members of my family - my grandmother - had been diagnosed with an advanced and progressive form of cancer. It was a very distressing time for me as I was incredibly close to my grandmother and I felt helpless in this situation, not knowing how to help or even where to begin. 

My mother and father were absolutely devastated, as this was a really hard time for them. As hard as it was for me, I knew it was much harder for my parents. They were suddenly faced with the possibility of losing their own mother and it was too much to bear.

In the weeks that followed, I could see that my parents were struggling which in turn caused me more pain. I wanted more than anything to make things easier, to remove the pain that they were feeling. 

So I did what I knew I had to do in that moment. I embraced patience. I put aside my own pain and sorrow and focused solely on my parents. This was by no means easy, as I sometimes felt like my own needs werenâ€™t being met. I reassured my parents, I gave them my unconditional love, I was there for them whenever they needed me and I showed them that I was strong enough to handle this difficult ordeal.

Despite this being an emotional time, my own patience held me together and
