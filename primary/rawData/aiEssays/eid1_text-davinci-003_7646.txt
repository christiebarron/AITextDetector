Minfong Ho ends Winter Hibiscus with this line to illustrate a sense of hope and renewal. The narrator cannot change the fact that she failed the test, but she hopes to take it again in the spring, when things will be brighter and better. The line also conveys the idea that despite the bad news of her test results, the cycle of life goes on - the snows melt, the geese return and the hibiscus will begin to bud. This symbolizes the idea of rebirth and that hope is always present. This suggests that despite current struggles, one should remain optimistic and continue on as the cycle of life renews itself.
