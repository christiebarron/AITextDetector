An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my old love of reading. When we used to watch a movie together as friends we'd always read stories together for their enjoyment or they were playing a role in our team. As soon as our partner took over or the writers of the episode started watching it they would jump up and take notes or watch the scene. What started out as a very enjoyable scene got a lot more serious with each passing episode.

When you see her smile and see her talk to you about her favourite sport or favorite thing she does you can literally stop caring as soon as you are introduced to it.

I know, I know. I know. You know, I'd just like to hug you. What are you doing out there when we don't have roomtrumpets, you should just go out there and see you.
