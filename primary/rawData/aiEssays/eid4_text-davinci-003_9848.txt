The ending of the poem provides closure and contemplation to the protagonist's journey throughout the poem. It is a reflection of her perseverance and willingness to persist even when times look dire. She uses the symbolism of the hibiscus, a winter flower, to represent her own inner strength and courage despite the challenges of winter. In the end, she finds hope in the idea that spring will return, bringing new life and a chance to try again. The metaphor of the flight of the geese serves to remind the protagonist (and the reader) that in life, though there may be hardships, there is always hope for a better tomorrow.
