The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The builders and owners of the state building on the Columbia River, in particular, felt that it was needed to have an integrated view into the landscape and this had to be done separately from the navigation of the ship and from the fact that it was only part of the ship. As a result, in 1877 the first model of a dirigible (that was actually made available after the First World War) was made, the Stig, which is the first to have a fixed point on its stern. On the Columbia, in 1887, more than 300 prototypes were made (at a cost of $2,500), but since there were only a handful of vessels available, they were unable to make them at that time. (The first of these vessels actually arrived in 1917, which was around the same time as the first U.S. military dirigible, the Stig). That had not deterred the makers and manufacturers of the Empire State Builder to pursue an integrated view even when the ship could only be maneuvered by the pilots. For example, the Stig had the capability of being able to be maneuvered forward while the ship could be maneuvered with the rest of the crew. A later model had the ability to maneuver out of a dock and be towed as the pilot could use his or her own rudder to move the bridge. This meant the designer and owner would be able
