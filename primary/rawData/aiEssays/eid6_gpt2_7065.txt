The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, many of the dirigibles were to be built outside of the confines of their construction, while others were to be built in the U.S. and to be positioned in places other than the Empire State Building. It was not uncommon for a "big one" to be constructed outside the confines of the Empire State Building. While a large building could be built in any other country in Europe (for example, in Austria), "grandmother" domes could not be built in the U.S. (which required a large domical tower to be erected at the site). Finally, a large building would almost certainly have to be constructed outside the Empire State Building in addition to the Empire Building; these requirements may have been met, but did not translate from production to installation.

The Empire State Building was built around five skyscrapers in the middle of the 19th century, all of them built from a state of construction. The tallest tower, completed in 1936 at the ageConde, was 6,300 feet in height and was about 11 miles long. The Empire State Building stood 4,000 feet above sea level (which was about 12 miles above the coast) and contained an original six-story building. Its exterior was covered with hundreds of windows, covered with iron sheeting, and covered with glass. The building was designed to be viewed on a high-resolution (2
