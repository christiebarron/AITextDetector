The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski have a huge impact on the cyclist. The setting is described as a “dark, twisty mountain road” with “rugged terrain” and “loose rocks”. This terrain is difficult to maneuver and presents a significant challenge to the cyclist. The terrain requires the cyclist to be physically and mentally strong, both in terms of balance and in terms of strategizing for the best route. Even the smallest mistake could cause a crash.

The darkness of the mountain road also impacts the cyclist. In addition to the physical challenge presented by the terrain, the darkness makes it more difficult to navigate safely. The cyclist is constantly faced with surprises from unseen obstacles. The dark also amplifies the sound of the wheels on the rocks and gives the rider an eerie feeling.

The setting also affects the mental state of the cyclist. While the thrilling challenge might be attractive to some, the darkness and danger can be intimidating. The cyclist has to push through fear and remain focused. In order to remain calm and focused, the cyclist has to maintain a mental toughness that is often hard to attain in the dark.

In summary, the features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead” have a significant impact on the cyclist. The terrain is challenging, the darkness creates obstacles, and the fear can be intimidating. Despite these
