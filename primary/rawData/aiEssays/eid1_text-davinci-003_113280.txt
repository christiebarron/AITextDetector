To the Editor,

For the last two decades, computers have become increasingly powerful and ubiquitous, with an ever-growing impact on our lives. In today's modern world, it is no longer possible to imagine life without the convenience that these incredible machines provide.

However, there is a flip side to this positive development and it is important to consider both the good and bad aspects of this kind of technology. On the one hand, computers allow us to access an unprecedented degree of information, greatly expanding our knowledge base and allowing us to become more productive in our lives. We can now coordinate activities and collaborate with people from all over the world, quickly and effectively, something that was virtually impossible before computers came along.

On the other hand, however, it is important to remember that computers can be highly addictive, leaving people feeling isolated and disconnected. With screens everywhere, it can be easy to forget that “real” human interaction is still essential for mental health and satisfactorily fulfilling relationships.

Ultimately, I believe it is important to find a balance between the advantages of computers and our need for real social interaction. While computers can be hugely beneficial when used in moderation, it is vital to remember that there are still some real, tangible benefits to interacting with other people, and that these should not be forgotten.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
