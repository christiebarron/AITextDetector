Dear Editor,

I write to you today to discuss the effects computers have on people. Whether we consider it a blessing or a curse, there is no denying that computers have made our lives much easier.

With the help of computers, communication between people has become easier. We can talk to each other through social media or even by just sending a text message. Furthermore, computers have enabled us to access learning opportunities. People have traditionally gone to libraries and schools for knowledge, and computers have made learning accessible from any location.

However, overreliance on computers can have some drawbacks.

For instance, humans have become less intuitive and creative due to constantly relying on computers. Also, some experts have suggested that the time we spend in front of computers affects our physical and mental health negatively.

But I believe the benefits of computers outweigh the drawbacks. As humans, itâ€™s up to us to take the right perspective and use technology responsibly and not be enslaved by it.

Therefore, I encourage the readers of your newspaper to use computers in a more mindful manner, so that they can reap its greatest benefits in their lives.

Sincerely,

[Name]
