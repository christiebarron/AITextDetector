I believe that censorship of materials in libraries and universities is simply ineffective because the public believes that it's their right to do so," he said. "In the absence of a robust mechanism that is effective, the public will feel betrayed by anything that would bring closure to some library and university."

The committee was created to examine whether the current system of licensing licensing of materials for university curricula should be modified for more widespread implementation.

It's going to reduce our ability to have money used to support the public suspension of speech and to preserve the history of the university."
