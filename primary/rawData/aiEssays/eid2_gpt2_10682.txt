I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is more effective and more cost effective than the other forms of censorship we see today.

My sense is that the government would like to do enough to protect free expression. They don't want to censor any kind of critical information. If they take over, they will censor any material that they see as having some value in their society. If they censor a book there, they will remove it. They will not allow a university to remove it.

Many people don't realize that when people are protesting against censorship, they are protesting censorship from within, to the detriment of all the people of your country. If censorship happens, how can you be sure every person will take that as an insult and make it clear what censorship is? I am not a big believer in the government dictating the content of books. If freedom of speech for a person is not guaranteed by government, then I believe censorship on a personal level is probably the best way of protecting that.

I would also take away that the idea that free speech guarantees the right to disagree is quite naïve. If someone believes that we do a lot of things in a democracy that they would disagree with me on this – which it is quite possible and I accept – that would be just as bad as they would have to be in order to have freedom of speech under a democratic system.

If you want a better picture of how free speech on your part is protecting your right to protest
