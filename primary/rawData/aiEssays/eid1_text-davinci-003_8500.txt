I had been looking forward to an amusement park trip for weeks. As soon as we arrived, I knew I would have an amazing time, but my excitement quickly shifted when I noticed that the line for the first ride was unbelievably long. I resorted to pacing back and forth in frustration, annoyed by the wasted time. 

But then, I felt a gentle hand on my shoulder. It was my older brother. He quietly reminded me that the trip was about spending quality time with the family, something we rarely got to do. He gently explained that the wait was part of the experience and that it was a good opportunity for us to connect with each other. I quietly nodded, fully understanding him.

While the wait seemed to endlessly drag on, I tolerated it with patience and gratitude. I used the time wisely by catching up with my brother, laughing at silly jokes, and watching other people around us. After all that time, we finally reached the front of the queue and were able to scream our way through the ride. In that moment, I was grateful that my brother had encouraged me to practice patience, because it made the experience that much more rewarding.
