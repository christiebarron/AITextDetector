The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Though dirigibles are designed and built for safety reasons, a significant lack of safety controls for workers at those buildings could jeopardize the success of any effort at making a dirigible useful in their home or office.

But for all the hurdles facing the dirigible project, the main problem was that the government couldn't determine if more than half of the workforce of the first five years of construction was actually employees of the next four or five years of construction, according to a study released by the U.S. Department of Labor by the consulting firm Perkins Coie, and the government's first attempt to regulate one of the project's many potential complications came too late, according to a report released by Labor on October 8th, 2008. According to the report:

The Labor Department determined that most of the employees could only work during periods of labor shortages when it could not provide additional income for their families. The second half of the first phase of the project was expected to provide only 15% of the original pay rise, if not more, in a few years to cover those extra working hours.
