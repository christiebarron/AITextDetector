Dear Editor,

I am writing to state my opinion on the effects computers have on people. I strongly believe that computers have changed our lives for the better. Computers have affected the way we work, play, communicate, and stay informed.

Firstly, computers have made our lives easier. We can now easily do work faster by using a computer. For example, students can complete their assignments much faster with the help of word processors, databases and the internet. Computers can store large amounts of data, calculations and programs. This helps us save time and money, enabling us to do tasks more efficiently.

Moreover, computers have brought new ways of entertainment to the world. We can watch movies, play video games, and surf the web - all without having to leave the comfort of our own homes. The internet also helps us keep in touch with our friends and family. We no longer have to physically be with family and friends; we can stay connected to them through social media and video chat.

Finally, computers provide us with easier access to information. We can look up almost everything on the internet, without having to spend much time and money on libraries. The internet allows us to gain knowledge more efficiently and cost-effectively.

For all the reasons stated above, I believe that computers have had a positive effect on society. I hope that readers can see my point of view and understand why I think computers have impacted us so much.
