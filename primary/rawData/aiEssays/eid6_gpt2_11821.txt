The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The only viable use for the prop was during an industrial installation, a small but significant one being the construction of the Empire State Building.

According to the Star Wars Film Library, it was originally planned to be a double-sided movie projector with two lenses (the central lens and the end result was a large 3D-image of the Empire State Building). However, the projected amount of lighting required for the projector to capture all of the lighting was so large, in fact that in addition to the two cameras attached to the interior roof, the projectors must also have "a full, dedicated projection panel on the exterior of the center console where the light source passes through." The fact that Star Wars film crew and the Empire State Building crew had the equipment to view the building's interior via the projector, and even to view the exterior via the lights. This technology allowed the Empire State Building to have more of an impact on the future of entertainment than was actually necessary in the pre-production period. It also allowed the prop some time to develop its own internal, proprietary vision.

In the early years, the Star Wars movie system was built over the "Star Wars Pro," which was originally called the "Reeves and the Rebel TIE Fighter." That set a very high standard for what could or could not be built via the film industry. In the first few films, the Empire State
