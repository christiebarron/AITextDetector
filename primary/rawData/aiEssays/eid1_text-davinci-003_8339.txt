I was helping my friend move into her new house. It was hard work and we had to move a lot of heavy boxes and furniture. We started working in the morning and by the late evening, we were both exhausted. I could tell that my friend was starting to feel frustrated, but I wasn't going to give up. I stayed patient and encouraging throughout the whole process, motivating her to keep going until we were finished. We managed to get everything in and we both felt a great sense of accomplishment. The experience taught me a valuable lesson about the importance of being patient in difficult situations.
