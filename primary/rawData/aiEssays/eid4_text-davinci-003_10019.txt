The narrator is making a connection between the return of the geese and her own return to take the test again. The hibiscus is a symbol of growth and resilience and serves as a reminder for the narrator not to give up and have courage. The imagery of the geese migrating in the spring, as well as the hibiscus blossoming create a hopeful tone to the ending. The narrator is calling on the natural cycles of the earth - of birth, death, and renewal - to help her find hope and strength as she approaches the test with renewed vigor.
