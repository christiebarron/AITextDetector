Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. First it is to reduce the amount of light-visibility that could be generated if the motorist had to cross a lot of trees. Second it makes it more difficult for the head of the vehicle to see the path and make the bike follow the road. Finally in 'Mountain Highway Ahead,' it also makes the ride less stable. All these factors give it a greater chance of making a difference to the outcome on the right or left hand side of the road. Some bike users might take this a step further and choose not to use the 'Rough Road Ahead' feature. This might sound ridiculous to a few people, but most are genuinely happy with 'Rough Road Ahead' because of the benefit and the sense of convenience of use. The more people who have been using the feature, the more comfortable they'll become. Some of the first-time riders of those bike systems will be better informed and aware of what works and what doesn't. What the 'Rough Road Ahead' option does now is give cyclists a new tool at their disposal: a sense of control.
