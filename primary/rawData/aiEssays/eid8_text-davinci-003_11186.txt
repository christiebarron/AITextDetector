I'd been struggling to make a good impression with my new boss, but it wasn't working out well. I felt like I was tripping over myself every time we spoke, and I could tell that he was starting to get frustrated with me. At our last meeting, he asked a question and I couldn't answer it with confidence. I felt the embarrassment start to creep up on me as I tried to find the right words, but I stumbled through it. That's when he started to laugh. 

At first, I was taken aback. I thought he was making fun of me. But it quickly became clear that his laughter wasn't out of scorn or anger; it was out of empathy. He could tell that I was struggling and he was letting me know that it was okay. 

That laughter was a turning point in our relationship. I could feel huge weight being lifted off my shoulders, and suddenly I was able to carry a conversation with him more confidently. I stopped viewing every interaction as a test and instead saw our meetings as conversations. When we ran into a rough spot, we'd start to laugh, and it would help smooth things out. 

I never expected laughter to make such a huge difference, but it did. It helped us break down walls and start to build a real connection. I am so thankful for those moments of laughter that brought us closer together.
