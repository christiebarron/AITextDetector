An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the little girl I lost as a child. It was one of those days when it was so painful, I was so traumatized and I couldn't even walk the house and remember that. She would come along and they would stop and say, 'Whoa!' I remember walking to the store, but I kept on going as I kept going and I was afraid, I was afraid to go over to the store," she said.

In the 1960s, the same year that she was diagnosed with breast cancer, Lacey had the diagnosis herself, she said.

She was diagnosed with the disease from an older man, she said, and at that time there was no health insurance or other means of support.

She was placed on the National Board of Nursing's cancer and blood cancer registry for breast cancer. She said she received thousands of votes.

The board has heard about the story of Lacey, and will recommend to the board a new study to look into their case.

The new study should include a comprehensive review by two health policy experts, Dr. Elizabeth H. McAlpine and Dr. Frank L. Wightman on their case, and the addition from the National Research Council to the national registry.

But if it is approved by NORC members, the study should be included in that list and a new study for the entire country.
