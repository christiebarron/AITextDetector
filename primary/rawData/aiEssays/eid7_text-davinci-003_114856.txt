I was in line at the grocery store the other day when I noticed a lady in front of me was having a hard time. She was trying to make sense of her coupons and was having a lot of trouble counting them up and adding things in her head. Everyone in line was growing impatient, but I stayed patient.

I patiently waited to her get her total and was very gracious with my compliments. I assured her that we all have days where counting coupons just isn't working and that she shouldn't be so hard on herself. We ended up having a nice conversation and she thanked me for being patient. In the end, she left the line feeling much happier than when she entered.
