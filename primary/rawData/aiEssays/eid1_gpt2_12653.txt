Computers have many effects on people. When you make a robot, your computer controls how far you push the handlebars and then whether the robot can run as well as you. Your computer also controls how hard you run - whether you can spin (or spin and spin without being jerked, or have your feet hurt) and how much weight the robot has. In a good-sized robot, this control is very important; in a lot of robots, the robot is not even designed to get as much as your weight.

For example, the big robotic arm can barely move at a glance, and it usually makes an ugly noise when trying to push a button, when it's just trying to push the trigger. As you try to play a simple games with it and use its powers, you can see where its learning curve is at each step.

As for some of the more complicated robotics, there's something important, though. When you force a user to do something, your computer can make mistakes that you can solve. Like pushing or pulling buttons, you can turn your robot away from you, and when your control is very good it means that more often than not, your robot can have a strong and durable response. That said, when you force your robot to do something that you can't do, it will often respond by making your hand slower, and sometimes giving you a little extra effort. When it wants to push a lever, it will often be tempted to
