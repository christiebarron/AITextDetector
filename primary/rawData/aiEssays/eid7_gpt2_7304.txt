An example of a time someone in my life was patient was in 1997, when I was doing a job I'd been offered that I wasn't paying for. Someone put an ad out promoting the idea of having children; it was such a terrible idea I'd never do it again. The idea was to create a whole new generation of people who would go and be happy, to use some simple word. I got to know the people I thought should be my family and they got to know them well.

Q You had some real hard work to do as a writer and you had done good in this part during the second half of this book (before you published the third), and you were also a friend of an ex-writer, so I don't understand that you got to be an artist. Was it strange working with George Carlin's idea for you as a writer and his idea for me as a journalist?

Carpillin: No, we were very very close, although I would never meet George Carlin again. We had an idea we were working on while he was at university and we were all really excited to work together on that for like ten years, and it got started in 1998. I'm never really sure what I was writing or which article I would have to work on for them but the first article was the first in the same year we did a review of you, and I'm really sorry that it took so long to do the second article
