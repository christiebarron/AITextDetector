The Empire State Building was designed and built with a unique intention – to serve as a docking station for dirigibles in the 1930s. Although this was an ambitious feat, the building’s builders faced a variety of obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

One of the largest obstacles for the builders was the weather. Because of the unpredictable nature of wind and weather, the dirigibles required stability as they docked. This meant the builders had to modify the structure of the building to provide mooring mast and tethers sufficiently strong enough to withstand strong winds. It also presented a challenge as the Empire State Building was already complete; any alterations to the building would have to be made while taking into consideration its existing height, weight and structural integrity. 

In order to make the Empire State Building suitable to dock dirigibles, modifications to the mast had to be made. The builders had to design and install a mast bar that could connect to the nose of the dirigible and that was strong enough to handle the weight of the airship. This mast would be fastened to the top of the building and affixed to the spire in order to handle the force of any strong winds. 

In addition to the mooring mast, the builders had to consider the tethers that would keep the dirigible in place while docked. They were required to purchase and install a network of rigging and wiring from which the airship would be
