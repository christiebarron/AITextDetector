The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because one of her characters goes so far as to call her a witch, a very common notion on people's minds right now, and I think she doesn't intend to take the name of a witch any more than she intended to.

Clyde: All right. Thanks, Sarah.

And to another character that is, in the book, Mary (M.D.) in the novel. Here's the character, as she's seen in the novel from time to time.

Clyde: Thank you, Claire. Thanks!

M.D.: That's a good one.

Clyde: Really, because I've gotten a lot of things done in my life that I've wanted to do over the years. I'm writing a lot! In fact, the first chapter I've written, I called it "J.K.," so it's an acronym kind of like that.

M.D.: And "J.K.," yeah. (laughs) It was all a really good thing.

So for this book, I needed to see if I could work with Sarah, and Sarah, what her reaction was on people when she saw your description of Mary.

Clyde: Yeah. Yeah.

M.D.: So you were so impressed with it then, when you read it out, there's no mention of her being a witch
