The features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead” greatly affect the cyclist’s journey. From the start, the cyclist is navigating the harsh terrain of a desert landscape. With dunes and rock formations all around, the cyclist must be nimble enough to navigate these obstacles, while maintaining his momentum and speed. The sun is also glaring down on the cyclist, heating up the air around him and further tiring him. This sun is mirrored by the light of the moon guiding him on his journey, giving him the direction he needs to move forward.

The wind is a significant force that works against the cyclist, pushing him off balance and making it harder for him to keep upright and move forward. It also creates a powerful headwind, forcing the cyclist to expend extra energy in order to break through it. The sand too, is constantly billowing up and slowing the cyclist’s progress as he rides through it.

Overall, the cyclist is faced with a number of physical and environmental challenges as he embarks on his journey. To endure his trek, he needs a combination of strength, agility, and determination. The cyclist must be able to overcome the elements, pushing through the headwind, maneuvering the obstacle of sand dunes, and tolerating the harsh sun. Only then can he arrive at his destination and move onward.
