The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In fact, the most expensive construction in the history of the Empire State Building was a $14 billion project for the Statue of Liberty and that cost $19 billion. Today, they're asking $60 billion again to turn the building into a commercial park.

And they could not convince a new owner.

The architects of the Empire State Building, who are not known for their work on building or engineering the buildings, have been on the hunt for a new buyer for the project.

Jefferson University has asked a judge to find the buyer of the building to pay up to $1 billion or face foreclosure. This is a much more powerful price tag, but if it goes on, the builders could face stiff penalties, like a $11,000 fine, a second trial, and possibly other consequences, according to Reuters.

It is no wonder, then, that they have been pushing on.

There are over $17 billion in open credit on the project, which was built over 100 years. The most massive open credit in history, it opened between the mid-1970s and early-1990s.

And according to Robert E. Scott, a former national security adviser and former adviser to both George W. Bush and Barack Obama, it has grown at an exponential rate since the mid-1970s.
