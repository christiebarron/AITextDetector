An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my father (I'm the youngest daughter, so my father might not have a car now), and so I was given a couple of gifts, each of which turned out to be more meaningful. The gift of a chocolate bar, of which I actually got one for my children to wear because I loved chocolate.

Another example of the influence of time is the fact that an event in my life, especially an event you were able to achieve, can be in your memory while you are not there anymore to see it. That is because I was the one who created the time capsule of my dreams and we often have to remember those when there is no time. But in that case I don't have to worry about this because it is part of my everyday life. When my friends and my relatives were talking about this and they mentioned that they knew that if I had to save myself we would probably be able to do it for only one minute.

We also think it is important for us as people to remember and consider all of life as a whole. We have to think of our own values and our own personal experiences, so we can find the courage to think and to change what we consider to be unjust and unnecessary. Our beliefs don't have to be based on a belief in time. Asking people to think and make choices on what to celebrate can allow us to change how we see life and what our lives look like
