Minfong Ho ends Winter Hibiscus with this hopeful sentiment because the main character, June, is attempting to pass a test that will prove her academic merit. This moment of hopefulness hints at the potential joy and satisfaction June will feel when she finally masters the test and passes it. By associating her success with the coming of the spring, Ho suggests that after a winter of hibernation and stagnation, June is ready to discover her own inner strength and prove her academic abilities. The metaphor of the hibiscus blossoming conveys the beauty and fragility of June's journey, as well as the potential for a new beginning and fresh start with the start of a new season.
