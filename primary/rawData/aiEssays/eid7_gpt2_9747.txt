An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was 20. I had surgery. I came into medicine with a problem of my heart stopping, and a patient showed up, dressed and in a dress. When I asked him what it was about, he said he was trying to use his medicine, but we never had time for it. We just called the doctor so he could do whatever he could to help. There was no other doctors in my life who could help.

The main question for me at that moment is: is this time to stop the disease, or is this time you have a chance to get help?

A lot of people are telling me that they want better treatment, but they've got the wrong idea about when to stop the disease. People who believe that the best treatment has come from getting better, but without going over the point of seeing a doctor, say "This has an effect on my heart," they're lying. They really don't know to try and go out there and see in order to get better, because what they're really advocating is they stop being so good. They want people to go out and see their doctors every day.

In this case, if the disease was caused by a small virus that wasn't infectious, maybe the most effective treatment should be getting it out quickly. People are not going to change their lifestyle until they get better, and it's an ideal time to stop the disease.
