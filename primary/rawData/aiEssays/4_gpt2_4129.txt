The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because, it's a story of death and vengeance. It turns out that while it won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2001 for its science or poetry, it wasn't a complete piece of science.

So what's more, this book could've done great science without that type of book that I was exposed to in school.

D. I. Cates: So your dad is an expert in quantum gravity. How did you come up with a set of rules in your head to start learning about how gravity works?

E. D. Wray: He built a table of equations. The equations they usedRepeating the equations, he figured out how to move the ball to the new position. As a kid I started messing around for a while on a quark, this little wave was bouncing off the surface of the earth, I'd be working on my quark and his wave, the little pieces we had to deal with. You see, I'd be on the phone or he'd be in my office. And so I ended up coding up two mathematical equations for my cell phone. Because you see what a quantum gravity effect does to an atom. By building this quark to that distance it makes a force that just jumps out from underneath the atom and it just gets moved about like that. I then have to figure out how to make it move. My cell phone had an antenna, and I made
