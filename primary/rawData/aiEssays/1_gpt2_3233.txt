Computers have many effects on people. If there was a computer problem, what could we do?

When an academic asked me, "Should we go back to work?" I think a lot of people are willing to go back to their days where they didn't write anything. The reason are we have had that time with computers. If we were an industry with 100 engineers (and I'm talking more than 100 people today), there are a lot of hard work taken. Then comes technology.

It can be hard to make a workable computer that can run on something. However, after seeing a job that can be done on a single computer today, I think it is worth considering the work that can be applied for. The work that can be applied today is that of a person. I have seen people from every level of academia going to work on any job that can generate 20 to 60,000 to 50,000 hours, which is almost unimaginable.

If we had a computer of such quality, we could do a lot of things but the only way that we could do them all was through our own work. There is no way we can do a computer to replace a man or woman.

I was the only one that said to him, "What if you take our job and get one that should produce 10,000 hours a year." And, even better-than that and without realizing that, we are doing a lot of work which could be done
