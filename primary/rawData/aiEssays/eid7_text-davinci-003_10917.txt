It was a long day, and I was exhausted. My little brother asked if we could go to the park and I thought it was a great idea because we both needed some time outside. We arrived at the park and started to set up our picnic blanket. As soon as my brother realized that someone was already occupying our spot, he got upset and wanted us to find another place. 

I took a deep breath and patiently explained to him that people visiting the park sometimes have the same idea as us and that does not mean that we have to give up. I suggested we look around and find another spot to sit. After some searching, we found an empty spot near a tree and we were happy with it. He reminded me that it took more time to find a spot, but he was so glad that we did not have to leave. 

My brother and I spent a good portion of the day that day at the park. Throughout this experience, I showed patience and managed to handle a potentially stressful situation calmly. In the end, both my brother and I were happy and had a good time.
