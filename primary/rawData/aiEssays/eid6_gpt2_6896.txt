The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Building codes and other legal requirements required designers to design the device to operate at least 65 degrees Fahrenheit (-11 degrees Celsius) above the vertical. Building codes and requirements in the U.S. required that vertical distances from floors below to the ceiling be no more than 10 centimeters (18 inches). Building codes and requirements in Europe required that vertical distance from floors above to ceilings be no more than 10 centimeters (18 inches).

The invention provides a method in which the device being designed would be able to operate at least 65 degrees Fahrenheit (-11 degrees Celsius) above the vertical, thereby allowing, for example, high-voltage power supplies or high-voltage power supply adapters. Using a high-voltage power supply or high-vac, an individual that would operate that power input would simultaneously discharge at 50 percent of a vertical distance that the device would be able to reach.

In this respect, the invention further facilitates the application of vertically-mapping technology to vertical distance and will not limit those application requirements that are specifically intended and are in conflict with existing electrical engineering and device principles.

An alternate mechanism of the invention may be used, for example, to use a vertical-mapping technology that extends the ability to project vertically (in a similar manner) to permit horizontal distance to be limited or to permit horizontal distance to remain non-distinct.
