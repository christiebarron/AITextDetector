One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was working for a local newspaper and an employee reported that when you get paid well for writing, there's a pretty good chance you will get a better grade than the other people that wrote something that you write.

To me the more I work the harder it is to break my expectations and keep yourself motivated, but a lot of people are less motivated, they might think "Well now I just learned I had a problem and the next writer I want to hire is an ex and now I want to interview that person too, I've never been on anything like that before."

I would say if you're just really happy to be on your own, not on that company and get paid well there are a lot of other guys out there that can work their best. You'd be surprised how many people are willing to sign up for nothing and then they go on to work for an organization.

So what do we do differently in our careers if you were to take a look at your career? Do you change who you work with and what role are you putting you in?

I would say I've done a lot more freelance and consulting than most people who get into writing, and I'm not in that group, but I try to find people people are willing to work with that I can put on my resume that I feel could give me a better edge than what I am with the professional world Collector by Day by
