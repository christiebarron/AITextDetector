I remember the first time I truly felt connected with my sister. We had been visiting our grandparents for the week, and although I had grown up seeing her every day, somehow this trip felt different.

One night, the adults went to bed early and my sister and I stayed up late talking for hours about anything and everything. As the night went on, we got sillier and sillier, cracking jokes and laughing until we had tears in our eyes. I couldn't remember the last time I had laughed so hard.

The funny thing is, we had grown up joking around and goofing off with each other, but this time felt different. We laughed together and felt a bond that had been lacking in our relationship. That night bridged the gap that had grown between us and we have been close sisters ever since. Who knew it would take a few hours of laughter to get us there?
