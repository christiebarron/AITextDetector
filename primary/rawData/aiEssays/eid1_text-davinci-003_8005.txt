Yet the original plan for construction of the skyscraper included the ability for them to land, dock, and provide transportation to the building’s 81st floor. This ambitious plan created many obstacles and difficulties for the builders of the Empire State Building, all of which were outlined by Marcia Amidon Lüsted in her book, The Mooring Mast. 

The overarching obstacle the builder’s of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock was the practicality of such an involvement. The New York skyline, already fairly crowded, had to accommodate the size and shape of the popular European dirigibles. The builders also had to consider the weather patterns and strong winds of the city, which could cause severe danger for these airships. 

Another obstacle involved the preparation of the building itself. Among the listed alterations was the installation of a 200-foot mooring mast on the roof of the Empire State Building. This involved welding structural steel members together to create a skeletal frame of the mast. In addition to the mooring mast, a further disaster-prevention plan was implemented that included the installation of numerous vents and smoke exhausts in order to disperse any build-up of hydrogen gas.

The mooring mast was also designed with a number of technological advances. These included an automatic
