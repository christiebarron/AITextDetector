I remember the day I met my wife like it was yesterday. We both had been set up on a blind date by mutual friends. We were nervous but gamely went along with the suggestion of going for a stroll in the park.

We were both a little awkward around each other— careful jokes, apprehensive smiles here and there— until I stumbled on a pebble and almost fell flat. All of the sudden, we both started laughing, unsure why, but it felt like we just got each other instantly. Before long, we were laughing loudly and uncontrollably, pointing out the funny quirks of the other guests and sharing jokes straight out of nowhere.

We talked for hours that day. I'm not sure when we stopped laughing— it kind of just ended naturally and we found ourselves now even more comfortable with each other, exchanging bits and pieces about our lives and hopes and dreams. We wrapped up the day and went our separate ways, but the strength of that shared laughter stayed with me throughout our entire courtship— and, decades later, it's still the glue that binds us together.
