I'll never forget the first time I shared a laugh with my future wife. We had been talking for the past few weeks and had established a great rapport, but there was still a sense of awkwardness that lingered. But one day, out of the blue, we both cracked up over a silly joke one of us made, and it felt like that awkwardness had suddenly evaporated in an instant. It was one of those laughs that just felt so natural that it felt like it was meant to be. From then on, conversations between us seemed to flow more easily and the awkwardness had disappeared completely. We often joke about that moment now, and it always brings up fond memories for us both. To this day, laughter is still a huge part of our relationship, and it brings us closer and closer together every day.
