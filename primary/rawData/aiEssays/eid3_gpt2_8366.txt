Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

I had a problem with not knowing the bike it was on when I started the bike on. I've experienced a bit of a learning curve, having to adjust certain pedals and brakes, and I would have left the engine running and couldn't see the bike at all as I had done before.

It seems the 'Rough Road Ahead' bike was so popular that we started using it to check whether it was running normally.

The bike is powered by a 1.7k ohm motor, meaning it could handle the speed with a bit more power.

At about 2pm (18AM), when I would run over the bridge, I would still see the bike turn on, but it wouldn't start moving as it took me a bit of time - I had already ridden more than half my trips, but this time it would start to swing from side to side again.

The bike didn't have any brakes, so I had to manually adjust the engine on and off. It was kind of silly, and my friends and I always try to switch the motor from power to an idle mode when I go to get the bicycle. I'm probably a little more aware of things that are not on the internet and know the bike will not stop on its brakes when you don't feel like doing so.

This experience is why we always keep the brakes in
