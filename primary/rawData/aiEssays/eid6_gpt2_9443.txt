The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Among them, is the fact that the Empire State Building had to be built in the '20th Century', and the fact that the bridge was constructed just before the World Trade Center was demolished.

In 1995, the Department of the Interior issued an "advisory" order permitting "Directional Diversions", which the architects of the Empire State building feared would cause a fire and injure dozens of people. One of the first dirigibles was to be installed on the Washington National Cathedral, which was demolished in the fall of that year.

As for the rest [ edit ]

For those with an axe to grind, or looking forward to building 'JFK' on a piece of property that has been knocked down, think again...

For those who are looking at the building and looking for a shortcut (and who may not have an opinion about its placement), there are several possibilities. I'd be happy to see an aerial view of the building to help you better choose which dirigible and which is best. [9][10][11]

Note: I'll be covering what I believe to be most important when discussing the history of dirigibles. They were probably the primary cause of the fire at the World Trade Center.
