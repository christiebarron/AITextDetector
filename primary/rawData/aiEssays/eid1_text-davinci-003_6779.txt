Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my opinion on the effects computers have on people. In our ever-evolving world, it is becoming increasingly more difficult to ignore the huge impact computers have had on society. 

From a personal level, computers have opened up new avenues of communication and collaboration that were almost unimaginable before their emergence. With the help of computers, people are now able to work and communicate with anyone, anywhere in the world with just the click of a few buttons. This has enabled individuals to engage in a much larger scope of social interaction than ever before, potentially fostering unprecedented thought sharing and understanding.

Computers have also allowed people to engage in leisure activities that were not possible before, even allowing people to create and express their own works of art. This development has provided a way for people to explore their own creativity and develop a confident level of self-expression.

On a more practical level, computers have created endless possibilities for streamlining everyday tasks. Being able to use computers to complete a work assignment or to organize large events has made everyday life much easier and more efficient for people all around the world.

From collaboration and communication to productivity and efficiency, computers have revolutionized the way people interact and engage with the world. I firmly believe they have had a very positive impact on society and should continue to be embraced and explored.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
