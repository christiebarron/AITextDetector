In Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead," the cyclist is presented with several obstacles due to the specific features of the setting. The first obstacle the cyclist faces is the terrain of the road. The road is described as being "rocky and uneven," making it difficult to navigate and increasing the risk of injury for the cyclist. In addition, the area is described as "more desolate than it should have been," diminishing the cyclist's chances of finding help if they needed it. The lack of sights and sounds also makes the cyclist feel more isolated and contributes to their sense of dread and apprehension.

The lack of light is another important element of the setting which affects the cyclist. The cyclist is presented with a "dark and ominous" sky and their headlights only provide minor illumination, making it difficult to see hazards ahead. Without light, it is harder for the cyclist to plan ahead, increasing their anxiety.

Lastly, the weather contributes to the cyclist's struggle. The weather is described as "cold and dry," diminishing the amount of protection that the cyclist has from the terrain. Additionally, the cyclist is presented with a "cutting wind," which makes it even harder to make progress on the road.
