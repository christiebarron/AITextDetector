An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a 30-year-old lady who became infected with an unclassified, invasive form of breast cancer, which she was told had spread to other women in the hospital. During her next six months in the hospital, she suffered from a persistent, debilitating illness for which she was unable to follow procedures, often for seven days a week, which left her having to work all day. The disease was eventually treated by an early diagnosis; I saw her in September of this year. My first visit was at the Hospital for Sick Children, an organization I'd cofounded to treat cancer among patients who needed it. I told her that although she'd been treated, there was absolutely no cure; many of the women in there could face a long, difficult, and Pleslovian process to return to their normal lives with their beloved. I also told her she was going to be a part of something special. The idea I had of setting up a network of cancer-free, non-cancer-killing, women who needed assistance with chemotherapy in their own beds was as appealing to me as it would be for a group of other cancer-free women who needed assistance with all other formsulsion.

That was something I was proud ofâ€”as a woman, that was the best I could do. My goal was also to give a voice to other people around the world who had been victims of cancer. I'm a survivor of breast cancer,
