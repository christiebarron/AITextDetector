I remember it so clearly. It was my first year of college, and my roommate had invited me to a party with some of her friends. I was nervous and worried about making a good first impression, but I soon realized that wasn’t the case. 

Everyone was so friendly and welcoming that I immediately started to relax. We spent the evening just talking and laughing, and after a couple hours it felt like I’d known these people my whole life.

At one point during the evening, we were all talking and someone made a joke that was so ridiculous, we couldn’t stop laughing. It was one of those moments when laughter truly was the best medicine. Everyone was bent over, trying to catch their breath as we each shared the punchline. 

I remember feeling so connected to these people in that moment. It’s a moment that still brings a smile to my face whenever I think about it. That silly joke was the beginning of many wonderful friendships; I’m so glad I didn’t miss out.
