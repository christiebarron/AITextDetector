The idea of allowing dirigibles, large airships typically rigidly framed in steel, to dock on the Empire State Building was originally conceived in 1929. As engineers aimed to make this a reality by installing a large mast on top of the newly built Empire State Building, they faced multiple obstacles that prevented the successful mooring of dirigibles on the building.

First and foremost, the high winds at the high altitude of the Empire State Building posed a challenge to the proposed mooring mast. In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, it is stated that the “strong wind currents at the top of the building made docking difficult to impossible.” Without an effective mooring mast, airships would be unable to safely dock on the Empire State Building. To account for the lightness of the mast and its susceptibility to high winds, engineers had to increase its size, making it the third-tallest automotive tower in the world at the time. Despite its size, however, the mooring mast was insufficient at reducing the effect of wind on the airship, ultimately preventing its successful docking.

In addition to the high winds around the Empire State Building, the size of the dirigibles presented another issue. Nearly three times the height of the mooring mast, they posed a problem when it came to proper docking. An airship attempting to dock at the Empire State Building would be required to stop at such a
