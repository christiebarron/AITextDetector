The features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead" greatly impact the cyclist. To begin, the cyclist is riding along a rural back road through a sparsely populated landscape. On one side of the road, there is an empty field with not a single tree in sight. On the other side, is an abandoned farmhouse with its backyard overgrown with weeds. This setting gives the cyclist a feeling of being alone in the world.

The cyclist soon comes across the sources of the rough road ahead: a winding road lined with boulders and potholes. This creates an immediate obstacle for the cyclist, who must use his skills to navigate the terrain safely. He must stay alert in order to avoid smashing into the rocks and falling into the holes. The roughness of the terrain means he must also expend more energy on climbing up and down the hills he encounters.

The setting is also filled with sensory elements that impact the cyclist’s experience. Along the way, he is met with birds singing, a stream gurgling, and butterflies dancing on the roadside. Despite the roughness of the road, these small touches of beauty can help him to relax and enjoy the ride.

Overall, the setting of Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead" is integral to the cyclist’s journey as it both challenges and enriches his experience. The road itself is a physical obstacle that the cyclist must overcome by
