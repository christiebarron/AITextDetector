Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. For example, it is often easy to see where cyclists are looking, when they are out in front of a red light and where the red line is. And it is often better to avoid traffic in this area. But the 'roundabouts' which form roads in the same way as the 'Roundabouts' are actually a common source of errors in the design of roads and roads systems.

Some of these errors are not simply accidents caused by cars but also by bad use from the design of the 'Roundabouts' themselves - especially in areas that are not used.

As can be seen from the number of crashes associated with these roundabouts, as many as one in every ten cyclists are killed or injured after riding in the 'Roundabouts' and a further six pedestrians or cyclists were injured or killed in these 'Roundabouts'. The lack of road safety awareness and good bicycle network management is a major factor; one that has resulted in a series of bicycle safety awareness campaigns. The need of cycling in these streets is reflected in these statistics.
