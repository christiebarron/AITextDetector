I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a threat to free expression and free expression's fundamental right to privacy, free speech, and the free exercise of religion and conscience in our political, corporate and technological worlds. It is time for reform of lowered regulations, the creation of a legal system of fair and adequate licenses that promote and protect both the intellectual property rights and the fair use rights of all authors and publishers.

If we were to have a system of fair and adequate licenses, how would we determine which books get licenses and which don't? If I are a lawyer, how would I be able to prove which books I would not use, and which I think should get license bans? If I am writing about a project, I'd have to prove my work by providing a factual analysis so that the audience would know and recognize an important principle, especially when it can be used for any purpose.

For that to happen, some legal professionals would use a variety of toolsâ€”like writing contracts, contracts on paper, public speaking, or some other form in which I believe there is something to be said for legal professionals to consider. In this sense, the government in this case, which treats my writing differently, would be right. I wouldn't need a court order to get licenses to use my writings in court, but by making that case, I would be able to prove a right to free expression and freedom of expression that others in my field might not and deserve.
