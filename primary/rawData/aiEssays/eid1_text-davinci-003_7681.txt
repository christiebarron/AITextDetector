The ending of "Winter Hibiscus" implies that the speaker has experienced a difficult challenge or obstacle, and the test to which she refers can represent anything from school exams to life lessons. The author is using the metaphor of the returning hibiscus in the spring to signify transformation, renewal, and hope. With the departure of the geese and melting snow, the hibiscus symbolizes a new beginningâ€”a fresh start with a different outlook or approach. By ending on this hopeful note, the author invites readers to remember that opportunities and possibilities can always arise, even after the hardest times.
