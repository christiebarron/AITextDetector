The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it's a piece on that kind of thing. The book does not end with a simple "but" (or at least the conclusion) and it concludes that we need more, and that's an extremely important thing you could do. You can stop it before it starts by saying "well that means I'd better stick to it" and then think about what you've come to.


The only people who would agree with it (from outside of my self-awareness) would be myself and other writers who are writers who write with love and dedication. We've been here before, and we've just been lucky enough to grow up the way we grew up, to have the chance to be as well-liked. It would all be a dream come true for readers outside of my writing. And even if we had chosen not to, we have grown up with a lot of work here that makes us think that we can do what we want to do, that's what makes writing great.
