The setting of ‘Rough Road Ahead’, by Joe Kurmaski plays a crucial role in the cyclist’s experience of the journey. From the start of the narrative, the reader is presented with the dusty roads of a desert environment during a heatwave. The intense, dry heat causes the breath of the cyclist to become shallow, leaving a wave of sweat sticking to his skin and making the bike feel like an extra burden. The harshness of the elements, combined with the overwhelming power of the sun, causes physical exhaustion to quickly set in, making the road ahead feel almost impossibly difficult.

The rough and often hazardous terrain also plays an important part in the cyclist’s journey. As he battles his way against the sand and loose debris, forced to stop and start again after almost every turn, the situation becomes increasingly difficult. The relentless nature of the climb, as well as the sheer number of obstacles in his path, make it practically impossible to continue.
