Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. While computers provide us with great convenience for managing our day-to-day tasks, I am concerned about how they can have a negative impact on our lives. 

We rely so heavily on the digital age for information, entertainment, and communication that many of us are becoming addicted to spending hours upon hours in front of a computer screen. In addition to the physical side effects such as blurry eyes, neck pain, and headaches, social interaction has also taken a negative hit due to our reliance on computers. People have become more inclined to stay home and “hang out” online or talk via text rather than having real face-to-face conversations with friends and family. 

We must remember the importance of staying healthy and taking breaks from staring at monitors. We also need to make real relationships a priority in our lives. Computers can offer convenience and make our lives easier, but we also need to be conscious of the dangers of becoming too dependent on them. 

I, therefore, urge readers to use caution and be aware of the limits of using computers to maintain a balanced lifestyle.

Sincerely
