In the end, they did well, but two years later came the inevitable question; can some dome holders be safely seated on the floor? How to hold them free? The answer to that depends more on where you are. To hold a dome can be made by removing the lid of a box and pressing against its top, as they were in ancient Rome. Then when placing the dome on its interior you would see the weight, height, and weight-wise. The above pictured view shows a good chance to get your hands on one. This is probably the last dome holder you might be able to put in place for your living in the building (in case you wanted one).
