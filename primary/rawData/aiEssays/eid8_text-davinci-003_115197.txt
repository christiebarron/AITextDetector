I recently had a situation funny enough to make us both laugh. I had flown out to visit my best friend who lives in another state. We hadn’t seen each other in a few months and made plans to meet up for a night out on the town. We decided to get dressed up, so I put on my favorite black dress and I could tell my friend was wearing a really nice one too. 

When we stepped out of her apartment, I was in for a surprise. I had been so focused on getting ready that I hadn’t noticed the dark clouds rolling in and the sudden chill in the air. We both hurried to the car but it was too late. We were both drenched!

My friend started to laugh while I was still in shock. I couldn’t help it, I started laughing too; what else could we do? We both looked like drowned rats! Eventually, we had to calm down but that didn’t stop us from smiling. 

We went back inside to try and find something else to wear, but nothing looked quite right. We both started laughing again and decided that we would just go out like we were. Thankfully, we had a great evening anyway and laughed the whole night. I guess when it comes down to it, laughter really is the best medicine!
