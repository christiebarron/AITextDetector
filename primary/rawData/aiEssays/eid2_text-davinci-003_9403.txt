The issue of censorship in libraries has recently been subject to fierce debate, but one thing that all parties agree on is that libraries should be a place of learning. It is therefore vital that we ensure that library materials are not limiting access to important information or materials. 

Library materials that are deemed offensive to some individuals should not be removed from the shelves. Censorship of books, music, movies, and magazines can send signals of cultural disapproval and silencing. Moreover, such materials can contain valuable information or perspectives that some members of the community might not otherwise be exposed to. 

Proponents of censorship argue that it is necessary in order to protect the innocence of the young, but the truth is that censorship can be just as damaging to children if not more so. Suppressing content can lead to a lack of understanding of the diversity of ideas and beliefs that exist in society. 

A better way to ensure access to library materials that are not offensive is to provide access to materials but also provide information about why certain materials might be considered offensive.This way, adults, parents and children alike can decide what is appropriate for themselves. Providing information about why materials might be objectionable is far better than censorship, as it allows people to form informed opinions.  

Overall, censorship in libraries should not be considered an acceptable practice. Libraries should remain places where patrons can freely explore ideas without fear of judgment or censure, and censorship is antithetical to that purpose.
