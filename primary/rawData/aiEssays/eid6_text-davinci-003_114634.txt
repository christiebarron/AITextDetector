The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. During the late 1920s, dirigibles, or airships, were becoming increasingly popular for their role in transportation. In 1931, John Jakob Raskob proposed that the upper portion of the newly-constructed Empire State Building be modified to accommodate the docking of a dirigible. However, this presented a number of challenges.

First and foremost, the mooring mast had to be designed and constructed in order to safely hold the dirigible aloft. According to Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s essay “The Mooring Mast,” the mast was made of structural steel which was composed of several sections fastened together. At the top, a circular arm welded to the mast held the actual mooring apparatus which was attached to the underside of the airship. The design for this component was studied carefully and the steel materials were tested to ensure that the mast could withstand the force of the docking dirigibles.

The second issue to consider was the size of the mooring mast. Dirigibles were often incredibly large and the mooring mast had to be designed to a sufficient height to accommodate them. The mooring mast had to be higher than the Empire State Building’s observation deck, which was located at a height of 844 feet. This required the mast to reach up to 1,048 feet.
