I remember being at the grocery store and the queue was extremely long. I had only planned to buy a few items, but everyone else had filled up their carts with groceries. I knew I wouldn't be able to get out of the store until much later. All of a sudden, the person in front of me started to argue with the cashier. I could tell that the cashier was getting frustrated and would soon start raising their voice. I stayed patient and didn't say anything. Eventually, the person in front of me stepped back and let the cashier finish the transaction. After the person was gone, the cashier thanked me for being so patient and kept the line moving. It felt great to know that I had helped the situation instead of making it worse.
