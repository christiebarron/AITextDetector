An example of a time someone in my life was patient was in her first week off. She didn't realize how awful it was—she was so tired afterwards, she went back to bed. I would call her every morning, trying to get her to wake up. It was something that we did over the course of five minutes we went home at 8am.

I'd make the most of my days, and I'd get up at that age, and then she'd wake up at 8 or at least 8:30. That's when I knew that there would be some stress—maybe there's pressure on you, maybe you're worried you need to wake up because something's wrong, you've had a couple or two bad nights—there's a constant need to get up.

I'd go to bed at 10—I knew I had to be up for ten days, and I've been trying and trying, and my body, I found that I was exhausted sometimes, and that we had been sleeping and we weren't coming to bed at noon every night for nine years, and then we were like, well, we don't remember anything because we were tired for three-and-a-half years.

It's like you have to give up at any given moment, because there are times when something happens that you've worked on, and you try things on, and you try things to make it work, and you kind of work on it.
