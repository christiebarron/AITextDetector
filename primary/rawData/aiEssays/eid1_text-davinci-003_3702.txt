Dear Editor,

I wish to express my opinion on the effects that computers have had on people. As technology has advanced and been made widely available, computers have become ubiquitous in homes, offices and schools across the country.

No doubt computers have become necessary tools in our modern society, however, the potential for great harm must not be ignored. Computers can lead to an astonishing amount of distractions. With the availability of the internet, social media and endless apps, users can easily become addicted to their devices. This often leads to an impaired attendance in school, a disconnection from family and friends, the inability to focus on essential tasks and an overall decrease in one’s mental health.

Adults have become equally as addicted. Many take it for granted that email and texting has become a main form of communication and succumb to the pressure of responding too quickly to expectations. That is why it is so important to regulate one’s use of computers and recognize their detrimental effects. Breaks should be taken throughout the day to promote productivity and mindfulness.

I ask that we all consider the consequences of over-exposure to computers and be mindful of our own usage. Our lives should not be dependent on a piece of technology.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
