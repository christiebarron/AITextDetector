Rough Road Ahead by Joe Kurmaski tells the story of a cyclist who embarks on a long ride in a rural area. One of the key features of the setting is the terrain, which is mostly unpaved, full of hills, and often takes the cyclist off the beaten path. The terrain proves especially difficult for the cyclist, as they face long climbs and harsh descents. The rough roads also take a physical toll on the cyclist, as they are forced to endure extra bumps and bruises along the way.

Another prominent feature of the setting is the weather, which often varies. During the cyclist's ride, they experience changing weather ranging from rain to sunshine. The weather features have a direct impact on the cyclist's experience as the rain causes slippery roads and the sunshine causes them to overheat.

Finally, nightfall brings its own set of challenges, as the cyclist has difficulty navigating the winding roads. Without the light of the sun, the cyclist must rely on their own senses to find their way and avoid any potential dangers.

Overall, the various features of the setting contribute significantly to the cyclist's experience. As they travel through their rural journey, the cyclist must confront numerous obstacles due to the terrain, the weather, and the darkness of night. Throughout this journey, the cyclist must remain resilient and find ways to overcome these challenges.
