 

Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects that computers have on people and to persuade your readers to agree with me. 

In recent years, computer technology has grown exponentially, making billions of lives easier and more efficient. The majority of people today rely on computers for work, entertainment, and communication. They play a vital role in our daily lives but can also cause damage.

With so much reliance comes a decrease in interpersonal skills. Computers enable us to communicate without face-to-face contact, removing the opportunity to practice communication skills. Without frequent use, writing, reading, and speaking skills start to decline. Additionally, the addictive nature of some computer activities can lead to a lack of physical activity and, as a result, health problems.

On the other hand, computers give us access to unprecedented amounts of knowledge. The internet provides a vast array of academic resources as well as entertainment options. With AI-supported automated processes, even the most mundane tasks can be completed safely and quickly. 

In summary, the advantages and disadvantages of computers should be taken into account. It is clear to me that computers are here to stay and we should use them in ways that are beneficial to society and do not lead to health or social problems.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
