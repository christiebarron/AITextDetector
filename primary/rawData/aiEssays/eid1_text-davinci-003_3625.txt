Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my perspective on the impact that computers have had on our lives. There is little doubt that computers are a powerful tool. They give us access to knowledge, from the Internet to quickly located files, and help us stay connected to people all over the world.

There is a downside, however. Some people feel so connected to their devices, they struggle to interact with others in person or even find time for leisure activities. Everything seems to revolve around the computer, and this can take away from experiences that help make life enjoyable.

Therefore, I urge readers to consider the value of their own devices and how they can be used to improve their lives, rather than take away from it. If we're careful and mindful of our relationship with computers, we can definitely benefit from them and use them as a tool for good.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
