One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was a kid for a group photo on a bus going around Lake Tahoe to an outdoor art project I was doing on a lake. I just did it after a couple weeks in a campground. I never had a bad joke or joke about the weather. The thing is, it was fun, it was pretty peaceful. And it's not just a funny thing. I've always been a sucker for cool music. Maybe my father would think it's like a kind of fun joke to tell me about a band you're listening to. I could imagine that, because the day he was listening to TRSD it would make me laugh just as much as adapting the tune to the mood.

Are you inspired by the idea of music growing up and growing up with kids playing their favorite instruments, such as accordion and instruments of the same type?

When we were young we thought that all modern electronic instruments were so simple and so simple and so easy, I thought that our own music would take advantage of that and have all the different tones of modern instruments. You find all the music around you at the same time with different styles of instruments. I was interested in making any sort of electronic instrument I could find to use. And I discovered TRSD once I was 18. It takes inspiration from these kind of older sounds from Japan and then I created all those melodies, all around me. And I really love using T
