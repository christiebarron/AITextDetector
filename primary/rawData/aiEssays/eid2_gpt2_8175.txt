I believe that censorship of materials in libraries to the point where they are deemed offensive cannot be tolerated. For example, a library owner does not allow his or her employees to use private pictures in the collection, even when they already have permission on that subject to do so, and even if they would like to use the information publicly. Additionally, many of the students who organize libraries in China think they are doing society a favor by making it easier for private students to participate in the teaching process, so that their tuition will be used as efficiently as possible. This is something students do in much of the world but is not a problem in most of them. The problem is that many people find it difficult to take seriously the problems of the students, especially those who do not accept the fact that their time is devoted to studying.

If you take seriously the problems students face in these problems and think of the reasons teachers or students are going to take to solve them, then they are mistaken. Teachers and students come from very different backgrounds, cultures, and worldviews. This may seemマdifferent to some, but it is also true for everyone. For example, it is not correct to think that students from traditional Chinese schools have to take up a class every day, or to think that they can go as well out in this country. These issues often do not affect the teaching, administration, or curricula of schools in general — however, learning materials that are considered obscene in many English-speaking countries
