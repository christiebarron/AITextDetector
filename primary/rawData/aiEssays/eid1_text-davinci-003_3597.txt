I'll never forget the time my best friend and I went on a road trip to visit some of our other friends in another state. We had booked a hotel for the night which was connected to a karaoke bar, so naturally we decided to go. We didn't really prepare for the night, so we both had to walk in off the street. 

When we entered the bar, all eyes were on us. We couldn't tell if the stares were welcoming or suspicious. I started to feel a little bit uneasy but as I looked closer, I noticed people were kind of smiling at us. 

And then we heard it—the sound of laughter, loud and clear. It was coming from the corner of the room. As we got closer, we noticed it was coming from a group of people. They were singing karaoke and the lyrics to the song were so corny we couldn't help but laugh out loud.

My friend and I just looked at each other and started cracking up uncontrollably. Soon, everyone in the bar was laughing with us. We stayed the rest of the evening, singing, laughing and having a great time. 

I was so glad that laughter had broken down the wall between us and the rest of the room. After that, we felt completely at home—as if we had been around the people our entire lives. I'm thankful every day for the power of laughter to bring people together.
