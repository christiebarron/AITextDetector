In the early 1930s, the architects of the Empire State Building—Ralph Walker and Arthur Loomis Harmon—envisioned the tallest building in the world to include docking space for high-flying dirigibles. While the idea of docking airships on the roofs of skyscrapers was incredibly alluring, the obstacles to making this happen turned out to be immense. In the book, The Mooring Mast: A Story of Building the Empire State, Marcia Amidon Lüsted describes the engineering difficulties the architects had to overcome in their quest to make this dream a reality.

The primary issue facing the architects was the fact that the Empire State Building was designed with an open framework. The framework lacked sturdy enough beams that could hold the weight of the airships plus additional passengers. In addition, the mooring mast was expected to hold the weight of the airship securely, while allowing it to rotate into place. Designers had to account for the area around the mast, so that safety was not compromised. 

Given the impossibility of the task, the architects consulted experts. The Smithsonian Institute supplied data about airships, and the Bureau of Standards helped solidify the specs needed for a mast that could bear the weight and size of these enormous vehicles. Some of the information uncovered was that a mooring mast would need to extend up to 250 feet in the air and withstand 110 tons of airship. This height was ultimately extended to 400 feet,
