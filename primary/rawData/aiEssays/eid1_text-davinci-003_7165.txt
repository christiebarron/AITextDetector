The setting of “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski is one of the most important elements of the story, as it directly affects the cyclist in a variety of ways. The setting is an abandoned asphalt road, with a few buildings and landmarks nearby, in the middle of a vast desert with no visibility. 

The deserted nature of the road affects the cyclist in a way that creates suspense and uncertainty. As the cyclist is riding the road, they are not aware of the potential obstacles and hindrances that may lie ahead. This creates both a sense of fear and a feeling of anticipation, as a cyclist can’t help but to wonder what could be lurking around the corner. 

Moreover, the isolated and vast nature of the desert adds to the unease that the cyclist is feeling. The cyclist can only assume the worst when the desert winds start blowing, carrying all sorts of strange and foreign sounds through the air. This essentially serves as a constant reminder that out of the ordinary things can, and will, happen at any given moment. The longer the cyclist stays on the road, the more their rational thought processes slowly become overwhelmed by fear. 

The extreme heat of the desert environment also serves as an atmospheric element that affects the cyclist. The strong sunlight has the potential to cause both physical and mental fatigue, making it more difficult for the cyclist to continue riding. The heat also makes the cyclist more vulnerable to dehydration and sunstroke
