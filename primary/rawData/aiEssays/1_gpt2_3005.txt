Computers have many effects on people. These include the creation of new jobs, increased competition, and an increase in wealth and income. And some even increase the rate at which one gains wealth. Wealth is also spread throughout society. Wealth is generated when wealth levels increase steadily. This phenomenon makes social phenomena like the growth of wealth not a well-defined phenomenon; its only defined phenomenon is competition. This is known as population growth (which is the difference between wealth and income). Wealth is not the only thing a society does to produce an individual (e.g., to get the right products; to purchase a house). It can also drive upward mobility at the same time of increasing competition.

The most well-known effect of the increasing competition in the economy is the increase in the profits of corporations. The profits of corporations typically increase on average 10% yearly, but their value in the economy is reduced as a result. A company is effectively losing its profits through the increasing competition.

In short, the rise in competition during the past five to seven years has resulted in higher average incomes and fewer jobs (all of which the rest of us have never yet discovered). The "new normal" that has gone with that growth in profits and new jobs, coupled with a greater rise in income has led some economists to conclude that the economic "new normal," that is, the increasing supply of resources (rather than the demand for "new" resources) has produced increased competition and greater wealth formation
