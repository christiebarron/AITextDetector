I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is necessary, on the principle of freedom of speech."

A new study published this week by researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Applied Physics, Austria, found that the use of words in literature may also be an indicator of whether people read the material well.

"If people read a book with 'I'm going to read this,' they might read the book well, which they may then choose in a more positive relationship, or they might read the book poorly," said study co-author Youssef Hamid, associate professor at the place where the research took place and who was interested in the matter. "We find that a few positive associations are consistent with the general knowledge, but also in general good. We find that people use words with a positive effect in reading and that it works as a measure of well-being."

"One could speculate that the use of words is used to reinforce an expectation, that all material in a novel was suitable for reading, even though the reader doesn't know how best to read it," said Hamid, a physicist at Berlin's Max Planck Institute. "In the study, our findings indicate, as we have already observed, that words help people remember good books as well as bad ones." Hamid and the team hope other researchers in the field assassinate the word wearers, and they plan on working on this technique further.

The study found that words were linked
