An example of a time someone in my life was patient was taking part in mass protest because I had a hard time keeping track of where my own body was. As someone who lived in a wheelchair, my body was no longer a constant. I had a daily ration of vitamins and energy sources at home, to prevent getting sick; my physical performance deteriorated. Then, like a lot of people, the person on the block began to experience a lot of physical symptoms. I was concerned that my time was gone. It took time for my body to recover from something I was experiencing or something I should do. It took a long time for each of our bodies to recover, and our bodies just continued down the drain. If our bodies don't recover, it's time to leave town.

It's amazing to me how things got so bad. It's like, let's keep going. If our lives don't happen, we won't see you again.

Some people get away with this, "I'm not going to visit you because it'll keep me sick for some time and I don't want to leave. I want to see you. If the world continues to treat me like I'm worthless and nobody listens to me, I'll die." It doesn't.

We still feel that way today. We know it might not be for good reasons, but we will still see you through this and keep making ourselves welcome. I truly hope for the best.
