I was in line at the grocery store and the queue was really long. Everyone was impatiently shuffling around and sighing. When it got to my turn to pay, I realized I had left my wallet at home. 

I apologized to the cashier and told her the situation. She said it was alright and that I could come back after I got my wallet. I thanked her for her patience and understanding, and she smiled.

I returned to the store with my wallet a few hours later and the same cashier was still on the same shift. She remembered me right away and welcomed me back. Even though she had been dealing with impatient customers all day, she didn't rush me and was very patient with me as I slowly counted out my change. 

In the end, I thanked her again for being so understanding and patient with me. It was a great reminder that patience and kindness always go a long way.
