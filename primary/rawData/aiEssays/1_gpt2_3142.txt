Computers have many effects on people. You can be a professional in your field, you will have many successes, and you can get a reputation for success. Be yourself and be proud for your accomplishments. It is hard to achieve when it isn't about power.


If you have the right attitude it will help you gain the confidence and pride you are looking for.


The best people will always have to take responsibility for their own successes.


There will always be something to be said about an individual's greatness. I like to think of him as a giant in his own way. I would call him the great-greatest person who ever lived.


People know that people are people, that they will have a big talk and a big deal, but if they don't talk it doesn't matter.

I feel you can't talk about someone's accomplishment for 30 years only if their accomplishments are really top 10. They don't have that much power. Be yourself and talk about how you are a person, how you live your life and the things you do. That doesn't mean you know everything; you just want to understand what has happened.

You can talk about things and have big talk but don't take responsibility. Be accountable for yourself.

This is more personal stuff and the more you talk the more you realize that you should have this. Don't think about your accomplishments without caring a lot about the people on this planet.
