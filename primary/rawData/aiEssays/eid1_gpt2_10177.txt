The problem with centralized systems, where many people depend upon online services for their work and their money cannot be solved with centralized systems, is only that if a data center is established in some event it will become easier to manage the same data that is available to many. This is why "networking" has become such a big problem as technology becomes more efficient under decentralized control of the network. It would be impossible to know the current state of systems and what's going on with the use of computers for services. It would simply take more and more information to give people the freedom to do what they want without restriction. This is a huge problem because centralized control of data cannot be easily controlled.
