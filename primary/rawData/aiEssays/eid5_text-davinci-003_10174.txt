Narciso Rodriguez's memoir From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives is full of rich feelings of nostalgia and melancholia. Throughout this work, Rodriguez conveys a wistful atmosphere that speaks to the inescapable influence that home and legacy have on our lives. Each chapter traverses a different experience that took shape under the shadow of these forces while providing a snapshoot of Rodriguez's life up until that point. 

The narrative of the memoir suggests feelings of sadness, reflection, and nostalgia across its entire scope. Through his words, Rodriguez presents a mood of deep emotion, one that is rooted in memories of his distant and not-so-distant past as well as the austerity and beauty of his Cuban roots. This feeling of loss is a constant presence throughout, from the sense of sacrifice that his parents put towards providing for their family to the glimpses of what life could have been had circumstances been different.

Alongside these sorrowful notes, Rodriguez also manages to capture feelings of positivity and personal strength. He recounts moments of joy - such as those associated with his brother's first steps and his first time visiting Cuba - and shows how such moments made him view his home life with love and appreciation. The overall outcome of the memoir is one of a bittersweet homecoming, as Rodriguez is able to celebrate the lives that his family have lived and the impact that they have had on him even as he mourns the injustices that they endured.
