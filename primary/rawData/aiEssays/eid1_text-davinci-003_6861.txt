Censorship in library collections has become a hotly debated topic in recent years. On one hand, libraries are sanctuaries for learning and everyone should have access to all materials, meaning no government or outside body should have authority to censor materials. On the other hand, libraries have a responsibility to keep patrons safe from offensive and potentially damaging material. 

It is important to draw a line between censorship and protection when it comes to materials being offered at libraries. Certainly, certain materials should not be available for patrons, including those that are too graphic or contain offensive language or propaganda. Mental health can certainly be put at risk when exposed to materials that contain inappropriate language or violence. 

Additionally, library materials should reflect the diversity of the community they serve. Libraries should make it their responsibility to include works from a wide range of authors and cultures in order to promote understanding and appreciation of different backgrounds and beliefs. If a certain piece of material is unable to be acquired, that should be addressed and a substitute should be offered.

All in all, censorship is a difficult but necessary part of library collections. A balance should be struck between making sure patrons are exposed to appropriate materials, while still providing a variety of works that can help to cultivate understanding and appreciation of different cultures and topics. It is important that library staff be mindful of what materials end up on the shelves, and to ensure that all patrons have safe and enjoyable access.
