I had been living in my new city for a little over 3 months when I decided to go out with some friends to a local bar. As the night went on, I noticed a cute girl in the corner, laughing with her friends. I started talking to her and soon enough we were hitting it off. Conversation flowed naturally and every topic we approached seemed to leave us both in fits of laughter. I was absolutely captivated by her and as I confessed to her I could see a sense of surprise coupled with a charming smile on her face.

Eventually, as our conversation kept going we noticed that our drinks were running empty and one of us had to end the conversation and go get new drinks. We both got up and, as we walked to the bar, we shared long glances and smiles that expressed so much more than words. As we said goodbye, she let out a mischievous giggle as she said something about me not forgetting where she was sitting.

That quirky sense of humour she had brought out the best in me and that evening is something that Iâ€™ll never forget.
