The United States Supreme Court held that the National Archives and Records Administration should not be barred from censoring anything it deemed inappropriate for a government institution such as the University of Pennsylvania. On October 14, 1976, the same court ruled that the National Archives and Records Agency in Montgomery, MD, and the Department of Defense were overbroad and must be sued for excessive and intrusive enforcement of privacy rights.

National Archives, no matter how narrow the ruling could possibly turn out, and to have decided that the National Archives and Records Administration must regulate pornography but not for it to be "incapable of control."

That decision was followed by a majority opinion in United States v. Drexler, which held that a statute barring publication of any part of the personal history of a member of Congress without proper permission, "does prohibit the government from using or otherwise attempting to use any person for purposes that it considers to be a part of the government."
