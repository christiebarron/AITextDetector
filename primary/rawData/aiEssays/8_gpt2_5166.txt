One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was just an 18-year-old freshman. I wasn't at my best all year, but at least my friend and fellow Yale student Ryan Moore wanted for me to play a bunch of football.

On that play, I was caught off guard by an offensive lineman who was obviously coming off of a blow to my jaw, throwing out the ball too far for me to make a play. I tried to copied the play he was making, but it had me scratching my head a little bit and I thought to myself, 'Damnit. I should've been looking for another way of blocking'. That was probably the most terrible thing that happened in college football, but if it was there, it'd be worse.

I wasn't really a big football fan during college and I didn't like my teammates. However when it comes to play of this kind, I love football and don't think it's really good because I'm always on the edge and it's a scary game to watch. I love the play and the defensive backfield. But on the last thing I want is for them to run in front of me, so I try to throw the ball more than I do with some of the other players.

When you get a chance, I'm glad it's the NCAA tournament. I think it's going to help everyone. But I'd go to the NCAA tournament one more time, maybe two years or three
