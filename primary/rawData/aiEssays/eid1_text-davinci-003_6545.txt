Dear Editor,

I am writing in regards to the effects computers have on society and the continuously growing reliance on them. It can be argued that computers have made life more convenient, and likely easier for many individuals. The technology has enabled us to access an unprecedented amount of information from any location and allowed us to communicate with people all around the world with ease.

However, not all of the effects have been favorable. With the increasing use of computers and other technological devices has come an increase in sedentary lifestyles and less physical activity. Social media use has caused a disconnect from reality and fostered a false sense of connection and belonging. It has also caused mental health issues such as anxiety and depression in many individuals.

Being aware of the negative influences of computers is of the utmost importance. We should strive to balance out the digital activities that children engage in with physical activities. Parents should supervise the amount of time that their children spend in front of a computer and the content that they are exposed to. 

I believe that computers can, in moderation, be beneficial to both individuals and society; however, they also have an undeniable negative effect on people if their use is too frequent or unregulated.

Yours Sincerely, 
[Your name]
