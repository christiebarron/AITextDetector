The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They feared they might be damaged by the lack of power to move cars. And they hoped that the builders could be able to replace faulty equipment for the new work.

The most important of course was the fact that the building could be converted into a functioning museum. This opened up many options other than the one used for the American government. The building should also house a research centre for the history of the military, and would give young scholars a great opportunity to share and learn about the ways in which the military led to great things. It could also house an important museum.
