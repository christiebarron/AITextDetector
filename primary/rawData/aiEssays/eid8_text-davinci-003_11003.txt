I remember I was out to dinner with my old friend Andrew. We were reminiscing about some of our craziest memories and had already shared a few good laughs. It was then that I made a joke referencing something he said a few years ago. It must have seemed like I had an incredible memory, because he immediately burst out laughing hysterically and addressing the table said “He remembers things! That's hilarious!”

We howled with laughter for what seemed like ages and even after the laughter eventually died down, we were both still grinning from ear to ear. I'm sure the other diners also enjoyed our laughter as it echoed in the air.

The evening grew longer as we traded stories and enjoyed meals together. At the end of the night when it was time for us to part, we hugged each other tightly, knowing that all those moments of shared laughter had brought us closer than ever.
