I recently had to work with my co-worker on a big project. She had a completely different approach to the project than I did and it was really frustrating because it meant we had to work twice as hard just to compromise. Even when I was feeling upset and discouraged, she stayed calm and patient with me. She kept reminding me that it was okay to make mistakes and that we can take our time to go over every detail before finalizing the project. Eventually, we ended up completing the project on time and it was a great success. She taught me the value of being patient and her willingness to work collaboratively with me was indicative of her patience.
