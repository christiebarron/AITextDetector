 

I remember when my wife and I first started dating. We would spend hours just talking and laughing together. It felt like no matter what we were talking about, we would end up laughing about it. It made me feel so comfortable being around her, like I could be myself and I wouldn't have to worry about being judged.

We had been together for a few weeks and were planning our first weekend away together. She had mentioned going to a comedy club and I figured, why not? I was nervous as the night progressed, not knowing what to expect. When the first comedian took the stage, my nerves only heightened.

But then it happened. He said something funny, and I laughed. Not just a little chuckle, I laughed full out until tears were streaming down my face. My wife looked at me in shock, then started laughing too. We both laughed so hard we had to leave the show early.

To this day, that remains one of my favorite moments with my wife. Years later, we still laugh about it every now and then. It was like a turning point in our relationship, and I know it was our shared laughter that brought us even closer together.
