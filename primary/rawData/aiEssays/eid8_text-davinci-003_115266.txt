I had just moved into the city about a month ago. It was the start of summer and days with clear blue skies and warmth that stretched until sunset. I had promised my best friend Jenny from home that I'd check out a hip rooftop lounge that had recently opened. She promised me I would love it, so I decided to make a night of it and invite my new colleague from work who I had become friendly with.

Neither of us had much experience with bars, but we decided to brave it together. We ordered a couple of drinks and soon got talking and laughing. I was amazed that neither of us had noticed the other's sense of humour or that we shared similar interests.

As the night went on, we continued to laugh. I remember my colleague and I doing some silly dance moves, trying our hardest to deliver a perfect funky dance routine. It was a night of laughter, from silly jokes to silly dance moves. We laughed as hard and as uncontrollably till the bar was about to close and I was holding my stomach in pain.

It was a night of finding new things in common and discovering the joys of friendship and laughter. I can still remember how happy I felt that night, knowing that I had made a new friend even while I was far away from home. It had been a great first experience with the rooftop lounge, and showed me just how far laughter can travel.
