The building of the Empire State Building in New York City in 1931 was a momentous occasion for the city and for the country. The sheer enormity of the skyscraper made it an icon of modern engineering and design. While the building itself had many remarkable features, one of the more notable was the plan to allow dirigibles – commonly known as airships – to dock on the top of the building. This plan, however, was not without its challenges. 

The most immediate obstacle faced by the architects and engineers was the structural considerations. The mast, or “mooring mast”, was 125 feet in height and situated at the top of the Empire State Building’s 86th floor, making it one of the tallest masts in the world. Faced with the challenge of ensuring that not only the building itself could support the weight and stress of the dirigibles, but that the mast could be likewise structurally sound, the team of engineers incorporated the latest advances in wind dynamics. They also made sure to use high-grade steel and weather-resistant materials.

Another challenge was ensuring that the dirigibles themselves could safely dock onto the mast. The dirigible pilots had to be trained and certified in the proper techniques in order to make the moorings. Making matters more complicated, the building’s location at the center of the bustling city meant that safety precautions were especially unavoidable. To that end, the building’
