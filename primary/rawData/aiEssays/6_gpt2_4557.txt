The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Most notably, the Empire State Building's ceiling was quite thin, so there were plenty of openings for a passenger seat as well as a large open-air concourse with restrooms, dining and medical facilities in many parts of the building, and in some cases, a bathroom. In addition, there were also not an abundance of spaces for patients. In fact, many of the concourses were set on fire, resulting in severe damage to structures, such as the Empire State Building from 1924 down to 1983. The original building's original ceiling was cut from its original, pre-fabricated form, with cut-out panels that provided access.

The Empire State Building built in the early 1950s was an architectural masterpiece. The original plan featured a central balcony and glass-faced doors. A major addition to the Empire State Building was the second roof, designed by architects Michael M. Davis and Albert Adrien, which allowed the Empire State Building to easily cross the skyline, with views of the California coast. At some point thereafter, the Empire State Building was converted into a 2,700-room hotel; in the early 1960s, the building was also renamed the "Tattoo House." In the 1960s, the Empire State Building's second stairwell was redesigned to match the modern-style elevators that its second floor had seen for over a century.
