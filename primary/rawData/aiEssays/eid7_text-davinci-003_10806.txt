I was recently on a road trip with some of my friends when we got stuck in a massive traffic jam. We had been stuck for hours and had no idea how long it would take for the traffic to clear.

At first, everyone was getting really frustrated, yelling out in frustration and making more and more restless. I decided that I needed to stay calm and keep everyone else calm too since getting angry wouldn't do anything to help us get out of the situation.

I reminded my friends and myself to keep patience and take a moment to breathe and relax. I reminded everyone to think positively, telling us that the traffic was likely to clear soon and that we would set off again in no time.

My friends appreciated my patience and eventually, they too, started to take a deep breath and look on the brighter side. I am sure that without my patience, things could have boiled over and the situation would have been a lot more tense and frustrating. 

Thankfully, after over an hour of being stuck, the traffic cleared and we could get back on our way. I'm glad that I had the patience to stay calm and help my friends to stay calm in the situation.
