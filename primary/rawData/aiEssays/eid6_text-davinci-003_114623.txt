The Empire State Building was a remarkable achievement of the early 20th century, and of particular note was its mooring mast, which was designed to accommodate passenger-carrying dirigibles. However, the process of allowing them to dock was fraught with obstacles.

The first obstacle was the design of the mast and the dock itself. The mast was tall and slender and could accommodate vessels up to 805 feet in length. It was fitted with two steel mooring cables with claws that had the ability to grab the mooring rings of the dirigible, securing it to the mast. A large hanger was attached to the mounting mast where dirigibles could be loaded and unloaded. This hanger was elevated so that dirigibles only needed to dock one hundred feet from the ground, far less than the 900 feet that had been the norm for earlier dirigible docks.

A second obstacle involved the weather. The mast was designed to withstand strong winds and could accommodate winds up to sixty miles an hour. However, due to the unpredictable nature of weather in New York City, it was difficult to ensure the safety of a dirigible at the mooring mast. One way that the builders addressed this obstacle was by keeping the mooring mast enclosed in a tall, windproof dome, thus making it more secure from the wind. 

The third obstacle was the air traffic that the dirigibles had to maneuver through. The air space around the
