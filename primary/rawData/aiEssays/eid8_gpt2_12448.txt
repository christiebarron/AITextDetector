One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I heard somebody say I had a terrible idea. It must be a stupid joke. We all know and love this kind of humor. I was a little scared. I did not realize now the amount of laughter I've had so far.


The good news is it was not as good with your body as I thought it would be (it should be slightly better). It was an adjustment and a way to let the laughter show and go. It worked. I still have the strength of mind and body to be even more intelligent. We live in our own lives and we must learn how to accept and use that as well as others. Some may say I believe my body is a perfect place to start taking that as our true love and we cannot let it pass. I hope to make you better as I am.


Now, do you have any advice for a couple who do not use humor on a daily basis (I don't think we should do it at all) or do it as a little piece of a larger plan. I know it can be painful but it will help you. Please tell others.

He has the weight of the truth in him too.


It may be that some of them don't get it through the weight of their ignorance, but just knowing is not
