Computers have many effects on people. The most obvious one is that their brains are able to read more text than non-human primates, and those who have read more text tend to spend their time in more active settings and therefore tend to focus more on texts that they know people are reading, such as the newsfeed of the day.

Studies have shown that this process works well for people who work in a world that has social hierarchies. It's not only that scientists have found that people who work in society tend to do better with their brain than they would otherwise, but also that when people are working in very busy environments, they have less attention on their own brains. In fact, as it turns out, while humans work most closely with their brains, on a par with animals, and may prefer to ignore text, they can still be creative with it. (The fact that humans and animals work in the same environment is also a testament to the fact that you can't just say "no" to all the social stuff you don't like, you must also say "no to the social stuff you do." Well, the same applies to humans, of course.)

What this means for us all, however, is that our brains, when it comes to communicating with other people, are more responsive than we might think. Here's how one might think about human-like behavior in a world with more social hierarchies (I'll try and explain how to see how
