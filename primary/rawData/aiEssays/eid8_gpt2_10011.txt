One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was 15 on my family trip to Japan with my older brother. His grandfather came along and I remember it at the time: "Hello. We would all like to introduce you." His name was Masahiro, the main character for us all. I knew all that he would say, and we didn't. He could give me some advice to keep my head up. I was just lucky. He just wanted to remind me it's your job to keep your head up, and I had to see him in action. I was excited. He just didn't have any special powers, so I kept wanting to learn more. I remember thinking some of the more subtle things I did—beyond looking for the next word—didn't work. But during that time, I got into it some more. Now it works, my friends say. I had a hard time doing it—when a few words I had were too difficult to follow or learn. A lot of time it just took me in.
