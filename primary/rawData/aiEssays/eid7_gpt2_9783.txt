An example of a time someone in my life was patient was one that was a little bit patient. I remember seeing this woman get up when it was cold all night at 6 in the morning. Her doctor said, "Well, maybe this may be why you have red blood cells like in the cold blood?" I remember sitting in the hallway all afternoon when the cold starts to fall and I felt a chill down my spine. My therapist told me all this was about to get real. And that day, when he said 'cold blue blood cells like the cold blue blood cells cause you the cold blisters, the stuff that makes you sick,' all I heard was 'you're cold blue blood cells," and when he asked, 'What's that?' I said, 'Well, you have this big white fluid to get it out of your blood, we'll see."

The last person I met on a night out, at one point, was somebody who didn't have diabetes. She didn't drink, she didn't smoke, she just had that terrible, bad reaction to medication so she had to take it out. So she went out there as an escape. And when I met her, she didn't look as cool as I did.

Then came the person who is now me. And I have to ask that person if she has diabetes. Because she isn't going to see me again.
