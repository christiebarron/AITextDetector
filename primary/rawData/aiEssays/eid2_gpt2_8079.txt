I believe that censorship of materials in libraries can work to prevent any serious intellectual discussion. But as with most things in life when it comes to copyright infringement, our ability to defend ourselves might be restricted; we might not get the protection we need to stand up for what we hold sacred.

I do not believe, however, that the current legislative system is a good tool to guard intellectual property rights which many people already enjoy. In the sense that the very foundation of free society is a strong desire to share in information in ways which facilitate free expression, there are ways in which we could go about such a process without damaging the First Amendment. But there is more to copyright and censorship than simply keeping an eye on what is being read or hearing while you are on the street.

While I believe that it is difficult to protect people from the consequences of their behavior without creating fear and confusion among others, as a result of the growing awareness of the power of a small minority of public officials, my views on copyright and censorship raise serious questions for all of us. I believe that these considerations need to be assessed carefully, but whether we can achieve such a goal is another matter altogether.

So, my request is that you consider these issues yourselves and ask who and what you think you are protecting by blocking the expression of these sacred ideas.
