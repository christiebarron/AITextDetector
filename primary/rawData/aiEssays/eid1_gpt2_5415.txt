Computers have many effects on people. They will alter their actions to conform to it, and their actions will be more and more destructive than the ones that they previously experienced. But what happens when a computer learns that something no one knows, and suddenly learns it's a lie?

You can be very confident that there will be no way to correct this. But there is a point where that becomes more important. When you come to the point you're about to see how computers and their technology do things. And your computer says "hey, look, it's just like when I was with [Bin Laden], it was all a lie. I was with him, I was with bin Laden." That's not a problem if you talk to other people now. But what if you're an accountant and there's an employee of the New York Stock Exchange running a fraud company that has a client that's in charge of all that? What if there were nobody who knows that that person is hiding money in Saudi Arabia? That's what he's doing. That's not the point. The point is to find the next one. You look around your office. All kinds and kinds of people are saying, "Well, this is a big problem."

And to really understand all of those things comes to really profound insight, and we have a very specific idea of that insight that people call "the power of the mind": you are not a person. You have no power as far
