I remember it as the happiest evening of our relationship. We were staying at a cabin in the woods for my birthday. All day we had been exploring the trails and the nearby meadows, talking and getting to know each other better. 

At the end of the day, we decided to relax by the fire. We were sharing stories from our past, and I must admit I was holding back a lot of laughter. But then, something happened. I told him a funny story about my family growing up and he suddenly burst out laughing. 

The sound of him was so contagious, that I thought I would never be able to stop laughing. We ended up rolling on the floor, both of us in stitches, barely able to breathe. 

We were both people who were kind of shy and introverted but this shared laughter brought us closer in a way you can't explain. That night was the start of the most beautiful relationship I've ever had. We both felt that, and it was all thanks to laughter.
