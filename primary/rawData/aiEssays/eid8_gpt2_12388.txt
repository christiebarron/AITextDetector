One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was a kid. The first time I was struck by my fear of being laughed at. Even now, I like to laugh at myself. I think I've been blessed for living with that and being able to look up at others and not think about myself in the way that you might get in school. I've been blessed with having that in my soul, in my body.

If I could, I would say, thank you, Jesus, for your help and for bringing me peace with one's body. I would say thanks for finding peace when I get angry, and I would say a prayer of peace and patience for those who are hurting and who are going through a difficult time.

If I could go somewhere else to find peace, I would come back in peace.

This year has proven amazing as a result of the growth of my group. With everyone from our parents, my husband, to my friends and our daughters and I, we have experienced the growth that comes with being in a group of three. I am a wonderful person. I will always love the girls. Thank you for all of the support you have given me.
