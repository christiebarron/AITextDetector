The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' in that episode of "Shows Off The Movie" has changed from one where his character went through three seasons of writing to now one where he's written 15. While some readers may like to give up his writing and the sense of his life and self-worth, the feeling of being back to something of his past is certainly not going to leave him with anything better than this kind of despair.

As for me, I loved 'From Home', and feel it to be one heck of a work. I feel the writing has been one of the most fun part of the book's journey. As a writer, I've watched a lot of things die for me. The whole book was dedicated mainly to my two year old daughter and the entire time, her words were coming from the heart of this novel. All that's written from my heart are the memories that I see in her head, trying to express the joy that my baby had to hear from the same people as he had to see. Each of these voices is not my fault, but they've been given the most emotional experience of one of the biggest things I've read.

If anyone knows of another best way to write or have experience with such a project please let us know. If you'd like more insight into 'Loving You,' look for 'The Art of Writing.'
