The Empire State Building was conceived in 1929 as an example of engineering and architectural prowess that would not only make a lasting impression, but also serve as a symbol of hope during the difficult years of the Great Depression. As the tallest building in the world at the time, one of the Empire State Building’s most iconic features was its location – perched atop a hill in Manhattan – with dirigible docks at the top.

The idea of a docking station for dirigibles atop the Empire State Building presented many engineering challenges. Firstly, the building had to be strong enough to accommodate the considerable weight of the ships, and this required extensive reinforcement of the steel structure. Furthermore, extreme weather conditions would be encountered at high altitudes, such as high winds and freezing temperatures, and thus the docks had to be able to withstand these harsh conditions.

Due to the wireless communications technology of the 1930s, cable systems had to be put in place so that ships could communicate with the ground stations. The cables had to be routed safely, so they did not interfere with the airships, nor were a safety hazard to pedestrians, vehicles, or other dirigibles in the area.

In order to accommodate the heavy aircraft, the designers of the docking station had to consider how the ships might decelerate and dock safely. To ensure this, the average wind speed had to be below 75 mph and the pressure differential between the interior and exterior of the building had to be carefully controlled
