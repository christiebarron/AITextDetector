The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They considered turning the building into an experimental space station when it was built. As late as 1945, U.S. President Richard Nixon ordered plans for a test and production of a "Flying Saucer" using a rocket propelled aircraft. Though the Soviets would not develop a space station for a manned launch vehicle, the Soviets did develop a shuttle. After the end of World War II, engineers in the U.S. government developed another design that was called the "Falcon" which could be used for low earth orbit. In January 1947, President Clinton became the first president from behind a glass wall. His beaches, seas and golf courses dotted with American flags and balloons attracted millions of visitors. The construction company of the Lockheed Martin Corporation built the facility and began construction in 1955. The second-generation Falcon was used in the launch of the U.S. Strategic Air Command. A new model was built of the Falcon to provide a more aerodynamically efficient and faster flying capability. In 1958, John F. Kennedy sent the U.S. military into the space race. The first American citizen to fly the Falcon in space was Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1958. Kennedy flew it for three days over Eastern Europe in 1962, taking the first flight over the Eastern Seaboard on July 20, 1962. Kennedy's flight, completed on April 7 enlarging the Eagle for use in space for four years and
