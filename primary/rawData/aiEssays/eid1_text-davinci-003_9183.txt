Dear Editor,

As technology advances, computers are becoming increasingly present in our lives. We rely on them to accomplish even the simplest of tasks such as checking the mail, and it's undeniable that they bring great benefits to our lives. But despite the conveniences of modern computing, I think we should be aware of the more subtle effects computers have on our lives. 

In the last decade, computer use has skyrocketed, and so have various physical and mental health problems like carpal tunnel syndrome, dry eyes, neck pain, and short-term memory problems. Spending too much time looking at a computer screen also affects the body's natural circadian rhythm, and can lead to insomnia or fatigue. In my opinion, this is unacceptable, especially considering the extent to which computers have become intertwined with both our professional and personal lives. 

I strongly believe that more reasonable regulations and enforcement should be implemented to protect people from the negative side effects of computer use. Additionally, I think it's essential for individuals to monitor their own level of computer use and set healthy limits for themselves. 

When used responsibly, computers can be a true blessing. But it's crucial that we all remain conscious of the potential pitfalls and protect ourselves from any potential harm that they could cause.

Thank you for your time,

[Your Name]
