The setting in ‘Rough Road Ahead’ by Joe Kurmaski plays an important role in affecting the cyclist’s experience. The setting reflects the elements of nature, which the cyclist interacts with throughout the journey. 

The cyclist has to deal with the harsh weather conditions such as the heat and the wind, which makes the ride difficult. This affects the cyclist’s performance as they have to fight against the elements to achieve their goals. The heat of the sun can make the cyclist tire quickly, while the wind can cause them to struggle to keep their balance. This presents an additional challenge and can make it harder for the cyclist to reach their goals. 

The setting also includes the terrain that the cyclist is navigating. The cyclist has to maneuver through a rough road that is filled with obstacles, such as potholes and rocks. This can slow the cyclist down and make them feel more strenuous. The cyclist’s speed is affected by the roughness of the terrain and they have to use extra energy in order to maintain momentum. 

The cyclist also has to deal with the element of time. As the night falls, the cyclist is at the mercy of the darkness and can no longer see the road clearly. This increases the danger of the journey and adds a sense of urgency to the ride. This can be used to create a feeling of urgency and tension within the story, as the cyclist has to keep pushing forward before darkness
