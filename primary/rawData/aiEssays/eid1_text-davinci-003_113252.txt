Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the impacts computers have on people and why readers should agree with me.

In todayâ€™s digital world, computers have become an integral part of our lives. They help us complete tasks more quickly and allow us to access information more quickly than ever before. However, they can also cause certain issues. For instance, too much time spent in front of a computer screen can lead to physical health problems such as eye strain and neck pain. In addition, the increased dependency on computers for certain tasks can lead to a decrease in cognitive skills. This is particularly true when it comes to communication. People are more likely to communicate through typed words rather than face to face. As a result, people are losing valuable social skills.

In conclusion, I believe that although computers can be very useful in our day to day lives, they can also have negative effects on people. I urge readers to be aware of the risks associated with computers and to use them in moderation to ensure that they are not putting their health at risk.

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
