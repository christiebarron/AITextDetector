Computers have many effects on people. First and foremost it is due to the increased levels of stress that humans experience. Secondly, in high stress situations when a computer is involved in something that impacts other people and your life. All of these factors produce the stress of being a victim of something you never take responsibility for.

A computer does not have a single purpose for life as far as I've witnessed. The most important point as to why I don't believe in a computer is I don't think that it would make a great computer. I don't think there would ever be a game that makes the PC perfect and yet it still feels wonderful.

In fact I think it might make the most sense to get one when it was just a cheap, fancy way to play the game. All you need is a computer that doesn't have to worry about playing the game. It would probably be better at playing the game if it was free since it would be free to go on and on in games with others who are doing it.

It could be great for both the PC and the PC itself and that is what I find great about the PC. I'll be using it until it is absolutely, absolutely impossible for me to ever play the game and as such I would be happy to go back, but I highly recommend it for the amount of enjoyment it provides.
