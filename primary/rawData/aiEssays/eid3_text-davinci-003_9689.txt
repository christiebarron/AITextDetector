In Joe Kurmaski's short story "Rough Road Ahead," the cyclist's experience is shaped by the features of the setting. The setting of the story, a dirt road full of broken asphalt, loose rocks, and bumps, influences the cyclist's journey. 

Throughout the story, the cyclist's progress is hindered by the difficult terrain. The ascent of the road is also a challenge. The cyclist has to use his gear to build up speed, then maintain a steady pace in order to make it up the steep incline. This is made more difficult by the loose gravel and bumps; he often has to come to a near stop in order to get up such an incline. The wind also plays a role in slowing down the cyclist's progress. The wind is strong and gusty, a challenge to overcome as the cyclist rides. 

The setting also adds to the sense of isolation and solitude that the cyclist experiences. He passes no one, and the landscape is empty and silent. This adds to the sense of uncertainty and dread that the cyclist feels. He is aware that he could be stopped at any moment, and the lack of other people in the area only emphasize the feeling. 

The features of the setting in "Rough Road Ahead" play a significant role in shaping the cyclist's experience. The terrain restricts his progress, and the wind prevents him from gaining any speed. The isolated landscape adds to the feeling of uncertainty and despair. Together
