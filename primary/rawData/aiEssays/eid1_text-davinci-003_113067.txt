Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects that computers have on people's lives.

In today's world, it is almost impossible to imagine life without computers. We've grown so accustomed to their convenience and efficiency, and it's easy to understand why people rely on them so much.

However, I believe that computer use can have a negative effect on people, as well. Computers can cause people to be more isolated from the real world and each other. We tend to spend more of our time working and interacting with technology than we do with in-person relationships. With the lack of interaction and communion, we can become unaccustomed or uncomfortable to the nuances of engaging with people and being a part of the larger society.

In addition to this, computers offer modern conveniences, such as online shopping and classes, which can increase spending and stress levels. It's easy to get caught up in the online world and to start to crave instant gratification and material comforts. The games and activities that can be found online can also become addicting and might take away from other, more meaningful, activities.

Overall, technology, and particularly computers, have a mixed effect on people's lives. On the one hand, computers can help us access important information and can be a valuable tool, but they also come with drawbacks such as isolation, increased spending, and addiction. I hope that readers can see the importance of keeping things
