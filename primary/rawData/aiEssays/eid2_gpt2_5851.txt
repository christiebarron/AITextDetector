I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is an important part of the free expression of ideas. But it's important for teachers to acknowledge that such censorship was actually a deliberate tactic to achieve one's ideological ends and to maintain a fair and open debate about them. Some examples (with no censorship involved) include:

• Disposable items like books and CDs: A ban on the sale of such items is common in our democracy because libraries allow free expression through a system of restrictions. The Library Federation of America did stop the sale of the contents of books by state libraries when it came to the collection of federal educational documents, and it is no longer allowed to do so. We believe that such a ban was deliberate and will not be tolerated.

• Libraries, like the government itself, are subject to the lawignment law. When the books that the government has purchased violate the law of the State of New York or of public schools as a whole, such purchases violate the right to free expression and therefore an individual's freedom of expression and the freedom to think for themselves. We believe it is unlawful for private citizens who buy books which are held within a class of books to engage in the same activity that other students in the class perform. In many years, the government could no longer purchase book on demand items of books that are not available in the market for the same price. In this respect, libraries should not be doing their job when it comes to publishing books that have been approved for
