Dear Editor:

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects that computers have on people. I am firmly of the belief that computers have changed our lives in many positive ways.

For one, computers have provided us with a consistent and affordable form of communication. Now, people can easily stay connected no matter the distance, even internationally. In addition, compared to having to physically shop for items, computers bring a certain level of convenience, allowing people to order items online whenever they may need them, from anywhere.

Another positive effect of computers is that they have become a source of entertainment for many people, especially with the rise of gaming platforms. People have been able to come together online and have full virtual experiences, allowing for an improved social life. Furthermore, computers have enabled easier access to education and resources, allowing more people to pursue higher education and research topics.

One significant effect computers have had, however, is their effect on our concentration levels. An extended amount of time sitting in front of a screen an exert unnecessary levels of stress on the mind, resulting in difficulty concentrating or absences thereof. Too much time on a computer without breaks or mental exercises can be detrimental to one’s health.

To combat this, it’s essential to take regular breaks away from the computer screen and to set time restrictions on the hours one spends in front of it each day. Discipline in the way we use our computers is of utmost importance in
