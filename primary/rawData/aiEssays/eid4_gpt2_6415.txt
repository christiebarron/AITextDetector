The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because of the unique way the language evolved as a child. We have an important chapter on the origins of Hibiscus and the history of language. It is great advice to our children in math and science, but also to anyone out there wanting an advanced, hands-on guide to the language of language. So if it's important, check it out and please share it with others.
