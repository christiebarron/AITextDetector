An example of a time someone in my life was patient was an accident in the middle of a shooting. He was lying back down, trying to make himself look more safe and that 2600-series rifle. And that gun was there to kill a person.

You also had one gun in your belt. I'm going to ask the family. The wife said she's never been on a mission like this.

You also had two guns. She's an accomplished writer. She has an excellent degree of experience in law enforcement. One other wife worked as a security guard at a security firm and it was her job to protect people. I remember being in an emergency room and she found an intruder. I've done interviews.

You have a young girl in your life who has a very tragic accident. Now you call an ambulance and say you're sorry. But the thing that struck me when I started doing all of the interviews is that she was just very sick.

You also went back to her home a short while ago, and you say she was really, really depressed about the accident. Is that the same thing that you saw with your son? Is your child being victimized by strangers on a daily basis, trying to take pictures?

The answer to that question is yes.

You also had a couple people in your household with severe mental illnesses. It's not surprising that you went all the way back to a very, very young age.
