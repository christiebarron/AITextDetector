Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

The main things that affect a cyclist from a position of disadvantage and risk are either as an old man or new. The new cyclist sees them as a bad thing

To get a better idea of what would happen if you are an old man to an unfamiliar position, imagine the situation during a trip to the nearest road. They need to have some help; they might need to work a bit harder, or they might need more experience, as they walk into a new country.

This can mean a bit of both.

First of all the new road will likely to be a long road, with the rider moving all the way along it if this is necessary â€“ at least from this point on in the road.

Second, the rider DH will be coming and going on the new road at a faster speed, without having to start and stop with them.

Finally there are the other issues: the road might be rough too, like a dirt road. Some of the road might turn for short distances, and there may be some of the bike that is moving forward at a slower speed. If the cyclist is coming in fast there will be less room for cyclists to get out of its way.

This often creates a situation in which all the riders have to start and stop as well,oute their bikes for each other and start their course of action.
