I have a vivid memory of one of the funniest moments of my life. It was in my middle school years, so the situation was that nerve-wracking mix of awkwardness, hormones, and trying to fit in.

I had invited my best friend over to watch a movie. We were sprawled out on the couch, and I was nervously rustling with the popcorn every few moments in an attempt to impress her. 

Out of nowhere, I tripped over the corner of the rug and fell flat on my face! When I turned around, my friend was already doubled over in laughter. I couldn't help but join in, and soon I was laughing just as hard she was. We must have laughed for about five minutes straight, until tears were streaming down our faces and we were red in the cheeks. 

Even though nothing all that spectacular happened, that moment has stuck with me as a hilarious one. To this day, it's one of my favorite memories I have with my friendâ€”two people, happy and connected by something as simple as laughter.
