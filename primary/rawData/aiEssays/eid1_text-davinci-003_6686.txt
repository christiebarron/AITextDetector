Dear Editor,

As a longtime reader of your newspaper, I am writing today to express my opinion on the drastic effects computers have had on humanity.

For many of us, computers have become an integral part of our daily lives. We rely on them for work, entertainment, and communication. But as essential as they are, it is hard to ignore the negative effects that computers have had on us. 

For starters, there have been numerous studies showing how computer devices are affecting our mental health, making us more isolated and anxious. People have become increasingly dependent on computer-related activities such as gaming and online shopping. We are no longer actively engaging with our friends and family in the real world but instead have retreated to our digital lives. This kind of lifestyle is not just unhealthy, it is hindering our development as people.

Whatâ€™s more, computers and the internet have made us lazy. We no longer have to go out and search for information or find ways to entertain ourselves; we can just type a few words into a search bar and be presented with an abundance of information and activities. This kind of convenience has led to a decrease in critical thinking and problem-solving skills, leading us to become passive consumers of information.

Therefore, it is essential that we become more conscious of our use of technology before it is too late. We must understand that although computers can make our lives easier, they can also have serious consequences.
