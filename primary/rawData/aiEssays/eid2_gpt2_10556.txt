Libraries will be made into "facilities" that "ensiorate the security of the people, maintain the dignity of academic education and the rule of law," the statement added.

The statement calls for public participation in the education of books, which it notes are in the public domain in some countries, and for "facility" services that bring people together by facilitating dialogue and exchange.

The statement asks governments and the public to respond to the public interest, and the aim is to improve books "fostrategically in an innovative way without compromising on the freedoms available to everyone."
