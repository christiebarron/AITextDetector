I have a great memory of a time when I shared a moment of laughter with someone who I was close to. It was a really sunny afternoon, and I was sitting playing a game with my brother in the garden. We were playing a game where we were trying to solve a tricky puzzle that was written on a piece of paper.

As we got more and more into the game, the tension between us grew as neither of us could solve the puzzle and the frustration was beginning to show. Thatâ€™s when out of nowhere, a funny thought crossed my mind and I started to giggle. Soon enough, my brother realized what I was laughing about and started to laugh too.

Now all of a sudden the tension that had been building between us had dissipated and we were both laughing uncontrollably. We were laughing so hard that soon we were rolling around on the ground, unable to contain our joy. It was such a special moment, and I will always remember it.

The laughter was so genuine and so sincere, it was something that only could have been created between siblings. It was one of those few moments where no other person in the world could understand the depth of the laughter but us. We just looked at each other with so much love and appreciation. 

Laughter really is the shortest distance between two people, and this funny moment with my brother is something that I will always hold dear to my heart.
