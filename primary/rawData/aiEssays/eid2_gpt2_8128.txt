I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is important for the well-being of society.

"As we are becoming increasingly aware of the increasing prominence of censorship in the form of content regulation, I think it would be interesting to see more research which examines how a range of different types of protection in libraries has influenced or, at least influenced, how a library has grown."
