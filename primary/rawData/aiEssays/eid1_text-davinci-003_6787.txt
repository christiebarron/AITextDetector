Dear editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the far-reaching and often controversial effects that computers have on people in our modern age. Computers have an inextricable link to our daily lives, be it for work or leisure. This increased reliance on technology has presented certain issues which should not be ignored.

On the one hand, computers have revolutionalised the workplace, allowing people to automate mundane tasks and automate processes more efficiently. As a result, many tedious, manual jobs have been eliminated, and thousands of jobs have been created in technology-related fields. This level of automation can be beneficial to businesses and employees alike.

On the other hand, there are certain drawbacks of computers that are worth considering. Studies have shown that excessive exposure to computers can lead to numerous negative physical and mental health issues, such as stress, eyestrain, and overexertion. Furthermore, the increased reliance on computers can have an adverse effect on workplace morale and efficiency as employees become more reliant on computers instead of relying on their own skills and expertise.

In conclusion, I believe that computers can be hugely beneficial in boosting workplace efficiency and productivity. However, it is important to consider the potential downsides of computers and take steps to mitigate them.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
