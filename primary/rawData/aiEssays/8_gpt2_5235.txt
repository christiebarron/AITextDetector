One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was driving my bike along the path for a crosswalk. I did so for 10 days and never felt like it was at all necessary. I just heard it on the radio when I realized, that is, when this guy pulled up behind me and threw his arms around my neck, and my heart just went racing. In fact, the car would almost fall down on its side. It crashed on the spot, and my heart wasn't even able to get up. I was like, "I don't know where I'm going!" It wasn't even 100% safe. I was lucky I survived. The guy who pulled first came to my home, and a man standing outside the door said, "Look behind you, you look down here." The man didn't get up, and it wasn't long before he got to that other man. A few minutes later he was sitting across from me, and that's when it happened. It felt like it came from behind me. I did this for 10 days."

I knew what was coming. I know it's going to keep getting better, because I am still working on it!


G-S-F-Y-T

That's all for now. I have to come to terms with it again with life and it being about him. I also have to remember that I knew where I were going. So maybe I'll find a place where after
