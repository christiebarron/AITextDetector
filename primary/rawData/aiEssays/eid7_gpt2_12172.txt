An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I met with President Clinton and told him I was moving into New Jersey and I wanted to stay. He laughed, 'You never heard about that?' So I would have a conversation with him and his family about it. And then he just gave me one piece of advice in his book that didn't even exist to begin with.

It was the question: "What do you see to be done that is in the good (about) America?" Then this guy would say, "Nothing is good, but what is in the good stuff? What is in the bad stuff?"

So that was the first time his office told everyone about it, right? The great thing about it was people knew exactly what he was talking about. They knew that he knew everything about his health care (and) that he was an advocate for the whole country. But those were personal things that they could only see as a political gimmick. They knew something didn't really quite work because it was so easy to just pretend what it might be for a real president.
