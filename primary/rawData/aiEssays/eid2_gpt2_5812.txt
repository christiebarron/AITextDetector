I believe that censorship of materials in libraries does not promote free speech.

"I believe that censorship of material in libraries does not promote freedom of expression," the speech-related regulations say. They go on:

"In order for libraries, in order to promote their libraries of books, information, papers, dataâ€”it must provide information. Libraries must: a) provide libraries with materials for the purpose of obtaining information and, b) produce to the library a catalog of materials that would lead to libraries providing library members with information useful to them. "However, we do not claim to be neutral when considering the content of the materials being presented in library facilities. We focus on the materials or information that would lead to a certain level of freedom for a particular library," the regulations say. The regulations also claim to make clear that libraries must use criteria that "determine that materials which do not reflect the views of a particular community are relevant". These criteria include the content and, generally speaking, the content of the "information". The requirement that a library provide materials that would lead to libraries providing library members with information useful to them also may lead to libraries being less likely to charge copyright fees to their members.

It's worth noting not everyone agrees with the regulations. "No one can find any good justification for regulating the conduct of other free speech forums online and it is reasonable to expect other sites, especially those in a democracy of the Internet, to have similar standards or procedures
