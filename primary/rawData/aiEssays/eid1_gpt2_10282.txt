Computers have many effects on people. First and foremost, you'll learn how the brain makes sense of things. Second, when you study a stimulus—what you're exposed to, what you're exposed to, and what you like. You can then learn how your brain interprets it and that it also makes sense of things. A very complex stimulus can have hundreds or thousands of properties. A brain that only really understands this one can easily learn many more.

This, together with our previous series of examples, can explain why all kinds of things don't make sense to us. It's true that we can see things that they don't, like the way they have a certain color or texture or size that we don't understand. That might make us less interested and less interested in them, because of how we have sense of color or texture—there can be many, many things that people can't perceive and how these things fit in with our own intuitions and emotions—but if that's how the world works in that context, then it's not necessarily true. It's just that the brain doesn't understand what you were doing when you were out of it in the first place. The only thing that might make something that much better is that maybe that stimulus or behavior is not good—something that helps your brain to understand other things, that might well make things better.
