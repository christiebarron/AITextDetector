An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when she saw another woman being treated for an asthma attack. She described that experience as excruciatingly difficult for her. She didn't cry or feel sick, because the doctor didn't hear her, and they were just going to have her take a rest. Her voice was shaking because she recognized she did not have oxygen in her lungs and had difficulty breathing.

For my mother, this might still make sense to us in retrospect. We are still patients because she saw doctors often, didn't see them or cared deeply enough for the patient to feel her distress. Her heart was racing, and her mind was constantly spinning out ideas about how to cope with everything she was feeling.

I believe that in a world of "one-size-fits-all solutions," with different types of care, we may yet find more compassion. But as we continue to move on, it is crucial that we make sure there is an understanding so we can recognize how much we love and care for our fellow human beings.
