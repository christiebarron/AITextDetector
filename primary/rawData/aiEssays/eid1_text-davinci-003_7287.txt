The features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski’s story, “Rough Road Ahead,” have a direct and powerful effect on the protagonist, a cyclist. She is placed in an incredibly difficult situation, trying to navigate a long and dangerous road, all the while dealing with the difficulties of the terrain and factors out of her control.

The cyclist is set in a challenging environment with a road that is filled with potholes, steep hills, and sharp turns. The setting also has a night time effect, with darkness looming and the cyclist struggling to see ahead. The protagonist is also faced with badly maintained roads, where flat tires or an accident could be suddenly right around the corner. The treacherous nature of the setting is further built up by the few drivers that she encounters, giving her an ominous, threatening feeling.

The effect of this setting on the cyclist is one of fear and vulnerability. It puts her at a sense of disadvantage while trying to reach her destination. She is constantly aware of the dangers around her, the unpredictability of the road, and the loneliness that accompanies late nights on a secluded, rural road. It is a draining and tiring experience that leaves her struggling to find the inner strength to keep going and push through the next few miles.

Overall, Kurmaski’s narrative does a great job in setting up the cyclist’s challenge and allowing us to experience her journey. The features of the setting
