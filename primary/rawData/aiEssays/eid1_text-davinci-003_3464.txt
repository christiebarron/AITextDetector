Dear [Editor],

I am writing to express my opinion about the impact that computers have on people.

In today's world, computers are essential for carrying out work and staying connected. They have revolutionized how we communicate, shop, and entertain ourselves. While these advances have enabled us to do more in less time, they have also created a number of issues.

For example, the use of computers can have a negative psychological impact by increasing stress levels and reducing physical exercise. Time spent online can also reduce our social interaction, create cyberbullying, and expose us to an onslaught of advertisements. 

On the other hand, computers can be used for positive purposes such as playing educational games, creating websites, and providing students with a source of useful information. They are also valuable tools for carrying out research or tracking down old friends.

Overall, I believe that although computers have the potential to cause harm, their benefits should also be taken into consideration. They are powerful tools that can be used for good and should be used with moderation.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
