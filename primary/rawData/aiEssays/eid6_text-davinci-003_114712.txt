Constructed by Shreve, Lamb, and Harmon in 1930-1931, the Empire State Building was the world’s tallest skyscraper at the time. Its grand stature brought with it the desire to make the building more aeronautical friendly. As ideas of developing the mooring mast materialized, airship enthusiasts began proliferating around the building. In Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s book, The Mooring Mast, she provides insight into the obstacles faced in the endeavor to make the building Airship friendly.

The first obstacle was the lack of established safety guidelines on the matter. With airships having a reputation for burning, the safety regulations for mooring masts were severely lacking. This put the building in a difficult predicament because mooring a dirigible to a mast atop such a tall skyscraper could have disastrous consequences if something were to go wrong.

A second obstacle was the financial strain that would have been put on the building’s owners. The necessary costs to build and maintain a mooring mast, including the loading platforms, an elevator, and occupancy space, would have been high. Even if insurance policies were obtained, the risk of liability was still
