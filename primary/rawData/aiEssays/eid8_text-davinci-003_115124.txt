I remember being so nervous before my first date with my now long-term boyfriend. We had only ever interacted in brief conversations, like when we passed each other on our neighborhood street. After all, how do you explain the oddities of making a connection with a person without ever having been formally introduced? 

When we met that night, I remember him avoiding making eye contact and fiddling with his shirt. I too was quite nervous, as I had no idea what to expect. After a few moments of awkward silence, he finally said something that changed the entire tone of the evening. He asked me if I had ever watched that episode of The Office with the exploding churro. 

At that moment, we both burst into laughter and I found my nerves settling down into that familiar feeling of comfort and ease. In that moment, we connected. We were no longer strangers, but two people united by a mutual appreciation for humor. Feeling secure in our newfound connection, we started to discuss the episode and our favorite moments. We were so wrapped up in the conversation that we lost track of time and before we knew it, we had spent the entire evening laughing and talking. 

Looking back on that evening now, Iâ€™m reminded that laughter has a way of bringing people together and bridging the gap of distance between them. Laughter was the key to unlocking the connection between myself and my now long-term boyfriend, and I am forever grateful
