 

It was the summer before I left for college. I had decided to take a break from the hustle and bustle of college prep and spend some quality time with my twin brother. We had, throughout our life, been able to rely on each other for moments of laughter, like nobody else could.

We'd play pranks on each other, pull hilarious stunts, and even practice our stand-up comedy routines. One night, after a long day of sightseeing, my brother and I had settled down in our hotel room to take a break.

As we sat there, my brother suddenly began to laugh hysterically out of nowhere. I mean, how could I not laugh when I saw his face? His eyes were twinkling and his cheeks were starting to flush pink. It took me back to a time at camp when someone had been dared to go into the lake in the middle of the winter.

My brotherâ€™s laughter was contagious, and soon I was just as hysterical as he was. We laughed for what felt like an eternity, and it didn't stop until our stomachs hurt and our eyes had been turned into slits from our tight smiles. 

I will always remember that night as the moment our relationship grew even stronger. Laughter brings us together, whether we are playing pranks or just reminiscing about memories, like the one we had that night.
