The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In 1924 the first private passenger plane, the H-26, joined the military in 1927, and by 1926 it was the first American aircraft to fly on a single-engine jet.

Although the design took many alterations during those years, it was relatively new when it was first released. Unlike most military and commercial aircraft, the S-22 was capable of shooting down any of its crew members while it remained on the mission. The design of the F-35A (with the A-10 Super Fighter variant) was later added to the S-22 with some modifications. With just one aircraft, the F-35A performed its full combat role.

Another significant change was the increased amount of weaponry and firepower that could be carried. As a result of its larger size compared to its larger combat role, it was not possible to fully defend against a variety of enemy aircraft. This meant the S-22's lack of defensive capabilities made it less able to fight close in to other aircraft such as those on the Red River. Nonetheless, the F-35A was a crucial component of the US Navy's modern amphibious infantry warfare tactics.

The S-22's mission was to prevent the F-35A from falling into enemy hands, rather than to save the American navy's air force from destruction. In the Pacific the S-22 was the first aircraft that achieved both of
