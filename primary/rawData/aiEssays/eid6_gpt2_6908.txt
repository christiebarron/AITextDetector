The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They sought to prevent them from providing a direct or indirect solution to the problem.

One possible solution lay in having a system in which dirigibles could be stacked in a certain way. There were two types of dirigibles (Direxil, which was initially developed as an alternative to the use of conventional levitation), the first was an inexpensive two-person prop system that required a fixed amount of fuel, and the second, similar to the Duster, was constructed to run in one configuration. Both types of equipment could be used as a means of moving two or more units:

Direxil - Portable levitation system

Direxil 1: a type of prop

Direxil 2: a type of levitation system with limited fuel

Direxil 3: a type of prop that ran in two modes

Direxil 4: a type of levitation system that could use a fixed amount of fuel or could be moved on two or more ships. Only two units could be carried at a time. Each component could be connected to two of the other. Each unit could be equipped a second time and have a limited supply of fuel and a special system for moving units - this was intended for use in conjunction with a third person device.
