Dear Editor,

With the rapid influx of technology in our lives, I write to you today to discuss an issue many of us have faced: the effects computers have on people.

As a student and a working professional in the tech sector, I’ve seen first-hand how computers can be immensely helpful. They open up a world of countless opportunities – from staying connected with our loved ones across the globe to helping us advance professionally.

At the same time, however, I’ve also seen how computers can have detrimental effects on people if used too extensively. Spending too much time in front of a screen can be detrimental to our mental health – leading to sleep deprivation, stress, and an unhealthy dependence on technology.

That’s why it’s essential for us to take a step back and evaluate how computers are being used in our lives. We need to strike a balance between utilizing technology optimally to make our lives easier without it having a negative effect on our overall wellbeing. This can be achieved by limiting recreational computer time, setting healthy boundaries regarding when and how much time we spend in front of our computers, and creating routines that prioritize physical activities, socializing, and outdoor activities
