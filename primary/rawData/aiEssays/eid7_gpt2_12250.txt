An example of a time someone in my life was patient was an 8-year-old girl with a broken leg who had been diagnosed with a rare type of epilepsy and needed treatment. I'm sure she was a huge fan of my show, which always gives me hope that when I get my act together I can see how successful I could be. She's in the early stages of neurofibromatosis and I haven't known that in a long time.

She said that she had seizures when FANTASTIC was on, and that we were both trying to cope, and was in a constant struggle with the fact that we had always been so scared for her. We're both very, very busy, and bore some personal demons out of it, but we are all really in love today with my show and looking forward to its arrival. I'm glad that she's in a good place, as well, and I hope that that leads us to a good conclusion for my family.

As an aside, I just need to say that this was a crazy, amazing show, and that she is a great mother who helped turn it into a huge success. Thank you so much for the support, and we're looking forward to the next episode of my show on YouTube (I hate that word!).

In terms of her relationship with the show I've been lucky enough to have all of her own personal thoughts, so I hope that you have what it takes to help
