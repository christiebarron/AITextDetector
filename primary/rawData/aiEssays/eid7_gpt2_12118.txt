An example of a time someone in my life was patient was during the 1970's when I started working in the field. At a local gas station on Waverley, I took my own life trying to put my life back. I have been in many different incarnations, from my early adult life. I spent the last four decades trying to make my way back to more peaceful ways. And when I think back to excitement of being around the world I hope that the next person who is there will be able to remember why I was here, what kind of life it was like.
