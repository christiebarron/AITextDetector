An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was looking for help when there was a fire that had left the neighborhood. I looked inside. I went back to where I was located about three minutes later, and a person was working that thing off and we were just doing our job. That's when we realized we needed help, and we had the help of many people to do the job.

The fire, which had burned for three days, was not unusual – it was unprecedented since early spring in the San Antonio Valley. We had been living in this small area for just two months, and since then it had grown rapidly from there to just 40 square miles of ranchy, ranchy land.

But there were many other things happening in the area, too. The people who were driving the trucks were changing their lives and living the traditional lives – they were going to get a new life out of it. People were finding jobs, finding opportunities, raising families, and starting businesses in the communities that they were on the move from.

I think if you look at the people who were living on that tiny ranch, they were living the traditional life. When you bring that to life, it's just a wonderful moment. It's beautiful, and people are living that way even if it's not an incredible moment.

I did my research for the history of this place, and they had been very involved in this development for a few generations
