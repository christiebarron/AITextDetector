I was doing some grocery shopping one day when I noticed an elderly couple in line in front of me. As I watched them, they carefully surveyed their items, double-checking against their list to make sure they did not miss anything. As I waited in line, the cashier began ringing up the couple's items but had some difficulty on the last few things they bought as he was unsure about the price. The cashier seemed to be getting a bit frustrated and starting to rush them along as they could not seem to remember the price of each item.

I could tell that this was becoming overwhelming to them and that the cashier was becoming increasingly impatient. Knowing this, I decided to step in and intervene. I softly tapped the cashier on the shoulder and asked if I could help as I had noticed that this was taking a lot of time.

The cashier kindly accepted my offer as he was already running behind schedule. I quickly scanned through the items, and provided the prices from memory. He thanked me and smiled, and the couple thanked me too. I was so happy that I could help the couple out and that I was able to remain patient while doing so.
