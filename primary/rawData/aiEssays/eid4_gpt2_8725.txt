The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because of its strong historical, scientific and philosophical orientation. Despite the often-underplayed and highly speculative side to Winter Hibiscus, it is a truly interesting read. And the book is quite difficult to believe. In short, there is a very good story that can be read under a completely different light entirely.


Overall, read Spring Hibiscus for the first time and buy everything I need, then get excited about the next Winter Hibiscus. Recommended: Definitely check out the book!
