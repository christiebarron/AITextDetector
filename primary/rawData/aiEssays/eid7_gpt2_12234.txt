An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was pregnant. I took pictures of my daughter who was getting breastfed. In those photos is the moment that my daughter, a year old, did nothing but sit on the couch. In those photos is where the milk began. We saw babies coming in there. My friends gave me images of people taking pictures while I took those pictures. And, of course, I took pictures where the milk was not in use. For the rest of my life, I remember when I took those pictures.

On the other hand, you can tell that I'm not a good storyteller. I use the word "not funny" as much as I enjoy telling the truth of my character. And, as I said, I don't have that special voice of "not funny." But it's not like the media loves to think that I'm "not funny." It's not that, you know, when you go to a hospital or get to the emergency room where you are admitted because of your gender, you'll hear "I can't take pictures." There's that voice there, too. I don't have that special voice. For some reason, I'm not trying to be funny, I just want to bring to the people who need it, you know? And I get that because of other people that make that kind of stuff.
