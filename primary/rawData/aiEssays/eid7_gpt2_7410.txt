An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a boy who was hospitalized in a critical condition for over 8 months. I couldn't just send it to the doctor or I would have to tell them to wait. Once their period of illness was over, the patient was discharged.

But, when his doctor and his specialist arrived, there was a huge sense of community there and I became so attached to him that it was becoming hard to get him to see me.

So I came up with something really, really simple: let both clinicians and patients know that I was out there making them understand what was going on â€“ that we wanted to let them know that my illness was the end of my suffering. I was very happy, very excited, and I would do anything to help him to understand that.

A patient with severe brain damage had a family member with dementia in their home who had tried to help him heal but had been told that a local doctor had treated his brain without him.

It was my parents' son, and that was my biggest comfort for him. I made sure that, if he was in my care, he was treated the way he was, without putting himself in an unbearable risk of dying.

Dr Steve McCourt was born in New Zealand but moved to Australia because there was another doctor in Sydney who could treat him because that was where he grewups on the island.
