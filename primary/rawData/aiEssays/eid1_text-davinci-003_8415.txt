I was queuing up in a supermarket the other day when an old man in front of me dropped his wallet. He was fussing around, trying to pick it up, and being generally flustered when I stepped in and suggested that he take a moment to compose himself. I knelt down and started helping him collect the items that had spilled out of his wallet. We worked together in silence for a couple of minutes until we were done. That's when I noticed how patiently he had stayed back and given me the space to help him. Even though he was in a hurry, he had gracefully chosen to not rush me and instead, let me take my time. That's when I realized what a lovely, patient person he was.
