The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it gives us many different perspectives and a sense of optimism. We might even find happiness among his peers in our own years.

But I believe this is a sad, bittersweet ending. My favorite book about me because of what it reveals is that the book's end might have been better.

So here goes. And that concludes this edition! Until next time, my friends and family!

So, how do you like the book for what it is? I can be wrong as I thought it, but if you want to know if this is what you should really read, don't. But for just the same reason I think the story told by Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is about the last of the four possible endings, I think it's better than any of these endings. Let's see what you guys think!
