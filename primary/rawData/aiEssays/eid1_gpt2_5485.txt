Computers have many effects on people. If you've seen a lot of this, perhaps you would rather have a friend with the same issues with a computer. It's a good idea to check in with yours before you purchase your PC, as there are many more questions you can ask if your PC is getting the right quality replacement before you buy.

If you have already checked out our review on how to get your PC to do its thing and understand what these components look like, consider this helpful tip.

If you bought this monitor back last year, you were already quite used to the backlights and had a lot to learn about backlights and other options (especially in regards to how we got to see this monitor). But now it feels like this thing is just too good for you to refuse. Don't worry! It's not.

The review was done by Mark & Robert, along with the owner of The Best PC Hardware Company on Wall Street, who wrote a review. This review was written by some of you who have had good trouble with one piece of this monitor. They just couldn't stop. The reviewer is really happy with the parts and the overall performance. No complaints!
