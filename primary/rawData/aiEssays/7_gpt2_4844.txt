He came to me who is a nurse and he said he would come and tell me that if I needed to get a doctor's appointment and then he would let me have a consultation and then he wouldn't be upset because he already had enough children. I would ask him what they can do with me. He said it's better to give us our kids to have fun, that they can make a difference.

I was very supportive as a child and when it came to therapy, I would go to her doctor and speak to her, and she would see her kids again. But she was also very supportive. It was because of my faith, and you see this in our church, but also the faith of my generation. The idea that if you don't do something good, if you can't do anything to bring about a better world for them, then if they try again, no matter what the outcome.

So it was just like, why not try this stuff, can we do the work?
