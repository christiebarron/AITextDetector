The construction of the Empire State Building was an enormous technical feat, and even more so was the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at its summit. The engineers and builders of the building faced numerous obstacles related to the structural design of the building and safety concerns related to the mooring of airships. 

The primary technical issue to consider was the design of the mast at the top of the building, which was intended to be used as a mooring. The mast had to be incredibly strong in order to accommodate the weight of the dirigible, which might be up to 175 feet long and as much as 138,000 cubic feet in volume. The mast had to be made of iron and consisted of three components: a 28-foot long base, a 42-foot long middle, and a 50-foot long peak. The three components were designed to fit together and form a 170-foot long, 10-foot wide mast to ensure stability of the airship while moored at the Empire State Building.

Safety of passengers was also a paramount concern. Passengers would be transferred to and from the mooring mast via an elevator car. The elevator was fitted with wire-mesh walls and a glass ceiling to protect the passengers from wind, rain and other elements. Additionally, the elevator had access ports along the side that could be opened while the car was in motion - allowing passengers and crew to step directly out onto the mooring mast.
