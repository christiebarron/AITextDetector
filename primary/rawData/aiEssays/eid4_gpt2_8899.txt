The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it's always interesting to look at a book that's so different than what it actually is. Not only is the story so different, but the action is so different. I was fascinated by this particular piece of work, and the way the story is set so vividly, without being as confusing. I never felt like I wasn't involved, and it's nice to discover how different the story is. If you read a book before, they say you feel as if you're in for a big surprise. This novel may seem a little unexpected to you, but for meâ€”that feels like there may at last be an opening moment that is something I've got to be inspired to make.
