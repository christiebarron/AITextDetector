I remember the day I met my best friend like it was yesterday - although it was more than a decade ago. We were both starting university, and had the same course schedule. The moment we spotted each other in the hallway, something just clicked. We introduced ourselves, and without knowing it, the start of a lifelong friendship had been formed. 

We started spending more and more time together, and soon enough our bond had grown incredibly strong. We both had a zany sense of humor that kept the room filled with laughter, and I don’t know what I would have done without his company. We would constantly make stupid jokes that helped us lighten the mood in the most impossible of situations. The more we got to know each other, the funnier and more ridiculous our conversations became.

Once, we were out at a restaurant after our exams and started talking about how we’d done. To our dismay, our scores weren’t as good as we had hoped, and we soon started commiserating about our misfortunes. But then, something hilariously unexpected happened - as we were talking, our waiter walked by and, thinking that we were discussing something else, he said “Good luck with the baby!”. We just couldn’t contain our laughter and ended up making a huge scene in the restaurant. That moment still goes down as one of the funniest moments of our friendship.
