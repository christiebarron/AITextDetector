One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was working with the British government and were invited to watch an episode of Doctor Who. The audience came to see how the Doctor and the Doctor were playing with our other Doctors (including Gizmo).

A bit later (and for this episode I'll use a joke) in an interview I do, Doctor Who producer Paul Williams played the role of a character who has been referred to as the "Rumble of Rags". He looks out onto the whole universe and what he sees is more than merely his own personal universe, his personal universe is the reality he's creating to live inside of him. He thinks more than what he sees, he imagines more than he lets on at times, thinks that he sees that he sees that he sees, and he puts his heart into every single one of them. But when he's doing something truly unique with words and his voice I cannot possibly ignore the fact that he is a fantastic voice, and as a result I'm always wondering how he felt when he sang about the "little guy" with his fingers on the button at the beginning of the "Hello, Dr. John" line. I suppose I had to wonder how such an actor could make such a great work of art (perhaps even "totally genius"?)

To make matters worse, it was one of my favourite performances by someone of his caliber who could even help me understand why it was so latch-and
