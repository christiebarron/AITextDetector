I remember a time when I had to be incredibly patient. I was going for a job interview for a highly sought-after role with the company I had been dreaming about working for. Despite my best efforts to get on time for the interview, traffic was dire and it looked like I wasn't going to make it on time. I started to panic and grumble about the traffic, but then I remembered that the interview was very important to me. I decided to take a deep breath and stay calm. I focused on what I knew they were looking for in the ideal interviewee and it distracted me from getting too frustrated. Eventually, I made it to the interview with 5 minutes to spare. Thepanel were impressed with my effort to remain calm and to not let the situation affect me. I am very grateful that I was able to show them that I was the kind of person who can stay patient and focused, even in difficult situations. I went on to get the job, and now I am living the life I had dreamed of.
