The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. There was some debate as to whether the structures would carry such things as a television, a radio, or even a computer so that "the builder could build them safely," said Robert Green, who directed research studies at Carnegie Mellon University. But there was room for development.

It was only in the 1920s and 30s that dirigibles first became a reality. In the 1950s and 1960s, the first space-use vehicles were introduced. More than 20,000 had been developed by that time, some of them built by NASA. They included "the World's Smallest Home," the first of which was built in New Zealand in 1964; the first home on the Space Shuttle was launched in 1979; and, just a few years later, the first unmanned flight of a Russian Soyuz into orbit; and many more came out of space from other countries.

Some of the earliest dirigible vehicles were operated by pilots and others by rocket crews. But it's no surprise that the first passenger capsules and space capsules began arriving in space under a host of different names, from the first "Boat P.T." that landed in South America on December 8, 1917; the first "Mission F.C.I.S." that landed on March 7, 1991; the first Russian passenger ship that successfully reached orbit aboard the Russian Kursk-Koury (N
