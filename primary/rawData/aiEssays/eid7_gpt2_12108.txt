An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was in therapy for a knee injury. She was recovering from knee problems and had had a foot injury, a dislocation of a toe, knee trouble so big she didn't even walk anymore of course. She would stand right there trying to get up and her pain was so great, I thought to herself, 'Maybe this is it. We're going to work my way through this, maybe we're going to be back together.' They were right and I had a chance to go on with my life and have our life together that year in fact...but I'm not going to be back. You know what? I will always know what my future has in store to fill out. So now I feel sorry that a lot of people are going to think I was going nowhere. You know what I mean? I always thought of myself as someone who would do something awesome, I did that... I was only here for a year and as I was doing that you know what it's like to be out there so hard.

When I did do what I did for The New Generation, I tried really hard at it and really tried at everything.

We had that same message with The New Generation. I learned a lot and I think I learned a lot. I didn't have that same message with it. I could be doing this if I was doing it right but to me it was more of a story
