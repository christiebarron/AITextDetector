The building's owner, Joseph Conrad in 1886, wanted to install dirigibles in the walls of the Empire State Building so that it could operate efficiently. He wanted the structure to stay as a skyscraper in space.

John Smedley

The most common obstacle to building dirigibles was the lack of a space elevator for the passengers. John Smedley, an engineer at the Union Pacific Railroad, used a 3-point curved elevator to get around the buildings.

John Smedley's invention called the "Hole" for the Hunchback of Notre Dame, was an ingenious idea. The elevator could push people sideways through a roof. The Hunchback of Notre Dame is one of two places in the country that is actually built on a horizontal piece built at the same time in different locations.


Ruthless Rudolf

Once the Empire State Building was completed, however, the owner of the building had an idea to build a dirigible with his new design.

Sixty years ago, Alfred D. Smedley would have known this and tried without making a difference. He was a brilliant guy, but his idea was to have every piece of American history painted on dirigibles.

His company, Rudolf H. Smedley Construction Corporation, had done a great job. But all of them had more problems than
