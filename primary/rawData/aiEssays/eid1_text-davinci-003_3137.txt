Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my opinion on the impacts computers have had on people, and to persuade your readers to agree with me. 

Technology has been rapidly advancing for many years, and the invention of computers has revolutionized the way in which we work, play, and communicate with each other. Computers have made it much easier for us to access information, and they have improved our ability to communicate with family, friends, and colleagues from any location.

Despite the valuable contributions computers have made to our daily lives, there are some potential negative effects associated with their use as well. Sitting at a computer for extended periods of time can lead to eye strain and poor posture. Additionally, the amount of time people spend in front of a computer screen is often at the expense of physical activities, which can have serious health implications.

These possible issues, however, do not mean that people should shy away from using computers. On the contrary, I believe computers offer far more benefits than risks. For instance, using computers can help us stay connected to the outside world, and that can have significant effects on our sense of emotional well-being. Computers also provide us with ways to express ourselves creatively
