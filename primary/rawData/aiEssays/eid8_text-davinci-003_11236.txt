It was my first date with Sarah, and I was determined to make a good impression. We had chatted online for a while and were both nervous about meeting in person for the first time.

When she arrived at the cafe, I could tell we both felt awkward. We ended up talking about what we did for work, but the conversation felt forced.

Suddenly, Sarah smiled and gestured down the street. I looked to see what she was looking at and saw a small dog hopping up and down in a way that made us both laugh. 

We started to laugh and couldn't stop for a couple of minutes. The tension in the air evaporated and things suddenly felt much more relaxed between us. We continued laughing and talking for the rest of the afternoon. 

It had been a long time since I had shared a good laugh with someone else and it felt great. From that moment on, it was clear we had a real connection and we ended up having a great time together. Laughter was definitely the key to breaking the ice that day.
