Censorship in libraries is a topic that has long been subject to much debate. While some think that allowing access to books, music, movies, and magazines of a sensitive and potentially offensive nature is detrimental to families and communities, others insist that with such censorship comes a deterrent to the freedom of speech and expression. As libraries around the world continue to debate the merits and demerits of imposing censorship, here are some key points to consider.

At its core, censorship in libraries suppresses creativity and expression. It denies individuals the freedom to explore ideas and beliefs without fear of judgment or scorn. By blocking the access to certain materials, the library is essentially doing the same thing that many oppressive governments do—it is stifling the voice of people and preventing them from accessing new music, movies, and books to broaden their point of view.

Moreover, limiting the availability of certain materials may unintentionally support them, as its illegal or restricted nature makes them more desirable for the banned audience. It may create a certain mystique or allure that attracts people to the banned materials even more so than if they were openly available. This same principle applies to the music industry, where "explicit" versions of albums are often more popular than the censored version.

Furthermore, censorship goes against the library’s mission to serve as an educational institution, where people can explore different perspectives without fear or prejudice. Rather than attempt to limit knowledge, libraries should be committed to expanding it
