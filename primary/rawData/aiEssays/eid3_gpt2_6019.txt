Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. On its simplest level, I think it is important to keep all the variables in mind.

Allowing cyclists to use the bike for a specific purpose (for example, walking or cycling alone) is more effective when a different style of cycling is available. The following values, if any are required on individual routes, will set bike widths to be slightly different. However, with a high number of bikes available to cover a range of different circumstances, all setting and cycling modes will need to set the same for all.

Rough Road Ahead

You will notice that more and more cyclists use roads that are wide enough that they can cross through. While this is a good thing, it can also be a disadvantage, especially if you can't even cycle through. The only way to take shortcuts to a bike that is wider and less narrow is to use a wide bike lane.

These values are generally required along with the corresponding number of bikes to be used in any given route. It is also more likely than not some lanes can be painted on the edge of a city (e.g. in public spaces);Ã§n a lane with a red or blue line to indicate that you have not been crossing before, there is a gap that might allow that person to cross over, but this still means that you are not crossing over in line with other riders in another lane.
