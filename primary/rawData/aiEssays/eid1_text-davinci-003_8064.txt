The Empire State Building, open for business in 1931, was an exciting engineering marvel of its day. This iconic New York skyscraper contained a number of innovative features, such as the first ever repository for helium-filled dirigibles, otherwise known as mooring masts. The masts were intended to be a secure place for dirigibles to dock when visiting New York City. However, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

As detailed in Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s book ‘The Mooring Mast’, the builders had to not only find an appropriate landing site for the dirigibles but also figure out how to build the infrastructure to support them. Dirigibles must be carefully inflated and steadied in order to dock. For the Empire State Building’s mooring mast, the builders had to ensure that it was strong enough to support the weight of a fully-inflated dirigible, but not disrupt the skyscraper’s decorative facade.

Not only did the mooring mast have to be sturdy, it had to be airtight and able to withstand varying weather conditions. Dirigibles can be excessively sensitive to wind, so any gusts of wind had to be prevented from entering the structure. In addition, the structure had to provide enough space for travelers to disembark safely and comfortably. The builders consulted with experts in dirigible maintenance and
