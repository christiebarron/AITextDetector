Recently, I was at the grocery store with my young daughter. Although she had become captivated by some of the candies and toys, I did my best to remain patient and explain to her why we weren't buying them. 

At first, she protested but I knew I had to be patient and remain consistent in asking her to move away from the aisles and focus on the items that were on the list instead. After a few minutes of reminding her to stay focused, she eventually listened and was able to understand why we weren't buying her any extra items. I could tell it was a lesson learned and she was actually proud of herself when we left the store. 

I knew that remaining patient was the best route to take and it obviously paid off in the end. It can often be a challenge to stay patient when parenting a young kid, but it can also lay the foundation for positive learning and behavior, so it's always worth it.
