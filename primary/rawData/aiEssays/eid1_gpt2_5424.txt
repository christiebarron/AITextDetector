Computers have many effects on people.

A simple Google search on "The Brain" will have millions of results. The first one will come up with, "Anthropologist: The neuroscientist who says we might make smarter machines".

In this research, the researchers found that the very same brain that determines whether a person would think differently when the brain of an animal is stimulated is also responsible for the decisions scientists make while they eat.

"Many aspects of human behavior are influenced by how we react when we eat. The idea that we should think like animals is not new. It's been very hard to draw this line in the sand recently in human science when people are challenged by something that they cannot understand," said Professor Tim Cook at the University of Sydney.

Other important aspects of human behavior (other than the pleasure we feel from our food choices) can be thought of as secondary to our brain's use of certain electrical signals and brain chemicals known as reward pathways.

For example, a protein called dopamine (the key ingredient in the body's attempt to control our thoughts) can play an important role in what's felt positively or negatively, and what's been thought of negatively or in a positive light. It's therefore important that we also pay attention to what's happening inside our brains, said Professor Cook.

"The brain is not an active machine," added Professor Cook. "It has to work in its own special kind of way.
