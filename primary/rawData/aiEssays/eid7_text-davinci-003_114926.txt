I remember back when I was in middle school; it was my first science fair project. I was so excited to create something awesome that could actually win first place and get my name in the history books. So I worked really hard on my project but when I went to present it at the actual fair, I realized that I had made a mistake with the diagram that I had included and it didn’t make sense.

I started to feel really embarrassed and angry at myself for making this mistake, but instead of giving up I decided to be patient. I took a few minutes to step away from my project and take a few deep breaths. I reminded myself that this was my first science fair project and that mistakes happen. I slowly walked back to my project, accepted my mistake, and made it clear to the judges that it was an honest mistake that I had made. 

It turned out that the judges understood and let me present my project regardless of my mistake. In the end, I didn’t place first, but I was still proud of myself for finishing my project and keeping my cool during the presentation. Being patient in that moment helped me stay focused and present my project confidently.
