One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I walked into the local park with a man who was laughing at me. My friend ran to me and said "it's the biggest joke around in the world" and I immediately started shouting. When I first heard this, I was overwhelmed and took in all the funny things about life, how funny people were, the world in general, and why I was so obsessed with the topic of'sex' and its associated sexual innuendos. I knew how to laugh so I began to get excited about it. Within minutes of getting my laugh out, this guy's girlfriend went from laughing hysterically to laughing in our faces, screaming for a drink. Just as I was about to make a decision about this, we both turned our heads and our bodies started shaking. I went up onto the ground and screamed. The next thing I knew, I was surrounded by another stranger. "Just go ahead and ask her to come back now." And we were done.

In other words, life is hard, stressful, challenging, complicated. These days, though, it's a lot closer to the surface.
