Narciso Rodriguez's memoir From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives creates a melancholic mood through its exploration of memories, in which he reflects upon his life and upbringing in New Jersey. Through his writing, Rodriguez dives into the intricate details of his childhood that formed the person he is today. He conveys his nostalgia for his upbringing and his desire to maintain the values he was taught as a young boy, even though his adult life has taken him far from his hometown.

Rodriguez also creates a reflective atmosphere in his memoir. He highlights his admiration for his family’s strength and self-sufficiency in the face of hardship. He moves easily between the past and present, noting how his family's attitudes and values have changed or adapted, while still holding strong roots to the culture that formed them. There is a sense of isolated reminiscence mixed with the occasional joy as Rodriguez recounts his growth to adulthood.

Another layer of the mood in Rodriguez’s work is the nostalgia he expresses for good memories from his past. He emphasizes the importance of his relationships with his parents, friends, and the landscape of places he grew up in. He contrasts this nostalgia with the fact that much of what he remembers is no longer present and he can only carry it in his heart. This sense of loss and longing is pervasive in Rodriguez’s words as he relives his past and speculates on its impacts on his present self.
