The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges in allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the world’s tallest building. The most significant of these obstacles was the limitation of space and strength of the mast that was installed atop the structure. 

The most important aspect of allowing dirigibles to dock, is the necessity of a mast to anchor the ship. The mast needs to be solid and durable enough to support the weight of the dirigible. The Empire State Building’s mast was indeed solid, measuring just under 300 feet tall and made of steel tubes. However, the mast was not strong enough to support the weight of a full-sized dirigible.

The limited space at the top of the Empire State Building also greatly restricted the size of mast that could be installed. The dirigibles were much larger than the scaffolding around the top of the building and the designers had trouble fitting a mast of level strength in such a limited space. To make matters worse, the facade of the building was already covered in windows and the mooring mast had to fit alongside these. 

The engineers also had trouble designing a mast that would actually mate with a dirigible. They resorted to a series of inverted loops that resembled a set of cartoon eyes. This mast design was crafted from a single piece of steel and clamped onto the rooftop of the building. The result was a rigid and durable mast that could be mated with a
