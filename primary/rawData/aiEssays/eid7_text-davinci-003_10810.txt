I was in line at the grocery store a few days ago when the checkout line suddenly became incredibly long. It wasn't too bad because the store wasn't too busy, but I started to get a bit anxious as the line wouldn't move. 

But then the cashier noticed something wrong with the checkout machine and they told us all that they had to fix it. I could feel the rush of several shoppers becoming impatient and starting to grumble. 

But I decided to be patient and take the opportunity to look around the magazine rack or something. I never seem to have the time to do that, so it wasn't a bad use of my time.

After about 15 minutes, the cashier proclaimed that the machine was fixed and that we could start checking out. I could feel the line of customers unclench in relief with the knowledge that they'd be out of the store soon. I silently thanked the cashier for being patient and taking the time to fix the machine, otherwise the line may have been held up for much longer.
