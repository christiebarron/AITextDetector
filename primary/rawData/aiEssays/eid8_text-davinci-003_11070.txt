I was out with a group of friends at a pub one evening. As we were all sitting talking, when out of the blue my friend Pat said something that made me literally burst out laughing. Even before I finished my laugh Pat had started to laugh as well, joined shortly by the rest of our group too. 

For a moment, it felt like the entire room paused as everyone around us was staring at us. Then, just as quickly as it had started, the laughter died down. It was in that moment that I realized just how powerful laughter is. We had all gone from complete strangers to feeling connected, in such a short period of time. 

I laughed more that night than I ever had before, and it was exactly what I needed. The feeling of joy and connection that I felt was incomparable. Everyone should spend a night laughing with friends, it is truly an unforgettable experience.
