I believe that censorship of materials in libraries or schools is a serious matter involving our nation, the entire society," the group wrote.

"We feel that even as members of the public were being deprived free and honest speech in public schools and in our city schools, these laws and laws continue to be used as a shield against certain hate speech and incitement to violence."

Coffee and other foods that aren't included in the law vary from school to school with a ban on sodas. Students are told that school officials are allowed to order school staff to remove sodas, but not at the locations where they do not appear.

The law also prohibits alcohol (and other illicit substances) at "public" locations. It also bans alcohol from restaurants, restaurants with public seating and from bar patrons dining there.

As a young black man, I was deeply interested in the culture I have found in a school where my parents would not tolerate violence and violence directed toward black youth. Now, I am more interested in what might happen to my community that is now being attacked and silenced through the censorship of other people's views.
