The building of the Empire State Building was a huge humanitarian undertaking of the early 20th century. It is an iconic skyscraper in New York City, which opened in 1931 and has become an icon of American ingenuity. Though it is now one of the most recognizable buildings in the city, the engineering and design of the Empire State Building was the result of much hard work and dedication by a team of architects, engineers, and builders. One particularly unique feature of this building is that it originally allowed dirigibles to dock at the top of the skyscraper. Despite the tremendous challenges they faced, the builders of the Empire State Building were able to create an innovative and secure mast that could support these large and delicate aircrafts.

In “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the author outlines the many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building came across while attempting to make the mooring mast as safe and reliable as possible. Due to the size of the dirigibles, the mast had to be constructed to extremely precise measurements. Further, with wind gusts of up to sixty miles per hour, the mooring mast needed to be designed to withstand powerful winds. To further complicate matters, the mooring mast needed to be atop the tallest building in the world at the time so that the aircrafts could easily reach it. Finally, due to the fact that the Empire State Building was located in the center of the city, it
