The building of the Empire State Building posed an unprecedented challenge to the skyscraper industry of the early 20th century: allowing dirigibles to dock. While airships had already been in use for many years, bringing them in as close to the Empire State Building as was deemed necessary posed significant challenges to the builders of the building. 

The principle obstacles lay in the technical design of the airship dock. The idea of a platform or mooring mast on the roof of the building had to be reconciled with the fact that the aerodynamic properties of airships and the immense vertical drag that such structures would generate could cause catastrophic problems in movement and stability. To this end, the engineers of the building had to construct a mooring mast that was lightweight and aerodynamically efficient while also being strong enough to support a full-size airship and its passengers.

In addition, due to the extraordinary height of the building, the wind would create a powerful force that could potentially cause instability for the lighter airships of the day. This concern was heightened by the fact that the mast had to rest on a platform that was constructed from bracing and steel cables, all of which added to its already significant weight requirements. To alleviate the issue, extensive wind studies and analysis were conducted, and special designs engineered, to mitigate the risk of an airship becoming destabilized and crashing into the building.

The remarkable innovation of the mooring mast allowed the designers to
