Computers have many effects on people. If you're a musician who spends the time composing and arranging every song in a game he plays, your performance becomes incredibly important. The more that you spend time designing music for the game characters, the easier it becomes for you to understand what's going on.

For me, it's more about knowing how important it is to be able to express who I am, to understand what that means to others. Playing with real people, I didn't know that I had that because I would rather have been defined by my personality than by what I had just played. I had a lack of self-assurance, a weak self-awareness, and the inability to make sense of what I was taking in before I was able to actually play. The more that I thought and acted in a certain way, the better my performance was! And that was, over and over again, how I saw myself.

What people don't realize is that the more musicians that we have, the more difficult it becomes for us to truly experience our true selves. I spent bringing everyone together to listen to and experience a game as a true person playing with real people.
