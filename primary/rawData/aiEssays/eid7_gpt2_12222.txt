An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was younger and the first person I spoke to was a nurse who loved breastfeeding, so I knew that breastfeeding was one of her hobbies. When my father was sick I found it amazing. I knew I was so happy to be raising her, I cried when I didn't have any milk at all. I did everything I could to make sure she would be happy too.

Her next steps went way better when I was an adult than when I was my infant. Today for me it is the most important thing and I am so proud of her as well.

I'll try to share my story next week but for now I'll leave you with this one last message for mothers out there, I'm just so happy and so tired of people judging our babies that we don't just get any formula and no one takes care of them, we are a group of people that care passionately for our babies, not just our mom, and I hope you have a little more heart and a little less sadness when you have to face up to your babies.

Thank you for sharing this blog.
