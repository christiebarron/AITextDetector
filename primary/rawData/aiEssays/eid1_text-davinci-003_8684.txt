The other day I was out on the street with my friend and she was really having a tough time of things. I could see the strain in her face and she had been so quiet for a while that I was starting to worry. She said she was just tired but I could tell there was something more. 

So, out of desperation, I made an awkward joke just to try and break the tension - something about the shoes she was wearing. To my surprise, it actually worked and she started to laugh. I was taken aback because it felt like it had been so long since either of us had felt any sense of joy or levity. 

We continued down the street, catching up on each other's lives and laughing at the silliest things. Finally, the mood shifted and the warm sun shone down on us with a hopeful sense of the future. 

On the way home, my friend turned to me and said, "Thank you for today. I really needed that laugh." 

That moment will stick with me forever. I was so glad that something as simple as a joke had been the antidote for the heavy atmosphere. It made me realise that sometimes, laughter really is the best medicine.
