The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One limitation was "no way to transfer fuel from one fuel tank to another," said John C. Spence of The Commercial Freight Association. Another obstacle was the fact that the building requires a "liquid phase separator" at the bottom of the building. The liquid phase separator was invented in the 1960s for other purposes. One source of "liquid phase separator fuel" would be fuel that had to be separated from fuel in order to use it.

In 1969 the owners of the building began designing a liquid phase separator so that fuel would be separated from fuel during flight by pouring a gas hose filled with a mixture of gasoline, water or diesel. The hose contains the fuel that has a low viscosity and a high volume. The gasoline in the hose will "flow" back to the fuel tank, producing about 30 gallons of fuel, which the building will use to start the engine.

"I am not that bothered," he said. "But for that, there is a problem."

"It was very important to keep the fuel coming, to put pressure on it, to put pressure on the valves, because it takes energy to break the fuel and it has to be maintained," said Kevin Clements, an engineer with the California Engineering Center, who created the hydrogen fuel tank. "But there's always going to be some energy that's lost."
