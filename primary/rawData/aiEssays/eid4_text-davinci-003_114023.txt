The ending of the poem serves to imbue a sense of eager anticipation about the reappearance of the things it mentions â€“ the snows melting, the geese returning - during the spring season once more. It reflects the hopeful, optimistic perspective of the narrator, even in the face of difficulty and challenge, and serves as an encouragement to readers as well. By connecting these natural events to the taking of the test, the poem encourages readers to take each challenge as an opportunity to grow and learn, rather than to see it as a roadblock.
