The narrator of Winter Hibiscus, a young Chinese American girl, is feeling the weight of the hurdles she must overcome to be accepted by both Chinese and American authorities as 'a true American'. At the beginning of the book, she is also struggling with a huge physical milestone—her first test to gain a driver's license, which she fails. In the end, she finds solace in a hibiscus she planted in her grandmother's backyard. The return of the hibiscus in the spring symbolizes the renewal and hope she feels in her quest for acceptance—as the snow and geese return, she too will have the strength to take the driver's license test again. The author is thus using the powerful image of the hibiscus to suggest that the process of acceptance and assimilation is fluid, and that with determination, the protagonist will eventually achieve success.
