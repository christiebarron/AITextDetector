One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was at my mother's house, my house sitting beside someone's couch in the winter and she just kind of raised a child out of there."

Cher said that it wasn't until she began living at their house in Westport, Conn., that she realized she could actually play with her child, and that a few years ago when she's in love with her daughter's boyfriend, she's even started seeing their daughter play a few times.

"That's kind of where we live," she said. "It was a love thing, and she would always pick me up off the ground and come out after me."
