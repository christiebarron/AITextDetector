I had always adored my family's quiet Friday night gatherings. My siblings and I would each take turns to tell funny stories during the long, easy dinners. One Friday night, however, I brought more than just a funny story – I had a trick up my sleeve. 

As I finished up the story, everyone around the table was still roaring and laughing. With a mischievous gleam in my eye, I decided this was where I had to make my move – the perfect moment. 

I reached into my pocket, pulled out a tiny device with a few buttons, and pressed the top one. It was kind of like a remote control. As I did, suddenly the lights went off and the room filled with the sound of laughter – laughter coming from an unknown source. 

My mom and dad shared a confused look, while my siblings and I were practically howling. Finally, we all clued in. It was my little brother in the background, laughing along. He had been in on the prank the whole time, and I had been controlling an old recording of him. 

No one had expected it, and it resulted in ten minutes of complete and uncontrollable laughter. My family has now had many laughs together, but this one is remembered best.
