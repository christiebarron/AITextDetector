Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. Although some roads in the GTA are more than 1 km wide and, in some places, can be quite short or even long, these are not necessarily the places with the busiest streets for cyclists or particularly for pedestrians.

It is not always a particularly big deal – in fact, some of the most well-known examples of this behaviour might be very far from these. The way you describe the distance between the two vehicles – some cyclists describe it as 30 kilometres (or 16 miles) on a day – may be completely unacceptable.

However, a good start could be making clear the situation that is sometimes presented by the driver rather than the cyclist. The two drivers are much more likely to use the time together – even with the same route. I would argue that the safest place to run at a lower speed in a close environment is as close to the speed limit as possible to avoid being hit by one vehicle.

Alternatively, you can get rid of one of the rear end when someone puts a bikehandle wrench, a steering wheel, or even a fork on.
