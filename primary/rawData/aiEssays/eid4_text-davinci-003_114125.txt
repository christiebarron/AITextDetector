At the end of the poem, the speaker reflects on their experiences of taking an important test while being a refugee in Thailand. The words at the end of the poem express the speaker's hope that when they come back to Thailand, to where they came from, they will be able to take the test again and have a chance for a better life. The return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus serve as reminders that the situation of the speaker is not permanent and that they can return home one day. This reminds them of the importance of the test and creates a sense of determination and perseverance to reach a better future.
