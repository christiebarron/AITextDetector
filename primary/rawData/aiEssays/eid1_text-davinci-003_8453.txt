I was slowly working my way through the checkout line at the grocery store, waiting patiently for my turn, when the customer in front of me began to fumble through her purse, desperately searching for her wallet. She apologized for holding me up and worried that she had misplaced it. As the seconds ticked by and the line behind me began to grow, I kept my cool and remained patient.

I smiled kindly and told her that it was alright, that these things happened. She continued to search and I continued to wait patiently, eventually finding her wallet in the process. She apologized profusely once again and thanked me for my understanding, and I waved off her apology with a friendly smile - no need to be sorry for doing something out of our control. 

All in all, the experience taught me that it never hurts to put a little extra patience and understanding in situations like this, as even the smallest gestures can go a long way in making someone else's day a little brighter.
