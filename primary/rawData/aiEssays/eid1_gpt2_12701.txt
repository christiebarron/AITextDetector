Computers have many effects on people. To put one simple example into the minds of the non-scientists behind you might look at a few words used above:

"Humans are animals. They act by natural selection."

â€¦That may seem somewhat counterintuitive to some, but this quote from the same author also is the cornerstone of the famous "The New Evolutionary Argument" (which the scientists in the original paper used to disprove their claims and were promptly retitled The Natural Selection Problem). This is an argument made to support the claim that humans are "sucking up" our food, and "dumping in alligators and bears" when they are not needed. This argument is not controversial, as it is backed by numerous studies in peer-reviewed journals and with the support of evolutionary psychology. I have not had the chance to read a few papers on the issue, and the authors were not pleased with my criticism. As I stated here previously:

"Evolutionary psychologists tend to be skeptical about a concept to which they were unaware. In doing so they may be mistaken in trying to make a claim about the evolutionary nature of the species. Instead, they can be so critical of their conclusions that they have to question them. To me, this is not the case with Darwinians."
