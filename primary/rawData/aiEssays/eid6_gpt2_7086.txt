The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. When the Department of Transportation approved the project, it went against a popular belief that transportation would become more expensive and cumbersome so they should never build dirigibles, a fact reflected in their current schedule.

The DBA decided to stop allowing some types of "dynamically-delivered" (or "duplicative" vehicles) within the building, a decision that made the building more accessible and less cramped.

The building's new traffic controller was able to move all vehicles into the lobby, the former elevator, and into the main floor instead of standing in the lobby, forcing the building to re-designate a pedestrian crossing as a traffic red light intersection instead of just a red light signal.

In spite of the setback, the traffic commissioner's offices had found some new projects to address on their own. They are now getting some new construction permit to start.

"I'm happy with that decision," Mayor Mike Duggan said. "I think it was a smart decision to go forward with this business model, which is more for the benefit of the community that we're working with. It's a win-win-win situation for everyone involved. I commend Gov. Mike Duggan and I think the community is very happy with that decision."
