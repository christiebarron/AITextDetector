The features of the setting dramatically affect the cyclist in Joe Kurmaski’s ‘Rough Road Ahead’. The story takes place in a rural area that is remote and desolate, with no trees to provide shade. The relentless sun causes the temperature to rise; the air is stifling and the heat radiates from the roads surface. This makes the cycling journey around the countryside particularly tough as the heat causes the cyclist to struggle to breathe and creates an overall feeling of exhaustion. 

The roads in the story are also narrow and winding which adds to difficulty of the cyclist’s journey. Here, the turns are unforgiving and any mistakes can easily mean running off the road as it is difficult to control the bike. Additionally, the roads are not in the best condition; they are rough and potholed which adds another layer of difficulty to the cyclist's journey. The cyclist is forced to maneuver over the unpredictable road conditions which is physically and mentally draining and it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain balance and accuracy. 

The cyclist must also negotiate the presence of wildlife in the area. Coyotes, rabbits, snakes, and lizards are all a potential danger, lurking around the corner as one cycles further into the countryside. This puts extra pressure on the cyclist to remain alert and to be wary of the wildlife they may encounter. All of these features of the setting combine to create the dangerous physical and mental risks the cyclist is faced with, which adds to Kur
