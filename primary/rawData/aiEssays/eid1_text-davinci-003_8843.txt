I remember going on a picnic in the park with my family. We were all having a great time, laughing and enjoying each other’s company. As we were packing up to leave, my sister’s phone suddenly starts to go off.

My dad got up to try and figure out what was going on with it and all of a sudden he started cracking up. He was trying to scroll through her texts and found a bunch of funny messages that she had been sending back and forth to her friends. 

Seeing my dad laugh was so special because it reminded us of how close we were as a family. His laughs were contagious and soon the whole family was laughing along with him. It was so much fun!

We all joked around for the next few hours, reciting funny lines from her texts. We laughed and smiled more than I’d seen in a long time. It was a moment of pure joy that I’ll never forget.

It just goes to show that laughter really is the best medicine.
