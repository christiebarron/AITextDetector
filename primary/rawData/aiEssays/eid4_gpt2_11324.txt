The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it takes readers on an adventure in the deep, deep world of winter. The book closes with a scene that you can never predict: a woman gets off the roof of a building and runs into a frozen wasteland.

In Winter Hibiscus, a young girl is able to walk on the ground and move. She walks, but at some point she collapses in the middle of it.

As she walks past the frozen wasteland, a figure rises from the snow and stares upon her, muttering, "You're going in my direction!"

The mystery behind what the figure means will never be solved.

What is it that gives this girl the power to walk? And what's the relationship, even though she looks like everyone else?

Summer Hibiscus: A Tale of Winter by Mark Roulston is out now and available for sale on Amazon, Barnes and Noble and IndieBound.
