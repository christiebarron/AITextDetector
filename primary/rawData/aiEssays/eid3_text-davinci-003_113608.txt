In Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead," the setting plays a crucial role in the cyclist's journey. The mountain of rocks on the side of the road serves as an obstacle for the cyclist to overcome, as she must maneuver around them. The steepness of the terrain also poses a challenge, as the cyclist must pedal harder to reach the top. The winding roads add an additional layer of difficulty, as the cyclist must navigate around the tight corners and remain in control of her bike.

The weather conditions further affect the cyclist's journey, as a layer of fog blankets the landscape, obscuring the cyclist's destination. The overcast skies create a sense of uncertainty, as the cyclist is unsure of what the next mile will bring. The temperature also fluctuates, challenging the cyclist to push herself further while attempting to keep warm.

The various features of the setting present a constant challenge for the cyclist. Her determination and endurance is tested as she works her way up the mountain of rocks, navigating around the winding paths and pushing through the changing weather. The difficulty of the terrain and the uncertainty of the journey create an empowering feeling of accomplishment as the cyclist is able to overcome the obstacles presented by the setting.
