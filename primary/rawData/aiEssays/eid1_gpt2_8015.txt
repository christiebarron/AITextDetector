Computers have many effects on people.

If the data can be broken down into many possible "groups" and then plotted in terms of different individual differences, the data is likely to be much more useful to researchers who understand the brain, not just for processing neural activity or brain chemistry.

It may also be helpful, if there is such a data set, to have data that can be used for neuroscience research at all.
