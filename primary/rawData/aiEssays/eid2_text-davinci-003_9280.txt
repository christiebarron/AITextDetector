Censorship in libraries is a controversial debate that is far from being settled. On one side, libraries should be havens for knowledge and free expression, but on the other, we must be cognizant of the content that is being exposed to our children. It is a precarious balancing act.

Honestly, I believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found to be offensive. It's important for parents to be able to trust that the libraries they entrust their children to are not propagating hate, bigotry, violence, and more. We must recognize and accept that libraries should be used for enlightenment, not indoctrination. To allow otherwise is to take away from the library's purpose. 

But what is considered to be "offensive"? Highlighting a particular form of material and labeling it as offensive is subjective and ultimately depends on a library's standards and individual cultural norms. Librarians should have the discretion to remove books, magazines, music, and movies if they are deemed offensive or inappropriate. We must be careful, however, not to get caught up in censorship; as long as the libraries take special care not to cross this line, I think that moderated censorship in libraries is appropriate. 

I firmly believe that libraries should be suitable and safe for all citizens, regardless of race, religious beliefs, or any other difference. Children should be exposed to books, magazines, music, and films that are not only varied and enlightening
