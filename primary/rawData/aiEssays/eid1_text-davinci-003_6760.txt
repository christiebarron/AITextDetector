Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have had on people in this digital age. Computers have advanced science and technology, making it easier for us to do research, acquire knowledge, and improve our lives.

Computers offer numerous advantages. With a computer, many tasks can be done with little effort and in less time. It is quicker to research for facts or to find information online than it is to search through library books. Computers also allow for more efficient communication, even across long distances, and help to promote collaboration. 

On the other hand, computers can also lead to health and safety risks. Eye strain is an issue due to prolonged exposure to bright screens while working. Sitting or standing in one position for long hours to work on a computer can cause physical fatigue.  Furthermore, computers may lead to increased stress. Technology can also be addictive, as it might become difficult to prioritize tasks than when you do not have your device nearby.

Overall, computers effectively improve our lives, but there needs to be a balance between using them and breaking away. Whether for work or pleasure, computers are a part of our daily lives and should be used in moderation. 

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
