I was driving home after a long day at work when I noticed a blockage in the road ahead. I rolled down my window to see shoving and yelling, and realized that there was an accident. A few people had been affected by the crash and were exchanging angry words. 

I knew that I couldn't pass the accident until someone had sorted out the situation. Even though I was tired and just wanted to get home, I decided to be patient and wait. After about 15 minutes, I noticed that the people involved had calmed down and the whole incident was being treated reasonably. 

They eventually figured out the details of the accident and I was able to drive past without any problems. I was relieved to have stayed patient and not contribute to the chaos. Being patient was a valuable lesson for me, and hopefully one that will save me from being late in other situations.
