I recently stopped by my local grocery store to pick up a few items for dinner, and the lines at the checkout were significantly longer than usual. As a typically impatient person, my first instinct was to throw my hands up and leave in frustration. But then I thought about how hard the store workers were working and reminded myself to stay patient.

So, I got in line and reminded myself to relax. Despite the time-consuming wait, I was determined to stay in line and not complain. I read a book on my phone, a technique I use to help pass the time, and before I knew it, I was at the register. 

The woman ringing me up apologized for the wait, and I told her that I totally understood. She smiled at me and thanked me for being patient. I wound up enjoying my time at the store, instead of feeling frustrated as I get so easily tend to do.

Since then, I've been reminding myself to stay patient in all situations, no matter how difficult they may be. Being patient helps me take a step back and understand more clearly what's going on before I take any actions.
