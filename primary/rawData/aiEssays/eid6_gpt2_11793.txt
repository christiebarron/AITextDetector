The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In 1922 the United States Supreme Court, in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, had legalized a $4.5 billion corporate campaign finance loophole.

Although the Federal Election Commission made a ruling on September 4 making it illegal to spend money on political action committees, a separate, similar ruling on November 4 said Congress would not take action until it considered a budget resolution.

A Republican president in 1972 signed two bills in his office that extended the deadline for a budget resolution to September 27, 1973 — a date that was also subject to the veto of President Richard Nixon in 1971. (Congress has since said it would not give a break until the United Nations Security Council approves a resolution.)

A new federal law is proposed — the First Intifada Anti-Discriminatory Law (Bipartisan Bill — Title VII Of The 1964 Constitution) — to crack down on the state campaign finance networks.

The National Association of Realtors is proposing a "Freedom of Information Act seeking and promoting a new law in Congress calling upon the President, the Congress and the Governor to ensure that the information available and the public's informed consent to the public's access to the law, and the information sought shall bear a high degree of public relation."
