Dear Editor,

I am writing to discuss the effects computers have on people. We use computers in nearly every aspect of our lives and it is no surprise that they have had an incredibly profound effect on us as a society.

On the plus side, computers have allowed us to become more productive in our day-to-day activities. We can now work faster, stay more organized and spend less time worrying about tedious tasks. Furthermore, they have opened up an entirely new world for us, allowing us to connect with people from all over the world, access almost any information in seconds, and even create new opportunities for ourselves.

On the other hand, there is no denying that computers have made us increasingly dependent on machines for our daily activities. This has been especially concerning for our younger generations, who may not have the resources or temperance to control how they use computers. Too much computer time can lead to physical and mental health issues, such as fatigue, neck and back pain, and even depression.

I believe that the effects of computers can go both ways, depending on how we use them. If we use computers responsibly and limit the amount of time we check emails, social media or videos, we can reap the rewards while avoiding unhealthy habits.

I urge readers to reflect on this topic and take responsibility for their computer activities. We all must remember that computers are merely tools and should be used responsibly to enhance our lives, not take over them.
