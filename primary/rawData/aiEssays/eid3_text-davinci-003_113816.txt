In “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, the setting plays a major role in the cyclist’s experience. The rugged, uncomfortable environment of the Sierra Nevada Mountains drastically affects the cyclist’s performance and safety on the trail.

The extreme landscape of the Sierra Nevada creates a multitude of different challenges for the cyclist. The extreme slopes of the mountain require the cyclist to navigate the trails carefully in order to avoid slipping. This is especially important because if the cyclist loses control, they could easily face a steep drop. The rough terrain also causes fatigue in the cyclist due to the constant impact of the trail on their body. The cyclist must also traverse thick forests, with their visibility greatly reduced due to the abundance of trees. These forests also carry the risk of wildlife in the form of bears and mountain lions, which could prove very dangerous in the off-chance that the cyclist encounters the animal. 

The distinct topography of the location also affects the cyclist’s mental state. The remoteness of the Sierra Nevada leads to feelings of isolation and loneliness as the cyclist is removed from the society of their everyday life. This sense of isolation can also cause feelings of fear as the cyclist is unable to rely on any assistance should anything happen to them on the trail.

The cyclist is therefore heavily impacted by the features of the setting. The rugged environment of the Sierra Nevada Mountains creates a variety of physical and mental challenges for the cyclist that
