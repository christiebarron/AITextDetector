I had been nervous before the date. Would he like me? Would we have anything to talk about? Sitting across the table from him at the restaurant, I noticed how handsome he was. Both of us were trying to think of something to say. Then, I caught his gaze and burst out laughing. 

I quickly explained that I'd noticed his shirt. It was an off-beat graphic that reminded me of a funny movie I once watched. He smiled and shook his head.

He started to tell me how he had found the shirt at a vintage shop and it just looked too silly to resist. We started talking about movies we both loved and laughed together about the silly plot devices some action movies had. 

That's when it happened. We talked and laughed together for hours afterward like we had been good friends for years. I knew at that moment it wouldn't be our last date.
