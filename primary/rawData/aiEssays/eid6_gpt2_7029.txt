The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, there were fears over the damage caused by explosions and debris, and they needed to create protective barriers to prevent other people from being forced into the area. As a result, they developed a number of special methods to protect their building without harming anyone, in order to prevent people from entering and leaving the building.

On April 16th, 1915, Captain George H. R. Hays, a member of the Army Transport Corps, and Secretary James Jackson, the Army Engineer, entered the building, intending to destroy the building. However, the Hays' bomb went off and the building burst, resulting in severe injury to the people living and work there. Since the explosives had already reached the building with all the necessary force to destroy it, the Hays and Jackson were forced to use makeshift shelters placed upon nearby property. On May 4th, 1915, several other construction workers from the New Jersey Department of Emergency Supply entered the building, hoping that the bomb would be neutralized, but they were hit by cannonballs, which caused them to collapse within a few metres of the building.

There were several complaints about the building's integrity before the Hays' bomb went off, and they wanted to get a trial. In April 1916, the jury was ordered to accept an order to let the builders make use of the building to prevent demolitions, and the trial resumed on June 23rd
