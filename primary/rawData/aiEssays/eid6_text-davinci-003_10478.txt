The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock on the building's spire. The buildingâ€™s height and location played a major role in these obstacles. Located in the heart of Manhattan, the building stands 1,250 feet tall including its 200-foot mooring mast with an airship dock on the top. This mast would be one of the tallest in the world, requiring considerable engineering prowess to design and build a system that could withstand strong winds and hold up to 8,500 pounds of airship.

The main challenge the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the task of designing a reliable system that could withstand winds and safely dock a dirigible. This system would need to include a series of sturdy support cables connected to the mast along with an elevator anchor or winch to raise and lower the airship. Additionally, they would need to figure out how to enable the airship to attach itself to the mooring mast. The Empire State Building's engineering team turned to pre-existing vertical mooring mast designs from other airship docks around the world, using them as a guide as they tinkered and refined their system.

Unfortunately, the unpredictable Manhattan winds proved to be an obstacle in itself. After testing several designs, the airship engineers settled on using four cables linked to pillars at the top of the mooring mast and two additional cables that stretched over the sides of it. These cables were
