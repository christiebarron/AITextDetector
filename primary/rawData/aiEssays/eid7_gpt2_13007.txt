An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the time I had to pull all the screws from my door. But it was always hard. When I was so used to locking a door, things got too long, and the lock went out. To put it simply:

"You get inside, you feel like that's okay now. It worked for me. You get inside." —Sammie Adams

I remember the first time I'd actually heard about locking doors. Her name was "Alison" and she's had my number. I never even knew there existed another way of doing it:

"I said, "Hey, come back to my bedroom. I'm not going to lie to you and say you never got the right lock. Tell me if you did that." She was so smart, I'll be sure to call her." —Sergio

If you ever had a situation where a stranger who was only 5 years old would ask you: Hey, how's everybody? And if they were a guy and he'd say, "Oh yeah?" then it would be the night before and then I'd be like "Yeah." Not because they were a lot taller than me but because I Morrisonized them, like I didn't have the strength to stand up and say, "Let's go home and relax."
