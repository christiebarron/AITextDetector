 

I remember the night my husband and I first met like it was yesterday. 
We were having dinner at a small restaurant in our hometown, and I couldn't help but feel a little overwhelmed. We had only exchanged glances until that evening, and I wasn't sure what to make of the situation. 

Suddenly, my husband exclaimed, "Do you remember the time our math teacher got stuck in a hula hoop?" We both burst into laughter as we recalled the time our high school math teacher had tried to show us a new exerciseâ€”only to find herself stuck in the hula hoop.

That night, the tension between us was broken as we laughed together. We shared stories from our past as we savored our dinner and even though I was still a little shy, the laughter brought us closer. 

From that moment on, laughter has been a regular part of our relationship. We both get through the hard times by simply throwing in a few corny jokes here and there, and doing our best to enjoy life!
