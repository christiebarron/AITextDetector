The ending reflects the narrator's hope and expectation that when spring comes, he will have a chance to try again and do better on the test he failed. He looks to the hibiscus in the garden as a symbol of resilience and possibility; it was able to survive the harsh winter and bloom in the spring. This idea of renewal and hope is very appropriate for the end of a story about a child dealing with academic failure.
