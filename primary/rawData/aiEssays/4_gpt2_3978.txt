The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it takes readers to where they are right now to find what they are missing and to find what they need. We learn the lessons on how to spend and live while we're reading, how to talk with others about their lives, and how to think about what we're searching for. Here is a real-life example of that.

Hibiscus' book is about a story about a family who go to college to write an essay. It is about a time in history when the United States government realized that it would need to make the most up to take credit for what it does by using taxpayer money to give free college scholarships to everyone. The government started telling the family to use their money for college scholarships, and then got caught as the family was using the money to write a piece of "scholarship code," or about as much as is fair. As parents, it is the only hope the government has to keep their kids out of college, they realized, and they wanted to use that money to help them get high school degrees, and in turn, they started writing about the scholarships they were given. The family eventually had to get a scholarship from the U.S. treasury to pay for the loans, and they did so a bit more than they might otherwise owe them. As you might imagine, many times, these kids are reading this book all the time, and all year round, all year long
