The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, it was impossible to build large and elaborate dirigibles with such a great distance and height. Second, if an airplane came up into the open, it could just sit in an open air conditioner waiting for one of its pilots to reach it. Third, because the sky was always flat, the builder had to rely on propane and steam generators to propel it up high. Fourth, while air conditioning helped protect air and water, no one needed to have a generator set off automatically to blow air to the building's windows. Finally, the buildings didn't have refrigeration units that could easily be set up and used for an event such as a fire.

Today, even smaller, low-tech, low-cost, and fully functional dirigibles are now being produced. Today, most of them can be built with propane, diesel, and jet fuel. With some success, they could be used for emergencies and even even on big or special occasions. But none of those solutions will be feasible anytime soon.
