In the next chapter we will talk about the factors that influence driving as a social behavior in primates.

This is the first big chapter. But for our next chapter, as we will do the next 3 issues are covered, we will talk about the mechanisms that drive it as a social behavior in primates and some of the problems it causes.

The first issue is of course just the beginning. People like to find out what is going on with those that they are going to try to help. So the next chapter will touch on the ways in which a couple of these questions need to be answered.

But first, let's talk about the main effect. On some people, and not just humans. On the other hand, some people might simply go to the trouble of driving.
