Computers have many effects on people. The most obvious one is that they will be less intelligent, more focused, less likely to talk to others than they were previously, and more likely to stay away from events that might threaten them. Research suggests that one reason for this is that the more human you are, the more you tend to make mistakes and fail to do things correctly. It also means that those who are good do better when they are close to those who are terrible, or to those who are more intelligent than others.

This is also true of people with mental illnesses: they are always more likely to have a diagnosis of a mental illness, and that makes them more likely to be better people than they are otherwise.

3) Why do scientists consider us to be smarter than everyone else?

Scientists consider us to be smarter than all others. This is because we can be clever to a point. The basic idea is that people have brains that are "different" from others. It's not that we don't have brains, it's that we are smarter than everyone else when it comes to computers. This explains why we have to look for these subtle differences in our mental abilities or we can start to think of them only as "intellectual", or with the "special ability" designation from our parents.

The other important "empirical" factor is how many others are smarter than we all are. We have evolved to be more "intellectual"
