I have always been taught to be patient, and I most recently put that lesson to the test. As I was preparing for a test I had coming up, I realized I was running out of time to make sure I had all the material I needed properly reviewed. With limited time left, I could feel the frustration and anxiety of the situation bubbling up inside me, but I decided that I was going to remain patient and handle it the best way possible.

I took a few deep breaths to calm myself and remind me to stay in control of my emotions. Then I got to work. I went over my notes one more time, tried to memorize some of the more important facts, and asked a few of my class mates if they had any tips or tricks to make the studying process easier. I was able to remain patient and focused, and because of that I felt much more prepared and confident going in to the test.

At the end of the day, I was grateful that I had stayed calm throughout the process. Not only did I feel proud of myself for my successful studying efforts, but I was also reminded of the importance of being patient in order to achieve my goals.
