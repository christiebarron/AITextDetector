One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was 13 and had to stop using my hair, and I had to start wearing it as something new. Before then, I'd only used two other things â€“ soap and toilet paper. My parents wanted me to wear them to school but I've been doing pretty well.

What do you think they meant with this? Sound off in the comments!
