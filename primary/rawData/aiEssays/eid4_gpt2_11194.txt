The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because of the ending. So it should start with a good explanation of why I think this, or any part of it, is so great: the original version of a prophecy, a story that was written before the second of all ancient wars, was that a small rebellion broke out between various kingdoms of the same empire, in which a small but powerful group of people came together all to become the greatest power in the world. This became the main plot of the novel, which I think is the reason there have been so many people (if you get my drift, I'll do my first book, and then I'll post one for all people who read this book) who are interested only in the story and what happened before the war (so this book is a really good primer, and gives something of a good insight on what happened) It was a time when, even among all the great powers, some of them were just too powerful; I think that the people of the planet Dacia were as powerful as any other and so there was the need for a small revolution and for a young people to be taken up off earth and start their own country, not merely to use as pawns to be able to buy the people power to defend their own lands. So I think that there was something unique about the story and a purpose to it, but also something big: you will never find something like this anywhere else.
