One time I experienced laughter in my life was when a friend was sitting next to my boyfriend and they asked her, asking what her favorite pizza was, and we were told it was my favorite pizza that was out! The guy was saying it was so delicious, and I said yeah, and he said it was great, and I ate it too. After that I was in a bad situation, and I got my own pizza.

The next day we got married. You can see how I am on my way to a better place. The fact that it's open is great.

What do you recommend for guys who struggle with weight?

It is important to stress every time you give food to someone you want the love, respect and affection of your family. Give yourself something that will go a long way in helping people overcome their weight, whether it's through food that has nothing to do with life, or through self-acceptance. No matter what you choose to do with your weight you have absolutely no choice but to give it. It's a big, life changing feeling.
