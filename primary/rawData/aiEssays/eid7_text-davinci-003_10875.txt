I recently had the opportunity to witness firsthand an incredible example of patience. I had started up a small business with an old college friend of mine, and while we were both working tirelessly to make it a success, there were times when things didn't move forward as quickly as either of us would have liked. 

We were faced with issues that were outside of our control, such as delays with our suppliers and lack of resources. But instead of getting frustrated with the inevitable obstacles, my friend was incredibly patient and understanding throughout the process. He kept a cool head and used the time to work on other projects while waiting for the problems to get resolved. I was in awe of his patience and how he was able to stay laser-focused on our end-goal instead of getting caught up in the little things. 

The patience he showed throughout our entrepreneurial journey was really inspiring and I was glad to have been able to experience it. It showed me that no matter how uncertain the road ahead may be, staying focused and staying patient really does pay off in the end.
