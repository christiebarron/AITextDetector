The memoir “From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives” by Narciso Rodriguez paints a vivid picture of the life of a Cuban American growing up in the 1980s-1990s. The book explores Rodriguez’s immigrant experience and the struggles, yet joys, associated with it. Through Rodriguez’s honest and intimate storytelling, readers get insights into his life, his home, his family, and his personal relationship with Cuba.

The story begins with a nostalgia-filled walk back in time to when Rodriguez was a child in Cuba. His descriptions of the people, places, and culture are imbued with an inner peace and a feeling of love for the beautiful and loving world he experienced. This nostalgia is reflective of the transient nature of childhood, and it infuses the story with a gentle kindness and warmth. 

The mood created in “From Home” then shifts as the reader follows Rodriguez’s journey to the U.S. with his family. While the shift does not dampen the love that Rodriguez has for his homeland, his new and strange surroundings create a sense of displacement and instability. This precarious situation is captured in vivid detail, from Rodriguez’s difficulties communicating in English to his attempts to fit in and establish a home in the US.

The book also gives glimpses into Rodriguez’s struggles to reconcile his Cuban heritage and American identity. This balancing act is expressed in his vivid recollections,
