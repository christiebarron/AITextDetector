I recently encountered a situation in which I had the opportunity to practice patience. 

I had booked an appointment to meet with an insurance agent, and arrived at her office on time. Unfortunately, the agent was running late due to an overly lengthy meeting with a previous client.

Instead of getting angry or becoming frustrated, I chose to be patient. I decided to take this time to explore the city and visit some local shops. I also took some time to read a book and relax at a nearby coffee shop. 

After an hour and a half of waiting, I finally returned to the insurance agentâ€™s office. She had just finished with her client and was ready to see me. I was patient and understanding of her circumstances, and appreciated that she was able to fit me into her day even though she was already running late. 

In the end, my patience paid off and I was happy with the results of my appointment.
