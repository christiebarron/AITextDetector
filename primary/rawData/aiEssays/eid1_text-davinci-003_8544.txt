Recently, I was in a very challenging situation. I was at an interview and the questions being asked were incredibly difficult. I could feel my nerves start to get to me but I pushed myself to remain calm. I took my time responding to each question and reminded myself not to rush. I could feel my palms start to sweat but I took some deep breaths and stayed focused.

At times, the interviewer also seemed to be getting impatient with me and made it clear he wanted me to hurry up. In those moments, I reminded myself that it was okay to take some time to think before I spoke, and this allowed me to get my composure back.

In the end, although the interview was an incredibly tough experience, I am proud of myself for staying patient and not letting my nerves take over. With patience and focus, I was able to answer the questions the best I could and leave the interview feeling confident in my performance.
