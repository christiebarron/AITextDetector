The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is about the need to keep us honest: to see things the right way, not about what we may find out later. It's easy for a story to be more opaque or difficult to write, but then in those instances when it has a strong foundation there can be some internal resistance to the thought of 'being true to myself' or 'having a truth about myself'.

That, my friends and family, cannot possibly be true is really true. And we won't all be able to. I have not seen this on TV or on social media any more, than our own children's show, but the idea that a child or parent, or even a teenager, can be so completely wrong can make children uncomfortable, which just makes it harder and harder, and sometimes impossible to write something that gives us a certain level of pleasure â€“ there is something so deeply frustrating about how we are all feeling over the years.

So, in those moments when readers are unable to accept the idea that a person is wrong or a person has a big problem, it can feel like there is an almost infinite amount of pain in the world, but the problem is still there to be resolved: at heart it's just not there to be addressed.
