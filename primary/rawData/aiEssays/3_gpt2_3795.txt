Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

In many senses, the setting is more appropriate if you're driving a long distance.

Reverse-Edges in RWD bikes

RWD bicycles are made from a frame known as an 'Edged Wheel'. This particular frame also includes a long leg that allows the rider to stand straight on the right. This particular bike is so large that it can be used as a double row for cross-hairs where the bike could still be ridden. The frame is a double sided 'X-Ride' that features a small side cover to help protect it from rain and mud if the tyres are not used.

The rear brakes come with a rear seatpost that fits the bike in a small bag. The bike has a 1-4.5-inch front rack and side-mounted hardpoints to help reduce drag along with an adjustable top tube. The rear seat is fitted with adjustable springs allowing the rider to position the bike at the desired location on the road as well as the brake levers.
