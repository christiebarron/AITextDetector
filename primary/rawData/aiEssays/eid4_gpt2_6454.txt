The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it's about a world of the spirit -- so much time and energy spent trying to navigate the world in which Jyn is being born. And, well, I think a lot of his time is trying to communicate with his family while continuing to learn from them -- it's amazing that that's true here -- but at the same time, there are so much more to life than it seems like.

Nrama: All right. I get you back on Earth, but what about the way those books were initially written? And that they were all written by William Lane Craig? I've heard that the first issue of the novel was written by Craig himself. What do you make of that?

Schuylkill: He wrote his own book. That was the next book that was written by Bryan Hitch -- I can't remember who wrote those books, but it was either by Craig or his daughter, I suppose? Craig first published the first eight installments (which I think was in early 1997), in the same issue, that we're talking about, and they took advantage of a little bit of the extra time when there was a world to explore in that book, and I think they wanted to focus on this very specific and complex time in his life just because that's where he was at that point in his life. It was all very exciting back then.
