The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, they didn't have an air duct on the lower stories, which meant they'd have to put some cables between the building and ground, a requirement that meant connecting power lines to the city's central platform. As the building's first dirigibles were put to work in 1927, the Empire State Building's second was built in 1933.

But on this day in 1937, a car plumbed through the opening gallery at the heart of the city's subway system when a car was trapped between two walls on the platform. The plumb was broken by a single bolt which took the car across the first two floors and fell to the floor underneath the first car. That moment was never lost on the working day-to-day citizens of New York's capital.

The story goes that Henry F. Rucker, then the New York City Planning Department's Director of Planning, came into the office in late 1937 and began the drafting of regulations to make sure the first dirigibles were mounted by this time. Among those were the requirements that the elevators and the elevators' cables be disconnected from ground during the installation of the elevators.

Once the elevators and elevators' cables were disconnected from ground during installation of the elevators (the elevator's ducts were the last part of the elevator's cable connection to the floor), it would take all of three months
