The task of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was an ambitious undertaking fraught with obstacles. The challenges associated with the docking of dirigibles were addressed in the book “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted.

The main obstacle with regards to the docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building was the wind currents that often buffet New York City. The strong winds would not have been an issue had the mooring mast that was constructed on the spire of the building been tall enough. However, the tallest mast that could be built on the spire was only seven stories high. This height was not only dangerously close to the height of the building but was also too short to anchor the dirigibles safely. As a result, the mooring mast did not reach high enough to be effective when the winds were strong.

Another obstacle was the lack of access points in the building. In order to dock the dirigibles, there needed to be passageway directly from the entrance of the building to the docking facility. However, due to the design of the Empire State Building, there were no direct access points leading from the main entrance to the docking facility. As a result, the dirigibles would have to come down into the lobby of the building and then be lifted up to the docking area, which was an incredibly dangerous prospect.

Finally, the biggest obstacle was the lack of
