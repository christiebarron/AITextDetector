I was out with my friends the other night at a comedy show, and I couldn't help but laugh. We were all having a great time, and the jokes were really funny. At one point, a particular joke cracked us all up and set off a chain of laughter. We all ended up laughing so hard that tears were streaming down our faces, and I don't think any of us had ever laughed that hard before.

After the show was over, I noticed my friend looking a little down. I asked her if she was okay, and she said she was just feeling a bit alone. That made me realize how valuable moments like these were, where everyone was linked together through laughter. I grabbed her hand and told her, “No, you’re not alone. We’re right here with you.”

That made us both laugh, and the mood lightened up. We were back to our usual selves, revisiting old memories and making new ones. The warm feeling of laughter filled the room and brought us closer.

It was nice to be able to laugh with my friends, and even though we don't get to see each other as much lately, it was good to know that laughter could still bring us together. Laughter is indeed the shortest distance between two people.
