Narciso Rodriguez’ memoir ‘From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives’ is one of the most powerful and emotive pieces of literature I have ever read. Rodriguez’s writing style evokes a strong atmosphere that transports the reader into the densely populated cities of Latin America, a place full of rich culture, food, and music. On each page, it reads as if Rodriguez is carefully preparing a painting instead of writing a manuscript. He illuminates the setting with his words, providing a comprehensive picture of Latin America and his life growing up, and immersing the reader in a melancholic yet heartwarming story of family, culture, and identity.

The memoir is filled with nostalgia, playing with a cyclical structure that takes the reader through Rodriguez's life from his birth to the present day. Rodriguez takes his experience of emigrating from Latin America and turns it into an intimate journey for both him and the reader. The chapters convey a bittersweet feeling of both joy and longing, sometimes bordering on sadness, as Rodriguez remembers the city he left behind to create a better life for himself and his family in the US.
