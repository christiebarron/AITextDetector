The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' shows 'a healthy, calm, loving, warm and loving relationship between an adult man and a young and healthy woman'.

The book is set in the 1960s – as part of the 'Vietnam War' era. It takes place in Vietnam – which, with North Vietnam facing a US invasion (in 1965) and its ally, Thailand which was now under Chinese rule (in 1965) the young man took over and took up the role of being "his wife".

The book follows John Locke in his journey. John uses his powers of persuasion and persuasion to persuade those around him, whether it is those of religion, politics, sex, sexuality or any subject to understand.

"Vietnam is casuistry, there is an understanding of truth and there is a sense of responsibility and empathy," wrote Pauline for the book. "The relationship was a personal one, he was raised on a family and family was an important part of his being raised.

"His family members include his mother whom he has adopted, his aunt and his uncle who are all women for many years.

"Many of the women he has grown through this period do not have the same trust, or who have not accepted his presence through marriage and other family-based relations.

"He also does not seek to change his upbringing, his family background, so he learns by doing."
