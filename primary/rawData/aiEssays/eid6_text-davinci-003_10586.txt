The prospect of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building created excitement, but the builders soon encountered multiple obstacles in realizing this vision. When the Empire State Building first opened in 1931, the building had a 400-foot mooring mast, designed to serve as a landing and docking platform for the anticipated zeppelin airships of the era. 

Implementing this docking system was a challenging feat, especially since many other efforts at accommodating the new airships had been unsuccessful. Building the mooring mast was one of the most difficult obstacles, as it involved making sure that the mast could withstand the weight and size of the airships. The mooring mast was a steel structure, unique in its design with a narrow base and wide top that D.J. Healy of the Weston Engineering Company had developed. It had to be constructed with extreme levels of precision in order to keep the structure stable and maintain its structural integrity.

Another obstacle was the R.E. Dietz Company, the fittings manufacturer for the mooring mast. Although the company was experienced in making various parts, the R.E. Dietz Company had to develop entirely new and specialized items in order to accommodate the airships. This included the creation of the conical hat attachment, designed to grip and secure the docking airships, as well as the vacuum lines, which gently lifted and set the airships onto the mooring mast.
