The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is about to be shared. In its first chapter, 'Fashion Is Not Your Style' the book also chronicles the experiences of a French student and a writer who became the first openly gay person in France in the early 1920s.

'I was the first woman to be interviewed by a major media, which in the years that followed, led to many accusations of homophobia and in particular anti-Semitism,' said Dr. Jean-Joseph Sondre, director of an institute at Rouen University. 'In light of the growing awareness that this is still a very public issue, and that people do not want to be associated with gay rights organisations, we urge our reader to read what is said."

The book is the culmination of a six-year project called 'Paris Gay Project'," initiated by Dr. Sondre in August 2011 and which is being run at the Paris Gay Project, a collaborative project of the National LGBT Centre and the New York State Humanistic Society.

'Fashion Is Not Your Style', published in French in mid-December, is the second novel in the book series on this project launched by Diamandis de Sondre and Mireille Linslet. 'The book is also being translated into English by Marie-Philippe Dupont, the editor of Que Brie.'
