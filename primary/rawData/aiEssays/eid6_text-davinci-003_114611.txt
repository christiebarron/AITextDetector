The construction of the Empire State Building in New York City was a feat of engineering and innovation for its time, as it was the world’s tallest building at the time of its completion in 1931. While the construction of the building itself was an impressive undertaking, the greatest challenge faced by the builders of the Empire State Building was the mooring mast project that would enable dirigibles to dock at the building. Obstacles such as the imposing height of the building and the risk involved in this relatively new form of air travel presented themselves throughout the project.

The mooring mast project was proposed by the U.S. Navy in 1927, and due to the building’s height of 1,250 feet, posed a challenge to engineers to effectively attach the mooring mast to the building without creating too much added stress on the structure. As a result, the mooring mast used to dock dirigibles had to be designed and installed differently than masts at other buildings of its time, as the weight of the mooring mast and the docked dirigible needed to be distributed over the building. As such, considerable engineering was required to develop the necessary calculations to ensure that the building and mooring mast would be able to handle the weight of the dirigibles, something that had never been done before.

In addition to the engineering challenges of the project, the danger of mooring such large airships posed a certain level of
