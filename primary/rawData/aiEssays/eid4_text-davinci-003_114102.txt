This ending serves as a metaphor for the narrator's struggles in school and in life in general. The hibiscus, a symbol of fragility, is used to represent the narrator's own vulnerability and fragility. The snows melting and geese returning symbolize the return of spring and a renewed confidence, which the narrator must gain in order to take the test again. It is also a symbol of hope, as the narrator believes that if she can make it through the winter, then surely she can make it through the tests. Moreover, the ending shows the narrator's determination to succeed even during difficult times.
