The Empire State Building has long held a symbolic importance in architecture and the city of New York. However, a relatively lesser-known attempt to allow dirigibles, or airships, to dock at the buildingâ€™s top in the 1930s almost made it more unique. Although the task of building the docking mast was a herculean one, the greatest obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock was the power of public fear.

When the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock on the top of the Empire State Building was proposed, it was met with intense skepticism and fear by many of the public. The large tethered balloons of the dirigibles contained significant amounts of combustible hydrogen gas, and the potential for disaster loomed overhead if a dirigible caught fire while docked.  This fear was only compounded by a number of major accidents that had occurred in the years prior to the installation of the mooring mast. In addtion to the Hindenburg disaster of 1937, other airships had also suffered similar disastrous fire-related incidents.

To combat this fear, the builders of the Empire State Building went to great lengths to ensure safety. The mooring mast itself, standing at 365 feet and weighing 120,000 pounds, was a marvel of engineering made with a high-grade steel alloy. Itss construction provided strength as well as provided protection from lightning, and it was built with multiple safeguards to
