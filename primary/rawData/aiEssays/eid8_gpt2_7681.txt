One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I heard how many men had been dead in my household. I got a glimpse of it when I saw the pictures of the dead women standing at the end of the street, on a cordon at a funeral line. They had been dragged out of the graveyard, cut off from sunlight and thrown away in the bushes. For some reason, they hadn't left their bodies in the back. I didn't know what they would come back with because it was an empty tomb somewhere, some kind of mass. The only way was to go and see it if that idea of seeing a mass of flesh and blood would allow me to experience it.

I didn't know anything about the body until I read the Bible, which I believe was written before the end of the fourth chapter of the Deuteronomy. While I still believed in an afterlife, and was interested in what it all meant, we didn't know about the soul outside of the story. As a result, I became skeptical.

I started to read the Deuteronomy a few times. At first I didn't know what to believe. I couldn't believe most of the things I read. But I read it because it would be the perfect story for me. I don't believe in an afterlife because I don't know what to believe or not to believe. My mind is free, in a way, to accept whatever I might not be able to believe.
