I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is wrong but the reality is that it will also result in unfair economic pressure on students who are already poor in libraries. It will also increase the number of people who find themselves faced with the same pressure as before."

The government has so far refused to take legal action against a number of academic publishers, notably Penguin and NewSee.

The government's proposals, which are set to cost between $10,000 and $15,000 a year for the libraries, include a new legal requirement that libraries publish books and "public works" to students, plus an increase in the number of online courses.

Those who do not abide by one of these conditions received a fine of between $4,000 and $15,000 - including the publishers' lawyers and their expenses - and were able to continue to work at the libraries.

However, Mr Davis, the Education Department minister, said: "The new online curriculum will affect students. Some universities are closing classrooms and will have to close or suspend academic courses, which should also mean that students have to pay for tuition, and that can result in an increased workload for students.

"As well as that there has been a reduction in the number of books and public works that can be taken away, and the number of people who have used the library to work. I'm also concerned that in some areas students don't understand how we can help them."
