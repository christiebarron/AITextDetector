The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it goes beyond his childhood fantasies. You don't have to read it to realize that it's a fantastic, moving, and, yes, seriously insightful book that takes you on a new journey to see humanity not only as it exists in the world but in the world through somber themes which include war and peace. In "The End of the Year" I hope you won't miss out.
