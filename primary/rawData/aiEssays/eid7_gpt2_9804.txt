An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my 12-year-old son, who is just about to get a surgery and who has to be confined to a crib as his mother is going through chemotherapy. My dad was going to perform the procedure, but I was out of the running. When I arrived they said they would be doing a second operation but he said goodbye early and we spent the day together waiting and being hugged. Just like you see around here I am sure one of you wouldn't want your family to be in the hospital that night. So we talked and when the procedure came the kids started to cry and we were so happy to see that they are alright.

Dawn: How do you say goodbye now to her?

Tori: It's been such an emotional day. As we have spoken, my mom is also leaving my brother.

Dawn: And you have to let our family go.

Tori: Yes, I know I do. But we know that we have a lot of questions unanswered, so my dad and I are going to take care of most of the questions and try not to leave any unanswered.

Dawn: One of them is about how she felt as you started treating her.

Tori: Oh, yeah, okay. So, what did you say and feel when she left?

Dawn: Oh, very personal. We were all looking for answers,
