In 1931, it was the dream of a few pioneering minds to build the Empire State Building and to have the first ever mooring mast that would allow airships, or dirigibles, to dock at this iconic structure. As ambitious as this idea sounded, the builders encountered numerous and unexpected obstacles while attempting to make the dream a reality. 

The main obstacle was the high winds that the Empire State Building faced on the top of its location in Manhattan. The winds often blowing at a velocity of 70 miles per hour or more made finding one stable point on the building to moor a dirigible to virtually impossible. The builders first attempted to build giant conduits to funnel the winds to the edges of the mast, offering the airships a calm point of mooring, yet the immense size of the building and the velocity of the winds made this approach too costly and unfeasible. 

In order to surmount this obstacle, the builders sought out the assistance of aeronautical experts. With their help, the builders ultimately built a unique apparatus on the top of the building that could be adjusted to account for any windload. This new apparatus, known as the Anchor Mast Track, was essentially a large piece of metal that could be curved to create a safe, sheltered environment for an airship to dock. Unfortunately, even with this new invention, the mooring mast was not immune to the winds completely, which forced the engineers to include a braking
