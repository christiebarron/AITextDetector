In his poem “Rough Road Ahead,” Joe Kurmaski describes a cyclist’s journey through a challenging terrain. The cyclist must face a road with numerous potholes, mud, and debris, and then take a dive through a thunderstorm. The features of the setting play an essential role in the poem, and greatly affect the cyclist’s experience. 

The most prominent feature of the settings in the poem is the physical terrain of the road that the cyclist is traveling on. As the cyclist moves ahead, they face a potholed road, mud, and other debris that can slow them down. This makes the cyclist’s journey more difficult, as they are struggling to overcome the physical obstacles in their way. In addition, the cyclist has to take a dive through a thunderstorm, which can be extremely dangerous. The thunderstorm adds a sense of danger and excitement to the poem, as the cyclist is taking a risky endeavor.

Despite the difficult conditions of the setting, the cyclist presses on and overcomes the obstacles. This exemplifies a determined spirit, which is reflective of the cyclist’s attitude. The setting is a physical manifestation of the individual’s journey through life, and how they must persevere and overcome the obstacles that come their way. In this way, the features of the setting serve to influence and shape the cyclist’s journey throughout the poem.
