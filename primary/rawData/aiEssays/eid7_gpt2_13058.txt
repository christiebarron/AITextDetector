An example of a time someone in my life was patient was one of the patients in my apartment who was suicidal. He was hospitalized for depression. He was a great patient. He was kind, kind of very helpful.

"But that patient who was suffering from bipolar disorder was also a very depressed man. He wasn't depressed at all. He was not depressed because of a mental illness. He wasn't depressed because he was having a hard time coping with it and being depressed and struggling with depression. He was depressed because he didn't want to become more depressed. That's the way it is. You do not want to become so depressed as to become suicidal.

"If you have feelings that your life is going to change so that you're not experiencing depression when you've just lost your job, what do you do to keep them out of that life? It's quite dangerous because a lot of times you can have an extremely severe depression."

"A lot of times, people just use depression as an excuse to just sit around and write their thoughts down," he says. "Because then you're always doing things that will keep them from doing anything else. It's actually quite easy. I don't say it like that, because I know that those individuals who aren't interested in doing the things you're 0000ing on are really not interested in the way to be the person that they're being told to be, because they're going to change their mindset.
