I remember the first time I met my husband like it was yesterday. We went out for dinner at a restaurant near our university campus, and we were both so incredibly nervous. We had been talking over text and video for weeks, but we both still weren't sure if things were going to click in person.

As the evening went on, conversation started to flow more naturally and before we knew it, we were both cracking jokes and laughing uncontrollably. Suddenly it felt like all of the uncertainty and awkwardness was gone and it was like we had known each other forever.

I think it was that night that both of us realized that we knew this could be something more. That laughter was a bond that we both shared - something that felt like a foundation on which we could build a life together. Looking back on it now, I realize that was the moment that I knew he was the one.
