In the memoir 'From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives' by Narciso Rodriguez, a unique mood is created that captivates and transports the reader. Narciso's vivid descriptions and attention to detail create feelings of a timelessness, nostalgia, and wonder.

The memoir begins in the early morning hours of a summer day in New Jersey where Narciso nostalgically remembers his life growing up in the Bronx. As readers are invited to accompany him on his journey of memory, he creates an atmosphere of warmth, peace and tranquility. There is a feeling of respect and reverence in how he speaks of the place he grew up, and those who populated it. As he goes through his memories—losing himself—he portrays the innocence of childhood, of pursuing dreams and passions, and of love.

The purity of summer air that Narciso portrays sets a peaceful background to his recollections. Every detail, every person, every moment leads the reader to understand his memories better. As the memoir progresses, there is a mood of profound nostalgia. He brings the reader to his home, in the past, and into the beauty and mystique of life. This setting is extended in the afterword of the memoir, as Narciso pens a letter to his unborn child, recounting his dreams; his words are gentle and hopeful, expressing not only his love for his child but also showing clearly the power of the memories he is leaving.
