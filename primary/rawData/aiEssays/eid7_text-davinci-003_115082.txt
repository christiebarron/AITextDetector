When I was younger, my parents adopted a sweet puppy from a shelter. At first, she was hesitant and scared of her new environment. We had to spend weeks trying to get her to trust us and warm up to us. It was a difficult time and I was so eager to bond with her. 

My patience paid off though and one day while I was lying on the floor she finally approached me and crawled into my arms. After that, we became best friends and she even slept in my bed with me!

It's amazing what patience can do. I'm so grateful for the hard work I put in because now I have an amazing companion and loyal friend.
