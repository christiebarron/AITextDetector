The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The building, built in 1930 in a brick-like structure on a hillside overlooking downtown, collapsed in a fire last year. The building was still functioning but was completely torn down, while its owners attempted to rebuild it.

The only buildings that were abandoned in the city after World War II were the Empire State Building and the Empire State Theatre, which opened on December 9, 1934. Before the building fell on September 6, 1932, three of the tallest buildings in New York City were abandoned in the aftermath of the World War II.
