The Empire State Building was built with a mast designed to allow airships (or dirigibles) to dock. However, this ambition of directors Starrett and Whann was met with various obstacles, which needed to be overcome before the dream of airship travel could become a reality.

The most significant obstacle facing the designers of the Empire State Building was the structural integrity of the mast itself. It had to be securely planted in the foundations of the building and be able to hold the weight of a full-sized airship without compromising its structural stability. For this reason, the mast was designed to be 450 feet tall, thicker at the base than a normal steel beam would be, and with four separate steel cables running up the side of the beam and cemented into the foundation. While it is almost inconceivable today, this was a daring engineering feat for the 1930â€™s. 

The next obstacle to be overcome was the size and maneuverability of the airships. The mooring mast was designed to accommodate the new behemoth airships, such as the Graf Zeppelin, which were up to two hundred and fifty feet in length. This meant that the airships had to be able to navigate the twists and turns of the New York City skyline, something which was not possible without prior codevelopment between Empire State engineers and the airship builders. 

The designers of the building also had to contend with the laws of aerodynamics. Calcul
