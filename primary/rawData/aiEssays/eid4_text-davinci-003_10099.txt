At the end of the story, the protagonist, Tony, is reflecting on all that the hibiscus--a symbol of his connection to his mother, his culture, and his home--means to him. The imagery of the snows melting and the geese returning is a visual representation of Tony's hope that this connection will be renewed and strengthened. Just as nature moves in cycles, Tony hopes that he will have the opportunity to take the test again and prove himself to his parents. The imagery of the hibiscus blooming serves as a reminder that he can do this if he works hard and stays determined.
