The speaker in Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho is a student struggling with her schoolwork, and the poem ends with her making a commitment to retake a test she hasn't previously been successful on. This imagery of the hibiscus budding in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return, reflects the rebirth she is committing to. She knows she will be able to approach her studies with a renewed energy and dedication once the new season arrives. By ending the poem with this thought, the poem draws to a positive conclusion that the speaker will succeed in her test and provides optimism for her future.
