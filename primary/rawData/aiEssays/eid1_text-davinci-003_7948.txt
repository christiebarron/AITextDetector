The memoir From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez creates an air of introspection and nostalgia that helps to transport the reader to their own memories and stories.

Rodriguez creates a mood of contemplation by focusing on the everyday, mundane moments from his past that had the greatest impact on his life. He touches on everything from religion, family, loss, and identity, all through his childhood lens. This lens allows readers to portray their own experiences in contrast, inviting them to reflect on how they also evolved through time and how their own personal journeys have shaped who they are today.

The memoir offers a sense of recognition, and it's interesting to see how Rodriguez intertwines both personal reflection and the passages of time together. Through his writing, the here-and-now takes a backseat to a broader look at how existence is connected to memories and history.

The mood of the book is bittersweet, as Rodriguez evokes both pride and struggle. He spends time reflecting on the strength of the people and culture of his upbringing, while also highlighting the pain of his ancestors in a way that allows readers to both recognize and feel its importance. Some of the scenes from his past are almost haunting, and readers can feel the effects of their losses and triumphs in the poetry as they relate it to their own stories.

Ultimately, the memoir is a powerful reminder that no matter where life takes us, the home we build for ourselves is
