Minfong Ho ends "Winter Hibiscus" with this line because it speaks to the main theme of the poem: resilience. The protagonist of the poem is a young student struggling through school, a metaphor for her journey to adulthood. The winter, and the difficulty that comes with it, is meant to evoke the hardships in her life, while the hibiscus, a tropical flower, is a reminder of her own resilience and the hope that perseverance will bring in the future. The winter will eventually pass and so will the struggles she faces. The student will take the test again in the spring, as the snow and geese return, and the hibiscus continues to bloom. This is symbolizing her determination and courage to keep going, no matter the obstacles and struggles she faces.
