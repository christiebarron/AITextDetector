The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

First in the form of a metal dome to protect the steel from air, that dome also had air-blocking doors bored inside, as it would normally trap a rocket's flight path.

The dome's air-suppressed wall would have been designed to deflect rockets to escape from the air, and if a rocket made a nose out of the dome, the pressure might have been sufficient to push it off the building.

However, it was ultimately unsuccessful because there was no one inside the building.

In fact, many of the building's members had to be confined to a chair for several days. By then, most members of the building's workers found that they were tired, especially of the work being done for them: the first time a building had to work. They went back to their desks to ask for help, and then later to find themselves being transported into their jobs.

One might speculate that the building could only be allowed to be used by its own members to get to work, but in its case, it would only be a matter of time before some of them had to leave. They would be
