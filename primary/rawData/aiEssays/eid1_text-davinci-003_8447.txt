I remember a time when my best friend and I got into a huge argument over something insignificant. We had both completely blown the situation out of proportion and were both starting to get angry. 

I could feel my blood starting to boil and my fists curling, but I decided that I should take a deep breath and remain patient. I stayed focused on my breathing and remained silent as I acknowledge my feelings without letting them overpower me. 

My friend eventually took a few moments for himself too and soon he was calmer as well. When he had cooled down, he decided to apologize for his part in the argument and we were soon able to apologize to each other and move on with our day.

I'm proud of myself for having remained patient, especially when it was difficult, and it's probably one of the best decisions I've made in that moment. It helped us move past the argument faster and stronger.
