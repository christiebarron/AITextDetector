The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, they had limited supply in an already oversupplied building sector. Second, despite this, the construction of the Empire State Building was still more than capable of accommodating all city departments, such as police departments and schools.

After the 2nd Avenue bridge was designed, another entrance was added. In its time, a 1.5-mile segment stretching from the center to a 2.5-mile section were built to serve as the bridge, with 1,000 seats at each end.
