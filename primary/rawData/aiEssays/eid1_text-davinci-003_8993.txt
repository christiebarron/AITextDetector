Dear Editor,

I am writing to offer my opinion about the effects of computers on people. In my view, computers can be a powerful tool that can improve a person’s quality of life. With the rise of computer technology, many activities that once required manual labor, like banking, have become automated and much easier for us to access and pursue. Furthermore, computers have opened up a world of opportunities in communication and knowledge.

However, it is important to be wary of some of the potential downsides of computers. It’s easy to become consumed with screens, resulting in too much time being spent outside in the real world. This could lead to reduced social skills, and social interaction which is necessary for mental and physical wellness. Additionally, excessive computer use can cause neck, back, and wrist strain, leading to health issues.

For these reasons, moderation is essential in the use of computers. Computers can be a great asset, but it is important to remember to maintain a balance of activities between physical activities and computer use. Finding that balance is an essential part of any person’s life.

I am sure other readers have their own experiences with computers, and I hope this letter has been able to shed some light on my opinion.

Sincerely, 
[Name]
