I remember the first time I met my husband so well – it was love at first sight! But I think the moment that sealed the deal was the one where we both just burst out laughing over something silly. 

It happened during an afternoon date at the beach. We had just finished our picnic and were talking about all sorts of things when I made a joke about how I thought my sunglasses were cool enough to be in a spy movie. He just burst out laughing, and my own laughter soon followed. It was so spontaneous, genuine, and carefree – I think it really set the tone for our relationship. 

From then on, every conversation, disagreement, or disagreement we had contained at least a little laughter, even in the hard times. And I think that's why we've been together for so long – the little moments of laughter and joy.
