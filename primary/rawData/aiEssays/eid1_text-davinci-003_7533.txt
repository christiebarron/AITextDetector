The narrator in Minfong Ho's book Winter Hibiscus is a young immigrant girl who is trying to assimilate into her new home of Minnesota. The hibiscus plant she has is symbolic of her struggles of trying to fit in and make a home in an unfamiliar place. By the end of the story, the narrator has taken a stand by refusing to take an unfair standardized test, and sacrificing her chance to succeed. The ending line is a metaphor for the hope she has that if she succeeds in making a home for herself and making a life here, then perhaps she will be able to be successful the next time she takes the test- when the hibiscus blooms again in the spring.
