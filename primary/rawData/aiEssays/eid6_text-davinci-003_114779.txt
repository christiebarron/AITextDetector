The Empire State Building was an ambitious project that included a plan to accommodate the up and coming technology of dirigibles in the form of a docking mast on the building. However, the plan to incorporate this docking mast was faced with various obstacles, including but not limited to technical, financial, and legal issues.

To begin, the technical hurdles proved to be a great challenge. It was unclear exactly how big of a mast would be needed to secure a dirigible and at what elevation should the mast be placed. It also proved difficult to be sure that the mast wouldn’t pose a threat to the dirigible either while in flight or while in dock. Additionally, the mast needed to be built with the flexibility to move in the wind and also be secure enough to handle the dynamic loads from a dirigible docking. To add to these technical issues, the mast needed to withstand harsh weather conditions, especially powerful gusts of wind.

Financially, the Empire State Building was already an expensive venture and the added cost of installing the docking mast proved to be too great, especially since the plans for the dirigible never fully materialized throughout the Building’s life. Furthermore, because the intent of the designers was to make the docking mast lucrative, there needed to be multiple companies that needed the service in order to cover the cost of production, installation and maintenance. This unfortunately hindered the project from moving forward.

The last major obstacle was of the legal nature
