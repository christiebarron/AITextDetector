I had a long day at work and I was exhausted when I arrived home. My partner was already there and had been waiting, with dinner, for over an hour. I plopped down onto the couch next to him and he gave me a look that said it all.

"I know, I know," I said, rubbing my eyes. "I'm sorry about dinner."

He raised an eyebrow at me, and I thought for sure I was about to get a lecture. Instead, he just started to laugh. I was so taken aback that I started to laugh, too. We just kept going, laughing until we were nearly in tears.

The funny thing was, there was nothing actually funny about the situation. We had both been so stressed out all day, but somehow, this moment of shared laughter was enough to remind us of how much we needed it â€” and each other. We ended up spending the rest of the night sitting on the couch, just talking and laughing. It ended up being the best night of the week.

From that night forward, laughter was always our go-to remedy when things got tough. Whenever one of us was feeling down, the other started to make silly jokes until we were both roaring with laughter.

There's no doubt that laughter is one of the best things for keeping a relationship strong. After all, it's true that laughter is the shortest distance between two people.
