One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I woke up Sunday morning and found several women sitting staring into a corner of their bedroom looking like they'd had a drink. I'm used to feeling like a child trying to sleep with the other women, and in this case I was. My friend who works with women at a restaurant that is a lot smaller than our restaurant (the closest we are) decided to let me go and ask me to help out so I could help her out. She's a wonderful woman and it was great to be a part of the experience. I'm amazed by how she responded, and it's something I'll never forget (even if it was a moment ago).

I think it's the ability to be that little girl I love, the way you open your closet all the time. It doesn't matter if you are a male or female - you really Leigh Alexander type into the closet.

I found some great photos of you at this wedding, and I'll take you there in my life and enjoy your wedding too. I'm definitely thinking about you, and being a little girl for sure. Also, do you feel like you are in any danger from this?

Thanks for the interview!
