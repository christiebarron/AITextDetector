The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' and 'I Am the Best' to the emotional highs or highs of working for two weeks in a row has been incredibly uplifting

This isn't quite the most inspiring thing about the experiences I have had in this life. This is a woman who loves to be alone in the world, a person in denial about all sorts of things, people who often seem to feel more free to push themselves. And while my experiences will change my mental image of justice, it's safe to say they will never come to fruition. They're still not enough piling on the pain and suffering while we're trying to do our best.

Because it's so different from being "free".

That leaves me feeling like I'm no longer free because what I want is a world that is in my favor and I will never go to. There's not much money I can save to try and make a decent living out of it. I've seen many individuals, especially homeless people, who refuse to accept that no matter how much they lose control or lack motivation, they were just living by this very same logic. No matter what people say about me and my abilities, I live by this kind of logic when I'm looking for what works for me and my future in order to do as much as I want. This may be hard, especially for people who are a little more accepting of what they see, but I can accept my fate.
