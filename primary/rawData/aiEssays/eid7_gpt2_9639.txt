An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was in a coma for a heart attack during a stint as an intern for IBM's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARC). I was in this time for five days. The doctors were on top of everyone else on the scene, and I was just trying desperately and nervously to explain to them which way I needed to go. The first thing I noticed was that a white-on-black sheet with a single cross-shaped window in it appeared to move in a line of all the other people who were waiting in line with me, all the way down to being all three feet behind the screen of the hospital. It was actually two blocks behind me.

It's almost like the picture of my back being straight. It's been very frustrating to me personally. I'm actually in rehab now and I'm trying to pay my bills. Just trying to do my job and get back out of that horrible condition.

You write that as you've worked through each step of your recovery. Is that something you've had an impact on since then

It's much the same experience that's happened to young doctors. I can't say much about that. It's something that has always been on my mind.

I know how difficult it's been so far. After the first seven months or so of recovery, I was pretty optimistic. Everyone I worked with in the hospital was pretty happy, especially after my surgery
