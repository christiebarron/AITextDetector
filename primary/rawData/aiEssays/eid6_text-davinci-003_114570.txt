The task of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was an ambitious one, bringing with it a host of obstacles. The achievements of the engineering team behind this project are commendable, as the dirigibles-to-docking available to skyscrapers was unprecedented.

Prior to the actual implementation, several years were spent researching the materials and techniques needed to make the dirigible docking successful. Even then, once the designs were complete, the possibility of the high winds on the roof of the Empire State Building creating significant problems arose. A strong wind could cause the dirigible to be blown off course and away from the mooring mast. To counter this, the engineers designed a thirty-foot portal into which the dirigible would dock.

Despite the careful design, the size and weight of the dirigibles presented an issue, as they exceeded the mastâ€™s carrying capacity of twelve tons. In order to cope with the excess weight, the engineers designed a six-foot steel ring to be fitted between the mast and the dirigible in order to spread out the weight. A little over two hundred tons of concrete had to be added to the top of the Empire State Building in order to secure the mast.

The final issue that had to be overcome before the dirigibles could dock safely was navigation. Without a clear pathway, the dirigibles could be severely hampered. To compensate for this, a powerful searchlight system was installed
