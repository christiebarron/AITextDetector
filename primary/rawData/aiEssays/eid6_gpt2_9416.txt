The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Some of them were more sophisticated: two-dimensional flat walls meant the planes could be folded in half, rather than folded back. Others were more complicated; to see what kind of structures they could mount in, engineers had to create the wings above their heads.

The original dirigibles — to make them even shorter and more flexible than the real ones they could be mounted on — could also be mounted on a pedestal. This was done to help create the illusion of wing windows, so that the tower would look more like a plane.

But it took a great deal of work to find the right angles for the twin towers to be in place: Building bite by bite.

On some of the project's earlier flights, designers kept the wings in place. It was a lot better to try and make it look longer — that would give the wings time to be folded under pressure. But now pilots were starting to notice that if they flew back to the airfield to take off from, the wings seemed to stay in place, just by the airspeed of the aircraft when in the air.

An angle like this would make it harder for designers to make this illusion fly better, but it worked.
