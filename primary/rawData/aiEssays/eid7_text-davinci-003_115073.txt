 

I was recently at the store, waiting in line to buy groceries. It was a busy time of day and the clerk was having a difficult time with the customer ahead of me. The customer had brought a lot of coupons, but the clerk couldn't seem to get them to scan properly. 

I could see how frustrated the customer was getting, but instead of becoming impatient, I chose to be patient. I took a few deep breaths, smiled, and waited patiently while they worked out the details. 

Eventually, the clerk was able to figure out the issue and the customer paid for their groceries. They were very grateful that I was so understanding and patient. It was a small moment, but it felt good to help others in a situation that was out of their control.
