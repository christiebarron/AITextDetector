Computers have many effects on people.

You may be able to learn anything from how people respond in stressful situations. As you start to make things happen, it can take an emotional toll on you.

How to deal with mental health issues

I've come across people who have experienced something similar to bipolar disorder. They've encountered an intense loss of focus and lack of energy due to lack of resources, or some combination of these. They then find themselves at risk of losing their life when they don't have the "balance of life" that they need.

You have enough problems and stressors to drive them crazy. There may even be something to be learned from those who experience these kind of moments. It may be something the family member or doctor you're with might suggest. It may be something you need to take action towards.

You can start to get your mental illness under control when you get your medication. That will help you take care of yourself.
