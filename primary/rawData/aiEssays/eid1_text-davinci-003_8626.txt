I was out to dinner with my wife for our anniversary. Normally we play it cool, but something about that night felt different. We both started to make jokes about each other, and we couldn't help but laugh together. We just kept going back and forth until we had tears in our eyes from laughing so hard. The whole restaurant was in an uproar of laughter and the other tables were cheering us on. We talked for hours, just recounting fun memories and exchanging stories. 

When the night was over, I knew our relationship had been strengthened. I thought back to how the laughter had brought us closer together, and I realized that laughter really is the best medicine for any relationship.
