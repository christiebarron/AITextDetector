I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a fundamental principle that must be upheld on public level. It is critical that libraries, especially libraries of all sizes and to all corners of the world, be a place of openness. For the public as a whole, the library must contribute," says Peter Vaz, chairman of the Board and President of the Center for Information Technology and Library Diversity at Johns Hopkins University. "Openness, if it is to continue to exist in the world as a community, must contribute as well.""We have to make sure that we are following the principles that we put up with for generations, that we have a commitment that should not be watered down."The idea of a library is to educate, not protect, but rather to educate the world with a wide range of subjects. This is more fundamental to libraries, including research and teaching, than for a single institution, says Vaz. "While I think that public libraries should provide a voice, a voice outside of the public sector, we should provide access in every kind of way. We need to know about these kinds of things, or, at least, we've done a lot of research about the role of public libraries in this place."In the world today, information about the contents of a public library is often passed back to the library by the public library, where it can often be traced back to an individual, says Richard R. Kornmesser, president of Cornell, the national president of the Federation
