I believe that censorship of materials in libraries should be prohibited, but in order to do so we must take all relevant factors into consideration in order to limit harmful, misleading or otherwise harmful use of the materials in libraries."

However, the Government has been criticised for its refusal to act against the rights of critics to speak out at public hearings.

"We have a duty to ensure we are not making our voices heard because of what has been said," said Mr Hunt, MP for South Yorkshire West and North East Yorkshire, the MP for Southwark South East and West Bromwich North.

"We must respect that the people who have received death and injury in these circumstances are entitled to speak out about what they are doing.

"No one should be penalised for speaking up for personal, professional or political reasons.

"The government's policy about censorship of materials in libraries must be consistent with public values and that includes safeguarding the privacy and anonymity of all potential staff."

The Education Secretary has made no formal statement about the plans for the changes to the legal system, but did say that he hoped that many of the requests made from the public about them would be "discussed with the relevant police."

A spokesman for the Department for Education declined to comment, saying that it is "committed to ensuring the well-being of all those affected by our information-sharing measures - including those who use our libraries with the greatest respect."
