The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because the series is so far gone. It's a lot of writing that I am extremely pleased with. What I don't like is the characterization. He's very different in some aspects and he's not as good as I thought he would be. He's not quite as good as I anticipated. I don't think what he did in this story had anything to do with what I thought and thought about him at that point in his lives. What I think I did was that he is a good person who, as a person, does a lot of well with people and makes a lot of good decisions as well. The thing has nothing to do with that. The important thing is that he can be a good person and a good listener and a good listener with those things. The book is much more about that. It's not a very good book. It's more of a very, very short story, and so the ending has nothing to do with my expectations of what it might take to make him a good listener. The other major point to say it's much more about me being angry that I have to write a story that's going to upset somebody about my own actions and their beliefs about why I'm this person. It doesn't have anything to do with that.
