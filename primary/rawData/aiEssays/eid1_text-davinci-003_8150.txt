The construction of the Empire State Building was a remarkable feat of engineering that allowed for the mooring of dirigibles at the top of the building. This posed a great set of obstacles, however, that the builders needed to overcome in order to ensure the safe docking of dirigibles.

The primary obstacle to the success of the mooring mast was the large wind gusts at 1,050 feet above the ground. The aerodynamics of the building had to be modified to combat the power of the wind. The designers designed a 130 foot mast with steel cables extending from it to act as the mooring ropes for the dirigibles. This mast would be extended from the top floor of the Empire State Building and into the sky. The steel cables were designed to be lightweight and rigid enough to withstand winds up to 100 miles per hour.

Additionally, the designers had to consider the crowd control and safety of people who were visiting the Empire State Building for its wonderful views. The mooring mast was constructed around a series of platforms, allowing for the safe boarding and exiting of passengers after they moor the dirigible. In order to ensure the safety of the people, the designers had to install gates and barriers to block off the mooring mast from the general public.

Finally, the designers had to consider elements such as the size and weight of the dirigible, the materials used for the mooring mast, and the anchoring of
