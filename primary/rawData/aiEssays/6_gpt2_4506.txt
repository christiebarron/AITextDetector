The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, the designers of the Building Code required that builders use air-conditites for electrical power generation to power the building. That had to be done through a crane.

Then, due to construction delays in the 1940s, the Empire State Building began to receive power from electric power plants. But while their power was being generated and used, electric power plants had to run to avoid the need for any electrical backup systems. So, the builders made the engineering decisions that the gas turbine, which would be built in the Empire State Building, would be powered solely by electric sources, not by conventional power.

So, it's been very difficult to make a power project using the Empire State Building, let alone a solar-powered wind farm.

In March, the building was scheduled to reopen for a special ceremony on March 19, 2013.

A New Space Needle for Construction

The original plans of building a new Empire State Building used several different construction methods. Here's an explanation: the Empire State Building was built in 1938, while the Space Center was slated to open in 1954. Building codes dictated that a new building be located at the end of the building's three floors, which was required to house both the Space Center and the main building.

So, because of the need for a new construction, the space needed to be located in either the Empire State
