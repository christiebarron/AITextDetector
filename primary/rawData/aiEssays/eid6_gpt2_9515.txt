The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The First and Second World Serenades were built with more open air air and raised in a high volume to provide the atmosphere. The structure became the hub of all the development that was going on at the time, the Serenade-building, and for most buildings in the city the first dirigibles were built on the east side of the building (the Serenade-building).

The development of the Empire State Building began with the completion of the first new dirigibles in 1919. Dirigibles are an important part of the system in that the builders were making the construction of the system look more like real estate. The real estate is not just the result of the workers who are working behind the scenes rather more on the facade as such.

The first new dirigibles were built in 1921 for the City of Detroit. In 1923, the Empire State Building (which was built as an additional twin of the existing Empire State Building ) completed a full renovation of both of these buildings. The City built a new, double lobby with a view of the city center and in 1925 the city's Empire State building became one of the tallest in the world. The buildings continued to be one of the most beautiful in the city for over 40 years.
