Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people and to urge your readers to agree with me.

In my opinion, computers have had both positive and negative effects on people. On the one hand, computers can improve work efficiency, increase knowledge and even provide entertainment. People can work remotely, make informed decisions, and enjoy movies and games on computers. On the other hand, computers can be a source of distraction and contribute to addiction. People can easily get carried away by their screens, mindlessly browsing social media or playing video games for hours, neglecting important activities like work and social interactions.

There are pros and cons to computers, but the consequences of not controlling a computer habit can be severe. Therefore, people should be aware of the potential harms of computers and set limits on their usage. For example, people should make a plan and stick to it. Allowing themselves some "screen time," as long as it does not become excessive, can be beneficial and allow good use to be made of technology.

Overall, I believe that computers can be powerful tools for productivity, entertainment, and knowledge, if used responsibly. People should recognize potential pitfalls, be mindful of their usage, and set clear limits to maximize their computer use.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
