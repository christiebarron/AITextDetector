The building of the Empire State Building in New York City marked an incredible feat of engineering and architecture. Upon its completion, the Empire State Building was the tallest building in the world and became an iconic part of the landscape of New York City. An interesting fact about the Empire State Building is that it was designed to include a mooring mast which would allow dirigibles to dock at the top. However, the builders faced several challenges in allowing the dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building.

The first obstacle the builders faced was an issue of stability. Docking a dirigible at the top of such a large building required stability so that the dirigible could remain upright. This meant that the mooring mast had to be incredibly strong and able to withstand the weight of a large dirigible. The mast also had to be designed to resist the high winds that can occur in New York City, as well as the pulling and pushing of the dirigible when docking. 

The second challenge the builders faced related to the architecture of the building. The empire State Building is composed of a steel frame, which would need special reinforcement to be able to support the weight of a large dirigible. Additionally, the landing space on top of the building needed to be large enough to accommodate a dirigible and the crew. This meant that two extra floors were added to the top of the building to create the space needed.
