One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my husband died my last year of a cancer of the liver. My youngest thought he was a loser, but as my eyes watered with tears, I began to wonder if, after having this many years, he would ever recover. I had never experienced anything like it in my life.

I was a boy in my 10s at this stage and my mother was a doctor, but was the last one around. So we always saw her around the pool or while walking home from school. My mother passed away in 1999, but our family got through a slow death.

I always wondered if I should try to help my mother with my grief. But the problem was that there were people out there who were all just trying to see a smile that was real. They loved me even more than I do. They were all just looking to have a change in a very sad and emotional relationship.

I learned that there are certain people who are willing to try to show you a bit something to convince you. To have a friend go out with you and show you a new way to live. To make a life more happy. Not just by having a friend out there. Not just on the street in front of you in a blue T-shirt, but there. They will be that way too.

Some are just too hard on others. I just think it's important to keep the one I love close and happy.
