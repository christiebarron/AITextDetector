An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my older brother after learning he had cancer. Even though he wouldn't have loved getting tested for cancer that day, he was more than happy he got tested. He really did appreciate what he heard from the doctors. I also believe the next time my brother tells you that you should give him a shot he'll know how much effort it took to put an end to that story.
