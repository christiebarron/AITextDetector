Computers have many effects on people. At the very least, they give us a good indication of what's really happening. People are changing their minds.

Why is data so useful?

It's a great question. In many ways, data is important. But it's difficult to use. It can be tedious enough to write a simple, but data-oriented program and then read an hour's worth of notes from one person on a computer (for example, an 18-year-old in the Philippines). Data-based tools offer the ability to use it quickly, effectively and effectively. A more sophisticated approach, which is the ability to draw from data, is a great way to find a problem (which most people can relate to), but for large-scale scientific projects it's a lot tougher. As a result, we have to keep using data to get better.

And there's one caveat: Data doesn't mean very much. "In many large biomedical applications like cognitive physiology, the human brain is really only a tool, rather than a tool to manipulate cognition," says J. D. Heimers, a molecular physicist at the University of Missouri, who has been studying this topic for more than 10 years. But in any case, data has some interesting applications, like the ability to build predictive models (from a few weeks of looking at a couple of data points to a million or so).
