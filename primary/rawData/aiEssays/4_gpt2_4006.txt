The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it says:

"I had been forced to spend much of the time wondering how much time would the young people of England need…

"The same story was told many generations later…

…but I'm just glad that all these lovely years and wonderful people – all those lovely stories from my own time, are worth reading, and so can I!

"I would be far wrong to place the burden of being in my house on myself, for I could not care less what happened to me when I got there to be honest."
