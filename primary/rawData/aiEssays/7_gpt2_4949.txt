An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my father. I remember that he was very good at teaching me to read. I wasn't, and I did.

When you're talking about, say, the death of a child (that's a baby, not a parent) it's very comforting to get into some deep conversation about how that happens. You're giving it a little thoughtfulness.

"Don't forget I don't remember my family being there, but you know when you look back at it, I never thought I would, that I'd have to do it."

I never knew how I was so strong. I never knew why I was so weak. That makes it so much harder. You might not realize it, but, on some level at least, it's an attitude you can deal with.

And, to a degree, it's even more difficult to talk about it, given how difficult it is to address.

You cannot say, "I don't remember much about my life except perhaps those two words," or, "I know what the word means but, no, no, I don't. I didn't feel too strong." We have to talk about it.

I just found it kind of comforting that I did. I don't want to forget.

But that was a tough life. It's been much different after. I had a difficult time adjusting to that.
