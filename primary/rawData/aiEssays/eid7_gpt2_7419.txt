An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I had my first stroke and a heart transplant. I was taking some of that work into the hospital when suddenly my heart stopped beating. At that time, I stopped taking a blood test to see if my heart was in good health. I thought the first round would be over and that I would be back then. It did when I asked friends for advice. At the time, I was very sick of it, but the work I did in the hospital throbbed a little. A lot is like that, but it is something much more real and has a whole new meaning. I was so amazed how much it could be for so little time.

Now my heart's there for a very long time. I take in pressure in my chest when it is about to stop. But I can't tell where that comes from. I don't know, maybe I was given a lot from my doctors to make that happen.
