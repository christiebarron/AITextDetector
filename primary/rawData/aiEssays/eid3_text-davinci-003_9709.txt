In ‘Rough Road Ahead’ by Joe Kurmaski, the cyclist’s journey is filled with many obstacles, both man-made and natural, that make every moment of biking a struggle. The weather in the story plays a significant role by creating numerous physical and mental challenges for the cyclist. It is very cold, with occasional snowflakes and hail, and the snow and ice-covered roads create additional risks for falling and sliding. The cyclist also faces strong and unpredictable winds that can be both helpful and impede his progress. By using the wind to help his speed, the cyclist is able to reach his destination safely, but he also has to be careful because the wind can lead him to take risks he normally wouldn’t take, like riding on a hill that is iced over.

The environment in the story is also harsh, with deep valleys, craggy rocks, and steep inclines. The rider must be constantly aware of the terrain, and, because of the treacherous landscape, must come up with a strategy to get to his destination safely. Even with the help of the wind, the cyclist must still be mindful of any obstacles that could impede his progress.

Overall, Joe Kurmaski’s ‘Rough Road Ahead’ paints a picture of an exceptionally difficult and dangerous journey for the cyclist. The cyclist’s strategy and fortitude are tested on every inch of the ride as he faces extreme weather
