Dear Editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Over the past few years, the presence of computers in everyday life has increased exponentially, and with this has come both positive and negative impacts on our lives.

On the positive side, computers have made certain areas of life much easier. We now have access to an ever-expanding library of information available online â€“ from government services to news and entertainment. And with this, we have seen increased opportunities for education and career development. Computers have also made communication easier, with electronic mail and digital media becoming the norm.

On the negative side, computers have replaced a lot of manual labor. This has caused a shortage of jobs in certain industries, such as manufacturing, transportation, and construction. Furthermore, computer use can lead to increased distractions and physical inactivity. Many people spend hours in front of a computer screen, not taking advantage of other opportunities in life.

It is my belief that computers can be used to improve our lives, but we have to use them in moderation. We must ensure that we use our devices responsibly, and take frequent breaks to ensure we stay mentally and physically healthy. If we do this, we can take advantage of all the positive possibilities computers have to offer.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
