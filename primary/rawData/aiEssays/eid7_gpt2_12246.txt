An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I got the call about this one on 6/27/18. The family member who rang the next day wanted to send me a letter that she had written to the hospital to get me checked out. A day later that family member called us in person and the other person was able to get the information for the hospital and the next day I got back on line to see what we could do. I was able to do this when the nurses and all the others at the hospital would look at me again and give me the paperwork when I needed them.

My first step was to make sure that I was looking after the other family members. I was told that there were other cases that were happening in the community which wasn't listed in my letter. It seems that I wasn't aware that I was taking care of them. There was one other family that I thought made headlines when I came to a hospital, so I had to put myself out there and tell them that I was involved in this. These are young people and people we're supposed to have respect for. They are just part of a community we're supposed to support and treat. These are individuals that need to be dealt with and treated differently.

Finally, just like in any other situation of this nature, we call them out on this and we want them to recognize that they're part of our community. We also want them to put their faith in
