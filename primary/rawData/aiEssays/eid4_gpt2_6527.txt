The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because the book is about the death of God. No doubt because, given that there are some chapters on death that are interesting. I am also really happy about that one. I don't want to think I was going to get too deep about it because it is a whole different chapter which is just so rich and compelling without spoiling.


Thanks to our listener-submanded t1 for the suggestions, that I may have forgotten or misunderstood about or should have been more clear about:


* Chapter 11: "The Lord is my brother."

* Chapter 22: "The God is in darkness, in all the way; what is in the way of it is in the way of he that is in the way of it."


It turns out, in Chapter 25 we had a big misunderstanding here, and here are some interesting things from the book's introduction:


The Godhead of a human being has the following attributes by their full name.


It consists of those elements of humanity, the physical body, the mind, the spirit, and the material mind - the spiritual soul, the mental soul, the spirit-mind, etc.


They are "the gods" (not "them"), and they are the elements of existence: the human soul, mental body, the mind, spirit-mind, and the physical body for example. The spiritual and material are called "the gods
