I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a central pillar of libertarian ideals, and it should be maintained, especially in public libraries.

But the basic facts of the matter are clear — not in the first person and not throughout the history of the movement, and certainly not in the history of the Internet. The current state of Internet censorship undermines freedom of expression, especially in the United States, and makes censorship of books, films and content impossible to prohibit. This problem is not limited to the United States and does even exist in the more diverse world of Canada. In fact, Canada is the only country where censorship of content is allowed in any significant fashion in the world.

Even if the United States censors content, Canada has historically allowed censorship of Internet content. Even if censors Internet content, Canadian laws on the Internet are still open for debate and may be the most important in Canada today, still holding the world online free of censorship, even though Canada is under U.S. control if those laws are changed.

We must continue to fight for fundamental freedoms for all people, regardless of political ideologies, and to oppose censorship in any form for any cause, for anyone, regardless of what they believe to be the cause.
