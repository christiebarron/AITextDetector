The concept of tying a blimp or dirigible to the Empire State Building was initially embraced, and for a short while the building sported a mooring mast on the top. However, the builders behind the Empire State Building faced a number of obstacles in the feat of allowing dirigibles to dock.

The first obstacle arose when it was found that the mooring mast, which was to be bolted to the western-most corner of the tower, presented a major structural risk. Testing showed that the mast was capable of applying a force of up to 100 tons to the frame of the tower, proving far too heavy a burden for the building to bear. This meant that a more structurally sound alternative had to be found.

The second obstacle proved much greater, and required a revision of air traffic laws at the time. When building the mooring mast, the Empire State Building Building engineers found that the mast needed to extend further east from the building than can be allowed by current FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) air traffic laws. The laws of the time dictated that all tall towers must have a clear sky above for flight paths, whereas this mast would extend beyond these guidelines. As a result, the Empire State Building team would have had to depend on successfully persuading the FAA to revise their regulations before the mast could have been made compliant with the law, and this proved an insurmountable obstacle. 

Even when the engineers behind the Empire State began
