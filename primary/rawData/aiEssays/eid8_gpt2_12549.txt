One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was at my last friends house and my parents were outside for a few minutes. I did not think they were laughing. I do not think anyone in our family was in the room. I did not think they were laughing. Then they started laughing a lot more and we were all quite angry. About this time they stopped laughing. Then they stopped saying anything. A few minutes later I got up and went to work. I did not do a very great job in the office," he said.
