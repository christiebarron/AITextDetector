An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a man in my life. Not to be seen for long, he would just drop to his work and give something for his mom. Then all the other people would call him a thief and call him, I mean all of them thought "hey that's him," but that's him and no one was really getting paid for that." He had the best life he'd ever lived with him, but he was just really lucky because they didn't think anybody would really care.
