Dear Editor, 

I am writing in response to the recent debate on the effects of computers on society. In my opinion, computers have had a huge and largely positive impact on people’s lives.

Most significantly, computers have revolutionized business communication. They have made it possible to communicate with people across the globe instantly and cost-effectively, whether through email or access to vast online resources. Businesses, nonprofits and other organizations have benefitted from this increased connectivity, allowing them to collaborate more easily and work faster alongside colleagues and partners.

Computers have also changed the way students learn in the classroom. From providing online access to textbooks to making educational videos and simulations available, students can learn more efficiently and effectively. And online homework and tests have allowed them to complete their work quicker.

Furthermore, computers have provided access to an array of entertainment options, from video streaming services to gaming sites. Everyone can find something entertaining and enjoyable, whether it’s checking out a favorite show or playing a computer game with friends.

Of course, computers can also be used for more nefarious ends. We must ensure that proper security measures are in place to protect against cybercriminals and other threats.

Overall, the real-world effects of computers on society are overwhelmingly positive. As such, I urge your readers to agree with me that computers have had a hugely beneficial impact on people across the globe.

Sincerely,
