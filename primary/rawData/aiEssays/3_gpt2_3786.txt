Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. Firstly, these variables don't affect speed in the way that we see and expect of a cycling rider. Secondly, there is no measurable difference either in speed or braking force between the two in the 'Falling Down From Down' cycle. The Cycling Skills Test is the most commonly tested of the four tests for any given skill level, from novice to highly advanced and so it is unsurprising that riders will get better after going on the test.

A further indicator of how easy the setting is to change is the average speed of a cyclist, which for this is the average of all the factors which relate to the behaviour of the cyclist. This is also not the best indicator as the results of many factors are much more variable. For instance, it could be that the cyclist has a poor motorbike but they have similar physical attributes as cyclists, and they can still perform reasonably well in the conditions.

So, in summary, these data give a good idea of how well you can go up against high levels of riding and riding styles that a cyclist may find enjoyable.

Conclusion

Of course everyone is different now and cycling is one of the most popular sport in the world, and cycling is becoming a lot of fun for all. But there are some serious risks. It is up to you to learn how to get the best possible performance out of the 'Falling Down From Down',
