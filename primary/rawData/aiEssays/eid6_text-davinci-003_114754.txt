The Empire State Building was designed with the intention of accommodating giant dirigible ships for docking. However, the builders faced various obstacles in achieving this goal. In the book “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the problems and solutions to the Empire State Building allowing dirigibles to dock are discussed.

The first major problem builders had to overcome was a suitable area to dock the large airships. The Empire State Building was initially constructed too tall which would render any docking apogee out of reach. To solve this, an extra mast was built on the roof of the building which allowed for a suitable height for docking. Since the Empire State Building was already very tall, the added mast was designed to be as inconspicuous as possible so as to not detract from the aesthetics of the building. 

The next challenge builders had to address was devising a safe anchorage system for the dirigibles. The traditional method of mooring an airship used two anchors with ropes strung between them, but this was deemed unsafe and aesthetically displeasing for the Empire State Building. To remedy this, engineers designed a more secure four-point system with a stronger rope and metal anchors that could withstand the powerful winds that dirigibles can generate. Additionally, the system was designed to be concealed behind a wooden canopy to give the dirigibles more protection from the wind and to limit debris buildup on the roof.
