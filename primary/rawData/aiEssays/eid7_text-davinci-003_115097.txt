 

I remember recently I was waiting in line at the supermarket. It was taking an incredibly long time, and the person in front of me had a very large and complicated order. Everyone else in line behind me began to get impatient, sighing and shifting their weight. I, however, was determined to be patient.

I told myself “It’ll be over soon. Everyone has somewhere to be. I just have to wait a little longer.” I reminded myself that the cashier was doing her best to efficiently process all the orders. I glanced around with a friendly smile, trying to encourage the others to remain calm.

When it was finally my turn, I thanked the cashier for her hard work and patience, and thanked everyone else for their understanding. With this shared understanding, we made it through the line in a much more pleasant manner than if I had opted for impatience.
