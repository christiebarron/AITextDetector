Censorship in libraries is a highly controversial issue, one which has sparked debate amongst readers, library staff and the general public. There is a growing sense of unease in some sectors that some materials, such as books, music, movies and magazines, are too offensive or objectionable to be made available in public libraries. However, I firmly believe that such materials should not be removed from library shelves, on the basis that censorship in libraries goes against the very mission of a publicly funded institution.

Publicly funded libraries are run in the interest of the public, and not for the benefit of any particular moral or political agenda. A library's primary role is to provide citizens with access to a variety of resources, both to facilitate self-development and to promote an appreciation of diverse ideas, cultures, and opinions. Therefore the censorship of what people can and cannot find in libraries goes against the very point of having a library in the first place.

In addition, curtailing people's access to resources on the basis of personal objection is arguably an unethical decision to make. After all, a librarian is not qualified to make moral or ethical judgements about the books, movies, music and magazines that are available in the library. Given that a library should be a treasure trove of learning, knowledge, and entertainment, an inclusive approach should be taken which respects the diversity of public opinion. 

Others may argue that this approach places too much responsibility on libraries to monitor and censor
