Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, creates a unique and engaging mood that is nostalgic, yet forward thinking. Rodriguez uses his personal and familial history to explore the idea of home, identity, and belonging. 

The opening sentence of the memoir sets the tone for the entire piece. Rodriguez begins, "I was born between cultures and between places." This statement provides poignant poignancy to his story of identity and heritage. Not only does this statement establish the conflict between Rodriguez's American-Puerto Rican identity and his geographic identity of New Jersey, but also the complexity of his family dynamic that is explored throughout the memoir. 

The moment of reflections in the memoir paint a picture of the emotionally heavy yet oddly optimistic nature of the memoir. Rodriguez's reflections are characterized by memories, laughter, and heartache as he chronicles his life and upbringing. He intersperses heartfelt moments that capture his familial relationships and the way many of them have shifted and changed over time. As Rodriguez relives these moments, readers also are invited into a space where nostalgia and emotions abound. 

The climax of the memoir showcases a shift in Rodriguez's interpretation of his identity and his home. As he visits Puerto Rico for the first time, he is finally able to make sense of his past and view it with pride. This moment is also reflective of his emotional and spiritual growth. It adds a layer of hope to the entire memoir
