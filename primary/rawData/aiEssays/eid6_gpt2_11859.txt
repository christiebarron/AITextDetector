The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The largest obstacle was to build a vertical staircase into the building, which had to be located in a special area. The first thing the builders had to do was connect the staircase inside the building with the main staircase of the building itself, and then create the tunnel to the top of that underground building. Since the first tunnel was too low for the stair to be at the rear of the building, they had to move the tunnel around at the back to create both side entrances that are not necessary to the main building itself. The second type of obstacle to build was to build an underfloor staircase into the building's level, which would allow the building to pass through it. The 3rd and 4th type of barrier, or barriers for the lower level builders, involved placing concrete block under the second floor where the second floor would be. The most common obstacle faced by the high tech builders of the Empire State Building was to make vertical spikes to the ceiling in a way that would allow them to drop on the ceiling at the bottom. This meant having to move the vertical spikes around for a short time; but the more difficult difficulty became to use the higher angle platform on the left as a way to jump high enough to do so in the main building, and the more challenging obstacles remained to use on either the higher or lower levels. Each type of obstacle faced by these high tech builders required a strong base for building
