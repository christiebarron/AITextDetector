The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Most prominently was the difficulty in obtaining an exact map for their installation, which required a crane. Also, the original D.P.A.'s "Mountain View Park" was unable to provide a map, which eventually led to the discovery of D.P.A.'s new facility. It was, however, constructed without any crane or other apparatus, and was ultimately found to also allow for a wider footprint of one foot, resulting in more space to be used in one building. But the plan was to construct a larger facility in one building until a wider footprint was built on its eastern side. While a crane was built there, the buildings were later removed and a greater set of windows and gates were added, adding to the overall size of the project.

The Tower of America

The building would become the largest building ever designed by any architect since the opening of the First World War, and was then built to provide the largest and most exacted level of view possible to its builders. It, too, would accommodate up to 7,100 people, and featured 1,000 windows and a central and central tower, with the former being on a separate third floor at the top facing east and west, which can be viewed by either side of the first story building's north tower. The tower was constructed of six towers, four with single windows, and four with separate and interlocking
