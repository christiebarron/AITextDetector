Dear Editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. It is my belief that computers have a positive effect on our lives. 

Nowadays, computers are a part of our everyday lives, from the classroom to the office, and from home to recreational activities. Businesses use computers to conduct interactions more quickly and securely than ever before, and technology has made global communication easier than ever. Through computers, people have access to more information than ever before, and have become more creative and innovative.

Moreover, computers have improved the quality of life of millions of people. For example, they have made healthcare more efficient and accurate. Medical personnel can now diagnose and treat patients more quickly and accurately. Additionally, computers have revolutionized the way we learn, allowing us to access resources on any topic, from any location, at any time. 

In conclusion, I strongly believe that computers have had a positive impact on society and on peopleâ€™s lives. I urge readers to consider the benefits that have been made available to us through computers and to recognize that they have been a powerful force in improving the quality of life. 

Yours faithfully, 

[Your Name]
