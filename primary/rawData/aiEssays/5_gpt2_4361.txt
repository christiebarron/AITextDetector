It suggests that the relationship cannot be reversed, with it occurring in all forms of society but only to the extent that people with drug-related mental health problems (especially if they are the direct victims) suffer from it and are often exposed to it at or near the end of their lives.

Researchers who analysed this idea found that while some people are more likely to turn to drugs in order to end their lives, many of them can have positive effects.

The research involved 25 people in their 20s who were found to use cannabis while drinking at least 80 packs a day as part of their work and in the early years of life. While many of those participants went on to attempt to take their own lives, 20% of those who had taken the pill again were "more likely to be on medication and to suffer from depression if they have consumed more.
