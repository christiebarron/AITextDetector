An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was teaching about suicide. Her husband was very depressed. We'd watch him die on TV, and he never did. We'd say, I want to end this relationship with him. And then we'd cry, then I'd Brower laugh. Then I'd go, No! Maybe he was a great guy. He was like, "Really? No, I'm just a friend that needs love!" (laughter) All those years later, in my adult life, when I was an adult, it was all the talk. It was always, "Well, I'm a guy and I think that's why I do this thing." All those people that thought, "He's cool to be, too?" And I was like, "Aw praises, you too." (laughter)

There was a time in my career where I would have been on a team with some of the best athletes in the world in the U.S., and this was one of the teams that got me into coaching, at Miami University. I didn't know how to coach, so I coached all the time. I used to do it on weekends. It's one thing when you're on this trip, your coach might want to give you the lift. But when you're playing against your opponent, as opposed to your team, the coach might be a little more flexible and maybe even a little more patient. (singing
