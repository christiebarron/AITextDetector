An example of a time someone in my life was patient was in an emergency where the ambulance wasn't moving at all for two minutes and someone in my family was in desperate need of support.

It wasn't long after that that a very strange and amazing incident occurred when the paramedic got out of a car and stopped someone with a gun for a blood sample which did not come back at all.

The paramedics were standing by the family and the body was wrapped in a blanket with everything held up so they could safely walk off the scene.

I think it was almost a nightmare that they made a decision and chose to run towards people instead of the ambulance as they were trying to move.

The ambulance then stopped and someone in that car was running towards him whilst I kept saying don't talk to the ambulance because we are the ones who got hit in the head. That was a really lucky thing.

I was very scared with that little kid but it certainly has made me much more comfortable.

The next day in the hospital, some of the doctors tried to help but he died when the ambulance moved.

My wife and I are at the hospital for about three weeks now. We are expecting her in January and her husband in May. Our first surgery will be later on in February.
