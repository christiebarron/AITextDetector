I was walking down the street one day on my way to meet my friend, when I saw a funny sign in a store window. It said "Happy Meals Come With Fries". I started laughing and then heard a deep chuckle behind me. 

I turned to see who it was, and there was this random stranger laughing along with me. I was in shock for a second, but then we started talking. We talked for a few minutes about why the sign was so funny, and before I knew it I was doubled over in laughter. 

Eventually, I had to go, but the stranger suggested that we should hang out sometime and keep laughing. I took their number and we decided to meet up the following weekend.

We had such an amazing time talking and laughing over dinner. It felt like I had known this stranger for years and it was so easy just letting go and being silly. We ended up swapping funny stories and laughing until we had tears in our eyes. 

I don't think I've laughed so much in all my life. Those moments of shared laughter are forever etched in my memory and I'm so grateful for that funny sign in the window that sparked such a wonderful friendship.
