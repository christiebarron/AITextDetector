The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One of them was state control of the building; the builder had no power over traffic and couldn't regulate what traffic and buildings could do with limited resources, such as fire suppression.

Despite these challenges, the Empire Building was never completely built; the only time the building was built was during the height of the Civil War. On the other hand, in 1865 it was once again considered to be an ideal building when the State of Texas hired Major William L. Johnson and constructed the Empire State Building.

During World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt used President Johnson as the architect of his plan to erect an elevated structure that would run through the Texas hills. President Johnson's engineering plans, renting the construction company's building at an area of 10.5 acres, were never completed until the project was awarded to the National Bank of Dallas in 1973.

One of Dr. Johnson's most lasting accomplishments was to design and build the first state-of-the-art electric locomotive. During his years on the National Transportation Commission, the locomotive provided the American Electric Railway with more than 300 miles of new line and improved safety, reliability and high speed capability.

While construction was underway for his Electric Power Plant at Amarillo, Texas, an employee of Energy East Texas, Texas, was killed trying to set down the plant. Since that time, the building has served as an
