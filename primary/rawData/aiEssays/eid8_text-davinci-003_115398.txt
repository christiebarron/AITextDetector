I was in the middle of a long day and I was feeling a bit overwhelmed and exhausted. I was about to call it a day when suddenly, I heard my best friend's voice ringing across the room. She had come to cheer me up and put me in a better mood.

We started joking around and it wasn't long before we were both laughing uncontrollably. I had to wipe my tears and fan my face with a piece of paper just to get myself to stop laughing. 

My friend then said, “You see, this is the shortest distance between two people!” I had to agree, because I felt so much better and our laughter had managed to break through my cynicism and the weariness I was feeling. We made plans for the rest of the day and started to tackle my tasks with new energy.

That short moment in which we shared laughter was so powerful and transformative. It reminded me that a relationship is more than simply talking. It is about being able to laugh together, be silly together, and just feel the bonding that laughter brings. 

I learned that day that laughter can truly be the shortest distance between two people!
