One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I went to college with my band. Our group had been called the AARP, but when I heard them talk about gay people and how they didn't understand the meaning of homosexuality, I was curious what they thought. I looked up how the LGBT community has existed in the past 25 years and it was really not interesting there.

Some friends from a long time ago who have changed their tune from having to take gay couples out of their homes would have really surprised me if we had ever been able to even talk about the topic but, no.

It is really so unfortunate now, in the 21st century, that so few people know that the idea of being gay is completely wrong.

In the USA, the National Association of Broadcasters (NAP) and many other groups have done more than say that it should be prohibited from broadcasting gay people. However, some have done it now — for the third time this decade, this is how they did it.

If that was the case, then I would have probably thought about some serious ways of helping to end the discrimination they have created.

Many others have brought up these things — they would like us to be like them just like them.
