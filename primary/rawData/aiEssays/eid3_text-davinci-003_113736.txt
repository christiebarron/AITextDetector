The setting of Joe Kurmaski's short story, “Rough Road Ahead,” is a crucial part of how the cyclist is affected throughout the story. While the cyclist has an important internal journey, the external environment in which he finds himself and how he interacts with it influences his emotional state.

The cyclist is presented a road with a daunting terrain and difficult conditions – the rough road which gives the story its title. The road is opaque in places, unpaved in others, and full of rocky outcroppings. The ruggedness of the road provides an obstacle for the cyclist – an example of how the environment can be a limiter of the cyclist's freedom and self-actualization.

This difficulty is augmented by the presence of a storm on the horizon, which creates an atmosphere of unease and potential danger as well as uncertainty. The storm brings with it a fear of the unknown and a sense of vulnerability. The turbulent sky and unpredictable conditions it brings give the cyclist a feeling of being exposed and needing to be prepared.

The final element we see in the setting is the remote and empty landscape in which the cycle takes place. This solitude and desolation mirror the feeling of alienation the cyclist feels. There is no one to share his journey with and this lack of emotional support, coupled with the obstacles and threats of the environment, challenges the cyclist's mental and emotional resilience.
