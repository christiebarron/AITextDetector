The memoir “From Home: The Blueprints of our Lives” by Narciso Rodriguez creates a mood of nostalgia and sentimental longing. As Rodriguez takes his reader into his hometown of Newark, New Jersey he paints a vivid picture of his upbringing and the stories of generations of immigrants who preceded him. He brings to light how a once country of immigrants, built by those who left their home countries behind, is now an anti-immigrant climate. His accounts are filled with emotional poignancy as he explains how these masses of immigrants left everything familiar - their countries, their languages, their cultures- yet what connected these disparate people was their common longing for the security of home.

The author’s deep sense of appreciation and gratitude for his homeland and heritage is evident throughout the book. Rodriguez recalls details from routine daily life that he shared with family and friends- like eating the dishes they prepared together or attending church. These moments add a sense of homesickness and longing for a life that he can no longer access or recreate. He also poignantly tells stories of those who have gone before him and from whom he has inherited community values of the power of kindness, creativity, and solidarity. 

Rodriguez’ memoir is a reminder of the ways our home can shape our lives and the importance of remembering and reconnecting with the past. His language and use of emotion results in a captivating, nostalgic, and sentimental tone throughout the book. Ultimately, it
