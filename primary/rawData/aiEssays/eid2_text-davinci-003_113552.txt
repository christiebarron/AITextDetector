It is important to recognize that libraries can provide alternate viewpoints on topics such as race, religion, gender and sexuality while still allowing for freedom of expression.

Supporters of censorship advocate for the removal of books, music, movies and magazines found offensive to maintain a safe and respectful environment. I disagree with this perspective and argue for open access to content in libraries, while allowing for parental discretion when it comes to making decisions about their childrenâ€™s reading and viewing materials. 

By limiting access to materials, we limit knowledge and the opportunity to challenge our own thoughts or beliefs. This type of censorship is dangerous and does not reflect the values of a free society. Some materials may be seen as controversial, however, this does not mean they should be withheld from the public. Those who are uncomfortable with certain materials should be allowed to opt out, while others should not be hindered by the fears of others.

Additionally, censorship of library materials can impede creativity and progress. Although certain books, music, movies and magazines may be seen as offensive, they may also inspire new ideas and movement for positive change.  Censorship interrupts this process. It can also lead to greater injustices, as not all voices will be heard or recognized without open access to library materials.
