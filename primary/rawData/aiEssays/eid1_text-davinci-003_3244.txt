Dear Editor,

Since the introduction of computers into our world, many have pondered their effects on society. Here, Iâ€™m presenting an opinion on how computers have impacted us over the years. 

Computers have had both positive and negative effects. On the one hand, advancements in computer technology have made life easier for many. Office and customer communications have become more efficient; the way we work, do business, and learn has been greatly improved. Furthermore, the sophistication of hardware and software helps us identify and fix problems quickly, allowing us to do more with less human effort. On the other hand, too much time devoted to using computers can be detrimental too. People can become isolated and forget how to interact effectively with people. Additionally, computer addiction can lead to health problems, such a back pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, and eyestrain.

To sum up, computers have clearly shaped our lives in many wonderful ways. However, if used in moderation, it can help us to lead a happier and healthier life. I implore readers to agree with me and to enjoy computers without becoming too reliant on them. 

Yours,

[Your Name]
