I was walking home one evening after a long day at work. As I was nearing the end of my street, I noticed a familiar figure walking in front of me. It was my neighbor, Robert. We said hello as he slowly turned around, no doubt startled by my sudden voice. That's when I noticed the small bag in his hand.

"What's in the bag?" I asked.

"Oh, just some popcorn," Robert replied, looking sheepish.

I smiled, knowing full well what he was up to. Robert had a habit of making popcorn and then walking around the neighborhood, tossing kernels to strangers. It was his way of saying hello and spreading joy. I started laughing and he joined in, making the silly popcorn tossing game even better.

For the next few minutes, we walked around, randomly throwing popcorn to passersby. Some people stopped and asked us what we were up to, and others just smiled, happy to receive a free snack. Everywhere we went, laughter seemed to follow us.

I guess that's the power of laughter. Even when it's between two strangers, it still has the power to draw people together and create happiness. I'm so glad I bumped into Robert that night, because it reminded me just how powerful a simple act of kindness and laughter can be.
