At the beginning of the story, the narrator is a young girl who is preparing to take her American citizenship test. However, her family decides to plant a winter hibiscus in their yard in the middle of winter. Throughout the story, the girl is so focused on caring for the hibiscus that she neglects her studies for her test. When winter finally passes, the geese return, and the hibiscus blooms, the girl realizes that she can take her citizenship test again. The ending of the story serves to remind the reader that if the girl had been focused and committed to her studies, she could have taken the test without a time delay.
