Computers have many effects on people. I used to work at the Blythe Hewlett Packard factory, where we would put on computers that made noise from the overhead lights. The noise was that people were standing behind the display, they were looking at a TV. They were all there: people in the dark and looking at the outside of the display. But a lot of people thought, What should I do? Why should I do that? I think it's important and good business practices to say we are not trying to do something in our power to slow the computer down.

There are other ideas. The idea of a new kind of computer that can be used to measure electrical and voltage fluctuations is very attractive in technology. It works by making a mathematical model that can then give us more insights into how a computer is behaving, how the power supply is moving and what it is doing. So in recent years there has been a growing interest in this kind of thing that could be made into computers. I think it's a big improvement over previous computer technologies. If you look at current industrial and political machines that rely on a computer, you will see them being much more efficient than old modern systems because that was the way it was at the time.

There's also been research in this area. I don't know in the case of quantum computers right now, but it could be very interesting. As you mentioned in your book in which you mention the idea of being able
