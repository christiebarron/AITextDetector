Dear Editor,

In today’s world, the impact of computers on our lives is immense. Computers have revolutionized the way we live, work, play, and communicate. While there are several advantages of computer technology, the negative effects should not be overlooked or underestimated.

Recent research has shown that extended use of computers can lead to physical ailments such as eyestrain and repetitive stress injuries, as well as mental health issues such as reduced social interaction and problems with concentration.

With the rising number of computing devices in our homes, it is becoming increasingly important to understand the potential risks associated with them and to consider practical strategies for reducing the risks. One option is to reduce the time one spends in front of the computer. Parents should also be proactive in setting time limits for their children’s computer use and in monitoring the types of activities they are doing online.

The long-term effects of computers must not be taken lightly. It is vital that we promote awareness of these issues and take the necessary steps to protect ourselves and our children. 

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
