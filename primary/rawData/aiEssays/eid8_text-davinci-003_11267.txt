One of the things my husband and I will always treasure about our relationship is the way we can laugh together. We met 24 years ago and our similarities were readily apparent. Not only did we share a love for reading and being outdoors, but we had so much fun together because we both had quick wit and an affinity for good-natured teasing.

One of our fondest memories together was a day we came across a really old, abandoned truck out in the middle of nowhere. I had never seen anything like it, and I knew that my husband would appreciate it too. We spent the better part of an hour taking pictures, poking fun at its paint job, and coaxing it into the occasional creaky wheel turn. It was so much fun and soon we were both laughing uncontrollably at the absurdity of the situation we found ourselves in. 

The hours just flew by and before we knew it, it was getting late and we realized that it was time for us to make our way home. As we drove away from that old truck, we suddenly burst out in laughter all over again—the kind of knowing laughter that bonds two people together in unspoken understanding—and we both knew that our relationship was something special. 

We still laugh together regularly, but that special moment we shared all those years ago still gives us both such happiness. It reminds us that through it all, we can always be there for each other and enjoy life's sillier moments
