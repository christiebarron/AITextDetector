Censorship in libraries is a topic that creates a wide range of opinions and emotions, especially when it calls for the removal of certain materials deemed offensive. While most people agree that libraries have an important role to play in educating people and providing access to a wide range of materials, questions arise when deciding the level of censorship libraries should have for materials considered morally or culturally inappropriate. 

For one, it must be recognized that libraries have evolved over time to meet the educational needs of the community. In this sense, libraries should avail materials that reflect the values, beliefs, and views of the people it serves. But in order to do this, it needs to exercise a certain level of censorship. If materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, are insensitive or offensive to particular members of the community, then they should be taken off the shelves. 

However, censorship should not go as far as to the point of restricting access to certain materials for valid academic or research reasons. For example, a movie or book with explicit content could be useful for fields like sociology and psychology. Libraries should enable materials to be accessed in a controlled environment, such as the private viewing of movies or reading of books in assigned areas
