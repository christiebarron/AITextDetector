The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' shows that the president had been a key player in pushing for the release of the files.

'From Home is intended for use as a record of our conversations, our thoughts and our thoughts for all of our life.

'There is no reason for this to be taken down.'

In his book, a year later, his political adviser gave a rare personal interview to The Times of India before his dismissal. On December 27, a week after he left, his mother said her son was still in an abusive relationship with another woman.

"His father was never the one to make excuses," her father said.

'The truth is I was abused and hurt,' said his mother, Ghulam Nabi, after that interview.

The president of Sri Lanka's National Police has denied that he was abused, saying: 'We found his files and we found it. '

'This may or may not have happened to him but the truth now is we were abused,' Nabi continued.

A fortnight into his term, he left for Sri Lanka with his father on December 9. He had left his home state of Goa along with his other sisters who had also been released on Christmas Day, he said.

The family said they heard of their release but decided to remain silent at first because the family remained adamant they 'did not think this would happen to our son'.
