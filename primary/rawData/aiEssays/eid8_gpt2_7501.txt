One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I realized that I did enjoy it. I was able to stand up to the bullies, but sometimes I was actually able to laugh at them and laugh with the community of people I thought were bullies. In school I learned that, well, they didn't know how to handle me, and at the end of the day the bullies are bullies themselves. To them, I feel like they are human beings. I was able to learn to deal with bullies in a very positive way when I began transitioning to the life of an actor, and that's great. I guess I understand the reason why, right? The truth is that most people around me, by choice, will try on any clothes on them or make them look like things to try to intimidate them. They believe that, asdownloads, or in some cases, they want to be seen as their own person, and they want to feel like they were that person too. They value the idea of becoming someone that they can be. They feel that people will fleec them and if their friends want to be that person too, then they have to try on clothes." â€“ George L. Johnson
