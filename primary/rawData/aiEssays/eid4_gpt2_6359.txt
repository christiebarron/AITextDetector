The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because he makes the book one step further into the past and shows that he has always been one step ahead in his understanding of the human world. We can see the changes in one of the most familiar things he has ever written: he has made the first step with the great problem it was to solve. In the book he has been talking about the human condition from the moment of his birth through the beginning of his life; he has always been talking about how humans have always been treated as affordances to all else in the universe. He calls on human beings to recognize that it is not just our present situation, but the future in which they must find themselves. He wants humanity to look ahead, to consider why people must be "proud of themselves". "The future is, after all, now," he says. "I'm not talking about the future by saying 'I'll be a millionaire' or 'I'm still going to give it'." He is, though, talking about the future by describing how that future will be created or destroyed, or the kind of society it could create itself. In this process it can give rise to much else, and it has become clear how much such a process that has been brought into being will never occur.

This has been the way he has been telling himself: we cannot make this happen, as he insists. We cannot make it happen unless we are somehow connected with this future
