Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

If you're at a junction which you want a rider to go through but is not clear (e.g. a junction which is blocked by a bridge and where it would be safer to go for a pedestrian), consider the options you might have, especially if you need to choose the option of an 'Rough Road Ahead' route.
