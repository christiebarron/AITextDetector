I remember a funny moment from college that made my roommates and me laugh so hard, we were nearly in tears. It was midterm exam week and I was up studying in our common area. My roommates used to prefer playing video games over studying, and I was determined to stay focused. 

Just when I was really starting to grind out my physics equations, I heard one of them shout "come on, don't be like that! What's so funny?" Curious, I looked over just in time to see the other had fallen out of his chair with laughter. I couldn't help but laugh too. After the initial shock wore off, I asked what was so funny and was directed to look closer. 

It turns out he had been playing a game and one of the characters had a hilarious joke written on its face: "Why did the student eat his homework? Because the teacher told him it was a piece of cake!" We all laughed until tears were streaming down our faces. 

That little moment of laughter not only made exam week a lot more bearable, but it also reminded me of the importance of letting go and having some fun every once and a while. It might have not seemed like much in the moment, but looking back on that night I'm glad we took a break to enjoy the moment and laugh together.
