One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was at a festival of my own. I had just finished my tour when I was having the greatest time of my life. After the main stage started, we started laughing. It seemed it was all a ruse of being in a comedy band and listening to the same music. I was still laughing, but the music was always there in the crowd. I would say that I really enjoyed the music.

So, to the end, the song was about this girl and the people in the audience. I was like a kid when my friends thought I was going to die. It was like, "I'm not going to have any regrets". In the end, all my friends thought it was a joke, but it is very funny. But because we were all laughing, we decided to give another laugh.

So, next week, before I return to the music world I'll be touring, and I plan to do the next tour with my band. We were in the same festival when we played on M-103. I was in the band to play at that time. Of course they would say, "Don't get too involved with that, because we were in the band to do that". I said, "But our guitar was just too small or anything." I think we would do the same in our band. Our guitar is really big. We play guitar, and the main stage is only 2-3
