Many people have raised questions in recent years about the use of censorship in libraries and the rejection of certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines that are deemed offensive. In my opinion, censorship of materials in libraries should not be allowed. 

Censoring materials from the library takes away one of the greatest gifts of society: access to knowledge and information. As many library patrons know, libraries often serve as the only source of information in many communities. The library's purpose is to provide a reliable source for the dissemination of information, so the liberty of the library must remain uncensored and unrestricted. 

Censorship also takes the form of blocked access to certain materials in the library. This not only restricts patron access to important materials, but also undermines the concept of intellectual freedom. Blocking access to certain materials implies that the library does not trust its patrons to make their own decisions about the materials they want to read or view. Furthermore, it takes away individual responsibility because patrons can no longer make up their own minds and form opinions about what they encounter in the library. 

In addition, censorship can put a chill on creativity by discouraging patrons from exploring certain subjects or engaging in conversation about potentially controversial topics. It also runs the risk of politically motivated censorship, whereby certain books or authors could be targeted in order to suppress diverse concepts and ideas. This not only robs the community of important knowledge but also puts free speech rights at risk
