Computers have many effects on people. They work, they move, they have a great future.

But in many ways today, it seems we're losing most of our ability to care for the many complex, life-affirming interactions that make it possible for our minds and bodies to develop and function. If we keep our heads down and stay focused on what makes our hearts beat, we die less and less.
