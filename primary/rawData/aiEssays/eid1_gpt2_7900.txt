Computers have many effects on people.

A person or object has some effect on the behaviour of others. An article called 'Brain stimulation: how a computer is better for you than other human minds' by Richard Felt has more.

He says we have been taking on computers for decades, but they are not completely "new".

"It's not like a computer now that we are using them so it is getting in the way of new ideas and interesting applications," he said.

'There are new people playing a lot of games, talking to a lot of people, which can be very stimulating for someone. It certainly has been successful for human beings.'

"There is a lot of overlap but we are all different."

But Felt believes this might be an "indispensable part" of our future.

'In the end, we have got to build bridges that make the world a better place.'

Felt says we already have computers that are about 30% more powerful than humans - just by virtue of the fact they use fewer processors and therefore less power.

"Technology was a very important part of the development of humanity at the same time as a huge increase in intelligence was occurring in many parts of our society."
