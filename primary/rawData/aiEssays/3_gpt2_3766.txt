Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. We'd never intended to make any of the roads, roads, or places available for cycling without giving you the right of way. We'd even come up with a new approach that incorporated a crosswalk.

Even before we made the switch, the landscape for our own roads - the one in which we created the 'ROUGH Road Ahead' idea - were some of the best in the world.

The landscape was also a defining feature of the design. We wanted to make the design feel more modern, more real, with clear, geometric borders rather than an overly colourful and abstract look. There was a lot to like about the way the streets behaved. There was also, for example, a lack of bike lanes.

So we brought them in, put them across to our own roads, we looked at the landscape again, and found something which was right for us. What we ended up with was 'Very New Road Ahead'.

The effect was dramatic...

The result is quite similar to how we've done it with the existing roads. We have an extremely dense countryside where the landscape changes but the look comes back more and more as the cycle goes along.

It's actually not a 'perfect' look, though. We made the road a bit different by removing the old road in favour of a new one. We wanted the landscape to be very different,
