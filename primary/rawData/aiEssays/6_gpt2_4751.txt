The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

With the formation of the Empire State Building on the second floor of the Supreme Court Building at 10:03 at the beginning of the 1970s, two private and public companies began developing the dirigibles system, known as the "Downtown Project" or "E.P."

On Saturday, October 18 2014, the first of three dirigibles, the 2:20:22 K of the second image above (4:18:00) displayed its main view, and then the first to the left (4:30:00). The second and third image shows how the space between the two towers is now covered with two layer-by-layer sheets of metal.

Brett W. Anderson, deputy to the Administrator, said the new models are the best that the company is able to achieve, and they will be the first dirigibles to take on new aeronautic performance challenges, such as the need for more powerful motors and increased maneuverability.

"The 2:20:22 K of the second photo shows the front tower of the Empire State Building in what remains of the mainandan building," Anderson said. "You could see that the towers were moving down, but not the main tower, where at least one of the main towers is now, although some of them have been removed, to go back up to the 1st Street side
