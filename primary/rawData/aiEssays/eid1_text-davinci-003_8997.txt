To the Editor,

As computers become more and more commonplace in our everyday lives, it is important to consider the effects they may have on people.

On one hand, computers can have incredibly positive effects on people. They can provide entertainment, helping us to wind down and relax. They provide us with countless ways to work, learn, and keep in touch with our peers from all over the world. Computers also provide us with countless opportunities, allowing us to take advantage of new technologies and remain competitive.

On the other hand, there may be some potential downsides to having computers in our lives. Too much reliance on computers can make us vulnerable to cyber attacks, leaving us exposed to personal data theft. Additionally, computers can make it easier for us to forget how to do things the old fashioned way, like calculating math without a calculator. Spending too much time in front of a computer can also have a negative impact on our physical and mental health.

Ultimately, I believe it is important to be aware of the potential effects computers can have on our lives, both good and bad. By ensuring that computers are used responsibly, we can reap the benefits of our increasingly digital world, while avoiding the pitfalls. 

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
