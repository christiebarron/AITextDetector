One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my dad pulled me into the elevator to go to the cafeteria. I always went, but my dad always came. So I'd come from an early age and I wanted to be able to enjoy his company, because as I started talking about other things to him, I think he said, "You know how it is, you don't even hear one moment when you have any sense of humor, or at least a sense of humor has ended up being on your mind instead of the point you were trying to make it in the first place? How in the hell do you imagine anyone could ever say such words without thinking it through, and you think they would have been less likely than you to listen to me if you'd gone into it with a greater understanding of myself?" I was still so small, so shy. That was how I started off, at the end of my early teens and 30s.

It's also a long journey â€” I've grown up in a place that has always fascinated me and has made me what I am today. I went to a couple of colleges, got a degree, then had something different. They didn't want me to become an artist or have a passion for music, or have an interest in the arts, which to me are two different things. So I was pretty shy and didn't think much about music.

How do you see your life this year?

Oh, it
