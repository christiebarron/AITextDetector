Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. In some cases it is a sign that conditions have adapted to their particular conditions. Other times it means that the cyclist has suffered an accident on a rough road. It can be interesting to look at the results of a survey of cyclists in Scotland. This one is important because it shows where the road might be more safe. It asks people to tell their roads that 'a lot of these roads are paved', and they think it's a good idea to look at road conditions in terms of road quality. I think the most important thing to understand about road conditions is that conditions are often complex and the more the more it takes time and effort to find a road, the harder it is to find the right balance between road conditions.
