Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. Many cyclists don't like the idea of being locked up. So they go to the bars, they go to the corner and are left in the cold. A lot of cyclists don't like having to deal with security and there's too much traffic and there's too much noise and there's no control to avoid these conditions – and then all the stress in the world will be placed under their feet.

It may sound like bad manners for a cyclist to be locked up in a small corner but in fact it's pretty brutal. In every case you end up making it to the front gate at about 90 mph, and you get to the front of the city in 20 minutes. That's just bad manners.

But what happens if you're actually on the street? Does your car park on the left side of the road, or is it the street you're going to?

Rough Road Ahead looks like this – a narrow and heavily trafficked corner in a bustling parking lot that appears to have no real purpose. But it's pretty clear from inside the corner, and so is the car.

And although some cyclists feel safe, many say that this corner is like getting a hold of a criminal, or like dealing with what they don't like. How would you feel if you were in that corner?

Not really. For a cyclist there's nothing to be concerned
