UPDATE, May 4: I now write to ask that you, along with an organization like the Media Matters International (MIIU), give us your thoughts on the censorship issues in our community. It is hard to deny the importance of this issue but it is not just in the sense that the media needs to control your views (and the content within them) but also so that you have access to the right information for your own needs. It also means that media literacy and communication needs to become a core service to the wider public. We're happy to discuss questions, and any other related questions, on the MAIU website. Please refer to the original letter attached to the above paragraph. We also would like to hear from you on more related media matters as well, so feel free to ask questions on all sides. Thank You.
