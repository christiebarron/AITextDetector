Narciso Rodriguez's memoir From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives chronicles his personal journey of immigrating to America, forging a career in fashion, and reconciling his Cuban heritage. Throughout this narrative, Rodriguez crafts a vivid mood that emphasizes his connection to his cultural identity and home. 

Rodriguez's recollections of his past effectively create a melancholic yet hopeful atmosphere.
