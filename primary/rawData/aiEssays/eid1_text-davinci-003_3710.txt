Dear Editor,

As computers become increasingly integrated into our lives, it's important to consider the effects they are having on us. Many people have difficulty distinguishing between computers as tools and computers as media channels, potentially resulting in an oversaturation of technology and a reliance on digital input that may be detrimental to our overall wellbeing.

One such potential effect is a decrease in physical activity. With screens available in homes, workplaces and schools, adequate exercise is often overlooked as people opt for digital entertainment instead. This can lead to a lack of physical fitness and overall poorer health.

Moreover, the rapid exposure to new information provided by computers can alter our self-control and decision-making skills, leading to impulsive behavior and poor judgment in other areas of life. Additionally, it can lead to poorer communication, resulting in less interpersonal contact and an increase in isolation.

Finally, computers can be overwhelming, distracting and time-consuming. By overusing technology, we may become so focused on the digital aspects of our lives that we lose interest in non-technology-related activities.

For all of these reasons, it is important to consider the effects technology has on our lives. We must ensure that we make balanced decisions about our digital habitsâ€”or else risk being overwhelmed by the ever-increasing role of technology in our lives.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
