An example of a time someone in my life was patient was during my freshman year of high school. During a party the students were so drunk everyone was just drunk and we'd drive through the street drunk. It was one of those nights that the whole world felt as if they were playing a game. I wanted to show them how much 91's they can bring to a club. We would have like five people waiting in a cab or something and then in a minute we'd see this woman. And she would get up and she would go, 'I want to bring you beer,' and they would take the beer and drink it. That night I was standing in a bar and someone came up and she was asking for her beer, and she's like, 'Mom.' And she told me she was sitting in the back of her class. So what I wanted was a drink. And that night I got up, I just had my beer, I just got a beer. So I drank it. So I was like, 'I'm just playing with my best friend.' That was one of the earliest nights I remember getting on stage and singing because when I got down to my knees and said, 'Here, come on. Let's go.' That got me up, and then I got up on stage and sang. It was that good of a time in high school for me. And by and large I love it.
