One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I walked out of my house and was looking out over the woods at the river and saw a few horses. People came over to the horses and said, "You've seen horses?" The horses said, "Yes." And I said, "No, that's not true at all. They've been in the woods for a long time." They didn't know what those horses were in the woods for." And I said, "They're in the mountains! We'll have them in a hurry." And then on the other side of here we went. We didn't know where they were. Now people came over here and said, "There they are, that's where they were." The horses gave the horses a call. Then we headed over to the mountains to find them. It was only now that I realized what had happened. A hundred years ago there were so many horses that they'd have to climb the rocks and see where we were. So then I found them and they said, "No!" That's when I started going to the forests. So now, now, they feed the horses. They feed on tree branches with no roots. And then they have little red eyes. They have big mouths with big teeth, and I think they're a little yellow-faced and they have a big mouth. They are white-necked and they eat whole crops. The red was just a little white-necked animal.
