One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I first came to the site with a small group trying to make progress and I couldn't even begin to explain how awesome and empowering this site was.

I took pride in teaching myself how to use these tools so we have seen tremendous success (and I'm grateful to have the "first time" of all people).

These days it's really difficult to get away from the old, traditional ways of thinking and practice.

Now that I've gotten the mindset about practice and working with you, I'm willing to work with you to make some meaningful changes, and for those who feel that you need help, you go to my website with a sense of relief and hope that something positive is coming.

Thank you
