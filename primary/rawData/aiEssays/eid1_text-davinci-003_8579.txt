I recently had the pleasure of being on vacation with my family. We had chosen a destination far away from home, and were looking forward to some much needed relaxation and fun. 

On the way to the airports, our flight was delayed. Instead of freaking out right away, my dad took a deep breath and said in a calm voice, “OK, let’s just remain patient and see what happens.” 

We waited in the airport for over an hour. We had no information on when we’d be departing and I could see my mom and sister getting frustrated, but my dad just kept reiterating, “Let’s be patient.”

After a while of just sitting around, the airport finally contacted us saying that our plane was running late and that we would have to wait an additional two hours. My mom wanted to cancel the trip right away, but my dad just put his hands up and shook his head. He said in a soothing voice, “We’re going to be fine. Let’s just be patient. We’ll get there eventually.”

Finally, after three hours of waiting in the airport, we were able to board the plane. My dad had been right all along: Ultimately, with a lot of patience, we were able to manage our situation. I was proud of him for maintaining his composure despite the challenges.
