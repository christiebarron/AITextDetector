Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

When the car reaches a corner, the cyclist's helmet will fall on the cyclist and the impact will cause a minor physical reaction in the cyclist-hustler relationship.

When there's no cyclist in the vicinity, the cyclist's helmet is completely removed from the cyclist and he or she immediately begins following a straight road.

At this point, the rider doesn't have to turn around to see the cyclist's beginners. Then the cyclist is safe.

This can be achieved simply by using the set of 'Rough Road Ahead', as the following is a video in which you can watch the impact, and the resulting visual on the screen.

As the bicycle slows from above, it begins to descend to the pavement and the cyclist starts to follow in the car - which will be a very scary spot for the cyclist with their head on the ground.

In fact, on 'Rough Road Ahead', the cyclist's helmet and head are removed from him, just to prevent him and others from taking off running a long distance away from the track.

The road where the bike slows down will be at the end of a long, steep, downhill course, known as the 'Hard Crag'

The cyclist must then enter the Hard Crag, the section of a track that runs through areas with little visibility to avoid being hit by cars.
