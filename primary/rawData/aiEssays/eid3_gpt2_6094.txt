Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

One of the biggest improvements is the set of wheels available. A more aggressive approach was developed and the number of bikes available was increased in 2012 compared to previous years.

There are also more cyclists with better performance and high speed, and more 'humblings'.

Some of these are already a part of the 'Road Ahead' 'Rough Road' programme, so it is clear that the more riders there are in the 'Road Ahead' program and how they ride, the lower the numbers will go with a greater 'humblings'.
