I was working as a cashier in a busy convenience store when an elderly man approached my register. He had a lot of items and it took me some time to scan and bag them all. He remained quiet and still, gently watching me work. When I finally finished, he smiled and softly said, “Thank you for being so patient.” Although I was tired from the long day, I was happy to see that he appreciated my effort. It was a small exchange, but I will always remember the man’s kind words and his patience with me.
