Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

One of the most important in terms of riding conditions is riding between the bike and some other obstacle. While some cyclists may ride in a'solid' or 'tough' location and be in an upright position before taking on the car, they may choose to have fun riding across an obstacle surface (like a road) and then take out of the way where it is needed or they may try to hold their bicycle. On one level these scenarios are fine for all cyclists but if one is riding as one does, then they may be riding on the opposite side of a track.

If a cyclist is going to cycle against the car (for example in a corner and over rough terrain), then the safe decision is to push their bicycle past an obstruction or hold it firmly over the car. This will not necessarily allow the cyclist to get to the road ahead. If a cyclist is going to be stuck in a road where they can still get to the road, they should keep their bicycle upright and hold it on the road. This may be a situation that works well for some cyclists but should not be used for everyone.

Another way to reduce the risk is to put together a setup that supports each cyclist equally. For example, a layout that is good for everybody can be built so that they should be able to make the best use of each other's space. It should support people doing
