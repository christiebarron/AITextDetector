The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because "the problem is that the book tells you that if you read the book and want to know more about it, you are a complete moron." What kind of problem is a moron? What is a bad guy like the author of the book? I don't want to give you an answer on that question, because if the answer is always or ever, I don't see how it can be a bad thing.

Of course, the bad guy's only real connection would be with a book written by a mad man. If the book makes you feel like you are the worst person out there, maybe the problem is with the guy. Maybe he's the bad guy because he is so crazy. He is, in many ways, the hero of the story.
