I'll always remember the time my best friend and I were walking home from school one day when we decided it might be fun to take a detour through the park. We ran across a group of kids from a nearby school, and one of them said something that made my friend burst out laughing. I had no idea what he said, but I just went with it and started laughing too.

The other kids looked at us like we were crazy, while my friend continued to laugh uncontrollably. It felt like the laughter just wouldn't stop. Eventually all of us were laughing so hard that we had to bend over and hold our stomachs. I felt like I almost couldn't breath!

It felt like such a carefree moment, surrounded by this group of strangers laughing together like old friends. It almost felt like we were all connected through the laughter. After a few minutes we all said our goodbyes and went our separate ways, but that moment of joy and connection continued to linger in my heart. 

Laughter really is the shortest distance between two people, and I'm so thankful that my friend and I got to experience that on that fateful day in the park.
