The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because of the people, and the people that love each other. I think those things are important.

LENNY THOMAS: So you're writing a memoir about the events of your life as a writer. How did that happen? Do you have a background there, do you read a lot of books, have you never read a book in a few years?

MARTIN DOUGLAS: No background. All there is is what you can't write about. There's also stuff you will read the next day that might help. Even if you don't know anything about fiction you can probably get some insights from the world around you as to some of the things you said in the book. So once you get there you have a pretty clear idea of what's possible and what you're talking about. I also think that, as something that I just learned in college, just getting around the world I learned to really understand things as an author. And like, if you really can understand a book well with all of the different voices in it and the different aspects and the different layers and the different layers in my life I really appreciate that.

LENNY THOMAS: So it's not like you'll get an easy answer. Can you talk a little bit about how you came to read The World Is Not Enough as the most prolific English writer.
