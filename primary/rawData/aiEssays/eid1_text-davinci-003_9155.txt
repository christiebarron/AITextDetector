I am writing to state my opinion on the effects computers have on people in our society today. Many believe that computers have made our lives much easier and have benefited us in many ways. But I think there are some downsides that we need to consider when discussing the implications of this technology.

The overwhelming availability and usage of computers have become a great concern. Computers promote laziness, since with the use of computers we are exposed to an environment where we can easily access everything without much effort. Furthermore, computers make it too easy to multitask, when our energy should really be focused on only one task at a time. 

Not only are computers promoting hyper-activity and careless multitasking, but a great number of people have become addicted to technology. This is primarily due to the seductive features that are found in gadgets such as smartphones, tablets and the internet itself. 

We must understand the impact that computers have on our lives and take the necessary steps to combat the potential negatives. We need to put limits on our use of computers, determining and respecting a certain amount of screen time. We must use our computers responsibly, avoiding activities that can be detrimental to our health and environment.

I urge your readers to give serious thought to the implications of our use of computers, and to take an analytical approach when using them. With thoughtful and measured engagement with computers, there will be a world of positive benefits and opportunities for
