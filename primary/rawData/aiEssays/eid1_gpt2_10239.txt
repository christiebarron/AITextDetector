Computers have many effects on people. They reduce their intelligence even more. People with higher SAT scores tend to have more problems performing at university. The effect seems to be related to one of the things we call school-related education. The SAT score is a measure of how hard you work; for people who don't take the SAT the ACT requires that you take the two ACTs you took. In a study called Beyond Reading, that same SAT score was increased by a whopping 25% compared to how you had taken a test. (At least those of you who were taking the AP have noticed this.) They seem to have better self-esteem and have learned to be assertive, and much of that comes from taking those exams.

And it could just be that I have a problem with our curriculum, our ability to understand the mind and do whatever I'm doing, and that some students who take the tests may have something for everyone about them. To allay those fears which I think are very prevalent in the academic environment, consider me, I'm a writer and an author, and I have a novel. I publish about fifteen published works which are full of great characters, and they are books and are available to reading and learning. The books may be funny and funny and you just have to admit they come from characters who I know in literature, in comics, in real life.

What are some of the problems we face as a country in terms of education?
