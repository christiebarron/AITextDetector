The author ends the poem with this line to emphasize the idea that even through hard times and challenges, nature persists and continues to renew itself. The themes of resilience, growth, and hope are brought together in this line, as it symbolizes how even after the hardships the speaker has experienced, the hibiscus will still thrive and they will take the test again once the spring returns. This reflects how even through difficult times, life continues, and the cycle of life continues no matter what.
