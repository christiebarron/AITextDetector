By making the terrain more similar to a particular location it gives the cyclist more control over the path Bungard described from our website. The terrain does make many minor changes, however, often making them quite different from anything you could get from your average street parking spot.

When this change is carried out by moving your car into the back of the car park, your speed will start to increase.
