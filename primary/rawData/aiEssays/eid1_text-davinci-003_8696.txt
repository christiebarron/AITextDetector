I was on a first date with my now-partner, and things were going pretty well even though I was feeling a bit nervous. We were walking around our local park, talking and getting to know each other when, out of nowhere, my companion let out an interminable burp in the middle of the path. I couldn't help but let out a huge laugh and, in that moment, the ice between us was broken. We burst into gales of laughter and held on to each other for support as the intensity of the laughter put us both in fits. From that day, we both knew that our relationship had something more to it than just the good conversation and social niceties: we had the power to find joy and humour in the little moments. Laughter was, and still is, a catalyst for our connection and a shared source of happiness.
