Dear Editor,

It is no surprise that technology, particularly computers, has had a profound effect on people—sometimes for better, sometimes for worse.

For starters, computers can bridge the gap between individuals and make communication easier. We can connect with anyone around the world with the click of a button, making conversations and form relationships with strangers from distant lands. This has opened up endless opportunities for networking and relationship building; without computers, these possibilities would be much more limited for the average person.

On the other hand, there are numerous detrimental effects on physical and mental health. Most computer users spend hours every day in front of a screen, leading to a sedentary lifestyle, overworked eyes, and poor posture. There are also studies that show increased feelings of unhappiness and isolation due to excessive online interaction.

In my opinion, computers are tools, and, like any other tool, its usefulness will depend on how we use them. As long as balanced usage is maintained and interaction with friends and family is kept at a reasonable level, computers can be extremely useful and have a positive impact on people’s lives.

Sincerely,

[Your name]
