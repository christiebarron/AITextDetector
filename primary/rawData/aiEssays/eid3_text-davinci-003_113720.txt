In Joe Kurmaski’s short story, “Rough Road Ahead,” the setting affects the cyclist in a number of ways. The protagonist, a young man on a cross-country bike ride, encounters various challenging terrain that affects his journey in different ways. As he treks farther away from home, he experiences the many diverse elements of nature, from mountains to deserts and tropical jungles.

Throughout his journey, the cyclist is challenged by the physical features of the land itself. For example, he encounters steep hills and mountainous terrain that force him to balance speed and stamina as he climbs higher and higher. As he cycles through terrain that is difficult to cross, he sometimes finds himself trapped in thick brush or dried river beds. He must navigate these obstacles carefully in order to stay safe and continue his journey.

The cyclist also faces the extreme weather of the land. During his ride, he experiences rain, hail, and strong winds that threaten to stop him. He is beaten down by the heat of the desert and finds his escape in the cool of mountains and forests. In the jungle, he faces a much different challenge as the humid atmosphere suffocates him and vegetation closes in around him.

Overall, the features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead” affect the cyclist in a number of ways. From the physical terrain that he encounters to the ever-changing weather conditions, the cyclist battles to make it to his destination
