Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my opinion on the effects of computers on people. While commercialized computer use has taken over our lives, it has become evident that people are adversely affected by the increase in computerized devices.

One of the negative effects of computer use is the rising rate of physical inactivity in the population. With the majority of our day spent sitting at a desk to perform typical activities needed for life, we are not getting the physical exercise we need. This leads to health issues by means of raising BMI and decreasing muscle strength. 

The number of mental health disorders have been increasing due to being over whelmed with too much time spent in front of a computer screen. Symptoms such as eyestrain, headaches, irritability and anxiety all contribute to the rise in mental health issues.

It would be wise for the public to try get involved in activities that promote physical activity. Going to parks, joining sports clubs, engaging in outdoor activities, and even using our feet to travel rather than public transportation could help in reducing the risks of computer induced health issues.

Computer use is beneficial in both the office and the classroom, however, it should be monitored to promote limitationsâ€”
