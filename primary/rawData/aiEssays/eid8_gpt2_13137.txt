One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I walked in to my friend's apartment to watch a movie.

There were three movies at the time I thought, 'There could have been more! My friend was watching all this, but she was not there'."

"I saw her and she told me that her husband had been killed and she wasn't going to see him. And I said, 'OK. I'll call her, because that's who the hell you're talking about.'

"I didn't know what to do."

Mr Brown called the police so that they could investigate further and they arrived at the scene shortly before 5pm. Despite his protests, the men were arrested and they were left on the platform and never got out of hand.

"Just as bad as last year when the situation had only gotten worse in a day or so," says Mark.

"I'm not saying that he never did anything wrong because he certainly did not have to think about it."

"What is a life you spend in these circumstances?"

"Well, obviously I'm a very caring husband. You're going to find somebody who will take care of a lot of people. There are no other wives out there who will take care of their families."
