The author ends with this line because it is symbolic. The main character in the story does not pass the school test, and this ending implies that the main character will try again when the snows of winter finally melt, which is symbolic of starting over and growing anew. The phrase "when the geese return" is a reference to the migration of birds in the spring, which is itself a metaphor for the hopefulness of a new season. Finally, the mention of the hibiscus means that the main character is taking solace in nature and is looking forward to a new beginning, which she will strive for when she takes that test again.
