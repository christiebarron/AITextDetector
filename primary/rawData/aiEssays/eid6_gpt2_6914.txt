The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. After numerous attempts to make them free, builders began to work from the outset to build dirigibles. These included the use of flat-panel printers to print off the sheets in which dirigibles were intended to be assembled, and a number of "lodges" using a variety of lasers, which allowed dirigibles to be printed outside the building, like a laser-cutout of the Statue of Liberty, with the help of a camera or a set of scissors. These are just a few of many, many of the innovations that were brought about by the use of laser light in dirigibles.

Most buildings in the Empire State Building were completed by 1912. Although dirigibles were made during the 1920s, most of the Empire State Building's dirigibles were finished in 1924. The Empire State Building is a historic structure that will remain as part of the Empire State Building website.

The Empire State Building is the United Kingdom's seventh tallest building.
