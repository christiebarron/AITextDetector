My friend and I had been walking through Central Park on a sunny Saturday morning when we rounded a corner and came across a couple practicing yoga. We both stopped to watch the two people and started to giggle. We couldn't help it; they were performing some difficult poses that we had never seen before and we found it hilarious. 

The couple stopped and smiled in our direction, realizing that we were laughing at them. They both laughed too and motioned for us to join them. Being a little embarrassed but mostly excited, my friend and I walked up to them and started to take turns trying to copy their poses. It was difficult to keep a straight face while trying and inadvertently we started cracking up every time one of us fell out of the pose.

It wasn't long before the couple was laughing with us and we all ended up enjoying the rest of our Saturday morning practicing yoga and sharing laughs. We left the park feeling refreshed and with an even stronger connection each other and the couple. I will never forget that day because it taught me that laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people.
