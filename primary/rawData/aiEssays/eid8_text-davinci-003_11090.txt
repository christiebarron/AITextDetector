My best friend and I had been friends since childhood. We had grown up together and had been through many adventures together. 

About a year ago, we decided to take a road trip. We had been planning it for months and we were both really excited about finally being able to take the trip. 

On the second day of our trip, we decided to go hiking. We explored different trails and eventually found ourselves on a difficult and muddy trail. We were determined to make it to the top of the trail and were nearly at the summit. 

But then, something unexpected happened. We both got stuck in a big mud puddle. I looked at my friend and started laughing hysterically. He couldn't help but join in with his laughter and soon we were both rolling around in the mud, giggling uncontrollably. 

We finally made it to the top of the trail, but we would both remember that moment of laughter forever. We continued our road trip, but no matter how difficult our situation got, we could always find something funny that would make us laugh.
