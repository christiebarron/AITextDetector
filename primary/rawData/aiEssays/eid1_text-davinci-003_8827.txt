It was our first date, and I was already laughing. We were standing in the cafe line, the scent of freshly brewed coffee and freshly baked pastries wafting through the air, and we were talking about our life stories. I had just told her about my childhood penchant for organizing my toy cars and my love of collecting comic books. She, in turn, had shared stories about her travels through Europe and her love of writing. 

Just as I finished one anecdote, she started to share another one with a flourish of hand gestures and a dramatic pause for effect. As soon as she paused, I knew I had to say something funny. “So in other words,” I cocked my head back and held up a finger, “you’re basically a superhero.”

We both fell into a fit of laughter as our order was placed. As I took a sip of my coffee and looked into her eyes, I knew that this could be the kind of true connection I was looking for and that our chemistry would be just as fun and even more meaningful than I had imagined.
