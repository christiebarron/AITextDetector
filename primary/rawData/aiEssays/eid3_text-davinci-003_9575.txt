The setting of 'Rough Road Ahead' by Joe Kurmaski reflects the struggles of a cyclist as they embark on a long and difficult journey. The environmental features of the setting such as the sun blazing and the wind pushing the cyclist further and further down the path of exhaustion play an important role in the cyclist's journey. 

The sun shining down on the cyclist makes the ride even more difficult than it needs to be. The heat from the sun causes the cyclist to become drained much faster, making it more challenging to reach the finish line. The cyclist's body begins to show signs of fatigue, tiring out quickly as the sun's bright rays pound down upon them. The wind does not help either, pushing against the cyclist's efforts and making the ride twice as hard. Although the cyclist has put in the same effort, the wind is constantly working against them and slowing their progress. 

These environmental factors can significantly affect the cyclist's journey, making it harder and longer for them to reach their destination. The cyclist needs to be aware of these challenges in order to better prepare themselves for the journey ahead. They must fight against the increasing fatigue and fight against the gusting wind that threatens their success. It is not an easy task, but by being prepared and persevered the cyclist can eventually reach the finish line.
