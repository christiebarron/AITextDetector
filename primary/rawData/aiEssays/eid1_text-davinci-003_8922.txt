Dear Editor, 

As technology advances, computers become an integral part of our lives and the effects of this ever-growing presence can be both positive and negative. It is important to recognize the influence computers have on people and the impact this has on society.

On the plus side, computers have made information content accessible with a few clicks, allowing us to quickly become informed about virtually any topic. They can also help connect people from all corners of the world allowing us to develop relationships with people we would never have the chance to meet in person. Additionally, the use of computers in the workplace has contributed to improved productivity, automation, and cost savings.

While its advantages may seem clear, computers also have drawbacks. For instance, too much computer use can lead to eyestrain and the over-reliance on technology encumbers our ability to research, think and form opinions on our own. Furthermore, computers can also be sources of stress, isolation, and addiction. There have been reports of some people forming serious attachments to computers, while less severe cases can manifest in increased aggression and depression.

Overall, computers have the potential to be both a blessing and a curse. We must be aware of how computers can impact our lives in both the short and long term in order to maximize their potential and minimize the negative consequences. It is only through wise use of technology that we can ensure the opportunities they bring are best used. 

Sincerely,
