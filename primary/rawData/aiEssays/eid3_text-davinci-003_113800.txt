In the essay “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, the setting plays a key role in how it affects the cyclists experience throughout the story. The setting is in the Sierra Nevada region of California, and its rugged terrain with its sharp ascents and descents, high increasements in elevation and temperatures, and constant winds creates a unique challenge for the cyclist. 

The Sierra Nevada provides a testing ground for those who seek adventure and to push their limits. This is why a person like Joe chooses to bicycle this route. The terrain provides different difficulty levels allowing for personal growth and challenge as riders move through the journey. With that, the cyclists are able to navigate around the sharp ascents and descents with their skills and experience of the surroundings.

The constant winds, another feature of the Sierra Nevada region, requires them to use a smart approach and technique in order to cope with the added resistance. The wind creates a unique challenge and can be both mentally and physically exhausting. It adds a level of difficulty to cycling and it is important for cyclists to be prepared and confident in their abilities in order to adapt and overcome the powerful winds. 

Finally, the increase in temperature serves as a reminder that cyclists have to be well prepared and hydrated in order to deal with the heat as they pedal through the Sierras. High temperatures can be very dangerous and those who are unprepared can suffer from dehydration, heat exhaustion or heat stroke.
