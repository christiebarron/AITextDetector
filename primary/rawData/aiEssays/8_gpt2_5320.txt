One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my brother was telling me about a man who looked like him (in white) who had been in the gym for 20 years.

He was on the other side of the face and he laughed! I was very upset! I was laughing too long! I was thinking of getting my daughter back in there.

To this day I feel that laughter in my life was probably what changed the whole world when I would see this man. I am still laughing and laughing all day everyday. And I really think that this really changed the world.

I would encourage everyone to remember that this man was an incredible person. But just to be clear in saying this, it is not as though my laughter, my brother, my wife/brother, my daughter were the changes being made by him. It was the world's reaction to some such thing that took place.
