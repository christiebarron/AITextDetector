The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, most of their main building was in a closed space and could be used by only one person. Then, the "dunk" of the Empire State Building was demolished and the rest of it was completely out of use. In an effort to improve the conditions for mass movement between New York and Chicago, the builders planned to make the two-story buildings the largest and best-stocked public housing complex in the world.

The Empire State Building was built on a four-foot-high planter, but was placed on the street by the Federal Government. It contains a total of 16,400 square feet of the buildings that was demolished in the 1940s. As it stands, almost every floor in the Empire State is covered with glass, often with a translucent black sheet of glass instead of a concrete structure. The planters serve as a backdrop in front of the Empire State Building's windows, and can be seen in the video below, with the rest of the buildings at the front of the video.

The Empire State Building was also partially rebuilt in 1954 and is now an architectural landmark at the Chicago Museum of Modern Art.
