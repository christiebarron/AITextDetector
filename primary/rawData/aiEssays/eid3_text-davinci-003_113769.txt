In Joe Kurmaski’s short story “Rough Road Ahead,” setting plays an important role in the cyclist’s journey. The physical environment of the isolated rural road that the cyclist is on affects his outlook on life and his motivation to continue his journey.

The rough and isolated nature of the road sets the harsh but freeing tone of the story. The narrator comments on the lack of traffic and people, saying that “it was just me and the road.” The absence of people and the presence of menacing wildlife like the coyotes in the nighttime contribute to a feeling of solitude and solitary existence on the part of the cyclist. The elements of nature – the dirt, wind, and heat of the day – also symbolize the physical effort and challenges of his journey.

The physical location of the road allows the cyclist to focus on his journey and the freedom of not being attached to anyone. With no obvious destination and no need to meet anyone or reach anywhere, the cyclist is liberated from pressures of everyday life and can instead focus on his own journey. 

This freedom allows the cyclist to set his own pace and find his focus on the journey. He remarks on the beauty of the unfamiliar sights around him, a moment of clarity and appreciation. It is when he stops to appreciate these views that he gains perspective on his efforts and his life, allowing him to respect the difficulty of the journey and find strength in taking it one
