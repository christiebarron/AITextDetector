The next section, 'Bike Traffic', discusses more about the 'road safety' aspect of cycling in general. It's actually quite simple as far as it goes on this page: we set a goal to be able to put at least 2km of 'road safe' use in 2015. This is mainly achieved through being able to see where cyclists are turning, through checking car speeds and speed to speed ratios and through using our'safe' cycling equipment such as our '
