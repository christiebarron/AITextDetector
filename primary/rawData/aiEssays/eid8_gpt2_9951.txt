One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was 13, I was standing at the front gate of the church at my first birthday party, looking at a picture of Michael Jackson and saying very high, very high. In that year I'm still in disbelief because I've said many things to other young folks who didn't follow or even have a good reason to.

There's no question that all I do like is play football or be an athlete. But that's what I want to grow and live in. What I've learned here is you need to do everything in your power to have success.

I've realized two things, those two things are both fundamental.

First you can't always control and control everybody. There's so much to learn from this and to learn from that and be better and more successful. It's something I've made a career out of and I intend to do that. I want all of us there to have successes, to thrive, succeed at this time of year â€” and, I want your blessing and prayers for being there for me all year.

"You need to always try to do better; you need to do better than where you are today. There is no better way to do that than in your business and your life."
