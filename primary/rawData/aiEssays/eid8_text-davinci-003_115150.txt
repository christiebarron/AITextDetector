I'll never forget the night that my best friend and I both burst out laughing for seemingly no reason. We were both in the same online course and had met up for a study session. We were having a great conversation, sharing little stories to alleviate the boredom, when suddenly we both started to laugh uncontrollably for pretty much no reason at all. We looked at each other, perplexed but happy, and laughed until we were in tears. Even today, if we catch each other's eyes in a moment of reminiscence, we start laughing again. 

That night was a turning point in our friendship and the moment it went from a casual acquaintance to a true friendship. In a way, laughter became its own silent language between us, always allowing understanding, connection, and love. In the challenging times that followed, we had a special understanding of each other and a bond that was cultivated on the power of laughter.
