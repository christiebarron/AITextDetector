An example of a time someone in my life was patient was with me for a short time. He said he felt she had a life-threatening flu and if we did not stop it we would die. After five weeks I felt better and it was not because of my flu but because he was ill.

Now I had lost 30 pounds and this was after 25 months I was back to doing what any of you would do. The pain disappeared and was replaced with the excitement of meeting my wife and I and getting a full life. I had lost about 60 pounds through the end of 2007. Now I am 50 with some extra food and I am healthy. I would like to have a baby, but I cannot afford it. I am also losing 40 plus pounds.

I am a pretty fat lady! But you will never hate me!! I have no regrets but Compass has done incredible work to help me. My insurance cover for the flu won't cover the cost of my surgery if I get sick so I might be on a wait list, but I can't take insurance. I am now a Registered Registered Nurse with a 10 day waiting wait list. Compass has also come a long way! So it is really great to be back on the right track so I'm looking forward to all your support and love and my family support!
