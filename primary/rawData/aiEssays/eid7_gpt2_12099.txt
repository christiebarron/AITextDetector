An example of a time someone in my life was patient was me.

"One of the things I was grateful for in the days leading up to the invasion is that I knew that there could potentially be something good in a world without nuclear weapons…I know now why no one would believe that.

"This is very much because people are doing something right now…they are doing something they were raised to do. The people who helped them realise that that was a possibility were actually brilliant and experienced scientists…they were also very motivated in putting food on the table when they needed it…it's really hard to believe now that something like this would happen.

"What really struck me was that there are people out there that are very very, very proud of who are actually helping.

"So I think what I feel at my core is, 'Look who has actually helped.'"

The research into nuclear weapons, which the UN warned was underway if North Korea failed to keep on developing a nuclear weapon, is led by Professor Christopher Dillingham, from the University of North Carolina Press at Chapel Hill.
