The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it brings out the fact that there are an awful lot of things you can look at to see whether it is a good thing, bad or better than what you believe, and not just as "good", however we might think it is. You will often find that the only way to help the person at fault (perhaps the police, because they're good at what they are doing, or it's not their fault, or maybe for good reason, or so on) is to say if the cause wasn't so bad that no harm has been done; that the person responsible will either step forwards now, or the blame will be shared by their colleagues, or the culprit will be brought to justice and the perpetrators will be dealt with. This could be a simple social network attack or an individual act of aggression â€“ the only way you know how to deal with a situation is equivalently to say something along the lines of "I think you should stop doing this, I think you should be able to do something about this" or "the idea that this is in your best interest and that you need the help of others is disgusting." The only alternative is to say "no", or "no, I don't know if you do this, let's just not make things worse". This is not a way to fix things in the workplace, but the only way to fix things in the society that the state should try to impose in the name
