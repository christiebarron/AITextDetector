The Empire State Building is a renowned skyscraper built in 1931. It was a remarkable feat of engineering for its time, featuring the first ever dirigible docking facility. Unfortunately, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock safely while visiting the building. This essay will discuss some of the challenges the builders faced based on the story, “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted.

One of the most difficult obstacles was the height of the mast. At the time, commercial airship construction relied on inflammable hydrogen gas cells, which meant the location for the mooring mast had to be as safe as possible to avoid catching fire from sparks or stray embers. In order to meet these safety standards, the builders were forced to raise the mooring mast to 342 feet above the building, an incredibly tall height for the time.

Another challenge was the weight of the mast and the strain it put on the building. The total weight of the mooring system was estimated to be at least 25,000 pounds, and it needed to be able to support the full weight of the dirigibles when they docked. With this in consideration, the engineers had to design and construct a rigid mast that would be sturdy enough to support the heavier ships.

Finally, adjusting the layout to accommodate the mast was also no small task. The existing structure of the building had to be modified to
