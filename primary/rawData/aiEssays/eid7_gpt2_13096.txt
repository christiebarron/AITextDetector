An example of a time someone in my life was patient was having a seizure, but I'd like to thank some women who found this useful.

I'll also give you the link to a study titled Sex differences in Symptoms of Epilepsy; " The Psychomotor Phenomenon of Epilepsy." Basically it's a series of images and their associated behavior that describe how people feel about their sexual feelings. I won't bore you with the science behind it or with its results for the sake of the study.

The problem is though, this isn't the first time that studies have suggested some sort of sex differences between men and women…

I've heard some stories about young women feeling more sexually attracted to men than women, when they weren't interested in being in a relationship or were thinking of leaving their homes.

It's not really a study, because I've never been able to find any statistics for how much sexual attraction some women have for the same men. I'd like to draw attention to this one.

I read a lot of books about sexual attraction to men (I know I never write about it), but most of these authors were not experts on sexual attraction (yes, that's sort of what their descriptions were). They just made a study where the authors presented data showing that men were more open versus women to feelings of sexual attraction compared to other kinds of sex.

Well… but what is his study about?
