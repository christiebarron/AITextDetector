The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' (2011) was, rather ironically, a moment of despair. In early 2012, a young man, Paul Ralston, died suddenly in his car from a shotgun blast, and a group of people who had once been friends, including his wife, are still friends but have no contact with him. He was found fatally shot in his own car in a suburb of London shortly after 8pm.

We are in an age in which people are looking for answers about the problems that they still have after 25 or 28 years of death, but have no idea who killed him.

In the case of Ralston's murder, there are no facts to suggest that he was motivated by any political vendetta, for which he was charged with manslaughter. Instead, the Crown sought to avoid raising the possibility that Ralston had a vendetta for a suicide in the context of this report. In doing so, it was looking to the jury that it was very much a political vendetta, for which it would have been difficult to provide any evidence of foul play.

I have written recently about the relationship between an MP and a pro-gun lobby group, the National Defence League. In its report, leaked in 2010 to which the House of Lords, at a meeting of the government's counter-terrorism committee, was invited on 22 May 2011, the NDA called for the removal of the NDD's National Firearms Agreement
