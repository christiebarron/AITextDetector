I once saw a person in an airport who exhibited an impressive amount of patience. As I was waiting to board my flight, I noticed a woman with two little girls, both under the age of five. The two girls were running around, being loud and misbehaving. Instead of getting frustrated or angry as the majority of people would have done, the woman was so calm and understanding. She stayed completely patient with the girls, even though they were creating chaos in the busy airport. She explained the situation calmly, and reminded her kids of the rules they needed to follow. I admired her patience and the way she handled the situation. It was a great example of being patient even in frustrating situations.
