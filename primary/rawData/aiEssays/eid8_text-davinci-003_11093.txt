I remember the first time I met my neighbor, Emily. She had just moved in and I was interested to meet her. We had just exchanged a few brief pleasantries when I began to laugh, for Emily had mistakenly put her shirt on backwards. She laughed too as soon as she noticed, and I knew then that it was the beginning of a beautiful friendship. 

From then on, we were inseparable. We would spend hours in my kitchen, talking and laughing endlessly making jokes, even about the most mundane things. We kept up this tradition for years and I never stopped laughing with her.

As we grew older and our lives changed, our bond endured, and even when times became tough, our shared laughter always kept us going. It seemed like since that first time we laughed together, we had connected on a certain level that no one else could seem to reach.

No matter what happens, I will always remember Emily and our shared laughter. She taught me the importance of smiling even in difficult times, and I will forever be grateful.
