The Empire State Building in New York City, originally intended to provide an aerial port for dirigibles, was planned to have an airship platform at the peak of the building. However, the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome a variety of challenging obstacles in order to enable the airships to moor. The most complex and important obstacle was designing the building and mast for the docking needs of the airships.

Constructing the Empire State Building for dirigibles posed an interesting engineering and architectural challenge. The planners had to take into account the scale of the airships, the changes in air pressure and wind, and the cumbersome sizes and shapes of the dirigibles. The solution presented was to build a stepped mast – a structure extended to the roof of the building that provided a much needed place for anchorage. The mast was made from the same steel as the building structure, granting it additional strength and suitable aerodynamic properties. 

Although the designed mast would safely and effectively support and hold up the in-flight dirigibles, further challenges remained. The planners also had to consider several safety precautions for  both the building and airship passengers. Such safety measures included installing specially-made air-ship safe mooring mast attachments, massive buffers to break the airship’s momentum when docking, and a specially designed exhaust system in order to reduce fumes from the passenger dirigibles.

The massive undertaking to build and construct an innovative
