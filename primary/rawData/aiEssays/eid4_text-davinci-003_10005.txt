The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho conveys the idea that the protagonist has learned an important lesson about the value of education. She has realized that instead of placing all her hopes and dreams on taking one big test, she should instead focus on taking small steps and learning along the way. The phrase 'When they come back in the springâ€¦' serves to remind the reader that life is cyclical, and that opportunities for learning and growth will always come around. The imagery of the geese returning and snow melting upon the hibiscus in springtime is symbolic of the protagonist's newfound understanding and appreciation of education and the journey that it entails.
