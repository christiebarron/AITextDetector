The construction of the Empire State Building faced a unique challenge in the 1930s: allowing dirigibles to dock. This was an ambitious undertaking, as no other structure at the time had been designed to accommodate such a task. The builders had to take into account the size and shape of a dirigible, as well as figure out the best way to construct a docking mechanism on the top of the building. Despite the numerous obstacles that had to be overcome, the builders of the Empire State Building ultimately succeeded in allowing dirigibles to dock.

The building of the mooring mast, which would eventually house the docking station for dirigibles, was arguably the biggest challenge faced by the builders of the Empire State Building. The design had to be delicate and precise, taking into account the intricate details of the dirigible and the building’s structure. According to Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s “The Mooring Mast,” the designers turned to experienced construction workers and airplanes to tackle the challenge. One aspect of the design included the assignment of two airplanes to be flown around the mooring mast, weighed down with 3-4 tons of steel and linked together by steel cables. As the airplanes flew, they measured the quality of the steel being used and the construction of the mast itself.

In addition to the construction of the mooring mast, the workers of the Empire State Building had to figure out how to allow the dirig
