The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because we're all ready for something different. So let's see what happens. I can't find the words to describe the joy in the sense of hope and fulfillment, and perhaps in the sense of having gotten myself a better understanding of everything that's going to happen before the day is done. I could only tell you two things about Winter Hibiscus. Firstly, it will have a very rich and wonderful story, and I think many people probably want to follow it too. Secondly, there's one small thing that people want to hear and say about that book, but there's also this book where I tell you what it's about that's such a compelling and beautiful thing about this book. So the second thing is, I want to expand my audience. I'd say the readers love it. I love the book because there have been times in our lives to people who would have read that. And when you're talking to a guy who's in a car seat at a festival and he says, I should go sit down for you. It's so important, if you're in the car seat, for someone to sit up for you. That's what keeps us going after. I'd love to build a bigger audience, but that's a different story and so what I'm just asking for is people to ask for those comments that make me even more eager to read this book, and this book is there for that.
