The Empire State Building has long been an iconic symbol of American innovation and ingenuity. Yet, in its early days, it faced many obstacles, particularly those related to allowing dirigibles to dock at its uppermost floors. In Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s book “The Mooring Mast,” the story of how the designers of the Empire State Building overcame tremendous obstacles in making the iconic mast atop the building suitable for dirigibles is told. 

The first major obstacle the Empire State Building’s builders faced was creating a secure mooring for the airships. Since dirigibles of the time featured rigid metal frames filled with highly flammable hydrogen, any instability in the dock or structure could cause a disastrous accident. To ensure sufficient stability, the builders mounted two large, interlocking steel frames between the 102nd and 103rd floors, where the airships would dock. These frames needed to be strong enough to hold the massive ships, yet light enough to be removed when the ships weren’t there.

The designers then had to find a safe way to tether the airships to the steel frames. Initially, they considered using a large winch mechanism, but ultimately decided that it would be too dangerous to operate due to the risk of accidentally damaging the dirigibles. Instead, they opted for a system of ropes and pulleys, designed so that several men could lower the ship gently into the mooring without
