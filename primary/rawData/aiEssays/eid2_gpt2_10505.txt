I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is an important safeguard against a wave of violence that includes hate speech. I strongly support efforts to prevent materials from being published."

In a statement from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), an anti-hate hate and hate-speech organization, Davis wrote: "This ban on hate speech is a step in the right direction. If we had known this ban existed, we would not have passed it â€¦ The California ACLU and The Anti-Defamation League agree that the ban would simply have been lifted. Even more importantly, we believe that if the ADL had known the ban existed, there would have been no reaction from a school. Instead, we encourage the public to use their social media accounts to express their opinion of this legislation."

Davis's statement said that school libraries will receive a letter from schools as soon as the proposed bill is signed into law. At the moment, school officials do not have the power to block library books, which are legal to do, and the ban won't apply to the library. The school system was also fined for distributing a collection of books from the UCLA Center for the Study of Hate in 2009, but not the UCLA Center for the Study of Hate in 2011.
