I was about to move into a new office and noticed that the place was disorganized and cluttered. I took a deep breath and vowed to remain patient as I went through the process of getting the office in order. There were mountains of paperwork, drawers that were jammed with papers, and disorganized filing systems. 

However, instead of becoming frustrated or overwhelmed, I chose to remain patient and take things one step at a time. I started by sorting through the paperwork and creating a filing system that made sense. I took a break and then started on the drawers. I labeled and organized everything to make it easy to find later on.

It took almost two days to complete the task, but I stayed focused and patient throughout the entire process. By the end of it, I had an organized and tidy office. Moving into a new office can be stressful, but I was able to stay patient and work through it.
