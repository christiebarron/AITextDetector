One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I saw the video of a guy masturbating. I'm amazed, really. It's a lot. When I'm really aroused on the big screen this is an amazing scene. You would never find out if you were in that situation.

When I'm feeling really horny I will masturbate to a very special person I call "Gore" a little bit but then I would masturbate more on the beach. It's like, this is a real guy. I masturbate to him on the beach and it's one-up with my orgasm and then get my hands on it. It's just completely real. I don't want to let it ruin my day.

I guess the most frustrating part about performing one particular way is that I would be so embarrassed or embarrassed to call someone the sexy guy. It's like, "Oh, who is talking about us and you?" I think, "What is that you do?" It just feels so humiliating.

I thought of my ex and his friends. There were lots of men at the restaurant who were really hot with me that were really passionate about me. We were friends every night. I can't describe how hot I was. My whole life I had an intense relationship with a lot of women. I didn't let it down in any way. I am a woman who's not afraid to be myself. It was just really really special.
