One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I found the video. This might've been my favorite video. They went over every line to remind me once more of my true passion for photography.

I got caught up in the scene when I had to use one of my camera's flash units (the ones I used just for shooting some crazy landscapes) during this shoot.

I was also a little amazed to find one of my favorite GoPro cameras out of all those I'd never seen before. The pictures and reviews on the website of this company are impressive!

The video was very well done; I love its beautiful quality. I found it extremely helpful, but not only did I be able to change and take the shot myself for just about all 5 frames, but to add a second of the video it also made a great video. I hope the quality of the product was similar to the old GoPro that is so popular in the industry today.

I think I'll have a lot more fun playing with a GoPro from now on that I can see being a real hobbyist in my next year's life.
