I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is the norm," said Eilat Elihaj, a legal fellow at the Middle East and North Africa Program at the Middle East and North Africa Foundation.

"We don't expect to be able to censor something in public libraries or government-sponsored libraries," she said.

While the government did not immediately respond to a request for comment, a Library of Congress spokeswoman said officials from the agency's mission "have an institutional mandate" after the 2012 law was voted on.

A key part of the 2012 law was written because an independent commission recommended, among other things, that government-funded libraries operate open on state and local government budgets, as opposed to open-access libraries. That rule was eliminated after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2013 over federal efforts to impose restrictions on open-access libraries.

The agency says it will follow the law "without hesitation."

The committee unanimously approved the policy changes in February 2012, and in March 2013 passed a resolution which banned open-access libraries from operating in state, local and tribal governments. The ban lasted for two years, though then-Rep. Mike Quleaveen (R-N.Y.) said the move was necessary to help libraries maintain their funding levels in the event that other funding streams shifted.

In March, after the government moved to increase its funding for public libraries, the committee approved the measure, according to Quleaveen.
