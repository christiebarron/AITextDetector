The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because the characters are constantly trying to escape the world of Winter's Labyrinth. The game has a lot of new story mechanics in it, but the book is mostly about the characters as they move through their quests. The story itself is pretty much based off of the games (a lot of them) and the novels are much lighter on character development. For this article, I'll be putting together an outline of what will be the first story in the book and I'll be focusing on the main protagonists. I'll be focusing my attention on the main characters in the game and they'll be introduced by the book and some other characters, though I'll go into their motivations in detail elsewhere, which will make them interesting as we move through the games.

In short we can look at how the main characters interact with the other protagonists as the game progresses. Here are some quick links to the main characters from the book, but some of them are not so specific as to be unfamiliar to most readers:

One of the main protagonist's main motivations are to go into Winter's Labyrinth and obtain the magic armor for the party. He is not a great figure, but once that magical armor has been obtained, it is possible for him to use it to travel through time, from the beginning of time to the end. They also go up through the world and back again to meet one another and they share story beats and other moments of adventure.
