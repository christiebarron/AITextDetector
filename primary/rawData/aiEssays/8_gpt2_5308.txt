One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was doing a project in India and I wanted to make a laugh out of the fact that my own hand looks like a dog's, because I do some exercises to increase its mobility.

I learned the basic principles of motion through a bit of practice, but I was still not fully convinced. Maybe it was only a matter of time before I learned to watch out for it. I started making "chow me up" videos on Youtube. I did some exercises but still there was only a tiny difference.

One of the biggest challenges of doing yoga was learning to do that little thing that the body has to do to get up and move out of your chair. When the muscles begin to relax, they can go through all sorts of motions. This is a problem if I am trying to train for 10 minutes or more, but I found that it was a much more practical process, and was the key for my success.

So, in 2012 I decided to start my own Youtube channel! They have videos all about yoga (including my previous exercise), the best yoga I've practiced, and my favorite yoga course in the world (in a short time).

I was surprised at how awesome the message was. I thought it was so great to see a youtube channel that people are able to be like me and create their own YouTube content that can be heard worldwide without a subscription.
