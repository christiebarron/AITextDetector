Dear Editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people and to persuade your readers to agree with me.

The introduction of computers has changed the way we live in ways unimaginable only a few decades ago. Computers have had a positive effect on people due to the convenience they provide. We can now stay in touch with family and friends, shop, study, and entertain ourselves on the internet. Additionally, computers have revolutionized the way people do their jobs in the workplace, eliminating mundane tasks and giving workers more time to apply their creative skills.

However, along with the potential benefits, computers have also had some negative impacts. People can become so dependent on gadgets that they lose touch with real-world activities. Computers also have the potential to be used for criminal activities, and unfortunately, there is no way to stop their misuse. Furthermore, computers may be used as a distraction from work, when people spend too much time on their computer each day.

I believe the effects of computers on people depend on how they are used. Computers are a powerful tool that can be used to better our lives, but they must be used responsibly. If used appropriately, I think computers are beneficial in many ways and can help enhance peopleâ€™s lives. I hope your readers will agree with me.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
