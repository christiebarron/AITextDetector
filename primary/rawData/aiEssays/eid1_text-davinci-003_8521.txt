I was about to check out from the grocery store when I realized I left my wallet at home. Going home to grab it would mean missing an important event I was supposed to attend. I was almost in tears when the cashier said, "Don't worry, you can take your groceries home now and pay me once you come back with your wallet. We'll make it work".

I was so relieved and grateful for the cashier's patience and understanding. I quickly hugged her and ran home to get my wallet. I returned to the store as soon as I could and paid for my groceries.

Seeing a stranger be so kind and patient reminded me to extend that same courtesy to others, no matter how frustrating the circumstances may be.
