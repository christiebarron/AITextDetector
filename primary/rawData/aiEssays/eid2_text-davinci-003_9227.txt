As libraries remain centers of learning, the debate regarding the boundaries of censorship has become increasingly central to the public discourse. Many argue that the works available to library patrons should not be restricted by subjective standards of what can be deemed offensive. After all, libraries should only be limited by the boundaries of the freedom of expression, as defined by the first amendment.

Advocates of censorship, on the other hand, argue that libraries should delete or limit access to materials that may be deemed offensive or contain explicit contentâ€“ like books, movies, music, and magazines. They fear that these items will either corrupt young minds, or expose people to materials inappropriate for any given age. Such censorship, however, could potentially silence marginalized voices or restrict the free flow of ideas. 

The alternative to censorship is moderation. By adhering to protocol, library administrators can make sure patrons are not exposed to materials that are too explicit or potentially harmful. For instance, librarians can choose to place books with explicit content in specific areas and with appropriate labels. Such an approach would provide libraries with greater flexibility, and allow readers to independently make informed choices regardless of age.

Overall, it is important for the public to remember that libraries are not meant to be censors of offensive material. The Freedom of Expression calls for an open and unrestricted dialogue, and libraries should strive to exemplify that. Moderation is the key to maintaining adherence to the public interest.
