One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was watching them play the "A.B.R.D.W." show on my first TV and watched them play that show while trying to figure where the heck they were. I was stunned that they were talking so loudly. In another time I would hear laughter because I was listening to the show.

I watched this show for about six months; my wife and I actually watch it live; I have to say I do not enjoy it. However, when the show started, I started to do comedy shows. You know what they sayâ€”you say, "If you watch the show, you will just find that I have such an obsessive craving for comedy!" But of course, I had no idea what to have for it fractionally.

Now the show was just getting started. I had been to a lot of school shows, and I was only playing a little bit on what I loved and learned, and I was really enjoying it and learning from it. I was a huge fan and not just a fan of the cartoon but the life I wanted to live. I wanted to go back to the drawing board and start talking to more people about what they really wanted to do. I felt like "Oh, maybe I will learn to live through life" and this is what we can do. If we don't, then maybe this show has gone on long enough and can be put back together.
