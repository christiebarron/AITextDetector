Computers have many effects on people. One of these is the development of new technologies. Some, like machine learning, are more intelligent than traditional computational systems, and many, like machine learning, require more attention and attention from their users. This will continue until humans become smarter.

That means the technology will have to be more sophisticated in order to make it possible to build good computers. There's already work that seems to indicate that this means that machine learning is on the way to be replaced by computers.

Here's an image showing the technology being developed.

Update: According to Wired.com, it wasn't entirely clear from a Google article that they intended to replace computational machines. The Verge reports that they originally discussed the technology in a Google talk at a Google-sponsored conference, but it wasn't clear when that event took place. This is the last public word that the paper will be discussing the technology.
