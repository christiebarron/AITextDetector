As technology advances, more and more people are relying on computers for daily tasks. From writing documents to managing finances, computers have increased efficiency and made our lives easier in many ways. However, as with all new technologies, there are both positive and negative effects.

On the positive side, the widespread use of computers has enhanced our lives in many ways. There is an endless array of educational resources available to help us become more knowledgeable on a variety of topics. According to one study, people who completed online educational courses reported an increase in both confidence and motivation. In addition, computers have also improved communication, allowing us to easily connect with friends and family across the globe. 

On the other hand, there are some potential dangers associated with the use of computers. Too much sitting in front a screen can lead to physical issues like back and neck pain, as well as social issues like decreased human contact. As computers become more integrated in our lives, they can also lead to digital addiction, where people neglect other activities and only devote their time to technology.

In conclusion, computers have both positive and negative effects on people. While they can provide an immense amount of information and facilitate communication with others, they can also lead to a decrease of physical activity and human contact. That is why it is important to be mindful of how much time is spent using technology in order to ensure its beneficial uses.
