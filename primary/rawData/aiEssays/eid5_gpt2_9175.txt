The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is so captivating that it is not surprising that the most memorable character, Paul Rudd, is a good one. Like his character in the play 'The Hurt Locker', his life was all over the place, including with family and friends. Rudd's portrayal of a man haunted by a mental illness has drawn praise from many of the writers who have influenced the life of the actor.

Rudd has also produced a number of series, including The Life of Pi, where he played a woman who was in desperate need of a job that he didn't have. For The Marriage, Russell Tynion IV played a woman in whose relationship to her parents was already falling apart. He portrayed the man in the script in a much more sympathetic light, although in his own words, "Paul was always more than happy to sit my character down." Both shows have a strong relationship to the characters and a love story between them.

Although Rudd is considered by some to be the most successful American actor to date, he has since only starred in one episode. Despite being named in a television series about the late 1950s, the film adaptation of the novel 'The Mummy' is still very much on the decline and will never see the light of day at the box office.

Rudd died of cancer in 2002 at the age of 94. For full-color photos and information on this story read my biography of Rudd here.
