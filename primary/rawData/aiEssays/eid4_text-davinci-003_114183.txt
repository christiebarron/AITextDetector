The ending of the poem Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho ties in with the natural rhythm of the cycle of life. The protagonist of the poem reflects on how he failed an important test, similar to how the hibiscus withered in the winter. However, there is an optimistic tone to the ending, as the protagonist expects the hibiscus to bloom again in the spring alongside the return of the geese, and expects to take the test again in the future.
