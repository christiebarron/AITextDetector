The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it is not the story that we would want to keep in our library, but a story that is well-written, complex, and has a great ending, as well as very much a plot. I read it, and it's a very solid book. If you're looking for a good high quality reading experience, you should definitely read this. I really hope that's the case for all of you on the site.
