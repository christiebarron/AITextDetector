Dear Editor,

It is impossible to deny the impact that computers have had on our lives. From the way that we stay connected with one another, to how quickly information can travel, computers have revolutionized how we live and work.

At the same time, the omnipresence of computers means that people are increasingly relying on them for all kinds of activities. From financial transactions or handling complex engineering tasks to controlling the flight of a commercial airliner, it is clear that computers have become an integral part of our society.

However, with this reliance on computers, there have also been some risks associated with them, and it is important to understand and manage potential adversarial effects. For example, spending too much time in front of your computer might mean missing out opportunities to engage with the physical world and build meaningful connections with people. 

Moreover, the widespread use of computers for all kinds of activities has also increased the potential privacy breaches. Cyber-attacks and data hijacking have become an ever-present risk, and even highly sophisticated defense systems can become vulnerable.

In conclusion, the advantages of computers are undeniable, but it is important to be aware of their potential risks. It is important to emphasize the need for responsible computer use and ensure that people understand the risks associated with computers.

Sincerely,

[Your name]
