One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was 20-some years old. I was standing by my friends' beds, I was laughing, and there was a man with an iPhone. My friend who lived next door spoke up about how they were having a great time, and she immediately sent me a text message to confirm.

This is very funny and true. You think you hear "this is stupid" but it was like the first time it happened! And that's when I remember something special happened. My husband and I got together and he was playing with his smartphone when we heard a low rasp in the middle of the night. He's laughing and laughing and laughing and laughing. Well, this is not the funniest video or I've ever seen in my long career, but the audio is so nice that I can't help but remember laughing so much. He started to cry, just because he was a big supporter from the beginning, and that's when I remember. After the big emotional moments, my husband, my wife in particularâ€¦ He started laughing so much, and one of my best friends also started to cry.

I think we all laugh really hard when someone is going through such a roller coaster event in life. It can be difficult to just talk to somebody, but it can be exhausting. There's so much that can go on during a roller coaster ride with so many different emotions. I've seen people cry in front of their car
