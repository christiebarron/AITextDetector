An example of a time someone in my life was patient was one of the few to find a doctor I loved and he went out and told people what he did for an hour, and I would ask myself, 'What has happened?' And most people would look at that and say, Well, he did this for hours to an hour. But a lot of people would say, And a lot of people will say No. He didn't work hard in one day; he did a lot.

Doerff: What is the hardest thing you've suffered? What has it been physically?

Tarrant: The hardest thing is getting it over with. I love my family, I love my wife, I love my family I love every family member, I love every single one of my friends, I love every single time I get there. They are my brothers, my wife (wife of 5) and my daughters. I love being there for a lot of people and I think that people might not understand any of that when you are a family member. But for whatever reason, I want to say it was like a big deal, a big one. I went out and walked back to my house. I did a very difficult thing. This was my seventh year in college. So, I was sitting there crying for days. And, I would say to the doctor, I said, What are you talking about? Because you think I have a doctor?
