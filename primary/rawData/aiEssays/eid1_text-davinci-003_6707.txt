Dear Editor,

In the digital age, computers have taken over almost every aspect of our lives. With the invention of computers, the internet, and other tech trying to keep up, people have become more reliant on them for daily activities than ever before. This dependence has both its advantages and disadvantages.

On the one hand, computers help us in almost all areas of our life, from providing education to running businesses. They help us become more productive, organized and creative. They can also give us instant access to the world's knowledge base. Furthermore, computers can also increase our enjoyment, with multimedia content that only it can provide.

At the same time, computers can make us lose sight of other important aspects of our life. For one, as people become more reliant on computers, social skills can suffer. This can lead to a reduction in emotional intelligence and empathy. In addition, time spent with family and friends can suffer, as people are often found glued to screens and unable to look away from them.

In conclusion, computers can bring convenience and ease to our lives but at the same time reduce our human interaction. We should enjoy the benefits that computers offer us, but also be mindful of ensuring we donâ€™t become overly dependent on them. 

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
