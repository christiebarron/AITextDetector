In the early decades of the 20th century, the Empire State Building in New York City was one of the world’s most ambitious engineering projects. Its striking height, towering above the metropolis of Manhattan, set a record that many viewed as impossible. As New Yorkers looked on in wonder, the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the building’s mast seemed like the perfect way to capitalize on its success. Unfortunately, the idea of allowing large airships to dock at the Empire State Building faced formidable obstacles.

In his book “The Mooring Mast,” author Marcia Amidon Lüsted points out the main issues that acted as a barrier to making dirigible docking a reality. First, the building’s architects and engineers had not anticipated the necessity for this kind of accommodation and thus had not designed the building’s features around a dirigible docking station. Secondly, the two mooring masts located at the top of the building were inadequate to support the heavy lifting abilities of the large dirigibles. Lastly, the mast at the top of the building was not able to mount the necessary equipment needed to launch and land the airships safely.

These problems, then, were the major obstacles that needed to be addressed in order to make the idea of docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building a reality. To deal with the insufficient size of the mooring masts, the engineers had to design
