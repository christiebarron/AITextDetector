I remember it like it was yesterday. I was on a blind date with my best friend's brother. We had been set up on this date ages ago by our parents and had finally worked out the logistics to make it happen. I was nervous when I arrived and had no idea what to expect.

He started off the evening by making me laugh. His witty comments and funny stories dissolved my anxieties and made me MORE comfortable. We talked past the dinner and through dessert.

At one point, he said something hilarious that caused me to fall out of my chair laughing. I was so embarrassed, but he was still laughing too. We ended up hugging and I felt a connection that I hadn't expected.

He has been my closest friend ever since. I looked forward to our shared moments of laughter, which often lightened the mood during challenging times. He was always there for me to make me laugh, and help me remember that life isn't so serious.
