As technology advances and evolves at an exponential rate, computers have become a central part of life for many people. In this technology-driven age, computers play critical roles in numerous aspects of everyday life, such as work, school, and communication. While this integration of technology into everyday life has many positive benefits, it is important to recognize how using computers can potentially affect us in a negative way.

One of the most significant potential harms associated with computers is the impact on health. Spending extended periods of time in front of a computer can lead to eye strain, headaches, and muscle tension or soreness. Furthermore, overuse of computers can increase the risk of developing more serious health conditions such as repetitive strain injury and carpal tunnel syndrome. Additionally, individuals may be prone to a sedentary lifestyle, as those who use the computer often may be less active and not get the exercise needed for good health.

Furthermore, computers can also be addictive, as users can unintentionally spend hours scrolling through various content, thus consuming hours of their time
