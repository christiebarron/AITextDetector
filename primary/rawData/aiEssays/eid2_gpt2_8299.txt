I believe that censorship of materials in libraries, museums, and other places of learning, for instance, has not only broken our rights but has made them more inaccessible to others.

The National Center for Education's (NCEER) "Learning for Our Schools: An Educational Strategy for Students, Teachers, and Teachers of Language," a project conducted by NCEER and Public Citizen Education Alliance, is an international research initiative that aims to help educators and non-profit educators create learning environments that meet the needs of our kids and advance the critical skills they need to succeed in school.

While the NCEER initiative works across various levels of public, private, non-profit, and other educational institutions across the nation, it does so by collaborating with educators from a broad range of industries, including civil society and law. NCEER's research takes a "soft" look at how and why classrooms can be made better, from the best-case scenario to the lowest-risk, and what can be done to help students to connect more easily with their peers.
