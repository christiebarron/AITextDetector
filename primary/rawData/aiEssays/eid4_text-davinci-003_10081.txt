The ending of the poem Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho serves as an uplifting message to the speaker. The poem is about the speaker's feelings of self-doubt and inadequacy in the face of a difficult test they have taken. The speaker is reflecting on how the hibiscus they planted in the winter will still come back to life in the spring, which gives them hope that they too will be able to overcome their difficult situation. The ending serves as a reminder that even if something is hard now, it doesn't mean that it will always stay that way; in the spring, the speaker will be able to take the test again, and maybe this time they will be able to feel more confident of their abilities and outcomes.
