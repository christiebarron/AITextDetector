I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a bad idea with regards to free speech, though. While we can never say that libraries have no right to censor individual authors on the grounds of their specific content, but there have been quite a few instances concerning such content in the past (see: The Anti-Fascists). So I think the best way to combat them is to prevent them, at the source. The very existence of the DMCA, of the DMCA's provisions against copyrighted works, clearly has been seen by various writers and creators. But when the law is used to prevent an author from giving away his creative works without the permission of another and his fans are targeted for hate speech, this also brings some problems. I suspect there may be some misunderstanding there (see: Wikipedia's new "anti-harassment" ban). I have included a list of suggestions here which are worth responding to (and which are not covered here so go to this wiki on this subject: Wiki Links) to the very first three suggestions.
