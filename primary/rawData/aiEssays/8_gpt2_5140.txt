One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I lost my own body. I was in the middle of the first day of being diagnosed with schizophrenia. I was very close to a friend of mine who had been taking antipsychotics. He was diagnosed with the illness about seven years ago. Within a matter of weeks, he was back. He was healthy and his symptoms were very mild and were able to stay on a medication of several hundred milligrams of catecholamines. We had a meeting where after a short amount of medication the person went into seizure control. However, the person was so scared his body was getting scared. For a very long time, he was completely normal but he became so anxious that he was unable to sleep or eat. I would go on and on to hear people say that he always had an aura of fear, but his body couldn't explain how he got his anxiety or his weight had fluctuated and how he took his panic medication. One day my boss brought him to the bathroom to calm him down. I said to him, "What's this? Do you want him to eat or not eat or not eat?" And he said to me, "No. I want him to eat because my boss told him. I don't want to be afraid. I don Bris. I love my boss, I love those two guys." I thought about how much it hurt, but he said that I had been the only one who could take the drug
