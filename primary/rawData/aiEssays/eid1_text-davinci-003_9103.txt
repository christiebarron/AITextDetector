Dear Editor,

As technology rapidly advances, more and more people are relying on computers for daily tasks. Many would argue that a world with computers has its advantages, and others would argue that it has its disadvantages. I believe that the effects computers have on people have had a negative impact.

When computers are widely used for activities such as schooling, work, and communication, people become overly dependent on them. Computers lose their educational value and become a hindrance for some workers and students. For example, when students are used to conducting their research on the internet and taking online classes, their critical thinking and research skills are often hindered. This has serious consequences, as they may find it difficult to be independent when it comes to making decisions.

In addition, communicating and socializing through computers has isolated people from meaningful interactions with each other. People are spending more and more time in front of their screens rather than engaging in real conversations and interactions. This has led to an increase in loneliness and depression, as people often feel disconnected from the world around them.

In conclusion, computers have had a mostly negative effect on people, and I believe we need to acknowledge this and make changes in order to reduce their dependency on computers.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
