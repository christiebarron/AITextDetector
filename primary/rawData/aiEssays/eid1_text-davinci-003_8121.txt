The Empire State Building, one of New York’s most iconic structures, was the first skyscraper to make landing space for small aircraft such as dirigibles. However, the planners and engineering minds who worked on the Empire State Building faced some difficult obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock safely. 

The most pressing obstacle was utilizing the limited amount of space on the Empire State Building’s roof. The roof of the building is barely large enough to accommodate the massive airships, making a safe dock for these dirigibles a complicated math equation. Engineers designed the mast, dubbed the “mooring mast” that extended 103 feet above the roof of the Empire State Building. This was to make room for the anchors to easily grab onto the mast, as well as give pilots additional time and airspace to judge their height when docking and slow down. 

Another obstacle was dealing with the incline of the building and how to make up for it. To allow dirigibles to land on a flat, level surface, a custom-made, adjustable steel scaffold was created. This steel lattice, complete with steel straps connected to metal bolts, was placed at the base of the mast so pilots would have a level surface to set down. The lattice created the level surface that the dirigibles needed to moor with ease. 

The mooring mast also had built-in safety features, such as cleats and
