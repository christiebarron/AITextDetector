The author ends the story with this line to signify that the character is hopeful and that there can be a sense of renewal, despite hardships. The imagery of spring, snows melting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding, all signal a new beginning for the protagonist, who has been struggling to find her voice and place in the oppressive school system. The idea of "taking that test again" could also refer to the character taking a road of self-discovery and confidence anew.
