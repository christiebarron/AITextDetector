I was at the grocery store a few weeks ago when I noticed an elderly woman at the checkout line who was having a hard time reading the food labels and getting her debit card to work. I could tell that the cashier was getting frustrated, but not once did the woman get upset or raise her voice. Instead, she remained calm and patient. 

I decided to step in and offer my help. I asked the cashier if I could help. He seemed relieved and allowed me to help the elderly woman. I was able to read all the food labels for her and assist her in entering her PIN number for her debit card. She thanked me and said, “Thank you for being so patient with me.” I was struck by her kindness and humility in the face of a difficult situation. It was a reminder to me that everyone deserves kindness and patience, no matter their age.
