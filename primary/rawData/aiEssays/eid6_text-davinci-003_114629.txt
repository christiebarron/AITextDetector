The Empire State Building, completed in 1931, was once the tallest structure in the world and became iconic for being the first building to permit the docking of dirigibles (airships). When planning the building, those involved were determined to make the Empire State an even greater achievement, by allowing the docking of dirigibles at the top of the building. However, the obstacles they faced to ensure that dirigibles could dock safely were immense, and included considerations about height, weather, winds, and constructing the mooring mast itself.

In "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, it is outlined how the tower had to be much taller for the dirigible’s safety. The Empire State Building was designed to reach a height of 1,250 feet, which was necessary to provide the proper height and distance away from buildings to allow dirigibles to dock. The height was also necessary to ensure that winds at the top of the building were low, allowing the dirigibles to stay in a decent position if there was a wind shift shortly after they had docked. Weather was also a major challenge for the builders as the Empire State Building had to be able to withstand potentially dangerous weather conditions, such as thunderstorms, which were common at the time.

Constructing the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was another major challenge. It was a heavily engineered structure that needed to be strong enough to withstand the
