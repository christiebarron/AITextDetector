Dear Editor,

I'm writing to share my opinion on the effects that computers are having on people's lives. As more and more aspects of our lives are being automated by computers, I believe the impacts on our physical and mental health, our environment, and our ability to think and be creative should not be ignored.

On the physical side, many of us have sedentary jobs with little opportunity for exercise, which can lead to obesity, cardiovascular disease, and other illnesses related to a lack of physical activity. Moreover, research has shown that extended computer use can damage our eyes, leading to eyestrain, fatigue, and maybe even blindness.

On the mental side, although computers are often considered a useful tool for learning, they can also limit our ability to think independently and creatively. For young people, this can be particularly detrimental, as computer-based activities like games and social media can take the place of real-world social relationships.

Finally, computers impact our environment significantly, both in terms of emissions and the disposal of out-of-date hardware.

For these reasons, I believe we need to be aware of the potential risks posed by computers and ensure we limit our reliance on them.
