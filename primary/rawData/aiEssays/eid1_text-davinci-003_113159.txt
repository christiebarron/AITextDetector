To The Editor:

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have had, and will continue to have, on us all. In todayâ€™s digital world, computers are becoming increasingly omnipresent. Technology in general has made life much easier, faster, and more efficient; however, it also has its drawbacks.

The most obvious issue with the rising use of computers is its effect on attention spans. As we become more and more dependent on computers and other technology to help us with everyday tasks, our critical thinking and problem-solving skills can become lost in the shuffle. It has become easy to search for information on the internet without having to think too deeply about it, or analyze the results. This can lead us to become overly reliant on technology, and fail to cultivate our own abilities to think and reason for ourselves.

In addition, computers are also limiting our interpersonal interactions. While communication is still possible over messaging apps and social media, it is no substitution for real-life conversation. Computers have contributed to the isolation of the modern world, making us less likely to engage with one another, and more likely to spend our time in front of screens.

I believe that while computers have opened a world of possibilities, we should be aware of the potential for harm, and try our best to ensure that our use of technology is not harmful to own physical and mental health.

Sincerely,
