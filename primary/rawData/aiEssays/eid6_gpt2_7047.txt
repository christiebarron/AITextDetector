The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

In a 1961 interview with the National Observer, the first man to ever dock a private building, President Albert Schweitzer, declared, "All that is in my mind is a building. All it is is a public square."

But for him alone — and not for the entire Empire State Building — the new, closed-off space was enough to make them want that.

And they had something to worry about: If the building can move, they could be allowed to reattach their original pedestals to their newer structures, the architects decided.

The building in question

This particular space was taken from the 1930 design of the new Eisenhower Building, according to one of the architects who helped bring the project to fruition. Its new roofline, by far the finest, is one of the better constructed in the history of American architecture, allowing you to see through on the back wall, right outside the entrance glass.

"You could see through on the back wall, but you could't see through on the front wall. That's why it was called a 'living window,' which meant you could see through on the back of the wall," says David Ayer, a friend of Ayer's and the architect to whom Ayer was involved in the plan.

The new front window was not so much a problem as a sign of some hope in the future
