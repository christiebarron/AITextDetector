In the memoir ‘From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives’ by Narciso Rodriguez, we are greeted with an atmosphere of love, loss, and remembrance. 

It begins with the author’s own memories of growing up in the south Texas border, the creator’s hometown of McAllen, Texas. Here he reminisces on aspects of the blueprints of his life such as his close family, the importance of community, his Catholic upbringing, and the crippling realities of poverty that fuel his successes as an American fashion designer.

The melancholy mood is set and established throughout this memoir as he paints vivid, yet heartbreaking, memories of his childhood. We hear tales of how his mother and father were working two jobs each, while his grandmother was raising him and four siblings. These stories bring the reader both immense sorrow for the difficulties faced by Narciso, as well as inspiration from the immense family love and perseverance.

The memoir takes a reflective turn towards the end as Narciso recounts his personal journey towards understanding his place in the fashion world. He talks of the support he received from his mentors like Donna Karan and Calvin Klein, whom he met when starting out in New York City. It is here he realised his dreams could become a reality, and his signature creations may one day be known across the world. 

The mood of ‘From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives’ is one of hope, resilience
