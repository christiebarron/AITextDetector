Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

Rough road ahead, or ROCA (Road Safety Action Plan), provides a way for people to put themselves at risk of being hit and run by vehicles after a car goes past them. It is also intended to make road safety a top priority while maintaining the safety of local residents and the environment.

"The ROCA is a step forward and a step backwards for wider awareness of the severity of road safety problems that we are facing," said Mark Wilson.

"The implementation of the Road Safety Action Plan and wider road safety reforms are important but the need is there for some level of transparency in relation to the specific roads we are currently operating and not just the specific roads which were developed."

In its introduction it states that the plan encourages cyclists to spend more time on active and safe roads where there is a risk of collision. It also states that, if the cyclist has a traffic safety problem and there is a risk of collision, it is recommended the council add a specific safety standard within an existing safe road.

ROCA also seeks to improve the behaviour of motorists and road managers at the frontlines of street safety.

"Rough road ahead, which measures the risk of accident (in comparison to road safety), is a step forward for wider awareness of the severity of road safety problems we are facing under the guise of improving the management and compliance
