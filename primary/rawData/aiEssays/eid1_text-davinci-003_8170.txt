The building of the Empire State Building was a monumental undertaking, and at the time, the plan was to allow dirigibles to dock at the top. However, the builders were faced with a number of obstacles in making this plan a reality.

The first obstacle was structural: the construction of the building had to be modified in order to support the load of multiple dirigibles. Since dirigibles were not yet commonplace, the designers had to develop an anchoring system that could hold multiple airships in place safely. The plan was to build four mooring masts at the top of the building, each equipped with an elevator winch.

The second obstacle was the weather. A New York City winter would be too harsh for the gas bags of the airships, as well as for the passengers. To insure that the dirigibles could dock and release passengers in relative comfort, the designers needed to come up with a plan to protect the airships from the wind and snow. Ultimately, they settled on the innovative idea of using ultra-light metal propeller discs to deflect the wind and snow from the ships. The discs were mounted onto the mooring masts, creating an aerodynamic shield that could help protect the airships and ensure their safety during inclement weather.

The third obstacle was the Federal government. The Empire State Building was built just before the airship industry was heavily regulated, so the designers had to develop a plan for docking
