I recently had the pleasure of afternoon tea at a five star hotel. As soon as I arrived at the hotel, I could see how busy the staff was. There were people everywhere and seemingly not enough staff to attend to them.

However, watching the staff, I was impressed by their patience. No matter what request was made, they responded with a smile and worked to resolve the situation. I also noticed that they asked every guest how their experience had been so far, and if there was anything they could do to improve it.

When it was my turn to be served, I was confronted with a long wait. Everyone in the waiting area was getting anxious. But despite the wait, the staff never seemed to tire. They remained smiling and pleasant, understanding that patience was key.

Eventually, it was my turn and I was served some delicious scones. Despite being slightly let down by the long wait, the staff had won me over with their kindness and patience.

This experience has reminded me that patience is an important part of customer service. Dealing with a variety of customer requests can be stressful, but it's possible to remain patient and provide a great customer experience.
