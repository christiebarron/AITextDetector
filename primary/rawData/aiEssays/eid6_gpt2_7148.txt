The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first was funding from the federal government. Another obstacle was their inability to hire qualified employees.

The building was built before World War II. The Germans first proposed using air-conditioning to keep a city cool. The Empire State Building's height of nearly 7 feet was required.

But the government didn't pay as much attention as it should have and wanted to build in light of their higher ceiling.

That's when the federal government went the extra mile and offered to buy some concrete to make it even colder.

They said they'd work with a contractor and subcontractor to make the concrete, so they could use that money to offset what the government says is the cost of the building's construction. With some money from the government to pay the contractor, it turned massacre into an international event, with many residents in Moscow and the surrounding countryside evacuated from the building in the middle of December.
