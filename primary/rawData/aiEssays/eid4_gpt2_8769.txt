The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because you never really know when you're going to write it. You can do it, but you have to keep telling yourself you do these things because that kind of tells people that they will love their story that way.

We didn't have a very well-written book last October when the book was first sold on Amazon, but I think people in general are happy with that.

There's so many great, well-developed examples of this sort of thing when you can't stand writing a novel. As far as I'm concerned, we did a lot of work with the publishers, who all agreed to write short stories with us. I don't think we saw much of a downside. And some of the writers that we talked to did it well, because they really had no trouble writing an engaging literary fiction story.

"A couple"

I loved every bit of A Song of Ice and Fire that they got. I loved some of their writing. And there has been one where it looked like A New Hope, but after some dialogue and a quick cut to a short story I think the whole world lost a little bit of that feeling of the story, and it sort of ended up turning into another long one of the same sort, as people say.

I loved the novel, after it was released. One of the wonderful things about this novel was it was also made for TV.
