One day on my way to work, I was driving on a crowded highway. There was a lot of traffic, and I was becoming more and more frustrated with each minute that passed. After what seemed like an eternity, I finally started to make some headway. Just as I was beginning to feel some relief from the traffic, a car suddenly swerved in front of mine right as I was about to change lanes.

My heart began to race with anger, and as I tried to find a way to move around the car, I noticed the driver had their hazard lights on and was slowing down. Then, in the rear view mirror, I noticed they were pulling over to the side of the road. With a sigh, I realized what the driver was doing—they had noticed someone walking alongside the highway and were getting out to help. 

I was overwhelmed with admiration for the driver's selflessness. While they had inconvenienced me, this person was risking their safety to help someone else in need. I was suddenly filled with a deep appreciation for this person’s patience and willingness to help others. Rather than get angry at the situation, I decided to be patient and thankful that someone was looking out for the safety of someone else.
