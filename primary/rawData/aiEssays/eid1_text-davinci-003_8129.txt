The Empire State Building was an immense engineering feat, reaching the record-breaking height of 1,250 feet and occupying a prominent corner of the New York City skyline. The building was designed and constructed with the ambitious goal of providing a safe way to dock an airship, also known as a dirigible. The builders of the Empire State Building faced immense challenges to make this dream a reality, and this essay will discuss the obstacles they encountered in allowing dirigibles to dock on the building. 

The most pressing challenge was the open possibility of heavy winds throwing the dirigible off course or pushing it into the building. The construction team had to develop ways to minimize this risk and create a stable docking point for the airship. As noted in Marcia Amidon Lusted's The Mooring Mast, the team used twelve-inch thick mooring cables from an oil derrick to secure the airship. Also, they designed a fourteen-foot deep concrete mooring tower, or mast, to sink into the rooftop and act as a counterweight for the airship, thus preventing its movement due to wind gusts. The engineers also had to design the mooring mast in such a way that it could retract into the building and out of the way of the airship when not in use.

Another obstacle faced by the builders of the Empire State Building was finding a way to allow the airship to skip over the antenna of the Chrysler Building adjacent to it
