I remember my first date with my now-husband fondly. We had met through a mutual friend and exchanged numbers, and although I was nervous about meeting up with him, I was also excited. We agreed to go to a diner to get coffee and just talk, and I remember being incredibly nervous as I waited for him to arrive.

When he finally did show up, he was smiling, and it immediately put me at ease. We started talking and I noticed how similar our interests were and that we had a lot to talk about. As we shared stories, I couldn't help but start to relax and even laugh at some of the silly things he said.

I was relieved to find that we were so comfortable with each other and that conversation was natural and effortless. We talked for hours, and I can still remember the feeling of laughter bubbling up within me throughout the date.

It was one of the most comfortable and pleasurable dates I had ever been on and it was filled with laughter. I knew then that I wanted to get to know this person more, and I'm glad I did, because we now have a wonderful relationship, and laughter is a big part of it. And it all started with that first date that brought us so close together with laughter.
