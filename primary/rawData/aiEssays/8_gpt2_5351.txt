One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my wife was working a night shift, and she was laughing too loud. Then all of a sudden I was in hysterics. I remember thinking, I can only have three-fourths of my body functioning at this rate, and this is my chance to make a living! But I had a really small frame of mind and I just kept it running.

My brain tried all sorts of tricks to distract me from the laughter, and most of the times I stopped. But by the time I woke up or something, I didn't have any further control over the behavior. I don't remember what that thing was supposed to be, but I knew that I could stop there if necessary, and still make enough profit to make a living at this rate. I tried to take one step at a time and still made some great sales for myself during the night.

I don't really have a question about whether being laughed in the most effective way should make you a good speaker, if you're going to make a living at this rate, this is going to help you a lot.

The Bottom Line

I think there simply aren't enough great people out there who make enough money to live off the joy of living in one big dream and not the actual happiness and fulfillment of one another's dreams. Maybe that's why so many of us struggle to imagine having a family and two jobs that allow us to make the most
