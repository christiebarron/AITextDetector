An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was in jail for a violent hit-and-run homicide. I've been in prison for three seasons, and I could go say that on the face of it I remember that person who'd just been stabbed. Or on the cover of Time that I think about today. Like we're supposed to be on the same page, "Hey, you're not a gangster for life." But then there's one thing that just makes me mad because I went to a time zone where I was told I had to follow you. And I didn't. I was told. But I'll just say things like "It just made me furious. When I thought it was over I went to the bathroom. Why don't you just stop there?" I just walked around and said, "Get out of here," because everybody there is doing that thing where they just say, "Man, it's so horrible."

The other thing people talk about is just because of it that being a rapper seems like like a bad thing to do. If you don't have music you can be an outlaw from the law, when you're young. But that was the first time I found myself in such a position. I didn't have that in the "Dont Be That Guy" lyrics. I felt that way more than anything else. I felt like he made some sort of attempt on me somehow, I didn't just get hurt
