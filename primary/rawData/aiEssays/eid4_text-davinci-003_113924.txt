The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho is meant to serve as a reflection on the idea of resilience. The protagonist, a young girl named Joe, is passionate about botany and is studying to become a plant taxonomist, but fails her first qualifying exam. The end of the story serves to emphasize that though she has failed her exam, she will not give up and will continue to keep striving for her goals. The last sentence is a metaphorical reminder that in the same way that hibiscus will continue to bloom each spring despite the harsh winter, Joe will continue to challenge herself and work to become a plant taxonomist.
