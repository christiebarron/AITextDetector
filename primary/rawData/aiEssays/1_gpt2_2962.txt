Computers have many effects on people. People's mood changes, their job performance, or their financial condition. If you're angry with yourself, or get worried about being unhappy, feel better about who you are. If somebody likes you, maybe there is something you can change in your life. Or, if someone tries to manipulate you, you're free of those emotions. That doesn't mean you can't feel empathy with them or have compassion with them. This process is important. People do more than simply have things in the world.

So, if one day you find yourself on your own, how would that affect you? For instance, what would make you think you were a good person? Would you start to grow? After all, the main answer to all this is really simple.

You really don't want to be the sort of person that you think you are or are not. So, when you say "I'd rather be the person you think I am without a real self?" There is nothing wrong with that. But the most important thing is to make those choices yourself. It's easy to just be yourself for the sake of yourself. We all do, all right, and it's our individual best that we make choices for ourselvesâ€¦ But it's very important because if any of us wants to be who we are right now, we don't need to work away all of our self-compassion and self-interest to become who we truly are.
