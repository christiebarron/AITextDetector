The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because readers are so excited to find out that the book is about Hermione Granger. And Harry is thrilled to receive the new one! But for some strange reason, it seems corpses and bodies of dead people and their lifeless corpses are going to be present in the Harry Potter universe. Now, in the form of the Potterverse, Hermione's ghostly life is going to mean she'll have to find a way to become a better wizard with time on her side. And she's not afraidâ€¦she even promises a "mementor" for her when she's ready! But what if it takes her one of the last wizards she'll ever meet for the rest of her life to come and find her true self?

In the last, only chapter of Winter Hibiscus, you meet Hermione Granger, who's got just as bad luck as Ron. She's a former witch who had a "cursed" life and turned to undead in order to try and turn her back on her beloved "wizard". Ron is the man with no name that keeps her from using her magic to escape from the evil Ron and save a few lives. You can go to find her at the Ministry to learn her side of the story. Even if you don't.
