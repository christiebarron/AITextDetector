I always remembered the moment my friendship with Chloe blossomed through laughter. We had just finished a grueling practice for the school's track team and its usual punishment - the dreaded 10 laps around the track. We were both exhausted and our pacing had slowed as a result.

Around lap 8, Chloe accidentally stumbled over a rock and nearly fell onto the dirt. She was about to get frustrated and keep going when I saw an opportunity to joke around. I said something along the lines of how clumsy she must be to have stumbled over that rock and got her to laugh.

Chloe's laugh was infectious and it broke the monotony of that last lap. From then on, we found comfort in joking around and making light of our situations. The tiredness and pitchness of our voices would be replaced with laughter, the moments of stress - with silliness. 

It only seemed natural that our friendship had become closer in the process. Every time I was too sleep-deprived to concentrate in class or when Chloe found a creative way to incorporate puns into biology — we knew we could rely on laughter to bring us solace and renew our friendship. 

Since then, I'm reminded of the power that laughter has in connecting us — during the best of times and the worst of times.
