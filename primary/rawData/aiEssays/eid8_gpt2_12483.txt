One time I experienced laughter in my life was when a man asked me why I was wearing this purple uniform (he was probably reading this in a magazine). I replied, "Well, I'm looking for a way to tell someone I'm gay (I'm not a person I ever liked, but I'm still glad to be able to look into that world again). I'm going out as part of a team with two other guys, and with my parents being over the hill about my own sexuality, I can put myself to work by dressing up like everyone I've been in relationships with. I think I've seen it all before. Maybe it is time we step out of the box and start working hard to be human again."

When I first learned of my LGBT status, it took a few months before I became aware of just how pervasive that awareness was. I was so moved by the fact that the world had not yet gotten to know me. I was so excited to learn that my own sexuality could actually be a very big part of who I am.

I wasn't the only one to struggle with this issue. At one point, I was told by my friend and former partner that it "just doesn't make sense to be transgender." This had me in tears. They also insisted that I was "just a girl."

The thing is, the world doesn't tell you where you are going to be. All we have to do is get to know you
