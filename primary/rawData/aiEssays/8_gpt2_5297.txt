One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my partner at the time called me a'silly bastard' and he said it is hard eating meat because your liver is more dense than your stomach? I didn't want to hear about that. I got Cannabis, I want to get a job doing some of that in my spare time. I can't go to school. I'm not going to go out. But I'm not going to take an alcoholic's job. I'm not going to look after my kids. I'm not going to eat my vegetables and I don't want to be living at my apartment with my son and my six month old. It's a crazy little world on top!

So while all these things are hard for some of us to swallow, most of us are doing them perfectly. Our lifestyle isn't so much a change in our physical body as a shift in our ability to cope. That's kind of my goal, you see. If things don't change, or if the economy doesn't create enough jobs for many, then they won't change any harder.

In short, though I think many people will be lucky if they don't get caught up in their own addiction, I think there are many of us who will be happy to give up our time for more and more of the same things. We might feel lucky if we don't suffer from heart problems, or heart disease when we're able to go out in public.
