At the end of the poem, the speaker talks about taking the test again when spring comes to symbolize the idea of new beginnings. The poem talks about how the hibiscus that blooms in the winter, defying expectations and surviving, gives her a new sense of hope and courage. The imagery of the snow melting, geese returning, and hibiscus budding symbolize the passing of the difficult winter and the coming of a new spring, which evoke a feeling of rebirth and new beginnings. This reinforces the idea being conveyed which is that one should never give up, persevere, and look forward to the future. Taking the test again in the spring is the speaker's way of expressing the resilience and hope she learns from the Winter Hibiscus.
