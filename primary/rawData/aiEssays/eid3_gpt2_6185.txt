Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. It depends upon you.


So lets dive in now, you're not doing it wrong.

Let's say, for one thing, that an accident will occur while you're at the station.

To get there, get on and go.

Here's what happens. The cyclist comes to the correct crossing/traction. He turns from the 'road to the road', where it isn't too far from the junction of the two streets (this is more normal and dangerous to drivers), to the 'road to the road'.

You go to the right of the intersection, and to the right! So your right hand wheel is going left.

You need to stay on to the right. It's very hard to get out of there if your right hand is holding the bike and the bicycle is in the path. It's hard to get out of the road if your right hand is at the end of the path.

If you do the same thing without a safe passing sign or that one you can't see here but don't have to use the left sign, make sure it's at least a couple hundred metres from you and just a couple of metres from any other traffic in the neighbourhood.

This is quite difficult with cycling.

The one situation where you need to make use of the safety sign is to overtake an object.
