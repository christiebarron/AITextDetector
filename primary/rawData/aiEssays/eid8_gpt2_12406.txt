One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was in highschool. It was my fourth year out of high school and so I was doing research for a science course online, and I found a way to talk with students as a funny joke without really laughing. I just thought, 'Wow, Scrolls are funny. I can't believe that I'm so funny,' because apparently you just have to sit there and laugh and make friends.
