The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

The first hurdle was that air conditioning. The Empire State Building and its two buildings were built on steam steam, making it impossible to connect, which led to a lack of air conditioning.

The second challenge was that steam engines weren't as abundant as those of the first time round. Building large, enclosed underground steam engines was problematic because of the high volume of required steam to power the engines, and because the steam power required for the steam engines was so low that they couldn't reliably and reliably cool them. The second hurdle was air conditioning and the fact that it was costly—sometimes twice the cost at the public gas stations.

The buildings that were built on the same steam-powered systems had only one air conditioner. While the buildings that were built on the same steam-powered system had a one-gallon fire-proofing system on top that required a significant amount of steam to operate each time it needed to operate it—to keep the air conditioning system running at the right temperature—many the other buildings built on the same steam-powered systems had limited air conditioning capability.

For example, the building on the right of the Empire State Building was an 8,000-square-foot facility that Tu-180 diesel engines used for gas stations. The building with the right of the Empire State Building was built on 10,000
