I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a crime under the federal legislation of 1986," Suit wrote. "'Freedom of speech and expression is of paramount importance, but it is a serious and effective means for protecting the right of free expression in a critical and independent public and it is contrary to the principles of democracy that our legislature has repeatedly and unequivocally adopted."

"Even today, a library that encourages the use of copyrighted materials under state supervision is no more able to protect free speech than our public libraries are to protect free markets, national security, and free press," it added.

"Unprotected content is not inadmissible in the eyes of this court."

The judge went onto hold that the statute, as used by the state's public library, does not give the library or any individual the right to inspect and censor the material at issue there in a way that avoids "an excessive judicial burden of proof."

This is the latest setback in a lawsuit filed by activists to protest against the use of copyrighted materials at the Massachusetts Capitol.

In a move that is being criticized by the National Library Association, the state Supreme Court is scheduled to hear the case this month.
