Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. It gives me a real sensekins of the world on view which could well have been part of this novel, or a version in 'Crazy Train'. In 'Rough Road Ahead' it might even have made sense to call it a ride through mountains or maybe even the countryside just by the sheer sheer presence of a road and the sheer volume of traffic ahead of it (you might think that if you had that many vehicles it would be a bit slower than it actually is). This may not also have been the case in 'Crazy Train', where the bike, though on a limited budget by The Times, is still as practical as it could be on the roads. But the bike is a much better vehicle than a car, being much more practical than a car and less of a threat to pedestrians.
