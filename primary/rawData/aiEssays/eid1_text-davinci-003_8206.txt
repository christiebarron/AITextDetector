Building the Empire State Building was one of the greatest feats of human engineering in the history of mankind, yet, despite the iconic structure’s remarkable height and beauty, it was never meant to become an airship port. In fact, the original plans for the building included the installation of a docking mast – an airship-attaching structure – at the tip, but this was ultimately abandoned due to the a number of engineering and safety issues. The story of this mooring mast, though never realized, is one of the many fascinating aspects of the Empire State Building and the obstacles faced in its construction.

The idea of a mooring mast at the top of the building was originally proposed by the building’s engineers, led by the esteemed William Lamb, as an efficient way for airships to dock the building and serve as a means of passenger transportation. While this seemed plausible in theory, in practice there were several engineering issues that posed major obstacles to the dream of the docking mast. For one, the necessary mast would need to be extremely tall to clear the building's spire – at least 125 feet – and have a massive, and expensive, foundation. Additionally, the wind on the roof of the building (130 stories in the skies!) coupled with the weight of the airships was a major concern.

In Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s book, 'The Mooring Mast', she notes another problem; the dynamic upward and
