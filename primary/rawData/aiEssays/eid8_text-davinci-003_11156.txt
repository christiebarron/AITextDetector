I remember the first night I met my girlfriend. I had seen her around campus, but never had a chance to really talk to her. I was nervous and excited when I finally got to ask her out on a date. When I showed up to take her out, I wasn't expecting her to be wearing such a goofy hat.

I couldn't help but laugh when I saw it and she laughed right along with me. We were both so nervous and the laughter was enough to break the ice. From that moment on, I knew that I had finally found someone special and our relationship grew stronger with each passing moment.

As we got to know each other better, our laughter only intensified. Whether it was an inside joke or a silly dance routine, we would often laugh together until we both had tears in our eyes.

That laughter brought us closer together and was a vital part of our relationship. It let us express our joys, dreams, and shared experiences without the need for the used 'words'.

Five years later, and we are still laughing our heads off. It still feels the same as that first day in her goofy hat. Laughter is still a strong part of our relationship and it will continue to be so for many years to come.
