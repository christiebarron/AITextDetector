I remember it like it was yesterday. I was visiting my friend's house for the very first time. He hadn't given me much of a heads up on what to expect, so I was a bit taken aback as soon as I stepped through the door. His living room was filled with all kinds of curious objects. A few of them I recognized, and a few of them I definitely did not. 

He saw me looking around and immediately started to explain the purpose of each item. To be honest, I wasn't really paying attention, as I was still so taken aback by my surroundings. But nonetheless, he kept going on and on about his interesting collection. 

That's when something funny happened. As he was talking, he attempted to pick up one of the more peculiar items and accidentally knocked over a small figurine. I started to laugh, and then he started to laugh, and before we knew it we were both cracking up. 

That was the moment I truly felt at ease in his home. We ended up talking for hours after that, and he even offered to show me his interesting collection in greater detail. 

To this day, I can remember that moment of connection, and how my laughter helped to bridge any divide between us.
