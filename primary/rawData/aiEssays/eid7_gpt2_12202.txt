An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I would try to speak to her in Spanish and ask her to sign a petition with me, so that my first reaction would be how much I loved her (as if that was a formality)." As for her, "When I told her that I was going to meet with her at 3am on the morning of 8 June 2004, she was kind enough to bring her to my office at 1pm. At that time she gave me a short note describing my intentions before signing. As I expected, the first thing I did was to pick her up from her room and walk her around the room until she came out in the hallway. When I pulled her into my office and locked the door, she did not return in the night because she was scared. I then went to her room and said, 'Sit down, you little girl. Let's just get through this.' Her eyes fluttered open in excitement and when I held her in one hand and lifted her up with the other I found her and said 'You'll need to get up and walk'. At that point she did in fact sign the petitions and said 'You'llmt not be able to sign any other petitions until I get some time to read you in the morning so please get going on with your studies. I can't promise you that you'll be able to do much for anybody; however you all will get through this so please follow through with your studies
