The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' was that she had had enough while she had been in her native Poland, where "She was very much a mother," he tells of his family's "lose-lose relationship."

"She's so nice and caring and so open."

At 8 or 9 months, 'From Home' says, she married Michael Pang's sister, Marla, who was 19 at the time. She also had the younger sister, Heather Jackson Taylor, a year older than him.

"I always like to try to talk to my siblings. We've done very well together," she says. "As an adult we've talked in a very private manner."

In the memoir, from her childhood to those involved in the late 1970s, 'From Home' says she's not going to let it happen to her but she doesn't want to do it to anyone.

"I understand why most people think about being a child. I believe that you cannot be human. What you have are emotions, and I just don't want to be held back," she says. "And yet, I would say that my personality can be a blessing to children. It opens up a lot of possibilities in terms of the very difficult process of making love with others."
