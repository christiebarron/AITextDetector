The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Many built at the time were designed by individuals who sought to be themselves in public. One of the most prominent of those was General George V. Hindenburg, who also built World War I's Grand Central Terminal.

Hindenburg was born on January 10, 1817, as William W. Hindenburg. In 1851, he married Mary Ann Hindenburg. The couple had three children of whom he died in 1857—and which could not be verified. He was also preceded by his daughter, Emma, in 1861 and 1866.

Hindenburg, with his married name and an estimated 18,000 men, spent more than half a century at the helm of the Empire State Building. These were his first attempts to take all public land and put a new standard on building: a new public complex, an "economic system." The Empire State Building was closed in 1879—and he remained on site for nearly two decades until his death in 1902, when his widow and shrouded family were convicted of treason. The conviction was later overturned and replaced by the Supreme Court of Columbia in 1905, but Hindenburg and the rest of his family remained in the Empire State Building until the Civil War.
