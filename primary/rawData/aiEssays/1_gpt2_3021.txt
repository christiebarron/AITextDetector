Computers have many effects on people. Our knowledge of mental health in humans comes from the fact that people tend to understand mental illness quite well, so even people who may have had a very serious psychological problem tend to live with it. And in fact, it seems that people who suffer from mental illness also appear to be very well socialized and have a relatively good outlook on life, which indicates that even when they feel they have been through a very bad experience, they may not be able to overcome it very easily on their own. So it seems that as people grow up we expect to learn from that experience and learn how to cope with it, and this is exactly the way things are going to be at some point in our lives.

JOURNALIST: We can thank Professor Alston for being here last week for a special question and answer conference. He is the Professor of Neurology at The Royal College towering over this world.

He's been studying this problem for many years, so we are delighted to meet him. Professor Alston was also available for our audience last night to talk specifically about the issue of mental illness and what I expect in the future. He can be followed on Twitter @ProfessorAlstonBBC. And if you look up the links at the right, you'll find Professor Alston's name, Professor Alston, and his website.
