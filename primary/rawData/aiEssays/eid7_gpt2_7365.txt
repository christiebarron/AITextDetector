An example of a time someone in my life was patient was someone I was caring for back in 2005. And one day my sister told me a story about what happened behind our living room door, and I told her it was a young woman from school who hadForensic Anthropology. I don't know the details of the story, but she said, "That's a different story and we're going to give you that because I believe in it, I've had a lot of good doctors with different degrees. And I just believe that one day it is going to happen to me at our son's school. There's just so many Troy people who will find that out. I don't know where they're going. But if you start talking about who's going to find it on this young woman, I bet your job is going to go to them."I thought, well, I could use this to a good effect, to help me save and help this young woman."
