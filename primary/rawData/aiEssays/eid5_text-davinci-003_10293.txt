Narciso Rodriguez's memoir From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives is a captivating and intimate examination of his childhood as the son of Cuban refugees. In the memoir, Rodriguez draws upon his personal experiences and memories of his family life in order to create a vivid and emotionally resonant narrative.

Through the use of nostalgic anecdotes, both funny and deeply reflective, Rodriguez conveys a vivid sense of the familial bonds within his immigrant family. Despite the obstacles that his family encountered as refugees, Rodriguez fondly remembers his parents' unconditional love and the constant reminder to stay true to his Cuban heritage. With this focus on family, Rodriguez discovers a sense of comfort, strength, and identity outside of his immediate surroundings. He creates a reflective atmosphere of warmth and comfort with his vivid descriptions of his family gatherings, care-free dance battles, and deep conversations discussed in the kitchen.

Rodriguez also integrates a rather somber note in the memoir, as he reflects on the material obstacles that his family faced while living in the United States. From his grandparents' dilapidated house in New Jersey to the cramped apartment in the city, Rodriguez poignantly highlights the difficulties that his family endured as refugees. The atmosphere of struggle and resilience that is conveyed through his account of these events brings a rigidity and drive to the mood of the memoir.

Thus, overall, Rodriguez crafts a beautifully nuanced mood in his memoir that is both heartwarming and sorrowful. By interwe
