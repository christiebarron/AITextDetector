I was visiting a local grocery store with a friend when suddenly a big crowd gathered outside one of the aisles. It was immediately apparent why - the staff had blocked access to the aisle as one of the customers was having a vehement temper tantrum. Everyone was understandably anxious and a bit scared; the store had to be evacuated while security tried to talk the customer down.

I could feel my heart racing in my chest, but despite my fears, I forced myself to be patient. Instead of feeling angry and frustrated, I stood back and observed the situation, breathing deeply and counting my breaths. I refused to get caught up in all the panic and instead tried to be a calming presence and a voice of reason for all those around me.

It took a few minutes, but eventually the security team managed to calm the customer down. I let out a huge sigh of relief, and felt so proud of myself for staying cool and collected. It was so important to remember to stay patient and composed - even in the most difficult circumstances.
