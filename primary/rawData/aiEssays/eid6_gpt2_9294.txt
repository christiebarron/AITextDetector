The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

• First, there were objections over the height of the tower and their positioning, as the buildings could not contain the heavy duty, open spaces within the structure. Also, the building was also built using the same materials that were used by government office towers.

• Although some of the owners of the Empire State Building were local and some were government employees, the Empire State Building served only to further establish itself in the neighborhood. One of the city's residents, Joe Wilsner, told the Washington Post that the builders were very interested in the Empire State Building at first, but had to keep pushing it too high to keep it in the building's proper frame.
