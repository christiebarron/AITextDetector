The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. These included their concern over the lack of proper safety requirements, and the fact that they did not know how to run their craft. The Star Wars: Episode VII (the first film in the Star Wars trilogy and the first non-canon film to be released in 2012) gave the filmmakers the possibility to make use of an early model used by Disney. They thought it would be easier and more sustainable to create and show the Empire State Building over a curved roof than at the Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which was a much more expensive, more controversial and much more expensive process. For many, the Empire Building project involved many factors, from cost overruns to building height restrictions and delays where several of the building's windows were damaged and a few were left without a roof. "We didn't plan it that way," says D.B. Jones, of the Institute for Industrial Design and Construction in Lawrence, Kansas. "But we certainly never wanted to break it."


During the early days of Lucasfilm Productions, a number of people worked as project organizers. Some were not even employees of Lucas blogger and writer John McTiernan himself; most were hired by his father, Walt Disney, an executive at Disney. Some employees involved in the building project were not employees of Lucasfilm producer/founder J.J. Abrams. However, the original Star Wars design involved three buildings at different angles. In
