The builders of the Empire State Building (ESB) faced several challenges when it came to the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock. While the idea of having airship docking facilities was not uncommon in the 1930s, the construction of a dedicated facility for the ESB would bring new challenges and considerations to the table. This essay will explore the obstacles the builders of the ESB faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the building.

The construction of the ESB would require particular considerations to make the docking of dirigibles possible. The most important of these considerations was the choice of how to secure a mooring mast factored in. The ESB was built with the assumption that the dirigibles of the day could be docked with the use of a dedicated mooring mast mounted onto the top of the building. A proposal was made to build the mooring mast out of steel frames that would be anchored in place by the strength of the buildingâ€™s foundation.

This idea came with its own obstacles, however. Foremost among them was the sheer weight of the steel frame, which weighed in at some 22 tons. This would make the installation of the mooring mast a complex endeavor, and builders would need special tools and techniques to ensure its successful installation. The very height of the ESB (at some 1,250 feet) further complicated matters, making it difficult to access the mast in order execute any sort
