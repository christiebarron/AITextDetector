The construction of the iconic Empire State Building has been an inspiring story of ambition and success for nearly a century. Perhaps the most remarkable feature of the building, however, is the original intent for airships, also called dirigibles, to dock at the top. The technical and logistical obstacles its builders faced in this endeavor were formidable, with a litany of safety, design, and cost considerations that threatened to derail the entire process. 

The journey to constructing a dock for airships began with what is called the mooring mast. Befitting its futuristic purpose, the mast was designed to be the tallest of its kind in the world. Approved for a total height of 175 feet, its topmost platform was set at an impressive 800 feet above street level. This vertiginous height would be necessary for the airships to remain steady in the higher winds that gathered at such heights.

Safety also posed a major challenge. While sturdy, the mooring mast was extremely sensitive to shifts in air pressure and humidity. To this end, engineers devised a system of pulleys and cables connected to large weights at its base, which could keep the structure steady. The construction of a landing platform, where dirigibles would liaise with the building, required a great deal of ingenuity. To ensure stability, the landing pad had to be wide enough to accommodate the sizable airships, without creating too much wind turbulence that would be dangerous for passengers.
