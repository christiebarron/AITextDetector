The construction of the Empire State Building posed many obstacles for builders, particularly when it came to the docking of dirigibles, or rigid airships. These immense vessels used by the US Navy posed a unique challenge, for the building was not constructed specifically to host them. Despite this difficulty, those in charge of the project did not want to waste the opportunity to use the Empire State Building as a mooring mast.

The main obstacle for allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was designing a suitable method to guide them into the mooring mast. Initially, builders set up a platform attached to the north side of the Empire State Building, located 317 feet above the ground and outfitted with a snapping device and mooring lines. This system had to be able to hold the tremendous weight of an airship without breaking down or breaking away from the building.

One of the other major obstacles was the airship itself. The US Navy craft were much larger than originally anticipated and as a result, the lines served to control the ship needed to be much longer. The US Navy also requested that the mooring mast be capable of accommodating several different types of airships at once. To accomplish this, the builders of the Empire State Building had to design and install a series of systems using different types of mooring lines, pulleys, and snaps.

The task of designing and constructing a system that could hold such an immense and unwield
