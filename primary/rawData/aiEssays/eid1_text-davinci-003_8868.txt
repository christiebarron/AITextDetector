I remember one night at dinner with my closest group of friends. We were all at this little Mexican restaurant, having a blast and just enjoying being together. We were telling inside jokes and poking fun at one another when someone said something so ridiculous. We all just started to laugh uncontrollably and I remember just in that moment feeling so connected and so alive. The sheer joy of being surrounded by people who also get your sense of humor and not feeling so alone was the best feeling. We laughed for what felt like a lifetime, and when we stopped, nobody cared if we looked a bit silly and over-excited. We were all just so happy to be in each other's presence sharing such a special moment. 

Laughter can be such a powerful tool for sharing joy and bringing people closer together. I'll never forget that night and how it felt so special to be laughing and connecting with people who I hold so close to my heart.
