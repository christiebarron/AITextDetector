The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because of the author's involvement, but I'm gonna be honest, I can't wait to see what makes the series so good so far. We have only just started and I'm going to have to stay off the site forever so this will be a prequel story that we'll eventually finish with.

This is a big announcement for a lot of people who have played your games or enjoyed your reviews. I was just reminded of the recent news that Blizzard is trying to bring WoW to Steam. What has been the response?

This isn't about the game making right now but about its release date. In my mind it was good for the game and it's a huge step forward in the genre to try to produce a game that has a much larger audience. To go into specifics was very encouraging. It's not a sequel but a fresh start and a continuation of WoW, so we'll see how it goes. Then we'll see things bashing up the existing WoW games as well in the future andintestinal and so on like that. You also have to be aware that they might have been making a new MMO this year (the original WoW was on Steam). So all that's nice, a little step forward but when people start to take a dive into other games. There should be a bunch of new stuff for a bit where it all becomes bigger and better but not necessarily it's like that for you
