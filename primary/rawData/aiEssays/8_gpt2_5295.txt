One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I found myself on my death bed.

I had no idea what to expect and how to feel. My body was full of things that I would never be able to forget and many things that I wanted to forget about. I didn't know what to expect when I woke (to the surprise and relief of my family and friends). I just wanted to be free and happy. Why? I wanted to be free.

I wanted to learn and practice who I am and what I care about. I wanted to learn to live who I am and where I belong and what I want in life. I wanted to make everyone who has ever lost loved ones feel welcome to come back. What am I supposed to say that will bring me to my true self?

In the end, what really shocked me was just when someone's death came along, all I could do was go and talk to them who lived through the same tragedy the way I did and help them heal.

I will be forever grateful for all the gifts that I received and will love as much as the loss of my beloved son.
