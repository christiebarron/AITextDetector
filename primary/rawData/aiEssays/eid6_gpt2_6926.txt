The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. There were technical difficulties because they weren't required to carry the weight of the space shuttle in return for their own services. The aircraft would have difficulty landing at takeoff and landing speed, but in some cases even a landing pad was required for the use of the dirigibles. (At least six commercial planes made use of the building.)

The Air Force developed two aircraft types of aircraft: the aircraft-bomber and a jet-bomber--both of which have the capability of flying the dirigibles.

So now you hear from the authors that, in their view, these planes make them even safer, faster, more versatile, and more agile. In fact, with the use of these types of planes, even the US military could run hundreds and tens of thousands upon thousands of missions, in order to ensure that the planes never got in the way and never slipped off the ground.

Unfortunately, you don't get this message out too often. The government of the United States has taken on an even more secretive role in keeping the public's attention away from these planes. For instance, the FAA has banned unmanned flying, and they do fly at some higher altitudes, for whatever reason.

The FAA has also, more or less, taken on a more sinister role. On April 23rd, the National Enquirer published a news report on the Air
