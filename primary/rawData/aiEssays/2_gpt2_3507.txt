I believe that censorship of materials in libraries and societies where information to the public, as well as scholarly research, remains a central component of the problem of human rights," Professor Shroff notes.

It has been reported that many books, particularly those belonging to the last eight or so decades — such as "the lives of African Americans," "World War II" and "Europeia" — had been forced into censorship over issues related to race.

Professor of Law at the University of Sydney, Shroff says that the government needs to make new laws to regulate censorship.

In April, he told Guardian Australia: "The evidence I have gathered about how we currently deal with the books is so overwhelming that I am very hopeful that any changes to these laws could have a significant and positive impact on the books being made available to the public by the academic community."

Professor Michael Tromp has called upon public organisations in Australia to oppose the new laws, particularly those in Australia.

"We have to be very careful in our laws when we deal with books such as the ones I discuss at this conference," he said.

He also notes that Australia's censorship of books in the 1990s was not as "over-handed as it might seem".

Professor Tromp says that it is important — in this case, without further evidence — that Australia make censorship laws where appropriate.
