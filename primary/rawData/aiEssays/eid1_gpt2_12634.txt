Computers have many effects on people. People with memory issues can be prone to memory issues during work and play sessions, often at high speeds and for necessitating longer periods of time.

The same phenomenon, according to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), could cause one in 10 patients to have excessive memory. These are known to affect other parts of the body. Some people experience memory delays when they get older.

Some studies have looked into how stress from the job, school or activity could affect the brain. This includes a study that showed there was a decrease in a brain area of interest when working with a computer.

In other words, it's difficult to control how much memory is stored in your brain.

"You need to understand one thing: Memory as an entity is hardwired by your body," says Robert Spiller, an assistant professor of neuroscience at the University of Chicago. "The human brain is hardwired on the basis of certain genetic traits."

This is a simple, fact-free way of figuring out what's wrong, explains Spiller, co-author of a paper on the topic called "The Hormonal Effects of Depression."

A high-speed commute in the morning can cause a patient with an excessive memory deficit to experience more delays. Studies also show that in people with severe memory deficits, that can be the basis for increased stress when they work, spend longer hours on the go or make decisions that cause a greater
