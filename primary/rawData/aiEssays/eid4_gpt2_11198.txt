The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it uses all of my other works in this book. Its characters are my personal favorites of all the books I have done, with my favorite line of work being those I have tried. It is an incredibly well designed book, and I wish I could say every character in the novel was great. Also the characters are the ones that can save my life, and its fun to watch each other as they deal with adversity every day. This is a great book. I absolutely love reading a book based on my favorite fantasy book series. I am happy with what has been written in there. The only downside I will have with this book are the chapters and chapters that were not present in the grading at the beginning. There should be no surprises for anyone that has read Winter Hibiscus to the end. I am not going to go through this book again.
