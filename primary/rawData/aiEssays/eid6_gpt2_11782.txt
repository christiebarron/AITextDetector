The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first was the problem of getting an elevator up to the top; the next was getting a ladder down, if they could get it going (which they were able to); and finally, getting up at the very top without having to wait for other vehicles to drop down to take control. The problem in each of these scenarios was that drivers were much better at building than they were at walking up and down the street.

The first obstacle that made it difficult for the builders to get into a high rate of construction was that they were going to build it up at all times. The Empire State Building would be a long way from its original state. The next obstacle was, of course, the problem of time and time again getting ready with new pieces of the building.

Even if they could get the elevator up once a day, their crews would not be able to work it down. So they'd have to come up with an idea of what to do with the work that they had to pull out of their trucks once every 48 hours. Instead of putting them in a row, they wouldn't just sit on the floor for a day at a time. Instead they'd sit down at their desk, pick up those pieces of steel, and start cutting things out just so they could start cutting out of the building when it was ready. This wasn't because there were no real plans for a day
