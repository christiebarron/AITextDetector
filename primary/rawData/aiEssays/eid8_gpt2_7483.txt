One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I saw my father talking about how much he loves me.

In fact, he took a great liking to someone. When a group of fellow comedians came up to me and asked about how my father would love me. The reply was:

"I don't know, buddy!"

I was like, why am I not liking you? Why is my father so attached to you?

To be good, my father loves people. He wants to be loved as well. I do want to be respected. I love how he is connected throughout the comedy world. If I could just put this in the words of his friend, "he loved us all!"

So if you ever feel the need to hug my father and he looks back, don't do it. Don't do it because I love you. That's not how it works. Your father loves you. You will feel the same way. He does love you deeply.
