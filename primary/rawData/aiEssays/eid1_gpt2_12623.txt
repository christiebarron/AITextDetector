Computers have many effects on people. The problem is, they also act to control people's emotions. The more you realize about how the world works on a computer chip, the more you'll want to use the Internet to control people.

These effects often occur when the computer's processing power becomes inadequate or faulty, or when a network is overloaded. This can be an emotional effect of computer technology, or it can be an emotional problem of a family member or doctor.

Sometimes the symptoms of an overuse problem can be worse, depending on what's happening to a system. When this happens in your family, you might feel overwhelmed and out of character when dealing with problems, as well as when you don't know how to communicate. A problem can also be a physical one, like an electrical or telecommunications malfunction.

But often, not all of the above symptoms are caused by a computer, for instance. This leads to a complex problem that everyone must deal with, and everyone in this community should take some time to explore through the tools that they can utilize as a system in their community.
