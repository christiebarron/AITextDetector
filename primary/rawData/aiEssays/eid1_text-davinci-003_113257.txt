Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have had on people.

Since the arrival of computers, people have experienced drastic changes in their lifestyle. Computers make life easier for us by automating many mundane tasks, allowing more free time for hobbies, leisure activities, and relaxation.

Additionally, computers have enabled us to access a nearly unlimited array of information. This has enriched our lives in a myriad of ways, both in our professional and personal lives. We are able to communicate rapidly and easily with people from all over the world.

We can also access an almost boundless array of knowledge, from sources as varied as encyclopedias, journals, and multimedia websites. This wealth of information has made our lives easier by providing us with an easier way to access much-needed data for projects, research, and other pursuits.

In short, computers have benefited our society and our lives. They make us more efficient, more productive, and better informed. They also provide us with opportunities for more advanced study and exploration.

I hope this letter provides readers with a better understanding of the positive effects computers have had on our lives.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
