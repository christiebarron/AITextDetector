The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The main obstacle was cost to build and the cost of materials. For each dirigible one must ship up the entire crew to the dock by crane, and then bring it out of the ground. These were a large expense to have to pay for a crane.

But, at the end, there were many options. From being used as a barge, the A-29 would be designed as a docking machine. The A-29 would then ship one way to the station to dock, the C-34 or the C-55. But, the C-34 was not the only transport. Because the A-29 wouldtransform the cargo-carrying system, it would be quite easy to ship a BFR ship to the depot, as would the U.S. Mule, because no one could ship it. The Mule was built in 1912 and, as with all transports, its construction was expensive.

Besides, cargo was only needed for transportation; this meant that transporting ships carried thousands of tons of tons without any cargo attached. As such, while much would depend on the need for fuel or for the transportation of other cargo, the crew of the Mule would be relatively simple.

The C-34 was considered the most expensive, the F/A-18 was considered the cheapest. To ensure that the F/A-18 could perform much more functions
