The protagonist of Winter Hibiscus, a young girl named Chiamin, is facing a difficult problem: she must take a difficult test in order to make it through two grades in one year, which is the only way she can keep up with her friends in school. She is worried about how she will do on the test, and expresses her worries with the line, “When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.” This is a metaphor for hope: Chiamin is hoping that by the time she takes the test again in the spring, her hopes of making it through the two grades in one year will have blossomed, much like the hibiscus. The line provides hope and a positive outlook for Chiamin, which is important at the end of the book.
