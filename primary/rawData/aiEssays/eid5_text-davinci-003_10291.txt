Narciso Rodriguez’ memoir, From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, creates a strong sense of nostalgia within its reader. This is achieved through the use of vivid memories and reflections of Rodriguez’s life, as he discusses his formative years growing up in a poor family in America. Through sharing his remembrances, Rodriguez is able to evoke a mood of melancholic nostalgia, as he lyrically looks back both on the good times and bad.

From the very first page of From Home, Rodriguez establishes a strong sense of nostalgia as he describes the ‘humble, red-brick house’ that he and his extended family of sixteen shared in New Jersey. Rodriguez lovingly recounts how ‘no matter how much money we had, there was always a rigorously enforced and abided by code of behavior that supported and protected everyone’. This memory of how the family worked together to get by in tough economic times establishes an atmosphere of resilience and courage.

The memoir goes on to focus on Rodriguez’s early experiences in the fashion industry, which also possess a dream-like nostalgia. As his career began to take off, Rodriguez describes the ‘magic moments’ that were created through the collaboration of everyone ‘glittering and busy on the cutting table’. He emphasizes that ‘all those colors, and those fabrics, and the ideas made time stop for a few precious moments of creativity’
