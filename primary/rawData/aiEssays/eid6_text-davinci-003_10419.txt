The challenge taken on by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock on the building was not one faced lightly. In order to make the process possible, different kinds of obstacles had to be overcome.

First and foremost, the designers of the Empire State Building had to come up with a suitable mooring mast. The mast would have to incorporate an observation deck with docks in order to service the dirigibles. The problem they faced early on was that the mast had to extend out from the building over 305 feet from the roof of the building in order to safely dock the dirigibles. This was not only an engineering challenge, but also a financial one. It was no small feat to build something over 300 feet tall that had to be secured firmly enough to the building to support the weight of the dirigible.

The second challenge that stood in the way of the builders of the Empire State Building was the actual placement of the mooring mast. The roof of the building had to be reinforced steel in order to support the mast and the stress brought onto the building by the strain of the dirigible’s dockings. This meant that the mooring mast had to be securely mounted to the reinforced steel, and that the whole mast assembly had to pass environmental and safety inspections, as well as having the approval of the building’s board of directors.

The third and final obstacle that the builders had to surmount
