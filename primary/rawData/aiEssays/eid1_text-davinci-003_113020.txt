Dear Editor,

Recently, the effects of computers on people have been a pivotal point of discussion. As an avid observer of technology, I strongly believe that computers can have both positive and negative effects on individuals. 

On the positive side, computers have provided people with access to an array of information quickly and conveniently. They have also enhanced communication, since they enable users to easily communicate with people from around the world. Computers have made access to knowledge easier, and have allowed people to connect with each other.

However, computers can also have a detrimental effect on people. Many studies have shown that extended use of computers can lead to physical health problems, such as neck and shoulder pain. Furthermore, too much computer usage can lead to isolation, social skills deterioration, and in extreme cases, psychological problems.

Given the fact that computers can both facilitate and hinder individuals, it is important for people to use them in moderation. For this reason, I strongly urge people to become more aware of the effects computers have on their lives and to use them responsibly.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
