One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was in my 25s. This is when I remember laughing as a kid, or at all."

"I am still trying to figure out my way into the world, when I was in a different world, I remember laughing like they did this crazy thing."

Bourrien says she is looking forward to making her own new comedy in the future. "Maybe as soon as I get my hands on my next film, I've been looking forward to it."

As with many young women, the best advice she could give to them, and her own life, is to find something you are excited about, something that can be something they truly understand the pain that may be coming along to the end. With that said, don't let an unrealistic idea come through and you will not be able to make it. The good news is in the long run, you may be an experienced comedian.

What do you take away from a comedy?

"We can do an amazing thing and we can do something great and we can do a comedy of the highest quality. Maybe people want to laugh about how they're feeling, not just laugh about how the audience is feeling. If that's what's good for you, then it's good for any comedy. Otherwise, the audience is going to continue laughing. If they're not going to laugh about their experience, then they're not going to see it.
