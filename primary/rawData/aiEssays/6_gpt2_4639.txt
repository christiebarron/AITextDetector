The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, an 18-inch by 12-inch curved glass bridge had to be built on top of the Empire State Building before its massive dome was even built. (See the Wikipedia article.) But the design of the Empire State Building made it possible to dock in the middle of the Empire State Building's roof. And the engineers at M. G. Lewis worked tirelessly, even as their efforts were reduced by the massive design issues and, at the same time, the cost of cutting the Empire State Building to a single piece. The new structure was built in the middle of the Empire State Building to accommodate the enormous dome and its enormous circular openings (it had to be widened even further as shown in the image below). For the next several years, many architects and engineers worked to build the Empire State Building just to get it off the ground (see the story from George Erskine, "The Empire State Building as a Fluid Transitory Material."), but the original plan failed, and by the time the Empire State Building opened in 1922, more than a hundred engineers had been out on the job. Finally, the State Building was completed in 1930. But the engineers working to build that bridge were almost certainly the same ones who planned the big open-air dome and the large circular openings in the Empire State Building. (See the Wikipedia article.) "The Empire State Building was very much built with the
