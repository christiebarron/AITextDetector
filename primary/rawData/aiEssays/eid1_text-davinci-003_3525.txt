Censorship in libraries is a widely contested issue. While it is true that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, can be deemed offensive by some individuals, censoring them is not the solution. Instead, libraries should employ methods such as age-restrictions or warnings for those who may find the material offensive.

Censorship of material in libraries goes against the core ideals of freedom of speech and expression. It is important to remember that libraries serve as a safe space for people of all ages and backgrounds to explore, express, and discover different works of art. Censorship risks the creating of a space that limits people by silencing those with differing opinions or stripping away their right to engage and express themselves. 

Rather than completely removing materials from library shelves, there are alternative approaches that can be taken to allow for continued freedom of expression. For instance, libraries can employ age-restrictions for individuals who may not maturely handle the subject matter. In addition, they can develop systems in which those who find certain media offensive can receive warnings prior to viewing it. This would allow people to make an informed decision as to what they would like to view or listen to.
