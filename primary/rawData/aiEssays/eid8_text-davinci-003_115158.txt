Once upon a time I was visiting a good friend of mine. We had known each other since college and had stayed close over the years, keeping in touch with occasional phone calls or email messages. 

We hadn't seen each other in a while, so when I arrived, we decided to catch up over dinner at a small Italian restaurant nearby. While we waited for our food, we began talking about all the things that had happened in our lives since the last time we had seen each other. 

We shared our successes and stories about our families, and then the conversation got more humorous. We both shared a fondness for the sort of cheesy jokes and puns that we had both picked up in college, so naturally, we indulged. 

At one point as we laughed, my friend said something that made me do a full-throated cackle that startled the other people in the restaurant and made my friend burst out laughing as well. All the other diners looked at us like we had lost our minds. But my friend and I didn't care; it was a special moment of laughter sharing that even if it was unexpected, felt amazing.

We continued to enjoy our meal, and the laughter kept coming. We were amazed at how a quick dinner could bring us so much joy and reconnection between us.

At the end of the night, we said our goodbyes with wide smiles and an eagerness to reunite
