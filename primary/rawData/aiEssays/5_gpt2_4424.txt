In a blog post, Mazzolato detailed how she chose to write an entire memoir based upon her experiences in the early 1990s when Clarke, then a 25-year veteran of the military, took the field in Iraq. She wrote the book for a crowdfunded campaign and is currently looking into it.

'From Home is a memoir, not a trilogy. What I've seen in the book is that 'We Live And We Fight Here' â€” a story that I love, and yet I know the real story is very different,' Mazzolato said.

'I'm really sorry for the people who were hurt and their children. We're the brave, funny army.'

She is a former Marine with two deployments to Iraq and four trips to Iraq in 2003.

She told NBC News, "One of those people who was hurt in Iraq that was my son, he came over and he was wounded, and there was carnage going on in the streets. He came in, and there were people firing at him, which we know killed him, and people screaming."

She also took part in an event at which Clarke spoke in support of those killed and injured overseas.
