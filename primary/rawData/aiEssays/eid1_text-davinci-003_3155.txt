With the widespread rise of technology and computerization over the past decades, itâ€™s no surprise to discover the effects computers have had on people. Overuse of computers can have both positive and negative consequences, but I feel the disadvantages heavily outweigh the benefits and should not be ignored.

On the positive side, computers have enabled people to conveniently perform tasks such as research, calculations, and communication. They have even revolutionized the way we work, allowing for jobs and responsibilities to be performed from virtually anywhere in the world.

Unfortunately, computers also have some dangerous effects that should not be overlooked. Recent research has actually found that too much computer use is linked to several health problems such as obesity, poor posture, carpal tunnel syndrome, and eye strain. There is also evidence of addictive behavior associated with computer usage that can lead to feelings of depression and lack of confidence in those unable to limit their use. Additionally, computers can serve as conduits for cyber-bullying and other forms of online harassment.

In order to benefit from the potential advances computers present, it is essential to recognize the risks and address them accordingly. People should be encouraged to be aware of their computer use, set boundaries
