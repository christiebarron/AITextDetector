The Empire State Building’s construction was a feat in itself, but one of its major design objectives was to allow dirigibles to dock. As Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s The Mooring Mast explains, there were numerous obstacles standing in the way of achieving this goal. 

The most glaring obstacle was clearly the height of the building itself. At a time when the tallest building on Earth was only a fraction of its eventual size, the notion of an entire airship being able to dock was audacious. Estimating the forces of wind and turbulence correctly was also difficult; engineers had to calculate the forces on the mast and how passengers would board the airship from the building’s observation deck. Finally, they had to figure out how to securely anchor the mast and mooring lines.

The mast itself was a major undertaking. To be stable, it had to be extremely rigid, so it was constructed from steel trusses and beams. This meant that it had to be tall enough to support the weight and wind resistance of what would become the world’s largest airship. However, the structure had to be incredibly light in order to meet safety standards and not contribute too much additional weight to the building. This necessitated the use of a four-legged lattice design to give it strength while minimizing the amount of materials used.

The mooring system was also complex. For the airships to land and
