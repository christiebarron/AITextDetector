The decision to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was a bold and innovative move when it was first proposed in the early 1930s. The builders of the building faced several obstacles and dangers in making the docking of large airships possible, posing a significant challenge. 

The primary obstacle faced by the builders was the potential for disaster should something go wrong and the dirigible crash. The airship was filled with a combustible material, hydrogen, which would mean that any accident would put the building – and those inside – at risk of horrendous damage. Considering the building was at the time the tallest in the world and the first one to exceed the Empire State Building is one hundred stories tall, the stakes were frighteningly high. 

The design of the building itself had to be adapted in order to make docking possible; a bulky and robust mast was erected to allow the airship to latch on and ensure it didn’t drift away or become tangled. This ‘mooring mast’ was placed at the eighty-second floor of the building and had to be modified to take into account the strong winds that constantly blew around the tower.

The process of mooring a dirigible required immense skill and precision and could only be undertaken when the weather conditions were ideal. The strength of the winds around the building made it difficult to sustain a static position, let alone one required to secure the LZ-127 or other airships.
