Dear Editor,

As technology advances, we have been blessed with countless tools that make everyday tasks simpler and easier to do than ever before. Computers have enabled us to work quickly, communicate quickly, and access information with a few clicks of the mouse. However, there is an ongoing debate about the potential effects that computers can have on people.

From my perspective, I see computers as an innovative tool that has allowed us to live in a more connected and efficient world. By having the ability to access information quickly, complete tasks quickly, and communicate with others efficiently, computers offer immense advantages. However, there is evidence that suggests too much computer use can have socio-emotional, physical, and academic effects on people.

Through my own experiences, I have seen first hand how computers can have a negative effect on people if used in excessive amounts. Poor physical health, decreased hand-eye coordination due to hours spent indoors instead of out, and decreased productivity due to the distractions of the computer screen are all potential effects of computer overuse.

We must use computers in moderation and utilize them as a tool to enhance our lives, not be slaves to them. Computers should be used to make our lives simpler and more efficient, not to undermine our physical, mental, and emotional health.

Thank you for your time,
