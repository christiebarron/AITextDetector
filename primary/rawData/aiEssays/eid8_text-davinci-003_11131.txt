It was one of those rare moments when my childhood best friend and I were both in the same city. We hadn't seen each other in years but somehow we managed to find an afternoon to get together and catch up. 

We spent hours just chatting away, but it didn't take us long to get into the kind of silly banter that we remembered from growing up and the shared jokes that always made us both laugh. 

At one point we both got a little carried away and started to make fun of the other person's old growing pains. Neither of us could contain our laughter and we both rolled around on the floor in fits of laughter. 

It was an unforgettable moment full of joy and made us connect with each other in a way that had been missing for so long. We realized that no matter how much time had passed and life had changed, we could still connect to the essence of who we were through laughter. 

It's been a while since that day but I still look back fondly on the time we spent together, laughing and enjoying each other's company. It was an amazing reminder of the power of laughter and how it really can bring people together.
