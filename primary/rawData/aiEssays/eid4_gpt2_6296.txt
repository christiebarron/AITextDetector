The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because the only difference is how the book ends. It also makes me think that the end of this book was the conclusion to Winter's story.

And as for Winter's story arc?

The book ending is what made the book so good. I felt like I had a character that was going through another cycle. This story was the worst series of all time. It's such a mess of a book that it's a shame. And then one could just enjoy the story without even thinking about how it ended. However, that's what happened to Summer. It's the ending for each part of Winter: her new husband, and his attempt to kill her; how he became obsessed with her daughter.

You have to start somewhere. You have to make a decision and not just stop at this single part. Maybe that would be the final chapter. Or maybe you should go back to Winter's side and see if there is a more important piece. Or maybe you are on the fence about any of this. But I think that's one of the reasons I write so often about books like this: you look at your back, you think it is OK to say or do what you like. You don't stop and wonder when the next cycle will end when you start asking: 'How did the book end?' Because you are so focused on the next, rather than the next.
