I had been invited to my friend Dave's house for dinner, and my stomach was growling with anticipation. So I was more than a little excited as I got ready for the evening ahead. I had put on my best outfit and had even treated myself to some new shoes.

When I arrived at Dave's house, I was met by five of his closest friends. We chatted for a few minutes while we waited for Dave to join us, and the conversation was nothing special—just the usual introductions and small talk.

That changed the moment Dave walked into the room. He had a joke in his pocket, and he was determined to share it with us. As soon as he opened his mouth, it was like a light switch had been flipped—everyone's moods shifted, and suddenly, laughter filled the entire room.

That joke broke the ice and unlocked a sense of joy that had been missing from the conversation up until that point. For the rest of the night, I talked and laughed with people I had just met, and the bonds between us grew stronger with each passing minute.

I left Dave's house that night with a smile on my face, energized by the joy that had filled the room. Laughter had brought us all together, and it gave me a glimpse of what was possible when strangers became friends.
