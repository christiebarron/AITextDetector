The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

The new elevator system (Fig. 1) provides several advantages over traditional car elevator.

It has an angle-control system for making sure the elevator's height is within about 6 cm of the building's centerline. The centerline at the left side of the tower provides additional clearance from horizontal space.

In this scenario the height requirements on both sides of the elevator have to be quite large.

The first obstacle was the cost. The original design used a cost per hour estimate in the early 1930's for the construction of the current elevator system. This calculation was later revised by the Institute for Advanced Technology in World Systems.

The cost per Hour for the construction of the current elevator system is 10,900 Euros per hour, which can be expected to reach its present value of 1.5 Euros per hour in 2014.

The same calculation is used in designing the current system, which is based on the estimate of 3.45 Euros cost per hour.

The cost of building the same system will be 2.7 Euros per hour for this elevator, but if the currenthonorable design were to come to a finish before the end of additionally 10,900 Euros per hour it would be 2.8 Euros per hour.

In order to give the elevator a new look it is necessary to replace the conventional door (Fig. 1) and a similar
