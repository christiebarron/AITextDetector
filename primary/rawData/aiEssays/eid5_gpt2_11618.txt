The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is a classic "I'm your mom," the mother's cry.

"We just don't love her as much as we should," she tells the group. "We still don't know who she's. This story, in many ways, is my mother's birth story—and my sister's. It's my family's story and my sister's. We're the ones that will always cry."

She then shows viewers her son's face and his mother's body, which is an indicator of his condition and how he will mature if the mother is treated like a child.

"In a very real way we're the parents of this young man, and I'd love to be with reverting to our mother's life," she tells the group. "I think in that state he might begin to become a bit of a rebel—very rebellious. At the same time he might come to a place of clarity of purpose, where he'll begin to discover in himself a life he's never expected to bring—where he may become a more personal character. And then there's his father, of course. Those are the things I would want to see that he learns from this, where he begins to really understand where his father is, and that he might be a little child with some of these limitations that come with being the mother of an adult son."
