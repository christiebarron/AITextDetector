I recently experienced a long, exhausting cross-country drive from my home in Maine to Florida. The journey was 16 hours and more than 1000 miles. Despite growing tired and feeling frustrated, I was determined to make it through the drive without complaining.

Throughout the drive, I had to fight the temptation to quit and stay at a hotel halfway. But every time, something inside of me kept me motivated to push on. I reminded myself that if I stayed patient and kept driving, the end result would be worth it.

The entire journey seemed to drag on, but I kept reminding myself why I was doing this in the first place and stayed patient. I had a mission and nothing was going to stop me from achieving it. 

When I finally arrived at my destination, I was thrilled I was able to complete the journey. Staying patient during the 16 hour drive may have been tough, but it was worth it in the end.
