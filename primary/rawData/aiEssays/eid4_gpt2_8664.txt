The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because of how hard it is for authors to change what is important for readers who are older than us and people who are younger than us with different perspectives on things like sexuality. This is an attempt to help.

As I've said before, the books that make up this book are the books that have never been published before. Their authors and their publishers are constantly changing them.

And as a note to those who read this book, the book isn't an apology that comes with the first edition. I've been reading it on the internet without any thought of ever being able to read it again. This is a good thing â€“ for those looking to give us a refresher of what we can expect from this series, it's much better to take my old readers, especially those who read the first edition to the next.
