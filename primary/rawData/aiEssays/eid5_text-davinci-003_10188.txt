Narciso Rodriguez’ memoir ‘From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives' offers a unique glimpse into the emotional journey of his upbringing and personal creative development. As his memories take us on a journey through time, Rodriguez captures an atmosphere that is both inviting and daunting. Through his use of vivid detail and striking imagery, we experience a retrospective glance at the events which come to shape both Rodriguez’ life and his career as a successful fashion designer. 

The memoir begins with a description of Rodriguez’ childhood home in Newark, New Jersey. His home was a refuge of humble beginnings and a source of inspiration, with its ‘expansive cityscape walls,’ its ‘piles of colorful fabric’ and its ‘multitude of colors.’ Throughout the book, Rodriguez returns time and again to this familial sanctuary. We share in the warmth of his childhood memories, as he remembers the evening walks with his grandmother and the simple pleasure in sitting around the kitchen table with his family. His recollections evoke a feeling of comfort, of familiarity and of togetherness. 

His narrative frequently cuts to the years when Rodriguez was growing up in California and studying at Parsons in New York. Amidst the difficulties of homesickness and the pressure of striving for success, he never strays far from his roots. He uses his mainstays of faith, family and friends to help him endure and support his dreams.
