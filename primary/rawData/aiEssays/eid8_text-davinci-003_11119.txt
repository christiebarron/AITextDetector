One day, my best friend and I were on the bus, on our way to the beach. We were both exhausted from the long week of work, and so we decided to just relax on the ride. We were idle and joked around when suddenly, a chance event filled the bus with laughter. 

A passenger had stumbled causing her purse to fly across the aisle, spilling its contents. Everyone stopped their conversations and looked towards the small mess. My friend and I were about to go and help the woman, but before we could do anything else, laughter had filled the entire bus. It was the sweet, infectious kind of laughter; the kind that leads to uncontrollable fits of giggles and grins on tired faces. 

The woman who had spilled her things was laughing too, and since everyone else was caught up in it, so did my friend and I. We went up to help her and succeeded in bringing a smile to her face too. At the end of it all, it was time to part ways and so we both said our goodbyes with hopeful smiles. 

That moment of laughter was an unexpected reminder that regardless of how tough life can be, simple, fleeting moments can bring us together and put a smile on our faces.
