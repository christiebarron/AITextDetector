Dear Editor,

As technology advances, it's impossible to deny that computers are becoming integral in most people's lives. From learning in school to career advancement to entertainment sources, computers are everywhere. With such a strong influence on society, it's important for us to ask: what are the effects computers have on people?

As with any technology, computers have both positive and negative effects. On the positive side, computer literacy is becoming a necessity for earning potential and is even a prerequisite for many entry-level jobs. In addition, computers are invaluable when it comes to research and allow people to work from home or even open a business. Furthermore, video games allow individuals to connect to each other online, creating communities of their own.

However, computers do have some negative effects. For instance, computer addiction can cause people to become isolated and less productive in their daily lives. Excessive use of computers leads to physical ailments such as carpal tunnel syndrome while long hours of sitting have been linked to serious health conditions. Also, there is a greater vulnerability to cyberbullying, malware, and other malicious programs which can lead to the manipulation of personal information or interactions.

In conclusion, computers are beneficial in many ways, but we must keep in mind the potential drawbacks in order to ensure our safety and well-being. Through continued education and responsible use of computers, we can ensure we reap the rewards with minimal risks.

Sincerely,
