The Empire State Building is an iconic structure in New York City that has become an international symbol of strength and resilience. Despite its modern day grandeur, the audacious project had many obstacles that had to be overcome during its construction, which included the unique task of allowing for the docking of dirigibles. 

The builders of the Empire State Building faced a multitude of challenges when attempting to make the docking of dirigibles a reality. From engineering challenges of designing a structure that could handle the weight and size of the dirigibles to finding a way to secure the dirigible in high winds and turbulence, builders were tasked with untested and complex feats.

One of the most difficult obstacles the Empire State Building faced was designing a safe and secure method for mooring the dirigibles. This process required the construction of a huge metal mast that extended through the top of the building to the roof. This mast, often referred to as the “Mooring Mast”, was equipped with a pulley system that allowed for the dirigibles to be attached and secured while docked. To ensure its stability, the mast was secured to a huge block of concrete located in the basement of the building.

Additionally, the crew faced challenges in designing the space necessary for dirigibles to dock safely. To this end, plans were drawn up for a covered dock, which included an anchoring system and a set of steel doors that could be opened
