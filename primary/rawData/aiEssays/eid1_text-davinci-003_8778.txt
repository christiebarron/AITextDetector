I still remember the moment my best friend and I shared our first laugh. It was a beautiful spring evening and we were both struggling through our college classes. We had gone out for dinner, and even though we had been friends for a few years, the conversation just wasn't going anywhere. 

Suddenly, I made an irrational joke about something random in the restaurant, I don't remember what, and she began to chuckle. Before we knew it, the laughter was spilling out of us and soon enough, we were both wiping away tears from our eyes. 

It was at that moment that I knew our friendship had reached the next level. We had connected in a way that neither of us had before, and we still laugh about that night together. Laughter really is the shortest distance between two people - it can start conversations, chase away the blues, and bring about a newfound closeness in a relationship.
