Books, movies, music, and magazines act as fundamental sources of knowledge and entertainment in our society, and libraries are the vessels which house these physical amenities. Although many of these materials can provide valuable educational and cultural insight, the notion of censorship in libraries lingers. To this date, there are those who advocate for the removal of certain books, movies, music, and magazines if they are deemed offensive. 

To censor library items is an injustice to freedom of information and a violation of intellectual liberty. Banning access to certain types of materials is inconsistent with the foundational spirit of libraries, which are intended to host an expansive array of literature and resources for the enrichment of humanity. By withholding items thought to be "offensive", the learning outcomes of individuals are forfeit, and knowledge is further suppressed. 

The offense of censorship can be extended to more than just library items. By delving into a libraryâ€™s information reserves and regulating the materials therein, we are disrupting the natural flow of education of library goers. Wisdom is able to freely guide scholarship and personal growth, and censorship disrupts this ebb and flow. 

The attempt to censor library materials, and to limit the plethora of resources already narrowed by library policies, is a grave disservice to the well-being of society. All forms of censorship of material in libraries should be abandoned, lest we render literature and its capacity for knowledge impotent and incompatible with a return to true freedom of information.
