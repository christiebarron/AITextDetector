The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because,

The world around him has vanished. From the frozen world into the deep-sea depths, this place is filled with monsters and dangers that have been brought to the surface. The very existence of the monsters has gone unfulfilled and the world is at risk of getting attacked.

The world isn't like a place with no hope, there's no meaning to it. This is a place where humans are only looking to preserve their survival against a monster that will never return. There's a reason those monsters come through the borders of this place.

Hibiscus.

The only thing left is a new life and the world doesn't look like it's coming back.

The one living.

But.

The one living in the beginning.

The one who made the final decision

The one in that final moment.

Hibiscus, the place that will be safe. The world that was there before with us.

What is this world? Is this a place where humans are alone but if we're here right now and we look in these empty shelves…

If I see this world… if we leave this world so suddenly and if that monster arrives… I'll have nothing.

If we change the world that we have decided to live in, we can say this is a world that's the last place we'll find
