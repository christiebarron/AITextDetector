In recent years, many of us have become increasingly reliant on computers and technology for communication, entertainment, information, and even our everyday tasks. It is true that computers have revolutionized how we operate and function in our lives. But are the effects of computers beneficial or detrimental to our lives? 

As a teacher, I teach my students skills they will need in the digital world. Computers have enabled us to easily entrance, access and process information on a level that was not possible before.

People of all age groups (from children to adults) can become addicted to gaming, online messaging and social media, and this can have serious negative effects, such as social isolation, poor concentration, lack of physical activity and even depression.
