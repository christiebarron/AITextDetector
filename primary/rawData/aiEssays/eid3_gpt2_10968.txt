Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

I'd like to start with the most important thing - that it makes you feel safer. Not knowing where to run or sit, and what to get you.

The cyclist's body is an active, safe and efficient platform for running. This might not even be possible with running shoes (that's a good one right now, but no one likes the sound of them). All the power you can feel from your foot on the ground will be lost in some random part of the car.

You've just run from your car. You've heard a car crash just before your race. A car is starting to sink down into the ground at your front or rear when you run to it, and it's getting very loud as you get down from the car. It's almost like a crash at the mouth right next to your car's backlight. When the loud crash hits, the front of the car is forced to brake and turn due to the shock of the car hitting the front of the body. You see the car crash in the back of your vision as the head of the collision happens to stand over the accelerator, and he/she has enough to drive through the turn, you see the head of the collision fall behind the head of drivable bike. To some extent, that is also the case if you see the car in front of you when you are under a truck
