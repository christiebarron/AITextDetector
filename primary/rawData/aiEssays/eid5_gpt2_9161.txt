The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' - which includes interviews with women, fathers and cohabiting couples - seems to be the kind of personal "/dev/hazard" he might have been.

'I never knew this kind of thing and I didn't know what kind of person I wanted to be,' Mr Simeon says.

'I had been raised in this group and my understanding of what women are actually like was at a young age.

'Even my older siblings don't know what a woman is, it's not like it was something that had to be seen as an obvious trait.

'My mother was very worried about my mother's safety - even if she was in a job interview she thought she might try to steal someone's car.

'I thought about the possibility of being murdered, and even though this was never that far from my childhood, I was never really aware of how much danger a man would have me be to my family.

'I used to feel terrified and I always considered this man something of an outcast. But now that I am here, it is back to normal. I've come to realise that if I go out and feel comfortable in society, I should just trust that I am loved.'

In recent interviews Mr Simeon says his mother told him that she would kill the man that came to her and so the couple had to keep silent.
