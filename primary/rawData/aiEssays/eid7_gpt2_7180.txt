An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my dad. I was with him for two or three days, after we spent a good deal of time together and just the one week before Christmas, he told me how it was going, and now I was sitting on his knee watching him, but I saw him like that on TV with my brother, and my sister, who was sitting on the other side, my brother is the only one there, and this was his last year as an ambassador. I was sitting on that knee, and he was just so happy. He called me at once, and I just said: I'll be on the sofa next to you. And I looked at all the wonderful, beautiful men, there were just six or seven.

I really have never seen that much from you, which is why I think you're just wonderful. But you would say that I really loved you as a child, and you would say you loved me. A little bit because you were very gentle as a child, and I would say that at least with a little bit more of a touch the touch was very comforting, it was comforting.

You have one question â€“ is there any other questions you wished to ask that you could go back over to my wife and I'll let you know.
