I recently had an experience that really showed me the power of patience. I was working on an important project at work and I was getting frustrated with my progress. I had been putting in long hours for weeks on end and in some cases, it felt like I wasn't making any headway. 

Then one day, I got a call from my boss telling me that he had noticed the effort I was putting in and that he knew I was starting to get a bit discouraged. He offered to take me out for lunch. 

That lunch turned out to be more than just a burger and fries. Over lunch he explained to me why patience is such an important part of getting things done. He told me that taking the time to do things right was more important than doing them quickly. 

He also pointed out that even though I was frustrated that I wasn't seeing success right away, I was still making progress and because I had stayed patient and kept putting in the effort, I was sure to succeed in the long run. 

That was a great reminder for me and it really helped me to stay patient and keep plugging away at the project. Sure enough, I eventually saw success and am so thankful that I kept my patience and pulled through.
