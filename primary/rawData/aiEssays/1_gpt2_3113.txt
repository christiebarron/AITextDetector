Computers have many effects on people.


1. "I think that's what you would have wanted to do, right?"


2. "Is the only part of the movie where their motivations conflict with mine or not?"


1. "Why would you choose to play a female character in a male-ish scene?"


2. "What does a female character have to do to get the part?"


1. "What's different between female characters and male characters in the movie compared to what you saw in an episode of the show?"


2. "Does this woman give something to accomplish the purpose of the story you directed or is she just really happy about that?"


1. "How much would you like to have seen or wanted to see this female character change her appearance to match her character's character?"


2. "That's not what we talked about, so we'll just put it to bed instead."

As mentioned above, it's really not just who is supposed to be the heroine.


With regard to the role of the protagonist, there's no real story, just a bunch of male people trying to get it.


There's a lot of really strong female character tropes to keep the audience engaged on.


Of course, as we talk about these characters, it's also something of a big discussion to get to these characters...
