It is an undeniable truth that libraries are a place of refuge, providing a safe haven for the curious mind to explore and learn. Therefore, the debate leading to whether material such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be censored in a library, is one that has been making headlines lately. 

What most people fail to understand is that censorship in libraries is more than just the prevention of morally corrupt material. Censorship can be used to foster love and understanding, free from judgement of our various opinions and views. By censoring certain materials, libraries can help us to gain new perspectives, and allow us to open our minds to respect and appreciation for different beliefs. 

Censorship in libraries can also be a way of protecting the younger generations, from having direct access to explicit material that may harm them. Instead of censoring materials to exclude ideas, libraries can use censorship to control the age range of materials available. Therefore, materials should only be removed when they contain explicit or offensive materials, and not simply because they are seen as being controversial.  

In conclusion, the debate over censorship in libraries should not be so strongly guided by the idea of complete exclusion, for it can be used as a way to educate, foster understanding, and protect the younger generations. Censorship should be viewed as a tool to help us to explore new ideas, while still respecting and understanding each otherâ€™s beliefs.
