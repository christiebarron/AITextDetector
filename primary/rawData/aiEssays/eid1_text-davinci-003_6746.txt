Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people in today's society. Over the last several decades, technology has become an increasingly important part of our lives. Computers are used for a wide range of tasks, from managing finances to playing video games. However, there is a growing concern about the impact that computers have on individuals.

I believe that computers can have a positive effect on people, as they provide us with access to a wealth of information. They also make our lives easier by making mundane tasks more efficient, such as managing accounts or booking holidays. Additionally, computers allow us to stay connected with friends and family all over the globe.

On the other hand, computers can also have a negative impact on people. Excessive use of computers can lead to physical and mental health issues such as obesity, depression, and strained eyesight. Some people become so engrossed in the world of computers that they can become socially isolated from the real world. 

Overall, I think that computers are a powerful tool that can enhance our lives, but the key is to use them in moderation. It is important that people understand the positive and negative effects of computers and use them responsibly.

Yours sincerely,

[Your Name]
