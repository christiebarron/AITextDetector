The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is one of melancholy.

He recalls that in the early stages he and his wife found themselves separated from their father.

'The relationship with my wife felt so broken and lonely, it was so unending, and all that he could control was me and my father.'

At his last address after his suicide to hundreds of fans back in 2009, Hallett told of how his feelings and his grief were shared.

He said: 'I had no place to go. I don't think of the pain of having a family and no money with me. I could have slept with no one at all, and I guess the other days, there would be no one, but we'd be together. But they were never one at all.'
