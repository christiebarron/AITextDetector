Dear Editor,

As the ubiquity of computers continues to increase, it is important to consider the effects they have on our society. There is little doubt computer technology has enhanced our quality of life in innumerable ways, but it is also a fact that they have potential downsides.

On the upside, computers provide access to an unlimited supply of information which, in turn, allows us to stay informed and make better decisions. It is also true that computers offer users countless ways to stay connected, while helping to facilitate efficient communication.

On the downside, computer technology can have a negative influence on people's attention span and ability to concentrate. It is not uncommon for people to become so absorbed in their computers that they lose all sense of time and forget their place in the physical world. Furthermore, users are presented with a multitude of potential distractions, such as online games, chat rooms, and streaming videos, which can lead to procrastination and reduced productivity.

In conclusion, computers are here to stay, and I believe we should all strive for balance in how we use them, taking full advantage of the amazing technology, while also limiting our time using them in order to stay sane and focused. 

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
