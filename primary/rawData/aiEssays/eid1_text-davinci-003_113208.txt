Dear [Newspaper],

I write to you today to express my opinion on the effect computers have on people. In a world that is increasingly digitized and interconnected, the use of computers has an undeniable effect on our personal and professional lives.

I personally believe that computers positively impact people in many ways. For example, technology has made it much easier for individuals and groups to communicate and collaborate with one another from different locations. Our reliance on computers opens up an entirely new realm of possibilities for entrepreneurs and professionals, leading to greater creativity, productivity, and efficiency in the work place. Computers also provide entertainment and education opportunities for people of all ages. In today's fast-paced world, computers allow students to take classes online, stay on top of their assignments, and even connect with online tutors to assist them with their studies.

Despite these clear advantages, there are some who argue that computers have a detrimental effect on people, leading to sedentary lifestyles and little social interaction. I strongly disagree with this sentiment. Computers are not creating these outcomes, but instead are providing people with an easy tool to access and stay connected with one another.

I hope this letter inspires readers to consider the benefits of computer technology and its positive impact on our society. While computers are not meant to replace traditional methods of socialization, they can be incredibly useful tools if used responsibly.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
