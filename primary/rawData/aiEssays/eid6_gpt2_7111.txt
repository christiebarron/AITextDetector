The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first was the difficulty of moving dirigibles away from them. If an obstacle like a ceiling block was placed along one wall, all the others would fall out. This was particularly awkward to builders trying to take a look at towers from the back and make sense of what would cause it.

Another problem was having to hold on to the ceiling and adjust the angle. For example, in the original version of Empire, the ceiling on the Empire State Building was tilted right (the only reason it did this was because the second side of the building was tilted right). In 2152, however, the angle to the left was adjusted after all the other angles remained. It got even better in 3202 and the ceilings adjusted slightly.

For the Empire State Building, the 3.0 level on the roof had to be adjusted for better angles so that the first and second stories of the tower would also be tilted. The angle of the 3.0 level on the roof was also lowered when the roof was completely in position.

So what has been accomplished so far?

So far, we know an Empire State Building has at least five major staircases (with four that are directly under) in the building that have been constructed to accommodate dirigibles. The first was done on the second floor. The second and third floors all had doors that were to be rotated in and out
