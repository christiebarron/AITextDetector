I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is necessary, but in practice it can be difficult and time consuming."

One of the most notable changes to the rules, said Robert Woodhead, senior staff attorney in New York at Rankings Research, is the fact that the library could use a system to identify the "best practices" they know about.

This year the New York Library Association will meet this summer on their annual meeting. But Woodhead said that is only a start.

"We still haven't seen what those techniques might be based on (the proposed changes). It's still a work in progress," Woodhead said.

Woodhead also said that the library could transferring library records of books to an e-mail address that is registered to someone with access to public records laws, not a private one.
