 

Dear Editor,

I recently read an article in your newspaper about how computers are having a significant effect on people’s lives. Although the article discussed primarily the positive aspects of computers, I am concerned with the potential effects which computers may have on people’s physical and emotional health.

The convenience of computers does not come without certain risks, especially if used improperly. The hundreds of hours spent staring at a computer screen can cause serious eye strain and neck pain. Furthermore, prolonged time spent on computers can lead to isolation, hindering the ability to forge meaningful relationships. It can also lead to an obsession with one’s online activities, which can steal much needed time away from work and family. 

Despite the potential detriments, computers can be a useful tool when used properly. In fact, technology has greatly improved workplace efficiency and communication. It can also provide a reliable source of information. But it should always be kept in balance with time spent with people.

Therefore, I urge readers of your newspaper to remain conscious of the pros and cons of computers and to strive for balance in their life. Increased recognition of the potential risks of computers will help to ensure that people never rely too heavily on the technology.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
