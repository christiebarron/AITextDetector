The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' has been a refreshingly unapologetic look intoaugual life of an outsider.

The book makes a point to acknowledge that all this is, of course, just the beginning. It tells of a group of people (the book opens with the description of three men and three women) who became estranged as teenagers from their parents. It is the first time, from physics and biology, that anyone has put as much thought to a single idea and seen so many variations on it, or done it in such the wrong way, that they have really come to believe that a new idea is possible, and just happens to have such some nice facts to back the theory.

What is amazing about this novel of such a large scope is that its most striking moments (and perhaps most interesting moments) are ones that will not be forgotten or overlooked. A new way of thinking around science could, in a way, make sense of all the ideas about these things (see: why we think that Earth is round). And that's the point of the book. This was a book of great insight and insight.
