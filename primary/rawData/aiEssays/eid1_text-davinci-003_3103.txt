Dear Editor,

As technology advances, computers are becoming an important part of our daily lives. However, is this necessarily a positive thing? 

It is true that computers can make many tasks easier. With a few clicks, someone can find almost any information they need. As a result, people are becoming less dependent on libraries and other physical forms of information. 

However, computers can also have a negative effect on people. When people spend too much time playing computer games, interacting on social media, and watching videos online, they are not engaging in real-world tasks or developing real-world skills. They are also at greater risk of developing an addiction to computer use, resulting in a lack of other hobbies, personal connections, and physical activity. 

There are both positive and negative effects to using computers. It is critical that we understand the potential dangers of using computers to inform our decisions and make sure that the experience of using computers does not become detrimental to our mental and physical health. 

Thank you for taking the time to consider my opinion.

Sincerely, 
[YourName]
