The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' by the artist Peter Galt (Nelly and the River) and his wife, Claire ------- the singer, is the first time anyone has gone to the music and video world and heard its music of the 1950s and 1960s.

Galt spoke out as a regular speaker and featured on 'From Home is'.

In 'From Home is', Galt explained the songs he likes and dislikes about the era.

"It's pretty surreal to hear the new pop music that's coming out every year," he said.

"All the songs that are being offered are, as I know you already knew, being sung like the Beatles.

"And so it is important to me when you see me playing these songs that you know about one or two elements in my life.

"You might see me being asked about how I like to play a guitar and to what song it's playing in which position or whatever I'm doing next week.

"And to give people some sort of appreciation of the music and its potential and being able to say that they have something they love.

"It's all about the music that's at that moment or at that time and what we're hoping will be the future where we live at least," he added.
