When my partner and I first met, we were both a bit nervous and awkward. Being in a new, unfamiliar relationship can be difficult, but we both managed to find moments of joy.

One evening, we were in our favorite restaurant getting dinner. It had been an especially stressful few days and we both wanted to just relax. As we were getting ready to leave, my partner asked me to tell him a joke. I was thrown off by the request, but I managed to come up with a silly, corny one. We both laughed at the joke and then just started giggling uncontrollably at how silly we were being. We couldnâ€™t stop laughing for a few minutes, which felt like a release after a stressful couple of days.

I remember that moment really fondly now because it was such a unique way for us to connect with each other. Through laughter, we were able to show each other that despite being in a new relationship, we both felt safe and happy.

Laughter has become a way for us to connect in our relationship. It serves as a reminder that even when things get tough, we can always turn to humour and laughter to make each other feel a little bit better.
