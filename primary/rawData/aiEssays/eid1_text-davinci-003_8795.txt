I was out with my best friend on one of our monthly outings when we decided to grab a bite to eat. We sat at a restaurant booth and I ordered us a plate of garlic toasted bread. Before it arrived, he started to tell me a funny story about something that recently happened to him. The more he spoke, the more I was caught up in his tale.

Before I knew it, I was laughing so hard that tears were streaming down my faces. I knew I had to stop laughing, but I just couldn't help myself. The more I tried the harder it was to stifle my laughter which just made it worse. 

My friend, not wanting to be left out of the joke, started to join in. Soon enough we were both laughing so hard that we were attracting the attention of the other restaurant-goers. They were all staring at us, trying to figure out what we found so amusing.

This only made us laugh harder and before we knew it, the entire restaurant was in hysterics. I had never laughed so much before in my life, and it felt so good! After our little scene of impromptu comedy, we sobered up and enjoyed our garlic toasted bread. Lingering laughter filled our conversations throughout the rest of the meal. 

Whenever I think back to that night, it always brings a smile to my face. That was the night that I shared the best laugh with my best friend,
