I was visiting my family over the holidays, and this was a particularly hectic year with many of us crammed in together that the kitchen was always messy. Everywhere I looked there were bowls and dishes spread out on every surface and the counter was piled with groceries that had yet to be put away. Despite all the chaos, my mum was incredibly patient throughout.

Even when it seemed like the mess might never get cleaned up, my mum's patience never faded. Any time one of us expressed our frustration with the mess, she remained level-headed. After a few days gradually all of the cluttered surfaces were eventually cleared and everything was back to normal. 

In that moment, I was so impressed with my mother's patience in the face of all the chaos. She showed me that it's important to remain calm even when it feels like a situation is out of our control.
