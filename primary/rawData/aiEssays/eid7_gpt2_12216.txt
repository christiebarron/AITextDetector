An example of a time someone in my life was patient was sitting on the edge of a bed, and my mother was sitting on the floor and my best friend was sitting next to her and my best friend was sitting beside her, and it was a beautiful photo taken on Wednesday of two kids sitting inside a sleeping body. I asked that somebody see my sister again and that was it. She said: Oh my God, you're okay! (Mums and Dad)

"You shouldn't even want to take those photos, right?" My mom raised an eyebrow.

"I'm not supposed to do that to you. I'm not supposed to do that to you! You're not supposed to take those pictures! It's okay to have good people try to take those photos!"

"Well, let me see the thing. My mom always would be upset with just about anything, just a child. She's a very gentle type of person, and if she's not in your life, that would probably be bad. That person would get more upset about you being upset about them. I don't know that she would get the idea, but at least she's fine."

The dad went on to remind me that I was always one of the best people he knew and that I could always stay in contact with more wonderful people just by being with my dad and listening to him.

"Well what about, are you looking out for your loved ones?
