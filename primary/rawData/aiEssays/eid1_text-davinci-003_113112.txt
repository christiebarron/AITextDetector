Dear Editor,

In today’s world, computers have become an integral part of our life. Some argue that computers have had a positive effect on people’s lives due to their convenience and ability to provide access to a seemingly endless array of knowledge and opportunity. While this is true, I strongly believe that the effects of computers on people are overwhelmingly negative.

From an individual level, computers can lead to physical and mental health issues such as obesity, carpal tunnel syndrome, and vision impairment. Sitting for long periods of time in front of a computer screen releases stress hormones such as adrenaline, which can lead to anxiety and chronic fatigue. Also, constant internet use has been linked to poor focus and attention span.

Additionally, computers have had a tremendous impact on social engagement. Excessive computer use can lead to real-life isolation, as online users tend to spend more and more time in front of their computer screens, thereby reducing interaction with family and friends. Furthermore, cyberattacks, trolling, and hacking have become increasingly commonplace on the internet, eroding people’s sense of digital security.

Therefore, it is clear that computers have had a largely negative effect on society. I urge readers to consider the potential risks associated with computer use and to use them in moderation, if at all.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
