Dear Editor,

I'm writing to express my opinion about the effects computers have on people.

The advent of computers has profoundly altered our lives for the better. They have enabled us to increase our productivity, gain information more quickly, and stay connected around the globe.

At the same time, however, digital technology carries certain risks. Computers can negatively affect physical health, mental wellbeing, relationships, and productivity. Research shows that overuse of technology can have a negative impact on usersâ€™ physical and mental health. Extended sedentary periods are associated with health risks such as obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. Excessive computer use has also been linked to depression, anxiety, and sleep deprivation. Furthermore, social media can contribute to feelings of loneliness, depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem.

That said, it is possible to enjoy the benefits of computers without overindulging in them. A balanced approach can help us reap the advantages while mitigating associated risks. Parents can set healthy examples for their children by refraining from using screens too often themselves. We should also make time to engage in regular physical activity and enjoy spending quality time with our families.

In conclusion, computers can be beneficial
