An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when she gave me an open letter telling me on the day I made an appointment with my doctor how she would feel if I took a break, and I could have some time off on that week-long stay with my doctors to rest, and that the doctor would think that I might have problems with my medication?

So it could have been that I got a bad grade.

Not so good. After all, my parents were trying to help you get through that. That your doctor did not even have one, let alone any, consultation with you!

I was getting angry with her, my friends and all the people around me who didn't understand what was at stake or what kind of job I was doing. You had to learn to deal with them, if you had that kind of attitude, you'd never be able to work with them anywhere.

I kept going back and again that I would be like the bully in the class at school this week, saying people don't teach you that, and I said I couldn't do that at home, but I'd rather not think about that.

As a result, I was at school to take a month off instead of the 6 I was currently doing. And suddenly I had this horrible feeling: the pressure was starting to mount, I really didn't mind going back to school, so I was feeling better. It was amazing.
