The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Several federal agencies Charged With Helping Build Your Own Building, as well as Federal Aviation Administration and Department of Defense, had been charged with supporting the projects. The federal government was also embroiled in a long legal controversy. In August, 1954, the United States Supreme Court struck down federal law prohibiting the use of dirigibles in a public school. Federal employees who worked on the dirigibles were ordered by Congress to refrain from using them. But that year, the Supreme Court finally ruled in an appeals court that they were government property.


In April, 1956, the Department of Defense sued the Department of Commerce for $1.5 million, accusing the U.S. government of trying to use dirigibles to house the military. That same year, in June, 1955, the National Academy of Sciences sued the Department of Defense for $1 billion over a letter it produced to the Bureau of Land Management asking for support during an official visit. Some of the letters sought to use the dirigibles as a "living example" of the value of the "U.S. Navy." On May 24, 1954, the Federal Housing Administration finally decided to block the use of the dirigibles for a public school. According to The Chronicle Of The Life of Thomas Edison, there would be no further use of the dirigibles for school use until the Department of Education began testing dirigibles
