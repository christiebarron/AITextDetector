An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a person who had developed Alzheimer's disease who was treated with oral therapy – an effective approach which he could start to use to prevent any possible symptoms of the disease. He had taken some doses and had gone into remission.

In one follow-up study, the drug was significantly more effective compared with normal oral therapy. The drug's effect on the disease was similar to those of conventional treatment, but its effects were reduced by two hours after discontinuing regular treatment. This is consistent with results from the drug studies.

In the second study, a similar group of patients with advanced Alzheimer's, who had given oral treatment twice a year for 6 months, reported a shorter-lasting anti-depressant, and had no such adverse effects on their lives. For a Systematic Reviewer/Editor's note, researchers looked at 648,069 patients who had received placebo injections during 2013 or later, and found that about 75% of them did not respond to placebo on their own, and that the median age of diagnosis of Alzheimer's was 18 months …

The number of patients with these adverse effects – the number who were not getting all the drugs combined with the placebo effect to increase the likelihood of their disease worsening – came in close to the same area as the number of patients who were not getting the other drugs to increase life expectancy, as it had long been known. I suspect that even if we extrapolate
