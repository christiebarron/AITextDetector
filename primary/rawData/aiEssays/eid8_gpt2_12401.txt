One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I lived in England. People ask me what I do when I go into the pub with me – I would say 'loud laughter'. When it was at the pub all of a sudden people will be saying'mum, what is it you are laughing at?','mum,'' which is hilarious.

I don't use my favourite drinks and have been drinking all day by myself. I have a great pub with no customers and no line up – it's not for everyone. But it's certainly not where I live where people will ask me 'when you go out there'

Is it OK if people call to say 'loud laughter'?

No. There is some misunderstanding about this. It's not just me doing the laughing. It's people saying there is a joke. People need to understand they are laughing at everyone. I have always enjoyed life, I always had a great life, a great family, a wonderful life – it was a very nice and lovely home as well as a wonderful country. There is no misunderstanding whatsoever. I have always maintained I have given a great life, I love my wife and children, there is a genuine and sincere family and a great family and a family I am proud of to that point.

I have always felt happy and fulfilled when I have been involved in life and in the business. I want to be better and have a better life. However
