One day, I was riding the bus home from an afternoon of running errands. It had been a busy day, and I was tired. As I settled into my seat, I noticed an elderly woman making her way down the aisle, struggling to find an open seat. I immediately stood up and offered my seat to her, and she accepted.

This elderly woman had several shopping bags with her, and it looked like she was carrying a very heavy load. She thanked me as she made her way to the seat.

Once settled, I watched as the elderly woman took out some of her items from her bag and began to organize them. To my surprise, she pulled out a rather large, heavy-looking book. As she was getting ready to read, I could see that she was having difficulty holding the book up with just one hand.

So, despite my fatigue, I patiently waited while she arranged her book and belongings. After a few minutes, she smiled and thanked me again for being so patient. I smiled back and watched as her face lit up with joy while she started her reading journey.

I learned that day that patience can go a long way - not only in providing comfort to other people but also in providing a sense of calm to ourselves.
