The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho allows the reader to draw a parallel between the protagonist and the hibiscus they thought of as a metaphor. Throughout the story, the protagonist strives for success in school, but feels overwhelmed and unprepared due to the constant pressures that come along with academic achievement. This overwhelmed feeling is reflected in the seemingly fragile hibiscus, which appears to be wilting and struggling to survive the cold winter. By ending this way, it implies that the protagonistâ€™s academic struggles can be overcome, conveyed in the idea that when the spring comes and the hibiscus blossoms, they will be able to try again and achieve success. The metaphor encapsulates the way that seasons come and go, but nature still changes, and we too have the capacity to grow and learn over time.
