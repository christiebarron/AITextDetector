The Empire State Building was, and still is, one of the most iconic structures in the world. Its builders’ ambition was to go beyond the traditional limits of the time and push boundaries to a new level. One of the most impressive feats of engineering was the installation of the mooring mast on the building’s 103rd and topmost floor. This mast was designed to allow dirigibles, or airships, to dock at the building and make it the world’s first aerial port of call. However, this vision was faced with numerous obstacles.

The most obvious obstacle was the limited space at the top of the Empire State Building. The mooring mast had to be designed such that it could fit the extra room, and yet still be strong enough to hold a dirigible. Additionally, the airships at the time featured an unpredictable design, making it difficult to identify how strong the mast needed to be. Engineers had to consider the ever-changing wind patterns ontop of the 102 stories of the building and how to safely and securely dock a dirigible.

Another factor to take into account was the powerful downdraft of an airship. The original mooring mast was only successful once a breakthrough idea of using a wire and wheel system was made. This system allowed the mast to guide the airship down the cable so it never had to deal with the extreme downdraft. The complexity of this innovation was compounded by the
