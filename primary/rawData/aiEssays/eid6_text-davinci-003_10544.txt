The Empire State Building, as one of the most iconic buildings in history, faced many challenges in its construction, one of the most ambitious of which was creating a docking station for dirigibles. This was an important feat as dirigibles were the main form of transportation when the building was completed. Despite the difficult nature of the task, the builders of the Empire State Building were determined to create a structure that could safely facilitate the docking of dirigibles atop the building.

The first obstacle the builders faced when constructing the mooring mast was ensuring that the structure would be able to support the weight of an airship. This was a difficult undertaking, as a mooring mast must have a robust, secure foundation as well as a wind-resistant frame. Additionally, a mooring mast must be fit for both ground and upper level docking due to the size and weight of the ships. In order to achieve this, the Empire State Building was designed with two mASTs. The first mAST was located at the center of the building's base and was made of steel beams. The second mAST was located at the top of the building and was designed with a steel lattice.

The second obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced when constructing the mooring mast was maneuvering the dirigible into a safe landing. To do this, the empire state building was designed with an electrically powered elevator which could move the mASTs up and
