I remember one time when I was about 8-years-old and it was the first time I started learning how to play the piano. I was so excited, but it was also a daunting task since I had no music background and knew nothing about notes.

My teacher, on the other hand, was so patient with me. He didn't mind having to repeat the same instructions several times over, or that I made a lot of mistakes. He was so consistent with me, never giving up, even when I was discouraged and wanted to quit.

He spent countless days helping me understand what I was supposed to do and slowly, I started getting the hang of it. Every time I made a mistake, he didn't scold me but rather encouraged me to keep trying until I got it right.

His patience really helped me to stay determined and he eventually became one of my mentors. Since then, piano has been an important part of my life and I couldn't be more thankful for my teacher's patience.
