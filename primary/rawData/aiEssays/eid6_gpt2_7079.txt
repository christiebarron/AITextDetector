The world looks a little different today than it wasAttack on Titan and the World War II bomber. As the aircraft's manufacturer, Boeing, and as a result of its involvement in the war, U.S. aircraft carriers had become one of the few things that would be considered reliable after the war ended. There is still a great deal of uncertainty about their function, efficiency and safety at the time, though. After the war, the carriers became more of a target for enemy aerial attacks, though for most of them they have been relatively undetected. While the government of the day had its
