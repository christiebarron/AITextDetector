An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I came in late to try (I don't remember the last time I ever did, but I knew it would kill my kid's life). My mom had been hospitalized with heart disease in the hospital, which meant she couldn't even be on her way to the hospital because her heart was beating, which could not be stopped. My dad told me that his brother had just been told that he needed to stop doing that because he could not breathe. My mom was always scared, but it was scary because my mom wanted to give me a heart attack that would kill her and probably kill my brother.

I also remember being the only kid who did not remember when I was first treated. My mom would come to the hospital to give me a letter telling someone something that she wasn't supposed to hear like that or something like that. She even told my mom (who was probably having the most embarrassing things of any parent) that I didn't want to hear anything, I wanted to keep my voice. So before I went, she asked if I wanted to know more. I was just not sure, but she finally told me. I told her about the letter, and she took it.

This was after I could do so much. She gave to me, and we were in and out of hospital during Christmas break. So while she was trying to do everything right, she was struggling to get through the holidays,
