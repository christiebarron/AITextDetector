The task of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was a daunting one, and the builders of the building faced many obstacles on this ambitious project. 

The most significant obstacle the builders had to tackle was finding a reliable mast structure that would be strong enough to carry the weight of a loaded zeppelin and not sway in the moderate to strong winds. According to Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted's article, 'The Mooring Mast', the mooring mast for the Empire State Building had to be twice as strong as the average structure of that type. This meant finding steel supports sturdy enough to hold the load and powerful winds, as well as an anchor that could safely secure the dirigible, just like a boat in a harbor. 

Another obstacle the builders faced was the scarcity and cost of the materials required for construction. The steel frames, anchor, and other components of the mast had to be fabricated and standardized, and this was difficult due to the lack of factories producing these rare items. Additionally, those materials that were available were often very expensive, making the construction of such a mast even more complex.

Finally, the engineering and design of the mast was quite difficult in and of itself. It had to be designed in such a way that the winds could be deflected so as not to cause destabilization to the dirigible. Additionally, it had to be constructed in a way that the steel would not buckle under the weight of a
