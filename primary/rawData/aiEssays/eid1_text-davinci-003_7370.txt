In Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead”, the cyclist is faced with a variety of features of the setting that affect him in different ways. 

The physical environment of the setting can be seen to imposingly shape the cyclist’s experience of the road. The vast flatness of the terrain makes the route seem endless, heightening the difficulty of the journey for the cyclist. The desolate, open country emphasizes the grueling task the cyclist has set out to accomplish, and the long, straight road has the potential to become monotonous over the time it takes to cover such distance. Yet, despite this potential, the cyclist is able to stay focused on his goal, seeing his efforts as a “test of strength.’

The potential for danger as a result of the environmental conditions presents a further challenge for the cyclist, forcing him to stay alert and cautious. The abundance of cyclists on the roads makes for a congested and unsteady route, and the potential for accidents due to the high speed of the vehicles on the road creates an environment of heightened risk. The cyclist is aware of this risk and makes attempts to stay safe, such as avoiding contact with cars experimenting with the limits of their velocity, yet the environment still presents a lurking threat.

The setting of Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead” serves to test and challenge the cyclist in a variety of ways.
