Dear Editor,

Since computers have changed the way we live, work, entertain, and communicate, my opinion is that their effects on people are far-reaching and positive.

With a computer, people can stay connected to friends and family in any part of the world. They can access educational materials and even take classes to further their knowledge. Computers provide untold advantages to business, enabling efficiency, organization and cost savings. They make communication faster and easier, allowing people to instantly access information and products from all over the globe.

Not only that, but computers allow for the development of new innovations that benefit us all. There are countless examples of resources that didn't exist before computers, such as wikis, blogs, podcasts, social networks, video-conferencing and other widely-used digital tools. Computers empower people to forge relationships, enter industries, and explore new worlds with ease and speed.

Modern technology has also improved the safety of our homes, communities, and workplaces. Through energy-saving appliances, homes can be better insulated to reduce costs, while businesses use sophisticated firewalls to protect customer data. In addition, many industries leverage computers to plan and coordinate emergency response teams.

Finally, computers provide new job opportunities that were never possible before. Technology has become such an integral part of our daily lives that it is nearly impossible to find an industry that isnâ€™t looking for computer professionals in some capacity.

Thus,
