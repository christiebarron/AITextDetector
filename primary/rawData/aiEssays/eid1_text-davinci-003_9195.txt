Dear Editor, 

As technology evolves, the role of computers in our lives becomes ever more prominent. I believe computers have had mostly positive effects on people and society should take note of these effects.

Computers have made access to information more simple and convenient than ever before. With just a few clicks, you can access all kinds of information, from current events to research, without having to leave the comfort of your home. The technology has also enabled people to better communicate with each other and collaborate on tasks.

Computers have also made many tasks faster and easier. To illustrate, imagine if all businesses worked with pen and paper and archaic machines from the past century. Now, most day-to-day operations ranging from payroll to customer communications, are computerized and made much more efficient. Computers allow us to improve productivity and efficiency, and get more done in a shorter time.

Finally, computers have helped to make the world a more connected place. People can work together towards a common goal, no matter the geographical distance. The technology has enabled us to bridge cultural divides and create a powerful platform for collaboration.

In conclusion, I believe that computers have had mostly positive effects on people and should be embraced as part of society. Without them, progress would be much slower.

Sincerely,
