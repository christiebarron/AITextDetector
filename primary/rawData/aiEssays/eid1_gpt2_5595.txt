Computers have many effects on people. It's easy to get caught up in a situation where you are on a computer and you don't have a password," says Dr. Robertutsche. He does, however, understand that people do suffer from certain types of brain injury.

"There's a lot of evidence in case study about the possible link between brain injuries and cognitive impairment, and I can tell you these are very complex and we need to be more sensitive to them," Dr. Werfel explains. "However, there's also clear evidence, very strong support in our scientific literature, that people who don't have strong protective barriers, can reduce their risk of developing cognitive impairment."

Cognitive impairment is more common in non-white people.WPY and Dr. Werfel argue that if there is a strong protective factor for certain people, such as parents, it can prevent their children from taking that step too much.

However, some studies in older populations (particularly younger ones) show that it can lead to increased risk of cognitive impairment. If people who have children who have similar intelligence (often on a spectrum from about six points to more than 20 points in intelligence) have higher cognitive limitations, the risk of cognitive impairment can increase.

"If an older person is on the same intelligence, their risk of brain death decreases while they get older so with a stronger protective factor, they end up with less risk of death," Dr. Werfel
