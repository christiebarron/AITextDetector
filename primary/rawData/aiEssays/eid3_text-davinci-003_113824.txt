In Joe Kurmaski’s poem, “Rough Road Ahead,” the cyclist is presented with a challenging landscape and terrain of a road that is difficult to navigate. The setting of the poem has a great impact on how the cyclist experiences this difficult road, and on how he chooses to traverse it. 

The features of the setting that affect the cyclist are described in vivid detail. Kurmaski creates a vivid picture of a road that is “an erratic serpent/ Of tar stippled with stretches of frost-bitten/ Gravel, bumps, mud patches, and splintered branches.” He also uses vivid imagery to describe the weather and climate of the setting, noting the directions “that [the cyclist] will be exposed/ To the driven snowflakes/ The swirling flashes of hail.” 

These features of the setting give the poem a sense of reality, and create a greater possibility for the cyclist to be affected by it. The rough terrain makes each step of the cyclist’s journey more difficult and exhausting than it would be on smooth pavement. The cold temperature and blasts of snow, hail and wind send an ever-present chill throughout the cyclist’s body, adding an extra layer of difficulty to his cold, long ride. The splintered branches and sharp objects in the road have the potential to slow the cyclist down and increase the likelihood of an accident.
