The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. As a result, they decided to make a series of new dirigibles, one that could be mounted on the underside of a steel pole using a crane. The only problem was that it didn't have the highest crane speed.

Instead, this model became the basis for the Empire State Building's most popular design concept (the 'double-circled 'bicycle'). It is also the model that has been used to illustrate a view of the Empire State Building from a 360 degree perspective. According to a study done by the United Way of Pittsburgh, the Bikes for Everyone project had a diameter of 7,500 feet. After the project's completion, more than 20 Bikes for Everyone designers followed suit, including a dozen that had the final production ready for future use.

In the days since the original project, the Bikes for Everyone concept has become one of the premier projects from Pittsburgh. Since it began in 2007, over 100 Bikes for Everyone designer projects have been completed in the city. Most of the Bikes for Everything designs use traditional design principles, such as adding a rear axle, adding two wheels to the sides of the car, using an axles-mounted rear guard and a large wheelspin axle to provide extra weight. There are many ways that this model can be used. These include:
