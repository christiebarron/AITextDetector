Libraries are public collections of information that are supposed to offer resources, education, and entertainment for the public. Censorship in libraries is a touchy subject, as materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines have been found to be offensive. This has raised the debate of whether or not librarians should be allowed to remove these materials from the shelves. 

The main argument of those who support censorship is that libraries have a responsibility to provide materials that reflect the values and norms of their community. If materials are deemed to be offensive, they could potentially lead readers to form negative thoughts and behavior. As such, materials should be removed from library shelves if they are considered offensive. 

Those who oppose censorship believe that libraries should provide access to materials regardless of whether or not they are deemed offensive. Removing certain materials from library shelves is seen as a violation of freedom of speech, as this censors the opinions and ideas of authors. It also limits the opportunity for readers to access valuable information. 

In my opinion, libraries should not be so quick to censor their collections. Removing material solely because it is deemed offensive can result in readers not having access to valuable knowledge and information that can add to their understanding and appreciation of different ideas and opinions. Libraries should not be expected to censor from their own collections but should instead provide as much access to information and materials as possible. This could be achieved by providing warnings that certain materials may contain offensive content
