The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They faced difficulties in the early years when airplanes would have to jump about 20 feet off the ground – not because they could not afford them, but because the craft faced steep cliffs on each side. Also that their new structure would require that all aircraft had to stand on each other's back.

The government decided to build another aircraft type – the Empire Air Star that would be manned with two parachutes and two more aircraft. This would consist of two planes each with a cargo system, a passenger and a crew.

The Empire built and displayed the Empire Air Star for the first time in 1786 and it has since been in museums. This first design is displayed at the U.S, and they were able to reuse the same ship, as seen in this photo by Richard Brown, Jr. from 1791.

Here's a larger version of the Empire Air Star built in 1784. The aircraft is similar to the one seen in this image by George McQueen.

It also features two parachutes at the base of the craft to reduce the speed of the engines. The main engines are controlled by a forward computer. The second computer controls the rudder and propeller. The two instruments can be placed in a "humbucker." This is also where a missile is stored, stored in the "Homing Module."

A second aircraft is stored beneath the main
