I will never forget the day my best friend and I tried to recreate a scene from the movie Bridesmaids. We had just watched it the night before and laughed so hard at the parts where the two main characters imitate flight attendants. The next day, we decided to play a prank on our coworkers by pretending to be flight attendants on our lunch break.

We got a bunch of props from home and rushed to the cafeteria in our “flight attendant” gear. We stopped at the entrance and gave a loud “Good afternoon, passengers!” Everyone stopped and just stared at us. After an awkward silence, my friend turned to me with a huge grin and said, “This is the part where we make the safety announcements.”

The room erupted into laughter. Everyone was amused and started clapping and cheering as we went around the room, making safety announcements and amusing ourselves and our coworkers. It felt so good to have laughter fill the room. We had made the long day feel a little bit lighter and brighter. 

This moment showed me the power of laughter. It was a reminder that humor is a great way to break the ice, connect with people, and bring joy to a serious situation. Laughter really is the shortest distance between two people.
