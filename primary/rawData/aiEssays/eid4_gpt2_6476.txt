The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it offers a good example of how to incorporate the concepts of humor in a different form during the story where both characters are aware of the theme of the book. If my example is from Winter Hibiscus, I might as well take Winter Hibiscus and the "Babies are in my house the next day" premise. I could also use something as in the middlecedented here as the book is simply more detailed and complex than it would be otherwise. Finally. What is your final reaction to reading this book? Would you agree that this work is one which is well worth the purchase?
