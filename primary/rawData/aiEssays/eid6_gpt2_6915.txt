The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. While the builders of the building had the right to build a "mirror-like" structure (as they did in the Statue of Liberty) they had to take certain steps away from the Statue of Liberty – the construction of the Empire State Building – to permit dirigibles to enter the building using an aircraft. A few of the dirigibles, however, would not be able to move. This allowed the Statue of Liberty to be blocked off so the builders who had the right to build a dirigible can build it. Unfortunately this meant that only the most enthusiastic pilots who used aircraft could fly. A few pilots even wanted to build a dirigible.

In addition to dirigibles and a few other tools to support flying, there was an alternative to the Air Force pilot, which was in and of itself an aircraft. A new aircraft was needed to support the pilots. This would take the form of a modified fighter jet. Its dimensions were relatively short for a fighter, and most pilots would choose a long (4 to 12 meters), flat wing nose. The larger, less maneuverable fighters were more maneuverable. Also, the fighter, in an attempt to counter the speed, would have to be powered only by the exhaust pipes on the tail fin. A short, heavy lift jet would give pilots the greatest protection from the speed fighters, as well as from aircraft that could make use of
