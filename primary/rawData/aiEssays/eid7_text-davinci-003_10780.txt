I was feeling really frustrated because I was stuck in traffic for longer than I had anticipated. I could feel my irritation mounting and I just wanted to get to my destination. Suddenly, it dawned on me that the traffic was inevitable and that I had to just accept it. Instead of getting worked up about it, I decided to make the best of the situation. I turned on the radio and found a good song to listen to. I also noticed that the other drivers around me who were stuck in the same jam were also patient and compliant. Seeing that, I was filled with a sense of calm and acceptance. I was able to remain patient and just listen to my music, knowing that the traffic would eventually clear.
