The designers of the Empire State Building faced the daunting challenge of allowing dirigibles, or “airships,” to dock upon the top of the structure. The challenge arrived as the airship industry grew in popularity following World War I, when it appeared likely that dirigibles could soon be encountered in the skies over New York City. Marcia Amidon Lüsted wrote in The Mooring Mast that, “The engineers and architects who designed the Empire State Building had to face the unique challenge of creating what was essentially a floating dock structure on top of one of the tallest buildings ever conceived.

The challenge of the designers was to repurpose the iconic building to accommodate a floating vehicle, and the risks associated with the endeavor were high. If the engineering problems were to be solved, then the airship would have to be able to latch onto the building via a mooring mast or cable mechanism. However, the height of mooring mast that was then available was nowhere near high enough to reach the top of the building, and achieving the necessary lift was seen as unrealistic. Furthermore, the frames of airships of the time would not have withstood the strong gusts of wind such a height presented.

The designers were ultimately able to meet this unique challenge by creating a new “docking mast,” a telescopic system that was designed to reach up to the top of the Empire State Building. The mast was made to hold
