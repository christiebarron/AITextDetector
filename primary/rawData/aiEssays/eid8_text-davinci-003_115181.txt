I sat across from my parents at the dinner table, scraping my fork against the plate as silence coated the room. My brother was noticeably absent again, and I knew something was wrong. I missed the sound of his laughter that usually filled the room, and I felt the silence between us stretching further and further. Finally, I decided to break it.

I told my parents something funny that had just happened to me at school that day and while they weren't particularly amused, they couldn't help but crack a smile. That was all all the encouragement I needed, and soon I was deep into a story of my own making, throwing out outrageous details and enough puns to make even the most stoic soul laugh. I let my words take us away and all four of us were soon roaring with uncontrollable laughter that sounded like a warm hug. 

Once the laughter died down it marked a turning point. The unspoken tension that had lingered in the room had left with it, and we each shared stories of our own, filled with many more gut-busting laughs. 

For the first time in weeks, the sound of my brother's laugh echoed around the room, and my heart was full. I had made the connection with them using the power of laughter, and it was strengthening the bond between us.
