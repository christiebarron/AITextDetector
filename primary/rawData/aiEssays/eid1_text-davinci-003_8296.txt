The building of the Empire State Building in New York City had an immense impact on the skyline of the city. Its iconic size and stature was a source of both national and international pride. One of the most interesting features of the Empire State Building was its ability to allow dirigibles to dock, with the first historic docking occurring in 1931. Yet, this remarkable feat of engineering accomplishment did not come without its own host of challenges and obstacles to be overcome. 

The first obstacle faced in making the Empire State Building conducive to dock dirigibles was the technological aspect of it. There were no other buildings of this kind in existence, so the designers had to come up with a whole new set of tools from scratch. They decided to outfit the building with a mooring mast, a structure specifically designed for docking large airships on the 102nd floor rooftop. This particular mast was unprecedented in its request, as it had to be of a structural soundness and sturdiness that could stand up to the strong winds and airships themselves. 

The second obstacle the designers had to overcome was the location of the mooring mast. The mast had to be placed on the very top of the building, which presented a physical challenge with few solutions. The mast had to be placed high enough that dirigibles could dock safely, as they needed to maintain a minimal profile and clear traffic in the event of an emergency landing, but at the same time not be so high
