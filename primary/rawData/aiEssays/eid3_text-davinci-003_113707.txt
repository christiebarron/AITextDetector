In the poem “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, the cyclist is described as “pushing pedal down,” which conveys the physical exertion it takes to navigate the winding roads of the setting. The rider is also “singing the solstice song”—a nod to the season of the story, and a momentary pause in the harsh journey, as they sing “to the moonlit night.” 

The rugged mountain terrain that is the setting for the poem speaks to the difficulty of the bicycle ride, both in the sense of the physical labor required to ride upon the terrain, as well as the dangers that may lurk.  The rider is navigating a road “lined with pines and brush” full of “boulders strewn” and “covered curves of dust.” Not only is the path hazardous, due to the items that dot the trail and could easily cause an accident, there is also the suggestion that the cyclist is not even certain where they are going. The winding roads of the setting make it easy to get lost, and the rider must navigate using the trail’s specific landmarks as guides, such as the “tree aglow in moonlight.”

The features of the setting serve not only as a physical and mental challenge for the cyclist, but they also serve as a metaphor for facing the unknown, taking risks
