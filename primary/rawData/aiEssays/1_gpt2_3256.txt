Computers have many effects on people. The brain and the body are connected simultaneously, through a number of different neurological processes:

Brain waves:

Gravity

Brain waves are transmitted either over the spinal or cerebral nerve in the lower back. In particular, the body has a very deep brain wave system that can be called a gravity wave: it is a wave that is transmitted to the brain when the body is moving in space. Also known as gravity waves, these are not gravity waves either.

Neurodynamics: and

Gravity waves happen when you try to push a weight into a new place through electromagnetism, a technology that uses magnetic signals to change the way the body reacts at various points in space. The body then attempts to react to these changes using physical force, often pushing the weight further down than required. So the body goes down to the earth's gravity wave.

You also have a big, noisy, and very strong wave called gravity wave, but that sounds like a bad idea. However, it is an important and powerful influence and for a small amount of time, all energy on Earth was very sensitive to it, and it was very clear that it was affecting human physiology, so you can be sensitive to it and you can be sensitive to some of it.

Gravity waves are really powerful because there are a lot of factors that shape the way this space, and the physics of space, can work
