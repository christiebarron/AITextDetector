When I was in the fourth grade, I was lucky enough to have a teacher who even more so than being invested in teaching was certainly invested in laughter. 

Mrs. Stewart was an older woman who taught us everything from reading and writing to making origami paper hats. She was always smiling and had an infectious laugh. 

One day in the middle of a lesson on fractions, the class was particularly rambunctious, and Mrs. Stewart noticed. She asked us what was making us so giddy and we told her we were excited for recess. Suddenly, Mrs. Stewart's face lit up and she made an announcement:

"We all have so much energy and happiness saved up, why don't we express it?" 

We all looked at each other in confusion until Mrs. Stewart walked to the center of our classroom, pulled out a portable speaker, and started to play a song. We were all amazed as she started to cut the rug in the middle of the room, singing the song at the top of her lungs. 

The classroom erupted in laughter as Mrs. Stewart grabbed us, one by one, to join her in a dance. All of our embarrassment was forgotten as we all joined in and laughed together. 

At the end of the song, Mrs. Stewart stopped and gave us a knowing grin. That was the day I learned that laughter truly is the best medicine.
