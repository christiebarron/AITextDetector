The building of the Empire State Building was an impressive feat of engineering, however the ambitious project posed challenges to the architects in allowing dirigibles to dock at the very top of the structure. According to Marcia Amidon Lüsted, author of 'The Mooring Mast', the planned docking area at the top of the skyscraper included the installation of a mast and tether. This was no easy task in itself, due to the size and weight of mooring masts and the complicated engineering that goes into supporting them on a structure of that size.

Another obstacle to the successful deployment of the mooring mast was that the Empire State Building didn’t offer a solid foundation on which to mount the mast. The sides of the building were curved and the roof was so wide that a traditional rectangular mast couldn’t be installed. The solution to this problem was to design a unique adaptor collar and build a continuous square frame that could fit over the curved corners of the building. This frame helped to spread the weight of the mooring mast over a larger area, allowing it to be securely bolted down.

A further obstacle was the mooring mechanism which was not available at the time. The mast had to be designed with a system of pulleys and cables that would slow the dirigible down and hold the ship in place while passengers disembarked. The State Department then approved an innovative design from the famous inventor Thomas Edison, which was inspired by
