I remember one night I was out with my best friend, Alex, at our local restaurant. We were talking and laughing and having a great time. Suddenly, right in the middle of one of our particularly hilarious stories, a loud laugh broke through the chatter of the restaurant.

At first I wasn't sure who it had come from, until I noticed the man sitting two tables over from us had bent over with laughter. He was bent so far forward he had to catch his breath before calming down.

Alex and I looked at each other and started laughing too. We couldn't help it; the man's laughter was so infectious. Pretty soon the whole restaurant was in stitches! Even though we didn't know the man, we couldn't help but feel connected to him and we couldn't stop laughing. 

The whole incident made me realize that laughter truly is the best way to connect with people. We may not have known that man, but because of that moment of laughter, we felt connected and it lifted both of our spirits.
