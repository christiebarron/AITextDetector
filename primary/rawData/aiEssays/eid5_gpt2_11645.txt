The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' and 'Culture in My Head' – also published by Nook, is all the more shocking when viewed from the perspective of a person who was an early advocate for mental health care systems like the AARP – where many sufferers, especially young people, struggled to come to terms with having suffered trauma and addiction for so long.

The book, narrated by writer/director James Harkin, reveals that he came into the AARP after graduating from the University of Virginia in 2010. He found support and guidance at a local family and health clinic in Virginia. "I felt like a part of someone else's world," he recalls.

Now, "from the beginning," he continues, "that I've grown up with was completely changed. The first thing I did was write a book about it. The second or third thing I did was tell my story with the kind of empathy I could have had at an early age. Those were the two biggest influences that led me to have such strong resistance. In terms of being a survivor and working in a profession that was heavily funded for mental health care (such as mental health care) I ended up being less of a survivor, less of the'man that does it' sort of man who is being held back as a result of that kind of abuse. I thought I was going to be able to support myself to do something and I wanted to try something again.
