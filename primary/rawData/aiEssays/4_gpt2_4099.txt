The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it's written in the first half of the 18th century, after the war, when a few of Britain's best poets turned the country's political scene on its head. The book tells, for the first time, what they actually thought after 1918.

You might wonder what the next book in the series might be. One suggestion, that's to be hoped.

The book takes place in the 1950s, when the USSR was fighting a war that no one in the public knew how to end:

But it was the Soviet military that began to realise that the Western world was now a more unpredictable place

In the year of the British surrender, the USSR and Europe were so determined to get involved with America, the US and Japan

They decided not to help. In 1949, Russia became a fully independent country

They set up a new constitution. The "New Russia" â€“ renamed after the late Soviet dictator, Nikita Khrushchev, who fought against the USSR for the rest of history and died last year

The book is about how Soviet troops had to adapt to the communist West and how they became better at fighting in the modern world through a new form of government

In a way, the Cold War ended
