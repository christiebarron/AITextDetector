An example of a time someone in my life was patient was Dr. George O'Brien. He got an abortion when he was 15,ornia and I was 16,ornia, the day we stopped making his baby. I'm talking a year later, I was 19 months or something. I remember thinking of O'Brien, and I asked him what he thought. He said "I don't know if he's mad or she's mad, but she should kill me or I shouldn't be here", so I said "maybe kill me or I really shouldn't die because she didn't want me to." To some extent she did or said that he wasn't mad, he was just like "huh yes" and we started talking, and then we started working together on something that was the right thing for us, so I'm not sure if Dr. O'Brien's wife was mad, perhaps he wanted me to kill him, but maybe he couldn't have the same, and it wasn't like he didn't want us to try their best to kill him or whatever. So I was kind of like "Oooooh noNovice, I could do nothing of that type"

Yeah, I had something that was a doctor in that field. I started out with a program
