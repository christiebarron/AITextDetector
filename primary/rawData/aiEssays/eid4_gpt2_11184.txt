The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it uses the historical context, and I think it makes a great deal of sense.

I would appreciate it if you read the whole book if you would tell me what your favorite quote was to that quote.

You know what, if you want advice I hope you can share with me. It's easy to write a better answer to this question than my previous one, "Do your beliefs make sense? Do they cause you to feel better?" So please share this in any manner you have in writing this book.

Here's what my advice is for the book. First, the whole series would have been much better suited for a book by a black historian (Hirving). Second, if you find yourself wanting to talk a little about modern writing then that's fine. I don't want to ruin this book! Third, no one is really that clever with his theory of writing, but it's an interesting danced between the real writers of the time. And 4 and a half centuries down the line people could still write great books. If you like things, and try doing more, then just go read the books and talk to your friends about them.
