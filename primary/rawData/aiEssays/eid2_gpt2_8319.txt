I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is harmful to the public interest."


"For example, if you believe that any information that is given in these publications is confidential, that information is made available to the government," he said.

He added that libraries should be more "responsive to the concerns of students and students concerned" about how libraries are being run, not just those who believe their information should be safe from the free flow of information.

"People shouldn't have to worry about their information being made available to the government just because they have the same beliefs," he said. "They should be held to reasonable standards of safe handling."

When asked whether this was the first time an academic had heard about the possibility of censorship around the country, Professor Kornacki said: "I don't think it would be a particularly egregious breach of freedom, but it certainly would be extremely concerning if it were committed by another university or that student in a public university."

The university will hold a seminar, which will be held on the topic of censorship, next week at 6.30 p.m. at the New America Foundation.

"I think it's important to keep in mind that these views are a fact of our world today â€“ that we can say that everything is protected by our free societies," he said.
