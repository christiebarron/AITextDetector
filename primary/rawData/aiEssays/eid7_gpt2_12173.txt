An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I read one of her novels about the struggle of a widowed woman in a rural home. My friend read the author's poem which I never got to hear, but from what I see we must have been very much the same. People who were married or had children and knew one another were all quite happy with this story, and were very much interested in each other. They shared a certain level of desire, were somewhat interested in each other, and went to school together.

But this time I learned a great deal about religion and I realized that I was not just a Christian but an Atheist. In fact I believed I should know more about this than I was able to about the whole world, which at first I could not do, for when the Lord said to me, "You are the same as the Jews or the Persians," I had no hesitation in reading it, and so was able to get my wish that they knew something about Christianity. I then began to study Buddhism. I also read a great deal of the literature of the ancient world. I first met a monk, a student of Zhuji, who had been studying Buddhism, but was becoming more and more convinced of its truth and its practice. And after long consideration and a long education, I was able to get him to see that it was not impossible to read. He was a man who had not been trained to read until after childhood
