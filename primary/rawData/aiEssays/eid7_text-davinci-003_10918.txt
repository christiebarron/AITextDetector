As a little girl, I remember my Grandma always being the perfect example of patience. I was often spoiled because I was the youngest granddaughter, but when I would get too rambunctious and out of control, Grandma was always the one to perservere.

One summer day, we all gathered at Grandma's house for a big family picnic. Everyone was happy and excited to spend some quality time together - that is, except for me. I was feeling restless and I was having trouble settling down. I wanted to play outside but it was so hot and I was too tired of walking around.

Grandma noticed my discontent and walked me to the porch swing. She told me to sit there and watch the birds swooping and diving in the sky. I sat there, in complete silence, watching the birds and the clouds and feeling the slight breeze. Gradually, I began to relax and feel less restless. By the end of the day, I was so calm and content that I had almost forgotten why I was upset in the first place.

Grandma's patience and understanding had been exactly what I needed that day. Even though I was being difficult, she was able to stay calm and find an activity that would help me calm down. From that day onward, I have remembered and tried to practice the same kind of patience that Grandma had shown me.
