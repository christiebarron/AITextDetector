Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. For decades, computers have become an essential element in our lives. We use them for work, entertainment, and other everyday tasks. Even though computers are performing our daily activities for us, I believe that computers have detrimental effects on us.

There is no doubt that computers are powerful tools for performing a wide range of tasks. But that same power can be used to manipulate people and their decisions. With the rapid development of technology, computers can now control and influence people in many ways. For instance, advanced algorithms can quickly analyze and exploit personal data to influence peopleâ€™s opinions and decisions whilst remaining undetectable. This is highly dangerous and can have severe consequences on society.

Moreover, many people are becoming overly dependent on computers. Today, we rely so heavily on computers for everyday activities, such as communication tools, social networks, shopping, etc., that we have developed an unhealthy addiction to them. We are slowly becoming less productive and more isolated from the world around us, as we can easily hide behind our computers. We are also exposed to an enormous amount of digital distractions, such as online games, videos, and other time-wasting activities, further decreasing our productivity.

In conclusion, I believe that computers have created a scenario in which people are more vulnerable to manipulation and isolation. Therefore, it is essential that people become more aware of these risks and
