I'll never forget the special moment I shared with my grandmother when I was a young girl. We had gone to the park on a wonderfully sunny day and were sitting on a bench, talking and enjoying the warmth of the sun.

Suddenly, my grandmother started to tell me a funny story. We both laughed as she recounted an embarrassing moment she'd experienced. I felt so close to her in that moment, joining in her laughter as she shared this story of hers.

The laughter we shared was like a bridge spanning the gap between us. I'd never felt that kind of bond with her before, it truly was magical. When it was all said and done, we sat in companionable silence, holding hands and soaking in the joyfulness that the laughter had filled our hearts with.

Even to this day, whenever I think of that afternoon with my grandmother I can't help but smile. The power of laughter had united us together and nothing will ever compare to that.
