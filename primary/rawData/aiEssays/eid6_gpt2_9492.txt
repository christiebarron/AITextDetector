One barrier was the fact that vehicles carrying the standard gas tanks and fuel cables were not allowed onto the building's main floor. The second obstacle was that large vehicles with more gas tanks or electricity could be parked there. After much deliberation, the State Building Council decided in 1990 against allowing dirigibles onto the building site. By 2001, the State Building Council found that the building was too large to accommodate the large number of dirigsitivists who planned to use the building. The following year, the State Building Council created the Alternative Camping and Transportation Authority. In January 2002, the City of Boston made changes to the building's location to accommodate alternative vehicles and allow the use of private cars, some of the most famous vehicular configurations in the world. Some of these modifications included placing a single lane from the E.B. DuPont main entrance onto the site's first level to make way for wheelchair ramps. The additional lane eliminated obstacles that could have hindered entry and exit on the property.

This building is now a unique
