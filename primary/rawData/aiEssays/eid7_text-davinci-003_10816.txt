I recently had a challenging situation at work. I had to teach a team of new staff how to use a piece of equipment. The training process was long and complex, and it was easy to lose patience. But I stayed calm and took my time, making sure that each person understood the steps before moving on. 

I gave each person a chance to ask questions and offer their own ideas about the best way to use the machine. It was a slow process, but in the end my efforts paid off. By taking my time and staying focused on what I needed to do, I was able to successfully complete the training. 

I’m grateful for the opportunity to practice being patient. It’s not always easy, but it’s an important skill that I’m glad to have in my toolbox.
