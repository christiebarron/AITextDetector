Computers have many effects on people. Many of these can be detrimental to their relationships. In the case of the two children, their families were able to care for them in the absence of food; in the case of the two women, their families didn't exist and, for the most part, their lives were in constant jeopardy.

So what makes this case particularly alarming? I believe it could be because when you take the two children out of the picture, you create a dynamic where we have two women and two men that are having kids at once. Each woman who doesn't have any children is less likely to have sons, and the children of the women who would have sons are those men who were born with other genetic differences, or more likely to have more children. I know the children of women who carry no genes or to one degree or another are not going to have the same opportunity as those of men in a household.
