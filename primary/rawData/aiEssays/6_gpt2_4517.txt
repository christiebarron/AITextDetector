The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The opening of the Federal Building on 25 June 1949 made it impossible to install Dirigibles at other US government buildings. A single-aisle crane would have required the construction of more than a thousand dirigibles, and with two major building districts of up to 8,000 people, the Federal Buildings would have needed around 4 million dirigibles. Yet, most of the capital was built on flat-beds. Consequently, for both the two major building districts, a single-aisle crane still worked. Another problem with dirigibles was that they could be carried over and destroyed, which could lead to a building collapse.

A new dirigibles assembly line was constructed by the US government on 20 September 1953. The line was opened on 5 December 1946 to the world's tallest dirigibles. One such assembly line was located near the New York, New York State Convention Center, at 63 East Third St. The line ran from 1.2 miles away from the North Bridge and ended at 2319 Third St. It stopped at the edge of the main terminal on a narrow, low slope (although, given the great distance, no other way out could be blocked). The two main dragways on the center terminal would have needed a crane. The largest part of this line was built on the right of a hill, with three main dragways on it. The main dragway
