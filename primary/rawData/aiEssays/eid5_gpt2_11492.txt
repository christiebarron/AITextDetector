The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is of great relevance to the present. Aobar is a man who sees his relationship with his children being a man's journey to freedom -- especially for his youngest children, whose lives are at risk. He knows that he cannot be left in the dark and he does not understand why this happens.

"The story of from home has changed me, as a parent," Aobar explains. "As a writer, I did not know how to make people love who I was writing about, or how to make them be happy or strong or who they wanted to spend the rest of their lives with," he says of his own experiences. "You could almost hear the emotions. I've been through all that stuff. This is a sad memoir."

Though Aobar is not a serial author, he began his career writing books to accompany his wife's memoirs -- and he even went ahead and published the couple's first major publication, a book based on the same memoir. So it was a perfect fit, writes Aobar. He says that the book makes them think as hard about freedom as he does about slavery, and then, suddenly, his relationship with his wife moves from one person in prison to another in a matter of months.

"I had a very good sense by this time," he continues of his life at the centre of his books, "that I had lived a different life."
