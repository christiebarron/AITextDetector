One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I learned one of my brothers was raped in the middle of the night. Even after seeing the footage at the film festival, my father refused to allow me to see the footage again. He and his younger brother were already married and were working in the field, and he had no choice but to keep him company, but on the day the police arrived, the two of them began raping and murdering his wife. The police arrived at their home on the scene, but in the face of the protests from villagers their decision was taken against them.

We were asked why their husband had refused to take action. The police said this because he had done something that was quite unprofessional. Our father was angry for an obvious reason, and he wasn't happy. He started crying, but was also in a struggle with his wife, who was already injured and suffering from injuries for the rest of his life.

On my third visit to Australia, our eldest boy was raped by other men by other women who we met as well. He was a few months older than his classmates, and we had never seen much of him before. However, after the incident at the film festival, two of the girls with him, who had already been married in Indonesia, started to fight, and were told to leave the country. The other one was an English teacher who was in a very dangerous position to leave the country.
