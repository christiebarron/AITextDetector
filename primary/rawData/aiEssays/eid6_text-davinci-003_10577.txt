The construction of the Empire State Building in 1931 marked a great achievement of the engineering capabilities of the time that provided the city of New York with a breathtaking, majestic view. A unique feature that was incorporated into the building's design was the capability for dirigibles, or airships, to moor there. Unfortunately, many obstacles stood between the builders of the Empire State Building and their desire to make dirigibles a practical part of the city’s transportation system. 

The greatest obstacle to the dream of docking dirigibles came from the size of the airships available in 1931. Most had a total length of around 750 feet, including their tail fins. This was too long for the mast—or the pole on which the dirigibles were supposed to dock—that was only 600 feet in height. The idea was to have the Emperor State Building span the gap between the mast and the airship’s tail, thus providing a safe connection. This design proved to be a failure, as it could not handle the force placed upon it when the airship moved away from the mast.

Another issue the builders of the Empire State Building were forced to address was the wind's effect on the airships. Of particular note, the winds in New York City caused the airships to drift en route, eventually pushing them away from the mooring mast. As a result, the technical apparatus for grappling the ship had to be equipped with measures that countered
