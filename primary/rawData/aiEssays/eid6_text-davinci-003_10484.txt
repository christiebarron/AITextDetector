The design of the Empire State Building in New York City was originally intended to include a dock for dirigibles, enabling the cutting-edge airships of the 1920s and 1930s to land on the building. In order to facilitate docking, a 160 foot tall, sleeve-like structure was constructed on the 103rd floor. Despite the clever engineering of the mast, there were numerous obstacles to the successful mooring of dirigibles at the Empire State Building.

The pressure difference between the inside of a dirigible and the outside air was substantial due to air outside the airship being at ambient pressure and the air inside the dirigible being propelled by high-pressure gas to provide lift. This pressure difference made the most difficult obstacle to docking the Empire State Buildingâ€”the tension between the mooring lines. Allowing a dirigible to slow and steady dock at the Empire State Building required two large heavy duty mooring lines, made from wire cable, to be secured to the dirigible and to the mast. But the pressure difference between the airships and the outside air presented a major challenge. Pulling against the difference in pressure created tremendous force on the mooring lines, putting enormous strain on the structure of the mast and on those who would be carrying out mooring operations.

The Empire State Building also faced challenges of logistics, technology, and public relations during the design and operation of the mooring mast. Dirigible landings were difficult
