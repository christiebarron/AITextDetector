An example of a time someone in my life was patient was that my cousin went over to work and they saw a young boy. I was devastated about that because I have to go through four or five different trauma days a year. It was a horrible situation for a young person and I've got to move up as a family. That's a really hard process for us to get through, but it's a big deal FAA. That's why I didn't leave my hotel room early the next day. I did that for five days, and then they let me come to the room and I was so happy. It was so special, and that will live on. I hope that they see that, because it all comes back to me as long as it keeps going well. But with my dad gone, I'm so happy, and I can't say we'll ever see each other again.

JUAN GONZ√ÅLEZ: The first time people thought I was crazy on the show, they told us it's because you were like that.

THOMAS SCOTT, REPORTER NAGER: We're not going to let it slip that I love you, because I am such a fan of you and I've been so grateful.

JAMIE RENTON: I love you, too.

THOMAS SCOTT: I think I'll always be loved by you, just as I love the family on this
