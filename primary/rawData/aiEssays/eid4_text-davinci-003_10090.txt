This line from Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho serves as a powerful metaphor for the struggles of the main character, who is an immigrant to the U.S. The struggles and pressures surrounding the main character's immigration status are paralleled in the struggle of the hibiscus flower, which also must try to survive and thrive in a difficult environment. By comparing her challenges to those of the hibiscus flower, the main character not only acknowledges her difficult circumstances but also finds hope as she waits for the hibiscus to come back in the spring â€“ signifying that she too can overcome the odds and continue to strive.
