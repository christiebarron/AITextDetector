The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' (by Gaby Gee in 1997, adapted for TOS in 1999) for the first time comes in several forms: "I have a great love for men and an interest in relationships. "An average man is just that," she writes. "But some would call him a p----. That doesn't mean they need to like a manâ€”that's a personal preference on my part. What he really wants is some other dude sitting up with him a couple of hours every week for his pleasure. "No matter what his life is, I'd have it the exact same way. It just depends if he lives it down or not."

The book, which comes and goes and has been adapted for the TNG-AM series, is called 'TNG Year 1: The Fall,'" and is currently on show in Toronto, England.
