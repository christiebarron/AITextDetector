One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was walking home from the bookstore with a girlfriend. While everyone else in the group was asleep, a friend and I stopped by (she always came back at the end of the day, in case I just couldn't make it).

"When you look at the top of the bookstore and the front door, if you try to open it at night you'll fall asleep, so I'll open it early so we can spend time enjoying our morning," She said.

I was stunned at how calm and clear she felt being out there. She was so smart we knew that she had a great job (she owns the store). We talked in the same company one week and she said a friend recommended she check out at the counter, and it all worked out.

What she wasn't impressed with for sure, was her understanding that "everyone is smarter by all the good things that they do in life."

In that moment, it struck me "It's not fair to try that out if nobody's smart," She said. "But if you don't make that change at the end of the day, you still have to give yourself permission to put your money where your mouth is."

We were excited, and didn't know if we could actually get outside for some fun. We ended up being seated on two chairs near this counter. My husband would never turn down a job if we came to his office
