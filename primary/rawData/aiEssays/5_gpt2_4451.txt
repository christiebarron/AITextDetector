The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is perhaps the finest of all time in the form is that she wants everyone to understand that in "God is all around us"; in the end, she concludes, "We are here. I feel we have a role to play. We can call."

In the following years, she writes a novel at which a certain young woman comes to New York, in an attempt to learn, as she puts it, "a very good way to start a dream come true and to begin learning as a person".
 LaCourie, the writer, is well known for her own writing, and this piece is particularly relevant in this case, with regard to "from home". It presents a girl, in the middle of her high school years, who finds herself going to an online forum discussing her favorite subject and is suddenly led into the world of literature, especially when she discovers that the world isn't that easy. The world is hard and there is no one there to be left alone with.

When she first got into reading, she got overwhelmed with poetry and poetry and began to come up with other projects, for instance, to write a story called The Other (whereupon in each entry a female character takes the position of self-described "woman", sometimes without warning, sometimes with all the attention and grace of a teenager), an essay collection, the title of which is the book she and her "real self" write.
