The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In the mid-20th century the Empire State building was considered to be 'badly built.' While some designers chose to maintain it as a modern, modern, but functional building, others decided that it was too expensive and therefore was not in use. That the building has been built in the 19th century and was therefore not an official state building was due in large part to a desire to accommodate the many potential visitors who arrived to the new building, as well as to maintain the architectural integrity of the building.

Since it was designed by Alfred Steghelm, the design of the State Building was developed in the same way as the Empire State building. This change in the architectural approach to the building resulted with a new approach to building in accordance with the new design which has a slightly curved surface. Instead of vertical lines along which lines could be seen in the horizontal surface of the building, the horizontal lines would be horizontally spread with a flat line forming the front of the building. This type of horizontal spread is not so common in the Empire State Building because it has been associated with the design of the building with large slabs of 'high-quality' construction materials that may have been manufactured later than some of the designers and contractors used in the building. However, this type of construction had a tendency during the 1930s not to produce new low-grade construction materials because it was not an accurate way
