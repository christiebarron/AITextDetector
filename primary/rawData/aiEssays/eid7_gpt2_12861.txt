An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I called him my daughter and asked if she was married and he said "yes" - was he? and then he took out a piece of paper - and the letter said - "you have made an engagement to my daughter for me and you were the one to announce to her your marriage, a month from now", and, in fact, was she not pregnant at all at the time so I went ahead with the engagement. So the marriage was done, for two months. I wrote her and thanked her for saying it herself. So yeah, to put it simply. I am really in love, but the word'marriage' is something I've been unable to really put into words all my life and you know, I am not really going to lay down my life in order to be happy, I would rather go out and do good things and enjoy what I am doing.

Q: Can you address the controversy of the sexual abuse of another child in your life as something much broader?

M: I think what is going on is, this is about one parent, one spouse. As I speak, she is getting close to one of my grandchildren and he is just now getting married. So I would like to say there are things going on that I believe go a long way. I do not condone any kind of sexual abuse going on among young people. You know, that was an unfortunate thing. When
