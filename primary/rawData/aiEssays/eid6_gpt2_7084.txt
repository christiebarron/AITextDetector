The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. During construction of the first steps, the steel-clad blocks were not completely covered in concrete to prevent the blocks falling to the ground, or to prevent them being struck down by a crane or a boat.

Despite many problems and concerns, building owners hoped to complete their steps at a cost of $1 million. And even those steps are not done now as the Empire State Building is still building two giant steel columns.

"We had to go through a process to make it through that project," said Jeff Crouch, owner of Pico Rivera Construction, which has been part of the Empire State Building since 2003. "I know of a couple of instances before in the past where people have been building the Empire State building. They have no way to go through the process of rebuilding it."

Crouch said the construction of the Empire State Building in the 1980s was difficult because of the large build-out that followed.

According to Pico Rivera, which is based in New Jersey, many of the projects in construction in the 1980s were done with hundreds of feet of concrete. After spending four years working closely with the Empire State Building owner to ensure a perfect condition, building owners felt they needed to be prepared for demolition.
