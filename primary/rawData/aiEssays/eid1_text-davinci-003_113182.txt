Dear Editor,

With today's technological advancements, computers have become a part of daily life for many people. Despite the great convenience that these devices afford us, one must consider the human effects of working with computers. I believe that computers have both positive and negative effects on people.

On the positive side, computers have the power to connect us with family, friends, and colleagues all across the globe. They are powerful tools that can make our lives easier by helping us to analyze data and manage our finances.

However, the negative side of computers cannot be ignored. The over use of computers can lead to physical health issues, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, neck pain, and eye strain. In addition, they can lead to mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression.

It is important for people to ensure that they are taking the necessary precautions to protect their physical and mental health. For example, stretching breaks should be taken when working on a computer for a long duration. The brightness of computer monitors should also be adjusted for comfortable viewing.

In conclusion, computer technology has both positive and negative effects on the human body. It is important to be mindful of the potential physical and mental issues that can arise from over usage. Taking precautions to ensure proper computer use is key to preserving both physical and mental health.

Sincerely,

[Your name]
