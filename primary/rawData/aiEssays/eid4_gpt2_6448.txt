The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it takes on a whole new meaning. As soon as a hero does something bad, something bad is going to happen. To start with, he doesn't know why it would happen, because no one really knows what happens, because they're unaware that no matter what happens (a lot of things go bad there!) he'll be caught by his mother (who doesn't have a good reason to be afraid of having her children raped or murdered) and so on… but because he's so terrified, he even gets to the point where he thinks he's going crazy, so he kills him. If the person he's about to kill doesn't see how that's a bad thing, he goes through five, ten or fifteen levels of fear. After all, he actually did kill his mother.

So this is where The Dark Knight, The Joker, The Penguin, The Beast and The Black Panther all end up. In many ways, The Dark Knight is the most interesting element in The Marvel Cinematic Universe – or, rather, the most interesting event in the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe.

It's not just about making the most of it (he actually does make things happen at least for a little while before anyone asks, right?).

There are elements that have worked over time that, I think, have made it more or less what it was the first time around – things where the character doesn't just disappear
