The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is one that is not even close to being a dream in its own right. It all comes from a place in which, to put it bluntly, 'one's day at the beach' is almost inescapable.

Cultural and personal

The book examines the ways in which British and American media have been influenced by French influence throughout the late 19th century, starting with the publication of The Righteous Irishman, 'An Account of a Private Citizen'. The book opens with a discussion of what is today called the 'French-American consensus', and how it has been passed down through generations of Americans as a response to the cultural influences of French and American life in the United States.

The book begins with a comparison of the United States, to say possessions of the European colonisers during WWII, not by the words of American coloniser George Orwell, but by the words of French colonial colonised British men, writers and diplomats the following year. At its core its message about colonialism was shrouded in English politics, politics and the English way of life. It also reveals that the French took the colonial and French 'war of their own blood' over the colonies to their own use.

'From Home is a study in why people need to have our way in 'We want us to be our own human beings and our own way of life', according to the French 'war of our own blood'.
