Computers have many effects on people. It is possible for your life to be changed by a computer.

How much might it hurt you to have a computer like that?

How might it save your life?

It has to be done, right?

Nowadays computers are quite expensive, so we do not have an investment option to purchase them. And not only do we not have an option, but a large corporation also buys your computer. So, we decided to put on a program called the Cyber Monday program which is meant to give us a cheap and cheerful computer for all you hackers out there. Our system cost some â‚¬35,000, but since you only have to pay one euro for the program there is plenty of time before you must buy any more. As long as it's free of charge the program does everything you want, and gives you time and security. To learn about how to use it and how it works, head over to our Cyber Monday website.

It's a special program! But I can use it for the rest of my life! It could be a little more dangerous too, so you might also want to follow the instructions to change the password or use different program on your computer. For your convenience we won't make a profit if you forget something.
