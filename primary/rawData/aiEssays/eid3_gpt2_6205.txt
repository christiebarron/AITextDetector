Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. It makes sense for cyclists to stop on the streets rather than on long-drawn slabs of highway.

There are three main road markers to follow if you want to stop on: St Peter's Green, the former St John's Green, and the former Hulbert-Buckingham-Saskatoon-Saskill trail. The former St Peter's Green gets more than a couple of inches of dirt; the southern path comes to a stop at the city boundary; and the eastern end of both routes is not on the map â€“ or even on your map! It's not a huge surprise that St Peter's has a number of low-mileage roads, the road just goes past the city boundary into Blackrock (that's St. Peter's Park road?), and it turns out that on top of most of those, you can pass through a busy shopping centre and the suburbs. There are also some low-peak road markers near Queen's Quay to see in more detail.

The St Peters Green sign goes to the heart of the city: it's a relatively straight road, and only about 20cm wide, so it's fairly easy to pass between two buildings. However, if you have only a short-distance line through St Peters you might feel like stepping through a pothole. A bike path runs underneath it to get from this point south through the city
