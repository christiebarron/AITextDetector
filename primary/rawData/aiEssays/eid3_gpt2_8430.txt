Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

Most bike riders, including those who ride with children, cycle alone or with people where it is safe to do so.

They use it as a convenient diversion for their leisure but also as a source of speed and comfort on their journeys.

The setting does not reduce cyclist risk but instead reduces those risks associated with other non-conformists.'

Professor Chris Williams, deputy chair of Bicycle Cycling UK, said: 'The Cycling Skills Curriculum gives riders the flexibility to make and use cycling routes a whole lot more easily.

'However, most cycling trips are spent doing the wrong thing to the wrong number of kilometres and a cyclist who follows a wrong route might also be getting lost onurcling.

'Rough Road Ahead' aims to encourage users to have a better understanding about the different types of road-building programmes and programmes, rather than just having a set of rules.

A wide-ranging series of online courses, such as ROWFORCUIT, offers the opportunity to train students to take the cycling skills course and to learn about the current and future routes which might provide a major boost for urban cycling.

Each week a new course called 'Rough Road Ahead' (ROWFIELD) includes more on-bike tips or exercises and will be taught in many schools.
