The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock at the iconic building. In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted, these obstacles are outlined in three main points. 

First, the most obvious problem was the simple size of the building itself. Since its completion in 1931, the Empire State has been the tallest building in the world, reaching an impressive 102 stories and 1,250 feet high. To make matters worse, the building has a narrow profile, constructed in a narrow rectangle with a two-story base. Even if the mooring mast had been built at the very highest point, aeronautical engineers feared that it would have been too small and too weak to hold the weight of a dirigible.

Second, since the base of the Empire State Building was built in a relatively shallow foundation, the load of the mast would have had to have gone through the building itself. The engineers were worried that the force of the mast slamming into the side of the building would be too great and the chance of structural damage was highly likely. Even if the mast had been built with a strong enough foundation, the engineers still had to worry about the extreme winds that can occur at such a great height, and how those winds might shake and rattle the mast, and in turn, the building structure itself.

Lastly, engineers had to take into account the logistical challenges of joining the
