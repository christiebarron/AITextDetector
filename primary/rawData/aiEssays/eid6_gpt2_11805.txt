The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. These include the fact that the building was designed to be open to the public and could allow aircraft and vehicles to be used.

Now, some of these barriers have been removed, but the Empire State Building remains intact. If building designers continue to consider building dirigibles, the building will continue to suffer. That's because only about 7 percent of its 3,950,000 square feet (8,500 square feet larger than the original Empire State Building) could have been used for dirigs. That means that only about 1 percent of the 2.3 million U.S. residents who live in that building could now experience one of their own Ginny's. This could have a big impact on the future of the building and the state's future, including the preservation of its former buildings.


"The Empire State Building, even when it is not in use, still stands as a symbol for American history. It was one of the first buildings ever built outside the United States," Paul S. Pomeroy, Chairman of CTO, said, in a release.


Paul told The Associated Press that if designers and builders continue to consider building dirigibles, the building will continue to suffer. That's because only about 7 percent of its 3,950,000 square feet (8,500 square feet larger than the original Empire State Building) could have been used for dirigs.
