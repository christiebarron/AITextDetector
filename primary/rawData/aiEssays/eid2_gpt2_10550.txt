I believe that censorship of materials in libraries requires that everyone have at least one copy of the materials in their possession that are being used. Many of these materials are not accessible through the local library where they are usually found. I personally am a person of limited English and can speak no language. This is especially true for small children. I am always very worried about my children's safety when they are reading library materials. The library service that they receive does not always always provide this safe and secure environment. This means that my three children are not able to read this type of material at their school, or when they are out at the library on their day off.

This is what I am concerned about when we have the library service that we normally see at schools being used with other libraries â€“ especially the kids who might be in school or work. When one person has access to a particular type of materials that we have not been able to access for a while, it makes sense that one person in another library would have access to this material. At schools where a library service is being used at all, if there's a need to keep up with current issues, the parent may be able to access this type of material.

I don't believe that some people want to see this type of information and feel that they somehow have nothing to say. I think some people simply want to see all of these materials. I would argue that the library service is important and needs to be provided to all
