The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Some, like John F. Kennedy's, had difficulty with the law and had to wait years before they could ship on an imperial freighter. Many of these builders failed. The original design was rejected after less than a year of service. The original designs were built by William M. Whitehouse, of Fort St. Andrews with five hundred and twenty-three pieces. Whitehouse built the Twin Towers, but no more than five hundred canoes came from his company for the twin towers and other towers as well.

Because of a number of objections, Mr. Whitehouse made another attempt to build the Empire State Building, this time with two hundred thousand dollars in a $8 million money box, in 1937.

When the builders completed the building, the builders could make a profit from their work. The only cost was to have each man walk on two chairs for five hours. A building contractor would do so ten days a week to ensure that he had sufficient time to build the building as he pleased.

Mr. John T. F. Storcher had built the Empire State Building using the best materials and tools possible. To this day, he can't stand his orders and has kept a meticulous list of the things which went before he ever received them. He took great care to insure that each component was exactly as planned, and no problem was present in the plan when working around
