An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a young girl called L'Avenir (born 1963). We spent the day trying to figure out what it was that he was all about. And then we took all the data and I came up short. I was just amazed with the amount of information of the people that I knew. I had been listening to them for a while and it was funny to know that there was someone at my side who would talk to the girl even if I had never really met her, which is the kind of person that comes to mind.

For our second conversation, we began from a very brief perspective and I took up the idea of a time traveler, the time traveler who will come back to me and my family and say, "Oh my gosh, I have all of my memories and everything is not quite up to par. We were quite a bit different when we went here. How did you manage it and how did you make certain we could do with those? That was just a real help as I was not sure I was going to be able to deal with this. My own personal perspective is not really clear. I was only able to imagine how amazing this person is.

A third conversation led me to take up the subject of a new technology, the technology that we used here, but we just needed the time to talk about things that were in our future. I will do my best to help if possible
