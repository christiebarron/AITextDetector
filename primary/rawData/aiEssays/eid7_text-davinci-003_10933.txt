I remember this one time when I was waiting with my family in line at the grocery store. The person in front of us had a full cart and was counting out coins to pay for her groceries. I was starting to get really antsy because I just wanted to get home, but my mom silently reminded me to be patient. I looked around and saw that a lot of people in line were getting exasperated.

But I just looked at my mom and smiled, and she nodded her head in approval. I remember that moment specifically because it was a reminder to remain patient in difficult situations. Eventually, the person got their groceries in order and we got our turn to check out. I am so glad I stayed patient â€” it could have been a lot worse and taken a lot longer had I chosen not to.
