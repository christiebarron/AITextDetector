The ending of "Winter Hibiscus" by Minfong Ho is meant to emphasize the idea of hope and resilience--both of which are themes throughout the poem. The hibiscus is presented as a symbol of tenacity and hope, as it is able to survive the harsh winter. By ending with this imagery of the hibiscus returning in the spring, the poem's narrator is showing that he too will survive, despite the difficult times he is facing. By vowing to take the test again, he is also showing his determination to learn and grow, despite the setbacks he is facing.
