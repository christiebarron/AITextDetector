Dear Editor,

As the world rapidly progresses in technology, its citizens are increasingly relying on computers to complete day-to-day functions. The effects of this on individuals can be seen in various areas of life, from professional development to leisure. Personally, I believe the overwhelming amount of time people are spending in front of computers has both negative and positive effects on them.

On one hand, focusing on completing tasks with the help of computers has undermined people’s imagination and creative problem solving skills. This technology has also led to reduced physical activity and potentially significant implications for individual’s health and wellbeing. Likewise, computers have led to people less frequently connecting in-person with their peers. This has affected people’s understanding of the importance of relationship building and collaboration. 

On the other hand, computers have the potential to greatly benefit individuals by providing them access to new and innovative ways to access information, learn, and develop. It has enabled people to be more efficient, communicate instantly with anyone around the world, and generally diversify their range of experiences. Additionally, computers have enabled people to conduct activities such as online shopping, online banking, and social activities from the comfort of their own homes, allowing them to manage time more effectively. 

Overall, the effects of computers, whether positive or negative, are heavily dependent upon their usage. It is often the attention given to the development of skills and the upkeep of physical health and connection with others
