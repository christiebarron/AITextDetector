I was recently vacationing in Europe with my family. We planned to visit the Leaning Tower of Pisa, but our taxi driver got lost. My family became very impatient, frustrated, and angry. I tried to remain calm. I reminded everyone that we were in a foreign country and it was reasonable to expect that our driver may need to take a few wrong turns. After about an hour, the driver finally found the tower. Despite the fact that he had taken us on a wild ride, I thanked him for getting us there and smiled when I paid him. This illustration of patience was key to having an enjoyable experience, and the rest of the day went smoothly!
