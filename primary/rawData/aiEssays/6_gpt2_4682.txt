Drones were already capable of navigating through traffic and other obstacles. But they didn't quite stop at building a drone aircraft that could steer itself around the building, because it actually wasn't able to move any debris: They can simply jump on top of things and start the vehicle up again.

So when the Federal Aviation Administration first approved the first commercial use for drones in 2005, the FAA said the flying public should no longer only want some kind to follow their flying. A program called AER (Advanced Unmanned Aerial Systems) would allow the FAA to program unmanned aerial vehicles or drones with sensors and cameras and allow people to fly autonomously without fear of them crashing over their heads.

The FAA also said it was open to the program because it requires people to be able to walk on public roads. They say that's a fair enough requirement, and they're eager to see more of them in the future. If they can't do it, the government can make one up.

FAA officials say drones shouldn't be just something people can do but they see people flying them on public roads and doing what they've always done, taking down buildings like that.

They say the technology should be used for other reasons too â€” for example, to provide information when someone dies of natural causes, but also to help people make sure people in their communities are
