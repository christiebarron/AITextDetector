Dear Editor,

I believe that computers have the potential to improve human lives in many ways but can also create a number of harmful wide-reaching effects, especially on younger generations.

Computer technology has presented us with many beneficial advances, such as the ways that it has improved communication, education, and healthcare. However, many people are beginning to feel the negative side effects of using computers, from feelings of addiction to physical ailments like vision problems and neck or back pain.

I believe that the increasing use of computers can lead to, what can be termed, ‘digital distraction’. For instance, young people can become so heavily absorbed in playing computer games, sending texts and messages, or using social media that they forget to exercise and socialise which can lead to serious risks such as obesity and isolation.

The use of computers should be monitored with caution. A reasonable amount of computer time should be set, depending on age, to safeguard people’s safety. Computers can be used for educational purposes, however, it is important to recognise the potential negative effects and keep an eye on computer use where necessary.

I hope that my letter can persuade the readers of the real dangers of computer use, and take an active part in ensuring that their family, friends, and children are well protected.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
