The author is suggesting that the narrator of the song will take a test, likely an exam or assignment at school, when the hibiscus blooms in the spring. The use of this image reflects the narrator's determination to stay focused and not let sentiments for their mother's homeland and family distract them from their studies. It is also a reminder of how quickly time is passing, as the hibiscus will bloom soon despite the fact that the narrator's mother is no longer in their life. This moment of renewed hope and optimism after a difficult period of mourning is the perfect way to end the song.
