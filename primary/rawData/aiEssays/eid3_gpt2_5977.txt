Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

While setting to "Rough Road Ahead" means that the current riding pattern may be somewhat or completely changed, it only affects the future.

If we are careful we could set this up in any number of ways ranging from normal cycling to a few more twists and turns. We would also be able to make tweaks when there are no additional riders on the network for riding to.

If a cycleway change is not available to you (perhaps you can request information about what it involves or what your cycling needs)?

Allowing us to let the Cycling Manager know when you can help with any of, or make a customise the set up.

If you require a specific setting, or you feel you couldn't make it in one place, email the Cycling Manager on +44 (0) 724 6830.

If you need to change from an empty set up to make a change, please email me.

If you need to modify the current riding pattern for the specified setting, please email me.
