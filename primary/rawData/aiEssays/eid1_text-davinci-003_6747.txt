Dear Editor:

As technology advances, computers have become more and more prevalent in our lives. However, with that increase in usage, it is important to consider the effects computers have on people, both individually and as a society. 

Personally, I have seen the positive and negative consequences of computers, from increased productivity to strained eyesight. However, the positives have outweighed the negatives in my experience. By being able to access and store an unprecedented amount of information, I've noticed an enhancement to my decision-making abilities. 

As almost all job seekers know, proficiency in computer usage and software is essential to have a competitive edge in the job market. In today's world it is impossible to ignore the importance computers have in our lives, both at work and at home. Computers have created a more efficient way of communicating, from Skype calls to the ability to email important documents to friends and family.

Additionally, computers have made us even more connected. It is easily possible to keep up with current events, people, and trends - topics that would have been out of reach without the help of computers. For people who lack physical mobility, computers have allowed them to access opportunities and escape the confines of their home. 

Computer usage is such an integral part of our lives that many people can't imagine life without them. By understanding the advantages computers bring to our lives, we can better appreciate and practice safe and responsible habits while utilizing computers.
