The sun was shining brightly, and I had just gotten off of work. I was walking down the street with my best friend and we were discussing a funny story we had heard earlier. Before we knew it, we were both laughing so hard that tears were streaming down our faces. 

We both stopped to catch our breath, and noticed that the people around us were looking at us strangely. But that only spurred us on, and we starting laughing again. We started to make up our own jokes and stories that were even funnier, and our laughter got louder and louder.

Before we knew it, we had attracted a small crowd of onlookers. They were all laughing along with us, and it made us both feel so connected and happy. We were all strangers, yet brought together in that moment by laughter. For me, it felt like laughter was the shortest distance between us. 

We kept laughing until our stomachs hurt, and started to bid each other goodbye. As we separated, I made sure to thank our audience for participating in our laughter. 

It had been a great reminder of how powerful laughter can be. It truly is the most beautiful sound that can bring two people together.
