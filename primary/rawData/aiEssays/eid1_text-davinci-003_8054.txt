The challenge of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building has long been an idea which captivated the world’s imagination. When the Empire State Building was first completed in 1930, the project quickly became known for its art deco beauty, towering height, and sheer impressive majesty. While the building itself stood as a formidable testament to American engineering and ambition, the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the building was an engineering feat far beyond the capabilities of the time.

As Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s “The Mooring Mast” explicates, the Empire State Building’s design had no provisions for docking dirigibles. Despite the ingenuity of the architects and engineers responsible for the building’s construction, a mooring mast had to be designed to bring dirigibles to the top of the building. This mooring mast had to be high enough to protect the dirigibles against strong winds while also fitting within the tight confines of the top of the building. 

The engineering team, headed by William Lamb, faced numerous obstacles while constructing a mast suitable for the Empire State Building. The team had to in-build additional support for the mooring mast to be able to hold the weight of the dirigible. This meant reinforcing the existing steel beams, a process that was time consuming and could be prone to errors. Additionally, the upper level of the Empire State Building
