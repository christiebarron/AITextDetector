Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

The cycling experience may be harder to imagine for some people but there is a difference between being able to stand at a turn, hit a sign, or move a bike with your toes.

The only option for those who desire to try to solve some of those complex problems is by working at a race track and a cycling museum at the same time.

A great place to start is by visiting a bike or walking a bike, cycling in town, or cycling on the train, bus, or train tracks and then having something organised with a cycling museum.

Once you understand the cycling experience and have already completed the 'Rough Road Ahead' experience there is a good chance you can start off Hoffmann's solution.
