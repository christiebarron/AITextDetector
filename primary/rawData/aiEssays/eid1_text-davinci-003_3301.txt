Dear Editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. For decades, computers have been used in countless ways. From education to business to entertainment, computers have drastically changed the way we live our day-to-day lives.

Furthermore, computers can provide us with more entertainment options, which can help reduce stress and boredom. In addition, computers can improve productivity
