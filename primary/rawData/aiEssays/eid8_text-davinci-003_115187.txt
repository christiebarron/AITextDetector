I was sitting in my living room with my best friend, catching up over coffee. We had both been through some tough times recently and had a lot of catching up to do. We started to reminisce and before long, we were both rolling on the floor in laughter. 

I had just recalled a funny story about my mother's disastrous attempt at baking an apple pie. My friend followed it up with her own story about her experiments with dyeing her own hair. We kept on laughing and neither of us could get the other to stop no matter how hard we tried.

Before long, we didn't even need stories to keep us laughing. We would just look at each other and start cracking up again. We laughed until there were tears in our eyes and our stomachs were sore. Eventually, we ran out of stories and had to end our laughter session, but it was the perfect medicine for both of us. 

I'm so grateful to have a friend who can make me laugh like that, even in the hardest of times.
