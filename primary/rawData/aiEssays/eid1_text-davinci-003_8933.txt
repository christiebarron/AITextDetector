Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. As the world continues to evolve technologically, it is hard to ignore the omnipresence of computers. Schools introduce digital tools in the classroom, offices autopilot administrative tasks, and businesses use powerful machines to move their products. 

That being said, it is difficult to overlook the impact computers have on all of us. Computers are capable of making our lives much more efficient--but there are hidden risks to our health and wellness. Those who devote their day to looking at screens, typing, and mousing, canâ€™t avoid the consequences that come with these actions. Eye fatigue, back pain and poor posture are just some of the physical ailments one can experience as a result of being on the computer for hours on end. 

It is imperative that we pay attention to our bodies and minds not just when we are directly interacting with a computer, but also as a result of relying on them. We must be conscious of ergonomics and take frequent breaks from our technology if we want to avoid long-term health issues. 

While technology is a wonderful tool, it is up to us to find balance between online and offline activities. Otherwise, we endanger our well-being and can can forget what it is like to take a break from the world of machines.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
