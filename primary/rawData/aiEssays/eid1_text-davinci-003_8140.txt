In 1930, the construction of the Empire State Building provided a unique opportunity to incorporate a mooring mast to accommodate dirigibles, or airships, for the first time at the top of a skyscraper. Despite the enthusiasm generated by this idea, the builders of Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles to making airship dockings a reality.

The most high-profile obstacle was a design and engineering challenge. The construction team had to design a suitable landing apparatus for the mooring mast, which was no simple feat. The anchor had to be strong enough to securely moor an airship the size of the Empire State Building and it needed to be able to keep the airship steady in high winds. Engineers also had to figure out how to deal with the electricity created by the friction of the airship against the mooring mast, as well as plumbing wiring and soil lines to direct any airship leakage away from the building.

Other considerations of practical value included costs and safety issues. The mooring mast and its associated anchor systems were expensive in cost and time; building a custom mast, with the necessary safety nets and lightning arresters, along with the risk of potential airship damage to the building and other potential safety issues, all had to be taken into account.

The political and economic climate of the era also posed significant challenges to the builders. New York City had been hit hard by the Great Depression and the budget for the building was tight
