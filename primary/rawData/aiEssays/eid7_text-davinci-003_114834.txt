I recently witnessed a situation in which someone acted with remarkable patience. I was at a restaurant with my son and daughter when two very young, energetic children were seated at the table next to ours. The children were filled with excitement and spoke in loud voices, while their parents tried to settle them down.

To my surprise, the parents kept their composure and spoke to the children in a gentle manner. Instead of getting frustrated and angry, they were extremely patient, no matter how many times the children interrupted or disregarded their requests. They kept explaining things calmly and asked the children to use their inside voices.

I was surprised and impressed by the parentsâ€™ level of patience. Even though it wasn't an easy task to keep those lively children at bay, the parents managed to do it in a compassionate way. It was a display of remarkable self-control and understanding.
