The ambition of the builders of the Empire State Building to create an airship docking mast was a visionary wish, but the ultimate accomplishment was fraught with difficulties. As described in Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s “The Mooring Mast”, the prospective site of the mast was at the highest point of the 79th floor of the building, and the task of constructing the mast was an extremely daunting one. It was essential for the mast to be strong enough so as to firmly entwine cable of the airship for mooring, while withstanding the strain of a large zeppelin. It also had to be able to adjust to a variety of weather conditions, as airships were susceptible to severe weather. In addition, the lines used to tie the airships to the mast needed to be able to telescope, as the horizontal wind movement of the zeppelin needed to be able to suffer itself easily. 

Every component of the mast had to be specially designed and engineered. Firstly, a flagpole was installed with an eye at the top of the pole, since the rigid steel mast would not bend enough to allow the connecting cable to the airship to reach the eye. The pole needed to have sufficient length, while being strong enough to resist the strain of pulling the zeppelin into the tower. Furthermore, it was essential to anchor the mast to the building securely, so that it did not rip out when the ship pulled it with force.
