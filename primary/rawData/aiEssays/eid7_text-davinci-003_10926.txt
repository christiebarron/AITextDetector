I was working a busy late night shift at the local fast food restaurant when a customer approached the register and presented me with a difficult order. They had asked for nine special burgers, each with a long list of special ingredients. It would have taken a considerable amount of time to put together a large order like this, and the customer was not considering that fact. I could feel my patience waning as I began to assemble the order.

However, I was determined to not let my frustration get the better of me. I looked at the customer and paused for a few moments before I spoke. “Okay, this order is going to take a bit of time. Is that okay with you?” I asked gently.

Without hesitation, the customer simply smiled and said, “Of course! Take your time, I don’t mind waiting.”

I was amazed! Considering how specific the order was, I expected the customer to be frustrated about the wait. But instead, they were incredibly patient with me. After a few more minutes of assembling the burgers, I was able to hand over a freshly made order of nine perfect burgers. 

The customer thanked me for my patience and consideration, leaving me feeling very lucky to have interacted with such an understanding individual. To this day, I remember their calmness and generosity, and strive to be as patient and understanding as they were.
