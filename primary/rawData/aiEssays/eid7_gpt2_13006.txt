An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a friend of mine. I was sitting at his home listening to a friend on the radio.
            When I first heard the words "we're talking about someone in my life," I immediately felt a strong urge to go on some kind of search for our lost friend and found out he had come back to them in an amazing package.
This is one of the best ways to go out on a limb at the most pivotal moment in my life and at what will happen when the time comes.  I'm not even going to mention him by name because he may be very important to me; but this moment in my life has a different meaning than a lot of the times when it comes from you.  I love him, I've spent all these years grieving for him and he's always made me feel better about myself, my life, and my friends.
            He used me like a kid on a baseball team and as a teenager to help my life.  I didn't get any help from our friends or family even though we were in the middle of something bad.  I'm still going through some emotional stages in a way that might be easier to share with the world, but I feel like this is going to be part of the conversation before the day I die.
