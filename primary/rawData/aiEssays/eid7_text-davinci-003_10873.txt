I recently encountered a situation in which I was incredibly patient. I was at the grocery store with my daughter, and she was having a major meltdown. She was screaming and refusing to listen to anything I was saying. People were staring at us, and I started to feel embarrassed.

I took a deep breath and reminded myself that she was just a child and that this was a normal stage for her. So instead of raising my voice, I stayed calm and gently talked her down. We ended up making it through the store without any added stress. 

Once we got home, I realized my patience had made all the difference. My daughter was calmer and more understanding, and seemed to feel better knowing that I hadn't gotten mad at her for her misbehavior. I was glad to have remained patient in the situation, and it made me feel more confident in my parenting skills.
