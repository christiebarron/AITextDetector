Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people and to persuade your readers to agree with me.

Through technology, computers have revolutionized our lives. In both personal and professional settings, they grant us access to an unlimited resource of information, enabling us to accomplish a plethora of tasks at rapid speeds. Computers have even helped create hundreds of jobs, allowing people to work from the comfort of their own homes.

On the other hand, computers can be a source of addiction and inactivity. The majority of people spend the majority of their day sitting in front of a screen. This behavior can lead to sedentary lifestyles, which can later cause serious health issues such as heart disease and obesity. In addition, individuals can become so consumed with their online activities that they forget their real-life relationships.

That being said, I believe the effects of computers on people can be positive or negative depending on the userâ€™s behavior. Computers can be used to increase efficiency and productivity, as long as we do not become obsessed with it. We must all find the balance between our virtual and physical lives and use computers responsibly.

I encourage all your readers to think twice before this amazing technology takes us over.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
