Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my opinion on the widespread use of computers. It is evident that computers are being used in our society more than ever before. From the classroom, to the workplace, to home, computers are integrated into nearly all aspects of our lives.

Though there are many positive aspects to using computers, there are also many potential risks. For example, prolonged use of computers can impact our physical health due to inactivity and poor posture. Additionally, relying on computers to do certain tasks can have an impact on our mental health, causing us to feel frustrated or overwhelmed when a task is not functioning properly.

On a larger scale, computer use has resulted in an increase in jobs that involve solitary work. This can have a serious impact on workers, removing the risk of meaningful relationships from our work lives. It can also cause stress due to increased pressure to remain efficient.

Overall, I believe that computer use must be balanced out with other activities in order to avoid detrimental effects. I am sure that readers will agree that we should ensure that we are using computers safely and in moderation.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
