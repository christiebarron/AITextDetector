I had recently just moved to a new city and I was feeling a bit lonely and out of place. I was trying to adjust to my new life and I was just not sure how I was going to make any real connections in my new home. One day, I was out at the park and I noticed a small group of people playing a game of frisbee. I had always been a fan of frisbee and I decided to join in.

At first, I was really nervous and self-conscious about joining in but I was also really eager to make some connections and to just have some fun. As I tossed the frisbee around, I started to feel more and more comfortable and I even ended up having a few laughs with everyone as they joked around and teased each other. 

Eventually, the hours passed and we all decided to call it a day and go our separate ways. Before each of us went in our respective directions, we all turned to each other with huge smiles and waved goodbye. At that precise moment, I realized that I had made some amazing connections and even though I had just moved here, I already felt like one of the gang. I knew that even though I was still a bit unsettled, I would now be able to make it through my journey in this new city with the help of my new friends and the power of laughter.
