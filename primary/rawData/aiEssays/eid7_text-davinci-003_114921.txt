I remember a time when I had to be extremely patient. I was studying to be a vet and part of my training was to learn how to perform surgery on animals. I was nervous and wanted to get started right away, but I needed to take the time to practice and develop my skills. So I spent a lot of time in the lab, learning the different techniques and doing a lot of practice.

During this process, there were many days where I felt like I was getting nowhere. I wanted to give up and just quit, but I reminded myself that I was doing this for the animals that were counting on me. I stayed patient during this frustrating process and finally, after months of coordinated practice and hard work, I was able to begin performing surgery on actual animals. 

The patience and discipline I demonstrated during this training paid off, and I am grateful I was patient enough with myself to keep pushing forward.
