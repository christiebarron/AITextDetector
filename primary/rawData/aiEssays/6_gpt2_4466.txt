The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

According to the New York Times, the main obstacles were that the dirigibles needed to have an airbag which wasn't even fitted to the building. According to a story published in The Sunday Times, the government needed to pay for those costs. The Times story also notes that there was even a shortage of spare parts for the dirigibles.

The government did not have a plan for how to fund it if it did face criticism from the public.

It would probably be cheaper to build an alternative to the Empire State Building, though, as it could easily be converted into other buildings.
