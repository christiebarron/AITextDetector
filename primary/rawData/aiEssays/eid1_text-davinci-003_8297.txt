Throughout its construction in the 1930s, it was always a priority for those working on the Empire State Building to ensure the skyscraper could accommodate the docking of dirigibles. However, they soon faced numerous obstacles in achieving this; obstacles which were only overcome through the dedication and vision of those involved in the project. 

The most daunting challenge the builders encountered was the sheer height of the Empire State Building. At 1,454 feet, it was far taller than any other man-made structure in the world, and the dirigibles of the time were only capable of reaching about 750 feet. This meant that the designers needed to find a way to ensure the dirigibles could dock safely at such a high altitude. 

The first challenge was choosing a suitable location. Although the ideal spot would have been at the very top of the skyscraper, the designers could not find the space required. It was eventually decided that the mooring mast should be installed on the 86th floor, making it the highest space in the building available.

The second challenge was creating a space that was structurally sound enough to support the weight of a large aircraft. This was achieved by installing a steel frame around the platform and fastening it into the buildingâ€™s reinforced concrete and steel walls. The careful planning paid off, as the mooring mast was able to support a dirigible of roughly 55 tons.

Further obstacles to the process came in the form
