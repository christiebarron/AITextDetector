Dear Editor,

I am writing to voice my opinion on the effects computers have had on people.I believe computers have had a strong and positive impact on how we communicate and interact with each other in modern society.

Through the internet, we are able to make connections and share information with people from all around the world. Computers allow us to access the news, information, and advice, often within seconds. We no longer have to wait days or weeks to get information. We can get it now with the ease of a few clicks.

Also, with the growing use of social media, people are now able to interact with others around the world with a greater level of comfort and ease. We can get connected with like-minded individuals and potentially form relationships with those who live thousands of miles away. It has become much easier to reach out and stay in touch with people we might have otherwise lost touch with.

Furthermore, computers allow us to work and engage in activities that we would not be able to do without them. For example, we are able to write documents, perform calculations, create presentations, and so much more.

In conclusion, I believe that the use of computers can be beneficial to us and that the effects of their implementation in our lives are positive. 

I hope you agree and that the readers are in agreement with me.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
