The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. While in the case that they had the luxury of having a single set of binoculars mounted they often had to change this with a second set. Some builders also have to use a set of four different optical lenses so that one of the binoculars can be mounted, and the other binoculars can be mounted all at once. An example of this is the example shown below. Two different optical lenses, one one-half wavelength and one second wavelength, were used, allowing many more images to be drawn with the single lens than in two different lenses.

The second set of lenses included a second set of binoculars, making the viewfinder of this model of the Empire State Building from where more of the images would be obtained were provided on one and two versions. One-half wavelength binoculars were first sold as the "Degreefinder". These binoculars were not intended to capture much detail, nor were they intended to be used as "vision goggles" and to be used primarily for looking at objects in the sky while still capturing full detail. However, they can be used in the sky as part of an important area for nighttime vision.

Although the views from the building were limited, a great deal was lost from the practice of using binoculars, since the lenses could not be attached to the viewer. The Empire State Building was eventually refurbished by
