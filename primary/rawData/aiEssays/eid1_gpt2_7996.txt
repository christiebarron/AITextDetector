Computers have many effects on people. In order to become more efficient, they are often more efficient because of their better computing speeds. If we work very hard on each part of our computer, one part per second or 1,000 steps per second, we must continually improve it to be able to perform thousands of other tasks.


1.2 This is not a question of computing ability as such. For example, a computer with less processor power is probably better at managing more complex data. We could say that the more a computer does, the better the computer performs. If a computer had a much bigger battery capacity, it would be much more efficient to charge it with batteries. We will say that the more the computer does, the more the battery capacity and more work our computer does. The more energy is applied and the bigger it's power use (or better efficiency), the better the computer performs for a given amount of energy.


One problem with increasing efficiency is that the more power is applied to an area, the less energy it takes to maintain it. To solve this, a processor with greater processing power needs much less energy. If our computer can keep up this increase, our problem is to increase the more power the processor has already applied and maintain it as long as possible so that we can more efficiently process computations. The more power the processor has, the more it needs to maintain.


It is important to note that these "greater computing power" effects
