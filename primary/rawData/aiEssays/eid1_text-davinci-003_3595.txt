I was in the middle of an extremely stressful day at work and I was starting to feel overwhelmed with everything I had on my plate. I took a few minutes to clear my head and, as I was pacing across the office, I heard a short chuckle coming from my coworker's desk. 

It was a strange sound, because it was the middle of the afternoon and everyone else had been so quiet, so I paused to investigate. When I took a closer look, I saw that my coworker was fondly looking back at an old photo of their family. 

Curious, I walked over and asked them what they were looking at. They proceeded to tell me the funny, embarrassing story of how that particular photo had been taken, and before I knew it, the two of us were laughing together: me over the story, and them at the memory of it.

It was the joy that was shared throughout our laughter that I realized how important it wasâ€”even when you're in the middle of the suffocating stress and strain of a long work day, laughter can be the thing that breaks through and refreshes your spirit. 

It's so powerful and, in that moment, I knew that keeping a sense of humor is necessary to get through life. Now, whenever I need a little pick-me-up during the day, I make sure to take a few minutes to tell a joke or share a funny story which reminds me
