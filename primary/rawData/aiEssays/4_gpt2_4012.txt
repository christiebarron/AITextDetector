The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because I feel like you could try to figure out what caused it - just read his reviews.

The story is really nice as a summary: a bunch of things that I've known about my family since college - family members who grew up on vacation and have been with me for a LONG time (both are good things - I've been to my family's funeral home three times - my grandfather died that weekend), and a friend who gave me a bad break from my life and came back to this home after that so I know his things are in better order and I don't feel like he's broken it.

I love it - I still don't see that many characters, but not many issues you feel is too shallow for your typical adult story, which is something I've always loved about Hibiscus. He was pretty serious about this, though, especially with the fact that "the truth" is so important to him - that all his issues were not so different from each other (we may never meet and we may never have the same relationship... you won't know, but Hibiscus had something like that in him and he did nothing to stop you from seeing it). Hibiscus was also very loving about his children, and the fact that he seemed well liked by them seemed to help them because the ones still in her family all seemed to be "willing to be kind", and he cared about them
