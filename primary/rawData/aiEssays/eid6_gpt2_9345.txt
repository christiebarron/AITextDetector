The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One was that there were restrictions on the use of the crane, a mechanism developed by the Chinese government that allows a large crane to climb on to the building floor. (See the New International Film Festival cover story.) Another was a problem with a huge airlock and tower attached to the building.

The American National Building Commission had recently considered building similar things with their own aerial technology but said last year that the lack of a crane and tower meant that the crane wouldn't be permitted. (They had in 2005 planned to build a giant, 12-story, OTHER building on Lake Shore Boulevard.)

For much of its history, the American National Building Commission has had great pride in protecting American interests. For example, in the 1940s, the building was regarded as a major military industrial plant, but for the 1960s government wanted to keep the building open.
