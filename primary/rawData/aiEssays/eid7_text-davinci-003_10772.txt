It was a hot summer day and my little brother and I had been arguing all morning. I was frustrated with him for not listening to my instructions and he was frustrated because he thought I was being too harsh. It was hard to stay calm, but I reminded myself that he was only eight years old and it was alright to be a bit silly at that age. I tried to be understanding and talk to him calmly, explain that he has to take responsibility if he wants to become a better person and that he does not only have to follow instructions, but also think about what is best for himself. 

After a while, he started to understand my point and I could see that he was listening to me. We talked a bit more and I was patient with his questions. I could tell that it was hard for him to express his feelings so I waited for him and tried to encourage him to keep talking. Eventually he was more relaxed and he expressed gratitude for the conversation. 

I was so proud of myself for being patient and understanding even when I was frustrated. It took patience and practice to stay calm and talk through our differences but in the end it was worth it. It felt like a big accomplishment and I'm glad I was patient with my little brother.
