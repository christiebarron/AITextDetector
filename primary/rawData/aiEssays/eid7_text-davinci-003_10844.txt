I was out on a leisurely morning jog around my neighborhood when, all of a sudden, I was stopped in my tracks. A man had come out of his home and started to berate me for being on his property. He was yelling at me from the porch, telling me to go away and never come back.

At first, I was taken aback and was prepared to start a fight. But then, I stopped and chose to take a more patient approach. I took a deep breath and instead of responding with aggression, I calmly said that I was so sorry for being on his property and I had simply not noticed that it had gone a little too far. 

The man stopped shouting and paused for a few seconds, and for a brief moment I thought he was going to continue his rant. But then, he let out a sigh and said it was fine and that I should be more careful in the future. 

I thanked the man for being understanding and continued on with my jog. In that moment, I was glad that I had chosen to be patient instead of giving into my initially instinct to fight back. Not only did it help in the situation itself, but it also taught me to stay calm during difficult situations and not become too angry in the heat of the moment.
