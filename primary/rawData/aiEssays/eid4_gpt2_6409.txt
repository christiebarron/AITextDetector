The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it's a little more comprehensive and the book is more expansive. There is more background information about the characters than any other book on this website and it makes for a worthwhile reading for anyone looking for a good summer look at seasonal events in New Orleans but it also brings out the best in the author. I particularly like this book because it has a very clear focus on the "Migration" and "Redemption" aspects of all the different events that unfold on the New Orleans "Jelly of the Whale". It also includes some great new information about the local government and city government, which can give you an idea of what kind of government you're looking at.

One of my favorite part about this book is how it takes into account the time that lives change on the streets of the city during the summer holidays. The books are really about traveling, travel, and moving in different parts of the city during the summer holidays which I really appreciate for the opportunity to do that.

The rest of this review will be an update just in time for season 19 in a little over a month and then I'll be back down to the beach. Have fun!

Update: A great review (with a bit of fun)!
