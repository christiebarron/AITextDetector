Early in the memoir, Rodriguez tells readers about the emotional and physical spaces of his family home, and how he could place himself in almost any room of the house and feel connected to the people who were also there. The memoir continues as he describes various textures, scents, tastes, and other memories he has of his childhood. The melancholic mood is further compounded by Rodriguez’s thoughts on the impermanence of his childhood memories. He notes that although he can recall vivid details of his childhood, he knows he will eventually lose those memories.

Although Rodriguez is aware of the fleeting nature of his memories, he also reflects on how they have shaped his life and creative process.
