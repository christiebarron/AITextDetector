 

I will never forget the unforgettable laughter shared with a special person in my life. It wasn't our first date, but it was one of those moments that truly bonded us together and made us even closer.

We had been out doing some errands and decided to go out for dinner. It was a small Italian restaurant with the most delicious pasta dishes. We were sitting in the corner perusing the menu, when I noticed an old man walking around with a bouquet of roses. I couldn't help but laugh as he tried picking out which table deserved the flowers. He went from table to table, with the roses in one hand and a menu in the other, before finally deciding we should get the bouquet.

The old man walked up to our table and presented us with the roses. We both broke out into shared laughter - appreciating the moment for its sheer randomness and silliness. The old man seemed to take real joy in seeing us laugh together and bowed out with a warm, grandfatherly grin.

That shared laughter really sealed the deal for us. We knew in that moment that we could always be ourselves around each other and be silly together. To this day, laughter is part of our relationship, even after all these years.
