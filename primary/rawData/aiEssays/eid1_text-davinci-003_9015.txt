Dear Editor,

I write to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. In the modern world, technology use has skyrocketed, particularly that of computers. The use of computers has changed the way people interact, communicate, and work. 

We can all agree that computers have drastically accelerated communication and access to information. This has enabled individuals to become more connected and open-minded, as well as more informed and productive. People can now access the wealth of knowledge and communication tools that only a few decades ago were not available.

However, I believe that computers have also had a negative impact on society. It has reduced people’s attention spans and created disparities between those with internet access and those without. Furthermore, it has distracted people from physical activities and curtailed outdoor activity, leading to a host of health problems.

In conclusion, I believe that computers are a double-edged sword. To take full advantage of them, we must use them responsibly, moderating our reliance so that it doesn’t become overwhelming or unhealthy.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
