I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is not only illegal for journalists, but also unethical and inhumane," said Professor Peter Kowalczewski of the University of Warsaw.

He added: "In his view, it is morally and morally possible that in all instances of censorship and censorship of information to protect our intellectual freedoms, censorship and censorship of information is in fact necessary for the spread of information to all citizens of the society."

It is not clear whether the university agreed with the Polish government on its response. It was unclear whether it would also follow the European Union on its anti-censorship measures.

However, the EU does not like this idea, citing a study of how the European Union could block websites critical of Russian President Vladimir Putin.

In Germany, for instance, universities have a very strict policy toward publications critical of President Trump, such as Breitbart News, The Guardian, The Independent and The Independent Wire.

The University of Hamburg recently took steps to comply with the German court order on Facebook. Its policy at universities is to censor and even downlate some critical books, for example "Black Friday". German authorities have also banned German textbooks with "anti-Muslim" content.
