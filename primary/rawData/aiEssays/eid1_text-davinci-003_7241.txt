In Joe Kurmaski's short story, "Rough Road Ahead," the setting plays an important role in the cyclist's journey. When the cyclist sets off on his ride, he is left feeling excited and ready for an adventure, feeling the freedom of the open road and the beauty that it promises.

However, as his ride progresses, the cyclist's optimism starts to be tested. The setting turns from flat, monotonous roads to steep hills that take an immense physical and psychological toll on the cyclist. This is not what he was expecting, despite knowing the general landscape of the area, and takes a heavy toll on him, both physically and psychologically.

The challenges of the setting also help to push the cyclist forward towards his destination. The inhospitable landscape and the seemingly insurmountable mountains that he climbs, complete with obstacles such as large rocks, ditches, and washouts, all force him to search within himself for the strength and courage to keep going. In the end, he finds the strength to complete his journey.

Overall, the features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist in Joe Kurmaski's story. The setting is initially a source of excitement and optimism for the cyclist, but as the ride progresses, it takes an immense toll on him mentally and physically. However, it is also what fuels him to keep going despite the difficulties, pushing him to his destination.
