I couldn't help but let out a slight chuckle as my friend began to walk away from me. We had just finished arguing about whether or not dinosaurs still existed and I could clearly see that he hadn't convinced me of anything. What made the situation funny however, was the look of exasperation on his face. He kept trying to argue with me, but eventually he just gave up and started walking away.

That's when I couldn't hold back the laughter anymore. I guess the absurdity of the situation had finally caught up with me. He turned around and saw me laughing, and it wasn't long until he started laughing too. We had a good chuckle together and in that moment I felt our friendship strengthen. That's when I realized that laughter really could be the shortest distance between two people.
