It was Christmas Day and I was excited to spend the day with my family — my two kids and my husband — and enjoy a meal together. However, it was far from a perfect day. One of my children was sick, so my husband had to take him to the hospital. I had to stay behind with my other child.

I was filled with dread — I had all of these plans for our special day and now I was facing the possibility that we wouldn't get to enjoy it as a family. That made me sad and frustrated, but I also knew that I had to stay strong and remain patient.

I tried to stay positive and focus on the good things. I took my other child outside to play and just tried to take pleasure in this time with him. I knew too that my husband was working hard to make sure our sick child was taken care of.

Eventually, my husband and the sick child returned. They were both exhausted, but I didn't think about the ruined plans or disappointment; I was just grateful everyone was okay and healthy.

In the end, we enjoyed a lovely meal together, just the four of us. And while it wasn't what I had planned, I was still thankful that we could all be together. That moment reminded me how important it is to stay patient and be thankful for the moments you get, even if they aren't what you were expecting.
