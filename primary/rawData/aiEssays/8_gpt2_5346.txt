One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was around 12 weeks out of school in Southwestern Illinois. The other month I walked into one of my local bars and one of the bouncers began making a joke about why people called their bar a bar, and my voice rose up in anger. I walked through a bar and said I was in some sort of mental hospital where people treat people who talk loud, they treat people who talk dirty. There are people who talk more profusely than others, and it made me feel so helpless. My body screamed. I wasn't conscious until about six or seven that day. Then, six months later, I finally found out that I was cured of all the psychiatric illnesses I was suffering in. I began treatment for a mental illness called bipolar disorder, which is one of my favorite causes of depression. I was just like, "Oooh, I guess I've stopped. Well, it probably wasn't that bad."

You know what, I thought that maybe mental illness can cure the depression and cause normal things? The therapy. The music. The food, and all that? Really? I mean I would've been surprised and depressed if I didn't know that this was something that really affected me so much. I would've said, "Yeah," and maybe I could've been completely supportive. When I first started out, I was so depressed my mom said I could talk about suicide. No one did. I mean
