Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. As we all know, computers have been a part of our lives for several decades now, and with its intimate presence, it affects us individually and collectively.

On a personal level, computers have become an indispensable tool, allowing individuals to remain connected, expand their knowledge, and stay productive. From online learning and working from home to providing an outlet for creativity and entertainment, computers make it easier for people to live their lives. They also offer more efficient ways of managing money, providing mobile banking services, and give people access to a variety of digital resources.

At the same time, I believe people should also take into consideration the potential negative effects of computers. Prolonged exposure to digital media can lead to eye strain, headaches, and insomnia. Additionally, using computers increases the risk of cyber-crimes, hacking, and data breaches. It is vital that people are aware of these potential threats when using technology.

Overall, computers have many advantages and disadvantages, and my opinion is that they should be used with caution. We must be aware of the risks and potential harms they could bring to our lives.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
[Name]
