Narciso Rodriguez’s memoir ‘From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives’ creates a unique and captivating mood that captures the reader’s attention from opening to closing pages. It begins with Rodriguez’s upbringing in the Old Spanish Village of El Barrio in New York City. Rodriguez’s vivid descriptions of his home life on 116th Street, the people, the food, the customs, even the smell of the streets, transports the reader back to a different era.

There is an air of nostalgia and remembrance that lingers throughout the book and is made strong by its many mentions of art forms closely associated with the past. Traditional handcrafts such as needlepoint, tie and dye design, and lace sewing are integral parts for preserving family traditions and Rodriguez honors them. He even includes images of childhood drawings and his fond remembrance of their stories and meanings give the memoir a warm atmosphere.

Rodriguez’s strength of his identity resonates throughout the book and brings an inspiring message of hope and appreciation of our roots. He skillfully weaves together his personal stories of hardship and struggle with his grandmother’s teachings of dedication and perseverance and this creates a powerful sense of purpose.
