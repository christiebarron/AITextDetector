The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it finds an odd little book with a very strange title on it. My theory is that it might just be a prelude to the book, or maybe a clue that could explain the book. It is not about the story or any of the issues (such as being an elf or just something) but rather about the story is the end of a long story, which is a real "meeting of gods".The Book of Thor is pretty well done! It takes place before the events from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs to The Tower of Joy. I would have preferred the same events, but this book is so far over the top with great art, such as the gold statues and the new magical symbols such as dragons, unicorns, or the dragon bones (and it has the whole "world" in this world), there's definitely tons of action and stuff coming together like I expected and really just just a very exciting sequel..It's a wonderful follow up to Winter and is very much a solid sequel and would only be better if there was more new story which came along. But there hasn't been any of that, like, maybe it was Winter saying, "Well I've already been through another one? I've already read that last one!" Or maybe that was Winter saying, "Oh my GOD, you're just wasting my time!" (I think this has something to do with this being a sequel too as
