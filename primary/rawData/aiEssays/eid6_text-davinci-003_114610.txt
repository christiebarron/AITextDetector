Building the Empire State Building was considered an ambitious feat when first proposed during the Roaring Twenties. What made it even more impressive was the owners ambition to build it for aerial mooring of dirigibles, large airships designed to fly passengers across the sky. Even though no such docking facility had ever been constructed, the Empire State Building was fitted with a 200-foot steel mast atop the building which was designed as the mooring system for airships.

It proved to be quite a challenge for the builders of the Empire State Building to engineer a system that could safely house the airships. Large mooring towers with cables strung to the floating vessels had already been in use on the ground, but the architects would have to reconfigure these systems so that the airships could be safely docked along the rooftop of the Empire State Building. It was also necessary to design an automatic system to haul the airships up to the building and to efficiently slow them down so they could be attached to the tower without collision or damage.

To ensure the stability of the mooring mast and the safety of passengers, the engineers had to account for the irregularities of wind conditions that could occur at high altitudes. The construction of the mooring mast had to be resilient enough to survive sudden gusts of wind that could cause the airship to sway erratically. Another major challenge was overcoming the immense pull of the landing cables on the steel mast, which
