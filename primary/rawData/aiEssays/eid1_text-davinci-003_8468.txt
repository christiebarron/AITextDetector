I'll never forget the time a friend of mine asked me for a loan of $500. I had the money but hesitated – this was a lot of money for me. But this friend had no other place to turn, so I agreed to loan the money on the condition that they paid me back in two months.

To my surprise, my friend returned the whole amount with two weeks to spare. They had scrimped and saved every cent to pay me back on time. I was overwhelmed by their patience and diligence.

Most of all, I was impressed by their commitment to keeping their word – dealing with the debt must have taken every ounce of their extra money and time, but they did it.

That experience was a reminder to me that patience and commitment are essential qualities. I hope I can always live up to the same standard of patience as my friend did.
