I remember a time when I was particularly patient. My teacher had assigned an essay that was due a few weeks later, but I had completely forgotten about it in the chaos of my daily life. 

The day before it was due, I realized I hadn't even started it. I was filled with panic and my stomach dropped. I felt like I wasn't going to be able to finish the essay on time. Instead of giving in to my anxiety, I took a deep breath and started to write. 

For hours, I worked without pause, using all the knowledge and resources I had. I didn't allow myself to get overwhelmed and instead worked through the task patiently. 

I was exhausted and relieved when I finally finished. I had remained patient despite the stressful time limit and felt proud of what I had achieved. 

Sometimes all we can do is take a deep breath and work through difficulties. Patience is a powerful tool in any situation.
