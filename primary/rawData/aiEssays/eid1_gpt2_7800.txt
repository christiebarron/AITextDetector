Computers have many effects on people. Whether they succeed or fail, the influence or importance it has on others grows. With the right combination of technology and culture, the world's best systems have the ability to create much-needed systems for their own use or to improve the efficiency of existing systems.

Our goal in our research is to show what's possible with an approach that puts human psychology and behavior on a larger canvas. We are trying to draw attention to some of the common causes of our problems.

As a part of our survey of our readers, we analyzed the results of data collection between 2011 and 2014, which revealed three major areas of public concern: 1) social media use, 2) computer programming, and 3) the use of technology. Our research has found that, even with the best of both worlds, our society is on a downward trajectory of increased consumption of social media.

Research results from 2011 and 2014 showed that only a small percentage of Americans, who are between the ages of 18 and 24MHz, used social media. In other words, they were not using social media for personal use. This suggests that the best solution for reducing our use of social media is education.

What we found after our analysis is that:

1) we consume less online

And, at the same time, we consume less

We consume more

2) we live more in cities

And, our digital landscape continues to grow
