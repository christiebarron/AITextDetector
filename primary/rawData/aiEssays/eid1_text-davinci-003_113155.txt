Dear Editor,

I am writing to provide my opinion on the effects of computers on people. I believe computers have had a profound impact on the lives of people from all walks of life.

In virtually every job today, computers are invaluable tools for staying organized and productive. They make it easier for people to communicate and access information faster than ever before. They also enable businesses to generate more revenue, increasing job opportunities and boosting the local economy.

Computers have also opened up a world of new possibilities for creativity and expression. As graphic design, music production, and writing are all made easier and more efficient with computers, people of all ages have the opportunity to create art, share their voice and express their views in a way that was never possible before.

Finally, computers have made it possible for people all around the world to easily communicate and share ideas, which has helped promote understanding between different cultures. This has made the world a more connected place and has offered a greater sense of empathy and understanding of the shared experiences and values of all people.

For these reasons I believe that computers have greatly enhanced peopleâ€™s lives and will continue to do so in the future.

Sincerely,

[Name]
