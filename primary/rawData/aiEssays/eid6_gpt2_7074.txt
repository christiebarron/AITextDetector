Construction began in 1913 in Manhattan as a group of small, single-story homes, which took to the streets within hours of each other. The buildings proved expensive in many cases and made up a part of the city. One was known as the Empire State Buildings of New York, a landmark to be known as New York City landmarks.

As the economy contracted and wages and living standards soared, the building was forced to sell, and in 1913 it began construction without a certificate of occupancy. By 1923, the Empire State Buildings (now the Statue of Liberty), which are the largest building structure in the world as well as America's most famous building at Washington Square Road, were still in use, though many tenants still continued to build them.

The building had been planned for 18,000 people, but as of July, the building was over and had no further tenants. Two of the surviving buildings, the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty, were located in the city at a different location, and are known as the National Park Service (NPS) and City of D.C. (Pasadena).

The building is one of the largest commercial buildings in America
