Dear Editor, 

As technology advances, computers have become an essential part of our day-to-day lives. It is no secret that computers can be incredibly useful, but it would be naive to deny the potential risks of too much computer use.

Though computers can be a great resource for education and research, their overuse can have many downsides for peopleâ€™s mental well-being. Studies have shown that too much time spent on a computer or in front of a screen can lead to problems such as depression, isolation, and lack of physical activity. Additionally, increasing numbers of computer games and online activities, while entertaining, can be addictive and lead to negative behavioral tendencies.

I believe the general public should be more aware of the effects that computers can have on their health and relationships. We should encourage a balanced approach to computer use, involving physical activity and face-to-face socialization. Banning or limiting computer use can have its place, but can also alienate and demoralize children and teens. We should insist on more regulated guidelines for responsible computer use, especially for children and young adults, so they can still benefit from computer use and avoid its adverse effects.

I am sure
