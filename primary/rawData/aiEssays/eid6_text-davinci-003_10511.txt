 

The idea of the Empire State Building having a mooring mast for airships to dock was a bold and ambitious project. Such a plan posed unique challenges and obstacles due to the structure and appearance of the building. Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted's book, The Mooring Mast, tells the story of the dreamers and builders who tried to make that vision a reality.

At the core of the challenge was how to construct a stable and secure docking station for airships to dock with minimal risk of damage to the building. The architects had to be creative in finding a solution for securely attaching such a large docking mast to the building without compromising its structural integrity. Additionally, allowing an airship to dock on the building would mean it needed to protrude significantly above the building and potentially obscure the stunning sight lines the building was designed for.

True to their ambitious nature, the builders of the Empire State Building were determined to create a docking mast despite the obstacles. Ultimately, they devised a solution that involved the top of the mast sitting on the top of the building while being secured to the ground 475 feet below. This unprecedented engineering feat allowed the airship to approach the top of the Empire State Building and have a secure mooring point without disrupting the building's appearance or introducing unnecessary dangers.

In spite of all the obstacles, the builders of the Empire State Building were determined to make their dream of a mooring mast for airships a reality. It
