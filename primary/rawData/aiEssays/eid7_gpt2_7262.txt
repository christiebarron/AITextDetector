An example of a time someone in my life was patient was someone I just asked him about because he was very passionate and worked really hard for years. He was a great teacher and was super happy there and really loved it! Everyone I would ever love working for is still a family. They are so much closer to me I just know it's only ever in their hearts that I will be able to get the best for them. If there ever is someone you can meet in your life that would you think wouldn't be so desperate to get in touch with you and get away from any of the negativity around your friends and family, that's all I can think of. That is love!

One of my biggest loves as a parent is seeing every single person that comes along and loves them. It is amazing to be able to see the people I love so that all of you can fall in love, be in love with them, love them by their side if that's your desire. No matter what a person says about you if it is not your wish, or what they say to your heart, there is always people that I love.

One of my big goals is to be a part of your family for 20 years. How has the whole process taught you anything REUTERS: http://www pistas.net/news/peter-s-hometown-family-says-humbling-parent-to-be-found-for-new-friend/
