Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. First of all, if you are in or near the city centre on Rondo Road or in between Rondo Walk and Atherton, Rondo Road will not be your destination. Second, roads and streets are largely unconnected, meaning there is no guarantee that you will never get in the way of a pedestrian or cyclist. The most recent census figures show 583,000 cyclists in this area had travelled to work on a regular basis over the last 11 years and that their average weekly commute (per day) on those roads was over 11. I personally encourage a good sense of punctuality and to take the time to check out one of the good cycling sites. One of the more popular places for visitors will be Tack-Off Park in South London, where a bicycle is required to enter, as well as the famous Green Road Station on the far side of Southwark.

As with roads, there is an alternative route to the city centre. If you are travelling on a bike in the city centre or to other parts of the city then you can follow along that bike and arrive in the city centre safely. If you are travelling in the south-eastern outskirts of London the route will be a bit different, and it will be difficult to find other cyclists travelling from that direction. Some places will have a separate bikeway, and that will make it easier for cyclists to get on and
