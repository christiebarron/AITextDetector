Dear Editors,

In today’s world, computers and the internet are becoming increasingly important and have an impact on our lives in ways that weren’t imaginable before. But in the midst of the computer revolution, there is a debate about the effects computers have on people. I would like to present my opinion on this topic and to persuade your readers to agree with me.

From my perspective, computers have significantly improved our lives and increased our productivity in many aspects. Today, computers are used in almost every field - from medical diagnosis to manufacturing and from advertising to accounting. This has allowed us to achieve results with greater accuracy, speed, and efficiency than ever before. Furthermore, with the advent of the Internet, we now have quick access to almost any information we want, enabling us to make informed decisions faster.

But while computers do bring many benefits, there are some potential negative effects. The most obvious danger is the hours of inactivity that sitting in front of a computer can bring. Without proper exercise, people risk damaging their posture, developing severe muscular and joint ailments, and putting on excess weight. In addition, computers can be used to access inappropriate content that can be harmful to children.

In conclusion, while computers can be beneficial, we need to be careful about how we use them and consider the potential downsides. With proper awareness and approach, we can reap the most out of these machines without compromising our health.

Sincerely,
