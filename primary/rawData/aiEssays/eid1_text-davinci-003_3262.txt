Dear Editor:

The proliferation of computers, the internet and technology have made our lives faster and more efficient. There is no doubt that these advances have opened up a new world of possibilities and life would be drastically different without them. However, these technological advances also have a downside.

As most of us are aware, spending too much time in front of a computer can lead to physical, mental, and emotional health issues, including computer vision syndrome, headaches, neck and backaches, and poor concentration. Even though these conditions may not be immediately life-threatening, they can still have a major impact on day-to-day life.

In addition to physical health issues, computers can also cause psychological problems such as distraction from reality, decreased social interaction, and increased addiction. Spending too much time on the computer can be just as damaging as spending too much time in front of the TV.

We should carefully consider how much time we spend online and the effects it is having on our physical and mental health. We should strive to limit our computer usage and ensure that we are taking necessary breaks from our screens; otherwise, the convenience of the computer can become our own detriment.

I urge readers to carefully monitor
