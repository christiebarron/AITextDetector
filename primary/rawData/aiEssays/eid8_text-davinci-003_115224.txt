I had been seeing my boyfriend for a few months and we were looking forward to our first real vacation vacation together. We were both so excited to explore a new place together, and couldn't wait to create some amazing memories. 

We were lying on the beach, just soaking up the warm sunshine when my boyfriend spotted something in the surf and said, "Hey, look at that!" I followed his gaze and saw an old canoe gliding on the waves in a circle. We both burst out laughing at the boat's silly antics, and the laughter just seemed to grow and grow. 

In that moment, I felt closer to my boyfriend than ever before. We just kept laughing until it seemed like there was nothing else in the world, all I could feel was that connection between us. It was an amazing feeling that I will never forget. Laughter truly did bring us together.
