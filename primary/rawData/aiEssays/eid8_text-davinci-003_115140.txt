I was hanging out with a friend I hadn't seen in months. We started catching up on each other's lives and talking about the annoyances of our jobs. In trying to explain a funny situation involving a coworker to her, I got so caught up in the story that I completely lost track of what I was saying. All I could do was laugh and shake my head, and my friend couldn't help but join in.

We laughed and laughed until tears were streaming down our faces. We both had to catch our breath was we shared every detail of the ridiculousness of the story.

It felt amazing to be able to sit with a friend and just laugh and be silly together. It was like all of those conversations we had were able to come full circle with this wonderful moment of laughter. We joked about how silly the situation had been, and it reminded us of all the good times we had shared together.

From that moment on, I could see the beginnings of a true friendship forming. We started bonding over shared stories of our jobs, our families, our hobbies, and much much more.

It felt great to rekindle our friendship through laughs and shared moments of misunderstanding and ridiculousness. It not only showed me how close we really were, but it also showed me how much laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people.
