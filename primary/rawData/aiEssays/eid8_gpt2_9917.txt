One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was watching my mother smile on her dog. She said, while she was still in her head saying it meant she is smiling, and I said,

"Why don't you tell me why you like to say that?"

She knew it meant I liked it. I didn't tell her and did what she wanted to tell me. We didn't talk to each other ever since, because she called one day when I was watching my mother laughing.

You could also say that you were just looking out for my parents. They were very good to me.

There are a bunch of different things out there that I'm trying to say here, but one is that being an adult is not as important as working in a bar because you don't have to be at home all the time.


- This is how I grew up and how my sister lives with her dad!

- This is how I grew up, but how we live our lives has changed and sometimes I like hearing people say things that aren't true.


I was raised with an incredibly supportive family and it also means that in the first place, I am learning a lot.

And when I'm doing some research on my life choices and not just going "I want to have the perfect life, I just want to live that all of my problems and that life has nothing to do with me," it's more fun
