The construction of the Empire State Building in 1931 is a classic example of human ingenuity and resourcefulness. It stands today as a testament to the technological prowess humans possess. However, few people are aware of the unique set obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced regarding nearby dirigible docking.

The Empire State Building was planned to be an incomparable work of art—one that would feature a unique design element—a mooring mast for large dirigibles. The presence of mooring mast transformed the iconic building into the city’s skyline distinctively.

The construction of this mast proved to be difficult and time consuming. As Marcia Amidon Lüsted details in her article, “The Mooring Mast,” the Empire State Building had to adhere to strict safety standards, which presented a number of obstacles for the builders. The mast had to be constructed using only the highest quality metal and building materials. It had to be able to withstand strong winds and thick cloud cover, as well as be able to bear the weight of mooring a huge dirigible.

Additionally, the builders faced issues of cost and time. Since the construction of the mast was so unique and complex, it took longer than expected and cost more money than the builders budgeted. The mast also had to be seamless, which meant the work was intensive and had to be completed with extreme accuracy. This pushed the projected completion date of the Empire State Building even
