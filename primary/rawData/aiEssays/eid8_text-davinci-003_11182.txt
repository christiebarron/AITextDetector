My best friend and I had been childhood friends since kindergarten. We had been through thick and thin with each other, and recently we had been spending more and more time together. One day, we decided to do something crazy and take a spontaneous road trip. 

The trip started off relatively normal until one fateful stop at a small gas station. After we filled up the tank, we started getting a bit mischievous and started browsing the store. We discovered a few really funny items, but the one that really caught our attention was an inflatable inner tube with a chicken riding on top wearing goggles. We both couldn't help but laugh at the strange and adorable Item.

The clerk eyed us suspiciously, and I thought for sure he would say something to put a damper on our comedy routine. Unexpectedly, he started laughing too. We continued to joke around with each other and the clerk, and before we knew it we had struck up a great conversation. 

By the end of the trip we still hadn't been able to find any use for the inner tube with the chicken on top, but that didn't seem to matter. The laughter that we had together that day at that strange little gas station was something that we would remember for the rest of our lives. We had shared an unforgettable moment that reminded us of the importance of laughter between two people.
