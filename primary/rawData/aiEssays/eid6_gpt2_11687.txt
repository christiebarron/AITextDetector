Construction of the Pentagon began on April 2, 1958 to produce the first of a series of high-definition pictures of the building's exterior.

(I would also like to thank David Hochschild, Executive Director of Liberty, and Bill Paley, President of the American Public Affairs Committee, who helped make this happen.)

The exhibit is the centerpiece of the Liberty exhibition, scheduled to include a documentary on a number of key characters in this generation, including the architect Joseph Kennedy, who will direct the film.
