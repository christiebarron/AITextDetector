The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because the authors have to go so far as not to write anything that could be considered a foreward step.

When all of a sudden, at a certain point of time, such a person has no choice but to enter into the "other world," they leave a message, a warning. What follows then is a story with some foreshadowing, that some of us are even less sure of.
