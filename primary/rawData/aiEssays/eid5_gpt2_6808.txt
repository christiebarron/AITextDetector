The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is reminiscent of what happened to the British Columbia MP and mother of four, Yvonder Williams. What she says took place before her life and it was a matter of time before her death.

Mr. Williams, 32, said, "I was taken out of town and I felt like I wasn't doing my job anymore," he recalled. "And I can still feel it. My mother used to come into my house and call, 'Are you done?'"

Her husband, John Vickers, 42, said after the shooting, his wife and they would spend their Thanksgiving Thanksgiving, May 31st in the basement of the family's house. Ms. Williams described the house as "chic, clean, elegant" and "completely without signs of war."

But his daughter Yvonne, who became a leader of the student movement and worked closely with young people in their community, said she and her husband were shocked at this horrific act.

"He loved us, he loved us dearly," she said.

The violence began when Mr. Vickers fired two shotgun shells at the building and then fled. The gunfire lasted nearly ten minutes before he was killed or wounded by a bullet. The couple said he didn't have a weapon when he had his first gunshot during the shooting andVenkatesh Narayan Singh, 29, described him as a "lover."
