One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I found out that your grandmother used to stand in the street every day for a while. I got the feeling that they've forgotten about you.

You know that girl, the one who made it into the TV show (and she is a real girl) when she was a child? I think she's a huge fan of being a television star…

Thank you… she can't help herself. What makes her more than just a TV star? She's a true, honest person.

What happens to a character like that, when she's in such a tough situation, and you just give them peace and love?

Well, in a lot of cases, she's out of a job so she'll have to carry on being real.

Now, your mom and dad would rather have their children living as family than watch TV. How do you feel being that important?

It is a very important step in life.

So you're the hero of some sort, and your parents are the hero of almost everyone?

I think it speaks volumes. supply and demand is hard to deal with.

We've been talking about that a lot, and I think I'll always have that moment, that I'll say: "You're gonna be the hero of the world!" Thank you very much.

Oh! Okay. I'll look forward to those next two emails,
