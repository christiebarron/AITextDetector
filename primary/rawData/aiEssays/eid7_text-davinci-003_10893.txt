I was visiting my grandfather recently and he was in a surprisingly good mood. He was telling me funny stories and jokes that I had heard before, but I wanted to make him happy and was grateful for his presence in my life. 

At one point, he asked me to help him open a jar of jam. It was notoriously difficult, with a stubborn lid and slippery glass jar. I struggled and struggled for what felt like forever, trying to create leverage and make it easier to unscrew. 

My grandfather noticed my difficulty and instead of getting irritated at my ineptitude, he put his hand on my shoulder and said, "Take your time, young one." His patience was reassuring and his words of encouragement helped me find the strength I needed to open it. 

In the end, I was triumphant and the jar was opened. But it was the patience and understanding my grandfather had in those moments that stuck with me more than anything.
