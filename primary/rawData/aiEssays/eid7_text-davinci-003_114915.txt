I clearly remember the day I was late to a meeting with my boss. It was one of the most important meetings of my career, but I had underestimated the bumper-to-bumper morning traffic. I was ten minutes late when I finally reached the office. Rather than getting angry, my boss simply nodded and said, "I'm glad you made it. Get yourself a cup of coffee, take a seat and we'll get started."

I was really embarrassed but at the same time, I was relieved that he was so patient. He could have reprimanded me for not being punctual, but instead he just shared a friendly smile and eased the tension. He took the extra time to make sure I was comfortable and gave me space to start the meeting on my own terms. I really appreciated his understanding nature and patience in that moment.
