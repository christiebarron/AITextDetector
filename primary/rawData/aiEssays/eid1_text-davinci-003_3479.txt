Dear Editor, 

I am writing to share my opinion on the effects computers have on people. It is my belief that computers have had an overwhelmingly positive impact on our lives. With increasing computer technology, the world is becoming more connected, allowing us to network and collaborate across all continents and cultures. Computers have also opened up new avenues of knowledge by providing us with easy access to vast amounts of information. 

By using computers, people can become more productive in their everyday tasks. Computers can automate many processes, making it much easier to process data or create documents. This saves time and effort that would otherwise get taken up in manual processes. Furthermore, the internet allows us to connect with people from all over the world and participate in international conversations. This opens up many opportunities for learning that weren't available before. 

Despite being beneficial, computers can also be detrimental if used unwisely. Prolonged use of computer screens can cause eye strain, and poor posture when using a computer can lead to neck pain and headaches. Additionally, using a computer for too long can cause people to become disconnected from reality, leading to physical and mental stress. 

Given the compelling evidence in favour of computers,
