I recently witnessed an act of patience that stuck with me. I was at the grocery store and saw an elderly man who was having difficulty making his way through the store. He was slowly making his way to the checkout lane when an employee approached him and offered help. The elderly man politely declined, stating that he was capable of getting himself around and that as long as he was taking his time, it would be alright. I couldn't help but admire his resolve. The employee continued to follow the elderly man, offering assistance but again the man politely declined. Eventually the elder man made it to the checkout lane and began to unpack his goods. 

The checkout line was long but no one complained or rushed the man. Everyone just stood quietly and patiently waiting their turn, content to let the elderly man take as long as he needed. I was so impressed by this and the patience everyone displayed for the elderly man. It's something I won't soon forget.
