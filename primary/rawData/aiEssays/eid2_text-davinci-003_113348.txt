Introduction 

Public libraries are a critical pillar of our society, providing education and entertainment opportunities for millions of people around the world. Unfortunately, as libraries evolve to stay relevant, they are facing a tough question: should they allow for the censorship of certain materials? In this essay, I will present evidence that public libraries should not censor materials, even if some of them are found offensive. 

Paragraph 1 

The most important argument against censorship in public libraries is that it undermines freedom of expression, a cornerstone of our democratic and open society. Libraries are places of learning and knowledge – books, magazines, and movies are all vehicles to fuel the curiosity of the public to acquire information and knowledge. Censorship of certain books, movies, and music fundamentally impedes on people’s right to access information and knowledge in an open and free way. 

Paragraph 2

Another issue with censorship in libraries is that it adds complexity for library staff and risks being overly restrictive. Library staff must carefully review, label, and remove any material deemed offensive, creating an additional and unnecessary workload for them. Furthermore, if things become overly restrictive, having to label and review every material in a library could end up inhibiting free exploration in the library. 

Paragraph 3 

Ultimately, libraries should strive to promote free expression and access to knowledge. Although certain materials may contain offensive language and visuals, libraries should look for solutions to address offensive materials
