The Empire State Building was an ambitious feat of engineering with the goal of its developers to make it the world’s tallest building at the time. However, it had one unique feature– a 200 foot tall spire constructed specifically for the purpose of accommodating dirigibles at the top. In “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the obstacles builders encountered in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building are discussed.

The first obstacle was that the docking mast had to be made especially strong in order to accommodate the heavy weight of the dirigible. To do this, the developers constructed the spire out of steel, due to the fact that it was the strongest material of the time, and also because regular steel had been perfected. Creating a spire with steel was challenging because of the resistance to work with it and the specific form it needed to be crafted into in order to hold a dirigible.

The next obstacle was the balloons. The builders had to carefully design the docking mast to ensure that it was the correct size and appropriate shape for the dirigible to attach to it for safe mooring. To do this, the Empire State Building designers needed to collect accurate information about the various types and shapes of dirigibles that were in use at that time.

In order for the Empire State Building to accommodate all different types of dirigibles, the developers had to construct a network of cables and
