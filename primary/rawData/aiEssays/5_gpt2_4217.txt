The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' in the 1960s was, 'You're going to never do anything good. Everything you've done over the past 30 years, you've done over the past 100 years â€“ you've worked hard, worked hard a lot to get what you want and you've achieved what you really wanted.'

The British novelist John Ashbery put that to the test in his 1964 essay about his life in Washington, D.C.: 'I didn't like what I read and didn't like what I did. All of this. All this. It was hard, but that was the truth. I wanted that story told.'

There were also political and emotional scenes. Ashbery was a socialist, an architect who once voted for the US Democratic Party. Ashbery has called Sanders' candidacy 'historic'.

The book's title, 'A New Life: A Memoir', is part of a new memoir series. It was written for the magazine that launched in 1971 and was translated into 13 languages into English.

The book will go on sale in April 2018.
