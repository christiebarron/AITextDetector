An example of a time someone in my life was patient was at that point in my life when they were very frail and had a long illness. I felt very anxious about the loss of my child and felt very happy about my own little place. I don't know how she felt, what sort of depression I had, how I felt. I've never been too lonely, I have a very strong and loving family. I don't think there was anything wrong with one of my children, just my family, and I didn't know that I would have to tell my life partner of someone with a different diagnosis but I felt like there wasn't. I've done everything I could have to save her, and I just felt that she needed someone that was not in my life.


I do feel I was in a really lonely place and this family, if it is all right for you, that's it. That's a shame, you know, but if it is wrong or uncomfortable to you in that way, then the world can be more forgiving to you. Your family did their best to please you, when I was younger, at one time, but I do think if they want to keep you in this position of being an outcasts and part of these weird, and HOLLYWOOD, things of this nature, then, I think that's right. It's no longer OK to be left behind.
