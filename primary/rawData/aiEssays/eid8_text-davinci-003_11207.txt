It was my first date with Brad and we had agreed to meet at a comedy show downtown. We'd been corresponding online for weeks and were finally about to meet in person. 

When I arrived, I saw him standing at the door with a bouquet of flowers. I couldn't help breaking into a smile and soon we were both laughing. We made our way to our seats in the theater, still chuckling. 

The show began and it seemed like the comedians were out to impress us. They were hilarious and we were laughing wildly at their jokes. 

At one point during the show, Brad reached over and took my hand in his. It felt electrifying and I couldn't stop smiling. We were both laughing so much that we didn't pay much attention to the acts. 

It felt like we were the only two people in the room. The show eventually ended and we made our way out. The theater was quiet, but we were still bubbling with laughter. 

The date had gone better than either of us had expected, and our laughter threatened to carry us into the night. We smiled all the way home, and I knew then that we had something special. 

Laughter had brought us together that night, and I knew it would remain an important part of our relationship.
