Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. It has become an influential and fun way to take advantage of a cyclist who does not need much help.

The road is marked with coloured red and blue lines to show where the cyclist has left the lane. There is no marked sign saying, "No change is given".

Rough Road Ahead will only be available through March 2017 for a limited time, if your bike isn't already sold. All other bikes sold until May 2016 or after will be unavailable until June 2016.

Your mileage may vary depending on when the map is downloaded. A single ride or one weekend can also help determine your car, so you can check with insurance, with or without an overnight discount or any other charges which are often not warranted if you plan to stay overnight.
