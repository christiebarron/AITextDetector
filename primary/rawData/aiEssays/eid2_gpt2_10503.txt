I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a public nuisance in an international community and that the government has been making a big effort and is a public nuisance in a democratic society. It's time for the government to take seriously that, because what they do is to censor literature and not to have any right to a right to a book," he said.

Mukherjee also referred to the decision of the Delhi Government on Tuesday to hold a second judicial hearing on the matter of whether books should be placed in a library. The Bombay High Court heard arguments in an appeal brought by New Life publisher and artist Ramit Sethi. The panel ruled that the district court does not need to hear a case involving books written by Sethi about the death of Salman Rushdie after the Indian Express, the newspaper of a prestigious Indian book imprint, ran a series of online comments alleging that he had made the suicide-suicide the focal point of a conspiracy between Salman Rushdie and a number of other Pakistani artists. The court also heard arguments in relation to the matter of the rights of authors of critical books.

"The judgment of the district court in the case has the force of law and, accordingly, it orders a further second judicial hearing on this matter. If this case is taken seriously, it could bring about an improvement in the situation for these writers, writers in general, whose writings often suffer from such a public nuisance," Mukherjee said.
