Dear Editor,

I'm writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have had on people. As technology has tremendously increased in our society, the effects of computers have been both beneficial and detrimental to our lives. While computers have allowed us to work more efficiently and stay connected with colleagues, friends, and family, they can also lead people to feel anxious and stressed out. 

On the one hand, the convenience of computers has made our lives easier in many ways. We can access numerous websites, conduct research quickly, and communicate with people instantly. This has opened up many job opportunities, allowing us to work remotely and even start businesses of our own. It has also helped us stay connected with family and friends even if they're miles away, allowing us to share memories and moments that would've been otherwise difficult.

On the other hand, computers can have negative effects on our lives. Many people become so obsessed with multitasking on digital devices that they forget to be present in the moment. They don't bother to enjoy the outdoors or connect with other people face-to-face. Even worse, staring at digital screens for extended periods of time can lead to mental health issues such as stress and depression.

As we can see, computers provide us with great convenience, but we can't forget to take breaks and enjoy our lives. We should use technology as a tool to help us, not something we rely on too heavily.

Sincerely,
