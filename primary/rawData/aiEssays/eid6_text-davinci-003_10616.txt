One challenge was the limited space available for the construction of the Mooring Mast, the spire on top of the Empire State Building that would serve as a docking structure for dirigibles. There was only a small portion of the buildingâ€™s roof available to construct the spire, and it had to be durable enough to safely support the immense weight of an airship. In addition, the mast had to be tall enough so the dirigibles could approach it while taking into account the surrounding buildings and structures.

Finding a way to attach a successful mooring device to the mast was also a major obstacle. A design created by the architectural firm Shreve, Lamb, and Harmon included an intricate system of cables and pulleys with weights and counterweights, but the challenge was making sure that this system would safely and securely hold a dirigible in place during docking. Engaging the services of aeronautical engineers and consultants, the architects rigged the mast with an array of cables and swing-arms that ran along the spire and connected to a slowly revolving frame serving as the mooring device.

It was also difficult to find a dirigible that was large enough to safely dock at the Empire State Building and capable of using the mooring system. Apart from being an impressive spectacle, the airships had to be
