The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

The earliest known use of the technology was in the early 20th century in Germany. In the 1930s, German engineers led the process of building the Empire State Building in a tunnel using a pipe. The tunnel was first sealed in 1940 after a mass fire, while this device allowed the steel from the tunnel to easily be removed.

Despite these flaws, the tunnel was not destroyed during World War II. Today, tunnels are used by aircraft carriers and for roads in Europe and North America where they are typically used in military aircraft.
