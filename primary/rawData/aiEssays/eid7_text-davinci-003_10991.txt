One time, I was in an elevator with my aunt and my two young cousins, who were both very excited and loudly exclaiming about everything they saw. I was getting a bit frustrated, but I remembered to take a breath and stay patient. 

I reminded myself that children get excited easily and I put on a smile to keep my frustrations at bay. My aunt noticed my patience and thanked me. My cousins also noticed and started calming down.

Eventually, the elevator doors opened and all of us were able to exit. By keeping my patience, I was able to maintain a peaceful and calm environment in the elevator. It was a lesson in perseverance that I'll always remember.
