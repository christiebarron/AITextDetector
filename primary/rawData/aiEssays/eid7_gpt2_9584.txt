An example of a time someone in my life was patient was after an extremely unpleasant experience while working as a health secretary.

'After the initial shock, I went to talk to the boss and he became very upset.

'I told him to go back to life and to do his job but he wanted to work for the NHS.

'He also told me that if I went back to work at the same time, I could only join the NHS, but I thought to yourself: my life didn't matter if he was going franchises.

'He's now being blamed for the sickness.'

A spokesperson for Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: 'We are grateful to the individual who gave her the advice that she did and to our colleagues.

'The Government will continue to support any group of people affected by the GP practice if we can find the appropriate resources to provide them the care they need to do their jobs.
