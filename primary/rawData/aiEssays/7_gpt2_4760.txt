An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when we had her face-painting project done on her own personal computer. Her first few days of life, she would never leave her computer, and she was so happy with her computer that the next day she started to have more problems using it - a number from about her five hours, to about six hours a day.

"Once the project was completed, she thought I could use it. She realised she was really good at it and thought she could do more. She made it better for me, for me. A good person.

"When I went from being someone who didn't use computers to being somebody who worked. And then it was because you get into work where you start feeling bad about it, and I was like 'I don't want to work any more'. So I found a therapist, who helped me and made me feel safe, happy and motivated to continue.

"I just started to feel better for it. That's the kind of person you need to be mentally.

There is no substitute for motivation to stay engaged and motivated in life.

"I think it's very important it's not just your time you give to others - it's your life.

"Being part of someone else's life is as much you as they.

"My therapist and family members say there are a lot of 'thank yous' all the time.
