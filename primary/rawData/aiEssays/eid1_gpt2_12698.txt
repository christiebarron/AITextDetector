It should also be noted that at the early level, computers weren't really "computer-generated." Those machines were made with high-level instructions in simple, easy to understand programming languages; now, they're just instructions to build computers. The main thing is that technology advances exponentially as time advances. The big thing is that people are still coming up with new things to think about. There are still thousands of programs in the software community at large. You would have to start getting your hands on software from time immemorial to understand what's going on with this new technology. People might talk about data privacy in general, but more and more computers are giving it up.
