The Empire State Building was an impressive feat of engineering at the time of its completion in 1931. In a highly ambitious endeavor to allow dirigibles and other airships to dock at the 102 story tower, engineers faced many obstacles. This essay explores some of the technical challenges that builders encountered while attempting to make the Empire State Building an airship dock.

The most significant challenge posed to the Empire State Building engineers was the structural strength of the tower. To accommodate the airships, the building had to be reinforced to withstand the weight of the airships as they anchored to the mast, or mooring. This required extensive steel reinforcement added to the steel skeleton of the building. The structural strength of the tower was further tested by the need to construct a mast to act as a docking point for the airships. Thus, a specially designed mast had to be erected and integrated into the buildingâ€™s structural plans.

The placement of this mast was another obstacle the Empire State Building engineers faced. It had to be placed in an area that did not obstruct the view or interfere with other floors in the building. To do this, it was decided to place the mast in between the 80th and 81st floors, erasing the total square footage that could have been used as convention space. This took up valuable space and created further structural challenges.

The final obstacle posed to the Empire State Building engineers was the magnitude of the technical problems that had to be solved in order
