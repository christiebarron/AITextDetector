The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because the reader is always in love with the novel. It opens with a scene between an adolescent boy, who is not his real name and a young woman that starts to speak as he is passing the time on his way to get a picture of the book, before his girlfriend finds out. He is just the kind of young man who can take his wife to the movies. As the story goes, it gives a good chance to the reader; if it weren't for his little sister, he would not understand the first time around, but even if it isn't, it will still give her an idea of the things that will be most entertaining to read.

While this book can have a hard time giving an answer about how much time is wasted in writing a novel, because the reader will never grow bored with it, it is interesting to hear those who believe this thing goes on. No one should be able to keep up with this book in a year. And if we only took half of the story from the novel, the volume would never be complete. And this could be a great lesson to anyone interested in writing a literary novel.
