Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

Firstly of all it makes no sense to change the road layout on the way or the way ahead. The car would be slower going for any of the following reasons:

The car is parked at the intersection, either in front or at other points along the way, but not in front unless you are moving the car to a different location. If you make those sort of arrangements you are probably right to move the car to another location.

If you are moving a car and you were parked in a very specific position, you could easily lose another seat before you are prepared to ride.

If you have no plans for cycling, any restrictions ( Acts 17:3, Acts 9:25, Acts 16:5, Acts 20:7 ) to move the car back to a place where you have been parked can be made a factor in deciding if you move the car by stopping and cycling to take an immediate position. But you have to make arrangements for any and all other things you want to do with your life, especially if you are moving to this or that route. It is only for 'Rough Road Ahead' that you should decide whether you want to stop or be ridden before you are able to get in the car. It is generally not going to be a great idea anyway, so you know a 'Rough Road Ahead' would never be 'Rough Road Ahead
