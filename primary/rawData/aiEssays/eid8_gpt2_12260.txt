One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I went to the train that I made the connection between the two of you (to be honest). I told you I am a real person and that this conversation is with you. I'm sorry, no, nothing went smoothly. I have been going through some issues of my life. I have gone through a lot of things. I was just so scared when I went to the station for my training here. After I train with you I felt great. I was like a little kid. I got good enough to do homework and a lot of stuff, I would go to the train just to get better every day. Maybe I could go to classes. I have just been going back and forth between you guys for some time now. And now, you're with me. I've been having fun. I'm excited. I am going to go to classes and do my own thing with nothing to do with you guys. If I can do the thing that I can do without you guys, then I'm so happy. You guys love me and I know our relationship could be very good together. What would you like to tell us about the moment when you're talking to me and my relationship becomes real? [laughs] "We'll see." You two did that and that, too. When I started I couldn't understand it at all. A little bit more. I'm going to be a lot closer and touch up a little better.
