The features of the setting in "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski have a significant effect on the cyclist. The story is set in a rural area of Colorado, so as the cyclist, he is greeted with winding roads, a variety of terrain, and uneven and narrow paths. All of these features make the road ahead more difficult to navigate and naturally increase the difficulty of the task at hand. 

The vastness of the area creates a sense of loneliness and disconnection, which allows for greater introspection. The cyclist is able to think more deeply and reflect on his life while on the challenging journey. It also serves to inspire and challenge him. The roads are rugged and unpredictable, and the cyclist must trust his instincts and skills to survive. 

The environment also feeds the cyclist's sense of adventure. The stunning backdrop of mountains and alpine vistas provide inspiration for this athlete. The winding roads, rugged terrain, and unpredictability of the environment increase the difficulty level and also provide greater reward for his brave efforts. For these reasons, the features of the setting help to motivate and challenge the cyclist, both mentally and physically. 

Finally, the unpredictable environment provides an opportunity for the cyclist to learn more about himself. The cyclist is forced to think on his feet, trust his instincts, and remain focused and alert. His journey is difficult and the environment is ever-changing, allowing him to gain a greater understanding of his strengths and capabilities.
