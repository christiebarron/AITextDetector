I remember that one grand night when we first shared a real, hearty laugh. It was summertime, and my best friend and I had taken a road trip to the beach to catch the sunset.

The waves were crashing, the light was disappearing, and we started to wind down. Our conversation had stayed light and easy throughout the day; talking about topics from classes, to our families, to plans for the future. The thought of what could be came into my mind, and stayed. 

It was unusually comfortable between us, a familiar feeling I hadnâ€™t had before. Suddenly, my best friend piped up and said something totally unexpected, and the whole situation became as funny as we both felt it was. 

We both went into full, uncontrollable laughter. I looked up to the sky, and saw the sun completely gone by then, but the stars were shining down with all their might. The laughter seemed to last forever, each sentence bringing with it another burst. I had never felt so connected with another person, as if we were one and the same.

By the end of the night, my stomach hurt and I was completely breathless. I knew that even after the summer time and the road trip, we would have that memory etched into our hearts and minds forever. That one grand night when we laughed, and laughed, and laughed.
