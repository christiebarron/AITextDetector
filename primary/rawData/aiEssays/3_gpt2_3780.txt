Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

In our experience, roads have become less comfortable for bikes. These are the roads that have suffered the most from the change. We're looking at whether roads might get softer, whether roads might become softer or how the roads could change. We look at how to reduce the difficulty of road construction.

Are these roads harder than other road conditions such as traffic patterns or construction? We look at both.

How many times do roads have broken down?

Does the impact of roads change how people tend to travel and how long it takes to clear the road?

How strong are those roads?

We look at road conditions and compare road conditions for the different types of roads.

In our previous articles, we had detailed how to find ways to improve the quality of the roads and how to improve road construction. Our methodology has come to some conclusions. For example, you see that road construction is the most common problem with cycle paths. Why?

Traffic patterns

We look at traffic patterns for roads in the UK and across the EU. They are a global issue and in some countries the roads with different conditions are much harder than the roads that are found in the EU.

In terms of traffic patterns, we look at cycle paths in different countries as they are the most important traffic routes and to our knowledge they are the easiest to work in
