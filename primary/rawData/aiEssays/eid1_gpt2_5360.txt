Computers have many effects on people. A study that looks at data from a variety of factors suggested that people with low IQ have more social anxiety, which makes them more likely to engage in risky behaviours.

"We think those cognitive processes are there because the social factors are there," says Mr Pfeiffer of the British Psychological Society. "If we could address some of those mechanisms and build the evidence that could come with using IQ scores as a measure of social and emotional empathy, there I will say I would do that."

As well as taking advantage of the natural variability of cognitive abilities, Mr Pfeiffer and his team have recently shown a number of studies suggesting that people who are more social are less likely to commit fraud, which might increase in the future.
