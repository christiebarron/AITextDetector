The memoir ‘From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives’ by Narciso Rodriguez is a beautiful journey through the designer’s life, tracing his cultural roots and the experiences that have shaped his identity. Drawing on his childhood memories, travels, cultural influences, designs, and his own lived experience, the memoir is a testament to his joys, tribulations, and ongoing professional and personal successes and failures.

The mood created in this memoir is one of strength and pride, stripped from his unyielding ability to always look forward and challenge himself. One gets the sense that he refuses to be moved by his circumstances, no matter how dismal, and rather stands tall to conquer his fears and push past his struggles. This is highlighted with vivid descriptions of the intersections of community, culture, and identity. Each page woven with words that delicately balance his recollections between nostalgia and progress; dreams and disappointments. It’s a rare intimate moment that is not only shared with the readers but encapsulates his journey into a cohesive narrative.

Likewise, his praise and appreciation for his friends and family, although often bittersweet, convey the warmth he has cultivated by keeping his beloved ones close and protected. Through his sharing of joys and sorrows, the mood created in this memoir is simultaneously warm and inviting, empowered and inspiring. Such a blend of candor and reverence communicates a powerful message of resilience and hope that exudes throughout this work. Nowhere
