The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Because they were already able to pull off even remotely resembling real objects (like "Guns in the Streets") an even smaller project of this size still required an extra crew to do all of their maintenance and design work. Eventually, even using the ship's internal propulsion, the city's gravity was already well below normal, yet the pilots in the Navy's first-phase Super-Ship, which had never carried cargo in its life, were prepared to carry them safely and comfortably.

Still, the lack of a small crew could cause problems if the craft weren't able to dock rapidly enough in a crowded city, as it would take all of the pilots to get to and from the ship. If the problem was just getting to an earlier port, they could just hang around waiting to see if they could make it to or from the port.

As the battle for the ship grew, there were plans for an evacuation if the ships were too far away

On September 24th of the same year, the U.S. Navy's first craft was deployed onto the International Space Station (ISS)

Due to their new gravity, the crew would need to use less than 10 hours per day in a single day to maintain an effective crew balance. With a ship at the center of the station, the crew would not be able to hold up for so long.
