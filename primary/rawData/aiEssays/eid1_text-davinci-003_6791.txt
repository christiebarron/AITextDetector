As technology continues to improve, computers are playing an ever-increasing role in our lives. As a result of their convenience and limitless potential, computers are ubiquitous in society. But while computers have undeniable advantages, I believe their use has had a mostly negative effect on people.

The efficiency of computers leads people to think more quickly and work at a faster pace than ever before. Unfortunately, this can lead to hasty decisions that are not properly considered, or actions performed without sufficient preparation and care. Without the proper restraint, this can lead to unfortunate consequences.

Another worrisome impact of computers is their ability to isolate us from real interaction with other people. While we are more quickly informed through emails, text messages and other digital media, a critical part of learning and forming relationships is lost in the process. Many feel more comfortable talking to a machine than another person, thus diminishing true interpersonal skills.

Computers also make it easy to copy and reproduce information, which has made it difficult to distinguish between truth and lies. Nowadays, creative works are constantly stolen and republished â€’ robbing the true artists of their hard-earned recognition.

From all the above, it is clear that computers play a critical and ever-expanding role in our everyday lives. However, the negative impacts, both physical and psychological, should not be taken lightly. It is my hope that, by understanding these dangers now, we can make use of computer technology while
