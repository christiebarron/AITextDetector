Computers have many effects on people. They change how you perceive what you are seeing in the world around you. I'm sure you can imagine seeing a beautiful sunset, for example. When an eye is looking at a distant object, it's very bright for most individuals and their eye just kind of turns and it looks a certain way. We just make ourselves an appearance. Our sight and perception is not as accurate as it can be because we are more of a reflection of the world around us######################################################### If I'd stayed within 500 feet of a window and looked in the windows for 15 minutes I'd probably have seen the sky, but those are pretty much subjective, and in fact, we're very biased towards our maniacal eyes. That's right. We're like ghosts, we're looking in the same whole world as you. Our minds have been created to judge the exact moment of light at which the world is at rest. Therefore, we rely upon the world of 'the void'. I'm sorry, maybe this book will put a new light in it for you when it hits. Also, I recently had a trip to a museum back home to investigate the story behind the idea for this book. I decided that if the world seemed too big for me in my early 20s it wasn't an option and that I would want to see the world as its real and not just looked like it was created for us to look in. The book was written in my mind.
