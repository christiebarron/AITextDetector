The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it's been so much fun to make it myself. This book was one, I think, of the last two best-written books I have ever read. I've never seen such joy in fiction â€” and it makes you realize, it makes you wonder if something like it is possible.


I am now writing my fiction in this year in which I want to start with a few short stories. First, a Posted story about a small family. Second, I wanted to try to give a basic account of my life and what my family was like.


I wanted to leave it there. The story, it was a story about life, about family, about love, about freedom. I want to set the reader on a path of a very different life but something else as well: a life that is one of love and freedom. And to break that free is to leave it with a little sadness and a little hope.
