Dear Editor:

As a resident of this community, I strongly believe that computers have had both a positive and a negative effect on people, but overall the positives outweigh the negatives.

On the positive side, computers have opened a lot of doors for society. They have allowed us to work remotely and in different ways than ever before, creating more opportunities for people to make unique income streams and advance their careers. Furthermore, computers have made communication more accessible, faster, and more streamlined. People can now connect across the world with ease, staying up-to-date with wider networks of people and cultures.

While some believe that computers have become a curse for our generation, they have the potential to be used productively rather than being a source of distraction. As long as people use their computers responsibly, there is no limit to the advancements and success computers can bring.

In conclusion, I believe that computers have had an overwhelmingly positive effect on society. They have enabled us to grow and advance our careers and increase our global connections. With responsible usage, computers can be used to their maximum potential.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
