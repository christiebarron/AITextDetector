I was recently in the grocery store waiting in a long line to check out. As the line got longer and longer, the checkout person's speed slowed to a frustrating crawl. Fume and annoyance started to build as I watched the minutes tick by.

But instead of complaining or getting angry, I simply smiled and waited my turn. I began a conversation with the people around me in line and kept myself occupied by predicting how many items the person in front of me had.

When it was finally my turn, the cashier apologized for the wait and thanked me for my patience. She said I was an example for the other customers who were getting frustrated.

My patience was rewarded with a kind cashier who was grateful for my attitude and understanding. I learned the valuable lesson that day that being patient when things don't go your way can pay off.
