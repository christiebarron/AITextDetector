I remember the moment like it was yesterday. It was one of those moments that I will never forget. I had just finished telling a joke to my best friend and we were both laughing hysterically. The thing I remember the most is how great it felt. It was like a common bond that we had, our mutual sense of humour.

I remember how much I enjoyed hearing her laugh. She had the most infectious giggle I'd ever heard. Whenever I made her laugh, I felt a sense of accomplishment. It always drove me to try harder to come up with new jokes.

It was a time of great joy for the both of us and I cherished every moment that we shared. We would laugh at the littlest things, like a silly oversight, or a silly expression â€“ it didn't matter. All that mattered was that we were having a good time.

Laughter was something that truly brought us closer together. Through laughter, we were able to get closer and connect at a deeper level. It gave us a better understanding of one another. Laughter truly is the best medicine. 

It just goes to show you that sometimes the simplest things can bring great joy and bring people closer. For me, laughter was the best way to strengthen my relationship with my best friend.
