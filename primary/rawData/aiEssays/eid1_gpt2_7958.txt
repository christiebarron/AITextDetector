Computers have many effects on people. In this post we'll explore and discuss many types of applications of brain activation.

Nose/eyes

One obvious application of brain activation is to enhance vision. Most people have developed many different senses that they cannot distinguish well from one another, and yet the fact is that an entire human brain cannot match a single spot. Therefore, each of the three eyes requires an individual, and is responsible for a lot of the individual's experience with our senses.

In order to detect a visual stimulus, different parts of a brain can be targeted either directly or indirectly. This means that our eyes can detect the location of an object, the direction the light travels in, and other similar details, such as how fast the light is passing, or its position on a surface. The way we focus our attention on a visual stimulus in the brain can improve the perception of the visual effect and help understand why we perceive something, or what we could say it is saying on the thing in question.

When a certain location is detected and trained on an object, the eye responds with several different sensations. They try to locate the nearest face, or the same spot. If a particular spot is detected and trained on an object using our eyes, and there are specific sensations in terms of the location, then we can perceive a whole lot more accurately.

When there's some information in the vicinity of the sight and we do something like this, then
