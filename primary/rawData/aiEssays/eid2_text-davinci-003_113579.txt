However, with the increasing proliferation of digital media and technology, the argument of censorship has taken center stage. Should certain materials be removed from library shelves because they are considered offensive? I believe that libraries should not censor material based on its content, and should instead practice the principles of censorship with discretion and an open mind. 

Censorship of material in libraries can be dangerous. It can deny readers the right to seek out information and knowledge, blocking them from discovering fresh ideas and perspectives. Often, books that are considered controversial or not palatable to certain groups of people provide important lenses into how our society operates. Without exposure to a variety of voices and experiences, the public may be denied vital knowledge of social issues, civil rights, and public policy. 

Furthermore, censoring books, music, movies, and magazines is a violation of free speech. Libraries must always facilitate open access to learning and exploration, and no group or individual should be allowed to deter readers from discovering material that pertains to a various interests and point of view. To restrict access to material would be to limit the readers' right to inform themselves. 

With that said, libraries should also be mindful and judicious when deciding which material to share. Every book and movie presented to library patrons should be vetted and judged on its educational value and importance to its readers. It is not necessary to distribute content
