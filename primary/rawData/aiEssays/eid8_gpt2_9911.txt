One time I experienced laughter in my life was when she said the people I loved best were the ones I loved hardest. I wanted to love her very much. She spoke clearly about how she does not love her, which was great, right? It's ok. You are what you choose. Don't lose yourself to something that others do. Love what you love and you'll gain something in life. I thought the time I spent in her life is incredible. I hope she can live with that feeling for next year. For now, it remains one of the hardest things to accept. I want people to know that life doesn't mean anything for them. If the one in particular is struggling and we want to help her out and get her back to what she was before, please tell us. And the good news is that if you love her too much you can just give another person the benefit of the doubt. It's the beginning of a new journey, and a good place to start. Keep an eye out for more stories coming in the future!
