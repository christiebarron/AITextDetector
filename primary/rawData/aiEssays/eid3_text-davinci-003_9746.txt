The setting of the story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski is a cold, dark, and rainy night. This setting has a great affect on the cyclist, as it is in stark contrast to a more ideal situation for cycling. The cold weather and rain make the roads slippery and the wind affects the cyclist's speed, making it more difficult to maintain a consistent speed. Additionally, the icy roads make the cyclist uncertain of what to expect, as they may have to unexpectedly adjust their course. This means the cyclist is constantly on their guard, which is demoralizing and adds to the difficulty of the journey.

The darkness adds to the cyclist’s unease since it makes the cyclist’s vision limited and affects their depth perception when riding on the roads. The darkness also obscures any potential hazards, making it harder to predict the cyclist’s movements. The darkness can also make cyclists feel more isolated, since they often cannot see or hear others. This feeling of isolation can be disheartening, as it can make them feel as if they are alone in their journey.

Overall, the setting of “Rough Road Ahead” has a profound effect on the cyclist. The cold and damp weather, wind, darkness, and hazardous roads are all factors that contribute to the cyclist’s difficulty and the despair they feel. All of these elements highlight the difficult and lonely journey that the cyclist is facing on the road
