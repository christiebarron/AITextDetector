Censorship in libraries has recently become a widely discussed topic. To many, censoring books, magazines, movies, and music is a violation of our first amendment right as Americans; however, others believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are deemed offensive. While both sides have their valid arguments, I believe that certain materials, such as explicit content, should not be readily available due to safety, cultural, and political concerns.

Firstly, it is important to consider the safety of the library patrons. Many patrons are curious children and teens, searching for knowledge and entertainment. It is the responsibility of adult librarians to try and protect these vulnerable ages groups from explicit material that could do psychological and emotional damage. Pornographic and explicit content can have a negative effect on young people, causing social anxiety and pressure and a warped view of the world. Though censorship of this content in public libraries could be seen as a violation of free speech, ultimately it is up to librarians to ensure the safety of kids and youth.

Of course, cultural and political concerns should also be taken into account when deciding which materials should be removed from shelf. Libraries house books that are the historical records of entire nations, and these books should provide an accurate representation of a country's culture, history and values. Books that are considered inappropriate or offensive to any race, religion, sexuality, or gender should never be allowed in libraries, as they are harmful to both libraries and society
