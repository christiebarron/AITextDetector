In Joe Kurmaski's story "Rough Road Ahead," the features of the setting play a crucial role in influencing the cyclist's experiences as she rides on the rough road ahead of her.

The cyclist's journey is set in a rural area, far away from the distractions of a bustling city. The gradient of the terrain is relatively steep, as evidenced by the cyclist's slow yet steady pace. The lack of roads in the area means the cyclist is navigating with only her intuition: she weaves through trees and bushes, continually adjusting her route due to obstacles and unpredictable conditions. The elements challenge her as well: relentless sun and heat, thunderstorms, and sudden winds all batter her body.

The cyclist's journey is also underscored by the emotional landscape of her inner world. She is on the brink of nervous exhaustion but also swollen with an infatuation with life and the joy of discovery. Despite her exhaustion, she is invigorated by the knowledge that she is pushing onward regardless of the difficulty of the path ahead.

The physical and emotional features of the setting thus design a unique and highly personal experience for the cyclist. The test of her physical and mental strength in the extreme conditions, combined with her openness to life's beauties and joys, creates a deeply rewarding experience. The rural setting becomes a testing ground for intense inner and outer exploration.
