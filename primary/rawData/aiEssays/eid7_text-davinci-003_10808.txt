My 8-year-old son had recently completed his chores that I asked him to do, and our reward was a trip to the local ice cream shop. As we were walking down the street, he spotted a toy store and ran towards the entrance.

I tried to get him to stay on course, but he was too excited. I could tell that he really wanted to go in and look around. Trying to remain patient, I took a few deep breaths and told him we would go to the toy store on our way back.

He smiled and followed me down the street towards the ice cream shop. As we walked, he chatted away about his life at school and all of the different toys he wanted to buy. I listened to his excited chatter and was reminded of how important it is to be patient with him.

When we finally got back to the toy store, he got to pick out two small items. I could tell he was so proud of himself for being patient and following my instructions. He still talks about it and remembers that moment when he was rewarded for his patience.
