I remember the first time I ever laughed so hard I thought I would cry. It was a few years ago and I was visiting my best friend from college. I hadn't seen him in a year and we had a lot of catching up to do. We were talking and reminiscing about all the crazy times we had in college. Suddenly, an image of a particularly embarrassing moment flashed in our minds. It was hilarious and I looked over to him to find he had the exact same expression on his face. We looked at each other and started laughing. And it kept going and going. We laughed until we were both in tears. I felt so close to him in that moment, like the years between us had melted away. Nothing had changed. We were still the same friends as before and it felt so good to laugh and really bond. That's why I cherish laughter. It's like medicine for the soul.
