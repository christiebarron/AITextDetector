I was sitting in a group of friends at a restaurant when an old joke I loved came up. I couldn't help but laugh, and the others around the table followed suit. We all joined in, the laughter getting louder and brighter with each passing breath. When it eventually died down, we couldn't help but look around the table and share in what we had just experienced. 

The sound of laughter was still ringing in the air when I noticed my best friend was about to speak. For a moment I thought it was going to be an angry reprimand for laughing so hard. Instead, she looked at me with her ever-present smirk and said, “And that's why we are friends.”

The whole table erupted in laughter once more, and I couldn't help but feel the warm feeling of joy and contentment in that moment. We soon moved on from the joke, but the laughter remained—it was the soundtrack of our friendship that was never far behind.
