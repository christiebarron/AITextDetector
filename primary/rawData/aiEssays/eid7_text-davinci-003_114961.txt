I remember a time when I was in grade school and it was the week before my spelling test. I was having difficulty learning some of the words, so I asked my teacher if I could stay in during recess to practice. 

My teacher said yes and stayed with me while I went over the words, even though she had other things she could have been doing. She was incredibly patient with me, coaching me through the words and break them down into parts that I could understand.

By the time the spelling test came around, I was feeling much more confident, and I got a good score. I was so happy that my teacher was willing to take the time to be patient with me and help me succeed.
