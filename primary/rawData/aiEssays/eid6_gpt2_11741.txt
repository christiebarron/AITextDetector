The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, only the most senior of the building's employees were allowed to be using dirigibles. The second obstacle was requiring any kind of equipment in the building, especially to access the exterior of each building as opposed to the building itself where all the parts work together in harmony.

The first of these obstacles, the ceiling height, was the first to face the builders and was addressed immediately after opening.

The second obstacle was an elevated ceiling for the windows to cover. A more recent problem arose after both of these two points were completed, but when constructing this part it occurred to these builders that any new windows were to be built in the middle of the building. Although the design took some time, and as a part of the cost of construction contractors many engineers did the construction work themselves, making it much more difficult in a shorter span of time.

Fortunately, two of the most common solutions were provided to the engineers during the building's years of construction. The first was to make sure all the pieces remained locked and secured during the construction process.lies an excellent study of its implementation. This research also led to the creation of a process whereby the builders could use their design's design criteria to decide which parts of an exterior area needed to be secured and which parts of an interior section needed to be secured and the correct way to ensure the safety of such parts. For these purposes, it
