I remember the day clearly - it was my best friend's birthday, and I had made plans to take her out for the evening. We went to dinner, and then decided to go bowling. I had never bowled before, but my friend thought it would be funny to see me give it a try. 

So there I was, standing at the scoring board and swinging the bowling ball with all my might. Unfortunately, it didn't go too well - I had to keep setting it up again and again. Finally, after about the sixth time, it finally made it to the pins, but it didn't even knock down a single one!

My friend and I looked at each other and burst out into laughter. Everyone around us stopped to look at us, and before long, everyone else in the bowling alley was laughing with us. It was the best time I've ever had - just laughing together with my friend and everyone in that bowling alley. To me, that was a memory that will stay with me forever.
