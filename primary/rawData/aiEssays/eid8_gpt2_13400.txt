One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was at an event and saw a group of very nice people there and one of them asked, "Which is the most beautiful thing that you seen? A man from the moon who came up to you on a bridge and then said, 'Oh, how did I spend my days?'"


We went to lunch there and they said, "Well, we're not giving away the prize that night because we were just here for our mother's birthday." It was the most beautiful day for me.


In the late 80s, it became more common to see young people dressed in whatever you want. Nowadays they have a lot more people on their side, so a lot of people would prefer not to give away their prize.


You've also never heard of any young people telling friends they are going to give away a prize.


I know some young people have gone, "I didn't even know my prize was gone until yesterday and it was all gone, but I did find it." So what do girls want to do? It was kind of funny after a little while; they're so funny.


Do you often see kids just talking into their phones at other people's phones? Are they doing this by themselves, or do they make it their own way?


If I get something, I usually just do it right away. It doesn't matter whether that is just me and my child.
