Computers have many effects on people. We talk about it the same way we talk about cigarettes."

There is a long and rich history of science to examine the impact of smoking on behaviour when people are exposed to environmental toxins and viruses. In the 1970s, for example, researchers in the UK showed that, compared to two years earlier, smoking levels in children in the UK had fallen by 5 per cent, while during the years after, levels peaked in both women and gay and bisexual men. This was the first study to examine whether the exposure to viruses and toxins in the environment could lead to similar behaviours in heterosexual and in gay men.

Dr Graham said: "A clear pattern of exposure, particularly to viruses and viruses as used in the research area, as well as an increased frequency of behaviour within society during the same time period have been identified from previous studies.

"And, as a result, the UK has become a centre for understanding the role environmental toxins play in disease-induced changes in one man's biology and behaviour. This is particularly worrying because in our own time, we have long had an emphasis upon the epidemiology of exposure to toxins, that is, exposures on health grounds as well as on physical and mental health grounds.

"For many decades, researchers have been investigating how diseases and diseases are caused by environmental changes through exposure to viruses, viruses as a form of disease or to toxins as a form of natural exposure."
