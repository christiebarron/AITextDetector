I recently had the opportunity to witness a remarkable act of patience. My boss had hired an intern who had a lot of potential but who needed more training. My boss was patient with her and spent a large amount of time each day explaining concepts and tasks. He patiently answered her questions and went out of his way to make sure she understood.

As the weeks went by, I started to notice a real improvement in the intern's work. Her tasks were being completed more quickly and she was simply doing a better job overall. I was clearly witnessing the direct results of my boss's patience. 

It's a quality he has in abundance, and it's one of the things I admire most about him. I'm a better employee for having watched him exercise patience and trust in this young person. It was an impressive display of gentleness, kindness, and trustworthiness that I will always remember.
