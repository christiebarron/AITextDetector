The fact that the Library of Congress and other public entities were working at the behest of large and sophisticated groups was probably irrelevant to the issue of censorship.

However, when we have more details of the situation, it should not be ignored.

On 21 July 2012, Google began a'secretive' search in the Library of Congress which found two of the major issues to be under attack. One was on the right, the other on the left and in its view censorship was harmful to privacy.

Google has also decided to move to close all other web-related sites in the US and remove the website of Wikipedia.

While this decision has sparked outrage in US cities and government agencies throughout the world, it should not be taken as a surprise to see that the Government of North America takes a very big interest in keeping our information safe.

In June the US Government of Canada (GCA) launched the 'Operation Cross Site Security' (SQLS) project to track how we store, review, analyse and preserve sensitive data, including documents and images.

The aim of this program is to prevent the data being accessed by those who can use them, but there are many safeguards to keep our data secure. The CIA's own privacy
