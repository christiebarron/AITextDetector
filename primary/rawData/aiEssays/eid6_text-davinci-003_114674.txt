The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted provides an in-depth description of some of the problems faced by the builders as they tried to make the building suitable for mooring airships.

The biggest obstacle faced by the builders was determined by the very nature of the docking of a dirigible—which requires a sturdy vertical mast and a long cable to secure the landing. As Lüsted explains, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was to be crafted out of steel and built 425 feet (130 meters) above the rooftop. Moreover, the mast had to love to a cable 6,500 feet (2,013 meters) long which was to be strung between lower Manhattan and the mast on the building’s rooftop. This posed an immense challenge to the builders, who had to develop a structure that could handle the great weight of a dirigible and its mooring cable.

In addition to the challenge of constructing the mast and cable, the builders were required to design a platform that could be raised and lowered in order to maintain stability and accommodate the dirigible as it descended. This platform was to be built from steel and covered with rubber in order to accommodate the mooring cable. Lastly, the builders had to construct a series of pulleys that could be used to extend and retract the
