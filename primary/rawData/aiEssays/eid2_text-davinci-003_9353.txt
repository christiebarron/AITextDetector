Censorship in libraries is an important issue that requires consideration when determining what materials should be available for the public. It is essential that libraries make an effort to ensure that their collections are free of offensive materials, while also recognizing the importance of allowing access to information and ideas. 

On the one hand, certain materials should be removed from library shelves if they are found to be offensive. This is particularly necessary in libraries that are intended for children, as materials that are violent or sexual in nature should be kept out of reach. However, this should be done in an age-appropriate manner - materials such as books about difficult social issues, such as racism, should still be accessible to older readers. 

On the other hand, libraries should be careful not to overly censor materials. People have the right to access information and ideas, even if some of them may be offensive or contrary to a certain set of values. If a library bans certain materials based on their content, it is making a statement that is in conflict with the fundamental right to freedom of expression. 

In conclusion, libraries need to ensure that their collections are appropriate for their intended readership. However, censorship should only be applied in accordance with accepted standards. Libraries should take a measured approach when determining what materials should be removed from their shelves, while always striving to provide a wide range of information and ideas to their users.
