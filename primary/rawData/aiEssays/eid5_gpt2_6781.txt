The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is about losing, coming off of defeat and being humiliated by many of the 'bad guys in the book' who didn't understand you when you told them you weren't the victim: you didn't deserve to be punished, you didn't believe the lie you told them, you didn't stand up for yourself when others attacked you and you're a horrible person – but what about doing a little bit more to save yourself?

You have to think about doing more than just the right thing to protect yourself. Your mind should also be free from this 'bad guy' and be able to be free from the fear that might come from feeling yourself like you were 'better than you were'. If you're feeling this way, if you're being treated unfairly, abused, or even persecuted — you're not feeling yourself better than anyone else.

There is nothing about writing or reading 'From Home is' that's in danger of losing any weight, or of failing to follow in the footsteps of this 'worst of friends' who won't do anything wrong.

This book will teach you how to become more 'in the spirit' of all your friends who are suffering and you're supposed to be the only one who makes the big decision or'make it happen' first.
