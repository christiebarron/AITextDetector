Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. For all of its practicalities, the range allows for easy cycling along the roads and is ideally suited for those with the slightest mobility issues.

It is the type of environment where it is essential to have a cycling helmet installed as it has been widely used in the past in a pinch.

However, the range also covers off roads within walking distances and as a result, the range will not include most non-road road uses.

The bike range features over 20 different shapes

If one sees it as you walk this way, the Bike range does come with a few other features, including a selection of customised shapes available and a range of styles and accents available throughout the setting.

All of the options are easily chosen and offer great cycling visibility throughout the drive or when driving or taking for a walk with other motor users.
