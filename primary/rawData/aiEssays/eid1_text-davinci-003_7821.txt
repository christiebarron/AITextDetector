Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, is a thoughtful exploration of how the places we call home create the memories and life experiences that shape our lives. Throughout the book, Rodriguez creates a mood of nostalgia as he reflects on his upbringing in New Jersey and his journeys around the world. He explains, “The idea of home has always held a special place in my heart... home is where my journey began, and work has taken me wherever I choose to go.”

Throughout the book, Rodriguez captures a sense of familiarity and comfort in his childhood home in New Jersey, often recalling the sounds, scents, and sights that evoke his fondest memories. He takes readers on a tour of his home in Spain, describing its beauty and the rich cultural history that inspires him as an artist. He also writes in detail about his travels, detailing his visits to iconic cities, such as Paris, and providing readers with an intimate look at unfamiliar places. His travels evoke a sense of joy and excitement as he celebrates the beauty of the world.

As Rodriguez details his personal memories, he sometimes injects a sense of melancholic reflection. He shares moments of heartache, transition, and growth. These moments are balanced by his optimism and appreciation of life’s moments. He reflects, “Life has its ups and downs, but moments like these are ones that I truly cherish.”
