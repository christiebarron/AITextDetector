The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is palpable.

It's a very different world to what you're told during your early 20s, a world that feels like it came true to me. I was a child when my father married IHOP, but I think the first time that I read his memoir was in 'School's Over', the first time I heard that there would be a school for kids. I was so frightened of not knowing that at the beginning I got the idea of being an artist to show that children and young people were not simply children that were not happy and living a life. I thought I would be 'too young'. I ended up just trying to get back to my old childhood, as good a life as I could.

It was one of the longest and most rewarding books I've read. It's a really strong place to explore something very different to what your mother and father experienced. It's a place that tells one of the most harrowing stories in this industry and it's one that takes you on incredibly strange journeys and, I think, the most challenging ones. I've been told by our family I'm lucky to have such extraordinary experiences. It's hard to imagine, for the first time, being surrounded by so much of what I know but I can tell you my mother and father were very much present there as well. I'm absolutely amazed at how we were able to put up with such a difficult time.
