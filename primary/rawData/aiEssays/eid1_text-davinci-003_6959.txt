In the modern era, censorship in libraries remains a controversial and divisive issue. As people increasingly call for increased sensitivity toward diverse communities, library book censors have often considered materials containing controversial ideas as potential threats. 

Excessive censorship of books, magazines, or movies can have a controlling and stifling effect upon our society. When cherished ideas are exposed to criticism, it encourages civil discourse and allows us to consider our beliefs more deeply. Furthermore, If some materials are removed from our shelves, not only would the educational benefit be limited but so too would our wider cultural understanding. 

The argument is often made that certain materials may be inappropriate or even hurtful to specific communities, so such materials ought to be removed from the shelves, while leaving only benign materials accessible to the public. However, we must not forget that the purpose of libraries is to provide resources that inform, educate, and enlighten, and not limit our comprehension of difficult topics. Additionally, rejecting the presence of certain materials does not mean that we reject their ideals. On the contrary, open and constructive discussion serves as a productive way to confront difficult topics.

At the end of the day, talking about our differences should be encouraged and not censored. As such, I believe libraries should not place unfair restrictions on certain materials, and instead open up avenues for constructive dialogue and understanding.
