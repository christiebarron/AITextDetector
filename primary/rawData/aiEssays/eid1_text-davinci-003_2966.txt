Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people.

Many of us rely heavily on computers in our daily lives, whether itâ€™s for work, entertainment, or just keeping up with the news. We have become so dependent on them, that it is almost impossible to imagine life without computers.

The advances in technology have both positive and negative effects. On one hand, computers can be extremely useful tools. They help us stay connected with the world, improve work efficiency, and provide us with a vast amount of knowledge. However, there are some potential drawbacks to the increased reliance on computers. For example, the increased use of computers has been linked to cases of health issues such as carpal tunnel syndrome, eye strain, and neck aches. Additionally, computers can also lead to distractions and may become a source of procrastination.

In conclusion, computers have the potential to be extremely helpful. However, it is important to be aware of the potential risks associated with them, and to take steps to ensure their responsible use.

I hope that my opinion has been helpful and has persuaded the readers to agree with me. 

Sincerely,
