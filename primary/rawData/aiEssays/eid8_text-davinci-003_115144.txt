I was standing in the grocery store line when the most absurd thought popped into my head: what if chickens had wings like airplanes? I couldn't believe I was having this thought in the very serious environment of the checkout line. I couldn't help but smile as I glanced around the room, immediately noticing someone who was looking in my direction and had also heard my chuckle.

I can't remember the last time a complete stranger had made me feel this way, and suddenly the checkout line felt like the best place to be. I locked eyes with the other person and smiled, completely open and unapologetic for the ridiculous thought I had just had. 

The next thing I knew, we had both burst into laughter at the same time. The sound of the cashier's disapproving voice asking for my card disappeared as I shared an unexpected moment with the stranger in the line.

We soon found ourselves standing there unable to stop smiling and laughing. As quiet returned to the line, he said "Well, that was unexpected. I'd like to think that the chickens in our lives would know how to fly with their wings if we gave them the chance."

The cashier gave us both a stern look, but I knew that the moment we shared was far bigger than anything she could say. This was one of those rare moments of connection with another person that humbling and memorable. We said goodbye and left, but I couldn't help but feel grateful for
