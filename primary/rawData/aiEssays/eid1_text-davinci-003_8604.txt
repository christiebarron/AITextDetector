I remember my first meeting with my long-distance girlfriend fondly; it was so exciting to finally see the person I had been chatting with online for months. We had both booked a room at a nearby motel, but stayed up until all hours talking. 

At one point, we started sharing stories from our past and both ended up in fits of uncontrollable laughter. She had been telling me about a mishap she had on her first day of school and her description of the incident was so elaborate that I couldn't stop giggling. In response, I put on a cartoonish impression of her recounting the experience and that sent us both into further extremes of laughter.

I still recall how great it felt to laugh so much; the sound of her accompanying me echoed off the motel walls, and for a moment we felt completely united. That moment of shared laughter was a unique form of connection that I will never forget.
