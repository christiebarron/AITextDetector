The setting of Joe Kurmaski’s short story ‘Rough Road Ahead’ has a strong impact on the cyclist. As the cyclist embarks down the overgrown, abandoned path, the atmosphere of the setting immediately affects his feelings and actions throughout the story. It is described as “ramshackle” with dense foliage forming a curved arch overhead. With this description, the audience can assume the cyclist to feel a sense of unease and unfamiliarity as he pedals the wrinkled track.

The natural obstacles he encounters such as distinctive rocks, vicious brambles and torrents of mud form a challenging physical and psychological barrier for the cyclist. His attempt to get back on route is frustrated as the terrain gradually deteriorates and his progress is hindered by the unfamiliar surroundings. These features of the setting can be seen as a manifestation of his conflicting emotions; dealing with something new, the unknown and uncomfortable.

These unfamiliar features slowly heighten the cyclists anxiety as he ventures deeper into the unknown; fast-growing trees create a strong barrier between him and the sun whilst the forgotten path becomes increasingly foreign. As the atmosphere of the setting grows, so does the sense of tension and apprehension; ultimately familiarising the audience with the sense of isolation.

Ultimately, the features of the setting in ‘Rough Road Ahead’ allow the audience to better understand the difficulties the cyclist faces as he embarks on his journey through the overgrown trail. We
