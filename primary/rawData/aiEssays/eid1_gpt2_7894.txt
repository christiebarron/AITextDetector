Computers have many effects on people. When computing is done effectively every part of my brain is wired up to respond to the environment. By working the body in our body we can actually do tasks like exercise. Many people are so good at it that they never learn to interact with it. I know this sounds silly but your body is not so good at what it does. Your brain is able to handle tasks like exercise or running. All of these things are very stressful for your life. Your body will not learn. You are not going to be able to do these things for years to come. So much of our mental health is being completely ignored in this whole idea that technology is the solution! This entire effort to make us better in everything we do to learn is bullshit.
