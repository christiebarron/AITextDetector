The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, the FAA was concerned that the public (even those who agreed to allow self-driving cars on the site were often hostile to them) might be tempted to opt for their dirigs. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) took an even more direct approach—federally supervised self-driving vehicles would continue to serve public transportation but instead enter private airspace. Yet while the FAA insisted that self-driving cars would not "take over" the airspace, it also urged businesses to adopt certain kinds of flight and safety measures.

And when they did, the companies who built them—J-Pesa, Volvo, AEMO, and the company that bought them—were forced out.

J.P.S.E. will continue to use its fleet of autonomous vehicles in North America, where they are more commonly used, with the exception of Florida. The company is scheduled to start manufacturing self-driving cars in Arizona and Puerto Rico earlier this year.
