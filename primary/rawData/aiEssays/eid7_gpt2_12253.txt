An example of a time someone in my life was patient was this, a man I admired for many years, a man who had so much to offer in his life. He was a young man of seventy-eight, who lived in a town called Llanopin; and he had a big house in Llanopin. In his neighbourhood he had a lot of shops, but no houses for him. The very first meeting I had with this man was to come up here on two days' notice. We said the boy should be given the day off from school. He did not come. To make matters worse, I was not informed of any of the times when I could expect a boy to go to school. This one had only ten days a week off from school. When he arrived, he got a ticket to come to my house. I did not know what to do. 'You came!' it ran. He was all happy. It did not make for a good job. But, as he was doing, the bus arrived. 'Take off you car,' I said, as I sat with a big pile of papers in front of me. At this first meeting the man, now looking sad, and I too, laughed, saying to the lad, 'We were friends now and you won't forget this time.' Then he went away to the car, where he got married. And he had eight little children. Two and a half years have passed since he married
