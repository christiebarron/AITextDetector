In the memoir From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez, an underlying emotional current flows throughout the text. Rodriguez expresses his profound love for his Cuban heritage and roots while being separated from them, which is the main mood of the story.

The reader first feels the effects of this emotional current when Rodriguez opens the memoir with “From Home I write.” The choice of words conveys his longing for the familiarity and connection to the birthplace of his family. He writes with a deep respect and admiration of his Cuban roots. For example, Rodriguez gives vivid descriptions of his mother’s handwritten Cuban recipes found in the family recipe box. Despite being far away from the land of his parents, he still finds a connection to them through the food that his mother cooked for the family. 

Rodriguez’s immense love for his Cuban past is felt in every chapter of the memoir as he emotively recounts his childhood memories. He paints vivid pictures of his family’s rituals, such as the way his grandfather sat in a rocking chair after his Sunday walks, and how his grandmother would gather her grandchildren in a circle for a story time. All these details bring us closer to Rodriguez’s Cuban roots and make the readers feel connected to them.

The memoir creates a sense of nostalgia and longing that Rodriguez himself must feel. The emotional arc of the book explores his journey from the sadness of being separated from his Cuban home
