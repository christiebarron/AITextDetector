I was on a walk in the woods with my best friend from college, when we both stumbled upon an old rickety bridge over a small creek. We were about to cross it when we both heard an unsettling creak as we stepped foot onto the wooden slats. We both looked at each other wide-eyed and started to turn back, when my friend said, “If we both jump at the same time, it won't creak so loud!”

We must have looked ridiculous standing there, jump in unison across the bridge. But sure enough, it worked! We made it across with barely a squawk from the bridge.

As soon as our feet touched on the other side, we both erupted with laughter that almost echoed through the woods. It was one of those laughs that blended together – when one of us stopped laughing and the other kept going – and we both realized at the same time how silly what we were doing was.

In that moment, we were bonded together by laughter, and from that encounter, I knew no matter where life took us, our friendship could survive anything. Even the rickety bridge over the creek.
