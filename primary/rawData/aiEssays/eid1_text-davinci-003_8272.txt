The construction of the Empire State Building was a marvel of engineering, however, there were many obstacles faced when allowing the dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. A unique feature of the Empire State Building was its plan for accepting the mooring of dirigibles at its mast. Due to the technical challenges of the project, testing the mooring mast proved to be a difficult task.

The development of a successful mooring mast was based on the creation of a strong platform, free of obstructions, and capable of handling the weight and turbulence of the airships. The designers initially came up with a plan to mount the mooring mast on steel columns, but it was quickly determined that the structure was weak and too lightweight for this purpose. A heavier, stronger mast was developed, comprised of steel and concrete, and upright columns affixed with bolts. Testing of the mast revealed that it could be used, but additional weight and reinforcement was required to make it resilient enough for the heavier ships.

The mooring mast was also surrounded by an elevation of buildings, known as the “Mast Ring”, which posed a challenge for landing the dirigibles. With the high surrounding structures, it was challenging to bring the ships to the level of the mooring mast, which was situated at the roof of the Empire State Building. To tackle this challenge, the designers added a large air scoop that was capable of pulling the
