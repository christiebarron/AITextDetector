If a motorist does not wish to take his or her time (i.e. a few minutes, or a few hours) then if they are using a cycle-powered bike with a shorter pass-through the width in range is increased to the width of the pass-through.

If your motorist wants a shorter pass-through then they can use a regular passing-through to move to less crowded places. So for instance, if they are moving to a motorway in the evening, then they can move back to the motorway only to lose a regular passing-through.
