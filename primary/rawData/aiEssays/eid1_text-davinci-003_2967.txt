Dear Editor, 

Recent technological advancements have changed the way we work, interact, and sure enough, the way we think and communicate. With smart devices and computers, information is made more accessible, work can be done more efficiently, and communication has become instantaneous. But it's difficult to overlook the potential drawbacks associated with too much computer usage. 

As technology has become so prevalent in everyday life and reliance on computers has intensified, some experts predict a negative impact on society's ability to think critically and creatively. Constantly being exposed to a stream of information and the buzz of emails, notifications, and comments can be quite overwhelming. Most of us hit the refresh and open tabs with no idea what we will find, nor do we consider how it should be used, managed, or analyzed. 

Additionally, computers have increased the number of cyber-related issues. Hackers, viruses, and identity theft last year cost Americans over $3 billion. Not to mention the mental health implications, such as lack of concentration, stress, sleep deprivation, and undivided attention to important tasks.

Teachers, employers, and elected officials must work together to find ways of offsetting the negative aspects associated with computer technology
