To The Editor,

I am writing today to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Computers, particularly the widespread use of the internet, have had both positive and negative impacts on society. On the one hand, computers have given us unparalleled access to information, communication, and entertainment. This has helped to revolutionize the way we learn, grow, and interact with one another.

Conversely, computers have also had unintended negative effects on individuals and society. First, people have become increasingly isolated due to excessive computer usage. It is easier than ever to ignore external stimuli to the point that it prevents us from engaging in meaningful conversation with one another. Furthermore, the convenience of the internet has caused us to become increasingly dependent on technology. We seem to have less motivation to do things for ourselves, as computers are available to complete all the work.

In conclusion, although computers have provided tremendous opportunities, we must be careful to regulate our use and prevent them from hindering us from engaging in meaningful conversations and activities. Computers can act as a tool and a resource, however, they should not deter us from healthy interaction.

Sincerely, 
[Name]
