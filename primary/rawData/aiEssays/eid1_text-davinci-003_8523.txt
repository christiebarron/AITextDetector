I was standing in line at the grocery store, patiently waiting my turn to be checked out, when I noticed the cashier in front of me was having some trouble with their transaction. They kept having to go back and check something with the customer, and I could already sense my wait was going to be longer than I had anticipated. 

Rather than get frustrated or annoyed, I just decided to accept that it was going to take a bit longer and focused on taking deep breaths and being understanding. After about 10 minutes the customer finally left and I was up next.

The cashier apologized profusely as I put my items on the belt, and I just smiled and said that it was perfectly okay â€” that these kinds of things happen. She thanked me for my patience and my understanding attitude, which made me feel really good.

At the end of the day, it might have taken longer than I wanted, but knowing that I was patient and understanding with the situation made it worth it.
