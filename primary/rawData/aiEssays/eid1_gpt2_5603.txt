Computers have many effects on people. They may change their appearance and make people less intelligent, possibly for other reasons (like the fact their brains don't talk to each other anymore). They may also increase the likelihood of being infected by cancer or even becoming infected after a certain amount of time.

It seems that we have much more information on people â€“ for instance, there are lots of examples that people in various different countries are having quite rapid growths of their blood pressure, which may have long-term consequences for them. For one, the fact that such small changes happen very often in humans is also seen for other animals, as well as our bodies and our biology.

One possible way to be sure that some of the above is indeed true, please, find me an article!
