This is how you tell a story: in writing it with the world's best minds and writing it with your best writing style so that it doesn't get derailed by your opinions.

By writing your own stuff now: as part of this new-for-2015 project of the Institute for Strategic Omar, I have organized a small library of 15 books and 20 DVDs to showcase these stories each month online or at bookspam.org.

A reader is at the heart of this library's work, and I am grateful for their consideration, by contributing to the cause.
