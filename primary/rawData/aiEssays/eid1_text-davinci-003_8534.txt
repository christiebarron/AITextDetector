I was recently waiting in line at the store when I noticed a woman a few people ahead of me struggling to pay for her items. A few minutes later I noticed the cashier was having difficulty processing her payment. The cashier apologized and asked the woman to step aside while they sorted out their issue. She did so without raising her voice or complaining. She simply took a step away from the cashier and waited patiently. It ended up taking the cashier about 10 minutes to sort out the problem. Throughout this time the woman stayed calm, never once appearing impatient or frustrated. 

When the issue was finally resolved the cashier thanked the woman for her patience and gave her a sincere apology. The woman smiled, thanked them for their help, and then left. As I watched this encounter, I was amazed and inspired by her patience and understanding. I was reminded that patience is a valuable trait that can help us stay calm in difficult situations.
