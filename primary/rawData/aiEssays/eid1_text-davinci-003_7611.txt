Minfong Ho ends Winter Hibiscus with this statement to emphasize the idea of hope and resilience. The imagery of the geese returning symbolizes a sense of optimism and renewal in the coming spring as the snows melt away. This idea of rebirth and a new beginning is also reflected in the character's decision to take the test again, showing a determination to try and succeed. Thus, the ending serves as a reminder that even in the darkest and seemingly hopeless moments, there is still something to look forward to and strive for.
