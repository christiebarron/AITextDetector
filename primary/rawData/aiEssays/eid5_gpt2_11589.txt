"This country has been bankrupt, but our young family has found a way to make ends meet," she wrote.

"We were forced to put up even less than we thought we would, and we have been given to a government in a state where we only have access to food and medicine, all of which is owned and funded by corporate profits.

"We had to do what any woman should do - go to work, spend her days in shops and watch TV, not to mention live out our lives in the luxury luxury hotels and on the beach."

Mr Gildon's autobiography also outlines how that world is now a society where women, men and children are subjected to conditions that they say could have led to the greatest amount of violence and poverty in many of the world's countries
