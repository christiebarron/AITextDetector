The purpose of this final line is to act as a metaphor for Ho's internal struggle and the difficulties she has faced and overcome thus far in her academic career. The cold of winter and the melting of the snow serve as symbolic of her adversities and frustrations, while the return of the spring and geese are meant to represent a sense of hope and optimism that soon her tests and struggles will be over. By connecting the personal experiences of the poem to the struggles of the hibiscus, she is able to create an uplifting conclusion that conveys the hope she has in her academic journey being completed and the tests she must take being successful.
