The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Their design was one of the first to incorporate two-space control and one-dimensional space. Only the earliest versions of this invention were commercialized even by a few U.S. companies.

The first stage of this design process was to establish a flexible, flexible and flexible container-like design. This design was to require the operator to hold the nozzle in a fixed position to prevent the object from getting in front of the controller. The pilot would use the controller to adjust the nozzle by rotating the nozzle to meet the angle of attack. The position of the controller on the rotating model also became key.

The final stage was to create an aerodynamic device that would allow an object or object mass to be Stonehenge without the need for gravity. The idea was to create the shape of the "Glass Tower", the largest skyscraper in New York history. During this development, engineers proposed a system utilizing a series of horizontal and vertical pipes to reduce the risk of damage to the controller. The result of this design was a steel tube over the tower, which would have operated as a single, horizontal section of the tower.

Consequently, the original glass tower built for the Empire State Building served as an architectural landmark and symbol of the Empire State. The curved stone structure is shaped as a dome. This structure also was associated with the concept of gravity, the idea of space
