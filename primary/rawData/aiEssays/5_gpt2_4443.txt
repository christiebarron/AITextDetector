The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is of great fascination to me.

When I was living among the refugees, I was aware that I could not be used as a narrator in a book about them. The first thing that stood out to me was the similarity of our stories.

I didn't think of the refugee as the "other" or the "other", but my own understanding of the refugee led me to the "other" part of the book. It became an exercise to test my ability to relate my own experiences. My new, more mature version of the narrative seemed an obvious and important step forward.

I was taken by the novel with a sense of awe that guerrilla art took a back seat to a culture that was the embodiment of humanity. Many of us in the book were not as surprised to hear the story's story about the Syrian refugees that were so easily absorbed within their own language. It is very important to remember how the Syrian population is often not even known to anyone else in general. The fact that there are often many Syrians and they even know each other or read their poetry could make us seem more welcoming to the world that the Syrians seem to have to go through to be accepted.

One thing that will appeal to many of you because of my novel is just how well it feels to be in my world.

I have seen the writing of any writer do a good job of it's role as a narrator
