One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was in the fourth grade and my teacher had introduced a new series of puzzles to me by saying they were some of the best challenges I've ever had to learn in any playground. The story really started as a teacher showed me a series of very unique puzzles and made me want to create my own series of puzzles from start to finish. The first one was like "this is great".


While I was learning the rest from how to solve them I became increasingly frustrated all the time. I would start looking into my own problem and finding the right solution would put me more in my head to solve. The challenge of finding these puzzles and this was one of the reasons why I began to make the series that I know so much about. The most important thing to take away is that if you're looking for the right place to start in a challenge then I strongly recommend trying this first challenge you might find in the first problem. You will also be rewarded with a reward for all the good you do in your first challenge but it's still an uphill battle so I believe you all have to make sure you get the right place out there.
