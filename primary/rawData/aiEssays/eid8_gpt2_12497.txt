One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was 14. What did such a scene look like to my young man?

When I was 10, I went by the name "the man who stole the ball" and I was not the most happy person in the world. If I had been with my friends and relatives then I probably wouldn't be a player today and my friends would probably not have had much of a laugh. The first thing some of us got to do was to look at my life and think about what we did wrong, what we did right. I had a great reputation. It made my reputation in Canada very bad.

I remember my friend getting a bad look and I think it was from the TV. Maybe it was a slap on the wrist. I thought I had got a slap on the wrist so he could get off. He was getting really angry. Then I met up with him at the party and I turned him in and started getting like "Who the fuck is his brother?" And he'd been to the party and he was like "Who's that kid?"

I would come in his room and he would be like 'Oh, I got a good look at the whole table. What do you think? Do I look like that?' And then when he comes in, I was like "Wow, you're so young you could play the piano on a bar stool and not be able to play the guitar in a club."
