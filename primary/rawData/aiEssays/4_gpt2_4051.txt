The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it makes people stop and think. But it also ends the way it ends because in this respect, Winter Hibiscus seems to have a sort of a happy ending. In the beginning we are a group of people who have come to have a new home together that is a place where the only things different is the colors and the kind of people to live together."

That said, Winter Hibiscus' ending is quite different from the opening and beginning we get for the first six years, in that unlike its predecessor, Winter Hibiscus seems to be ending at the same time. A lot of books you would expect to find in the U.K. or America have had at least one chapter or even two, and in most cases, Winter Hibiscus manages to do that without the plot or narrative elements that make it so memorable. However, the book does manage to be a good way to start a sequel which is more of the same. Winter Hibiscus gives us a glimpse into how we feel about how each character interacts with each other and is a pretty nice change of pace. I'm curious to see how well Winter Hibiscus can be adapted to U.S. and American audiences, especially since it is a good one to start on.

Winter Hibiscus will be released October 17, 2017 for the PS4 and PC, and December 10 for the Wii U and 3DS.
