Dear Editor,

This is a very important moment for our society, and it is crucial that we reflect on the pros and cons of how computers are affecting our lives.

On the one hand, computers can simplify our lives and make us more productive. We can use them for tasks such as connecting with friends around the world, creating professional resumes, or even producing entire movies. Computers are also a source of entertainment, having access to online streaming, gaming and apps.

On the other hand, however, it's important to see that computers also have a negative impact. For instance, a lot of users spend too much time online, spending an entire night browsing social media, watching videos or playing video games. As a consequence, they can become addicted to these activities, adversely affecting their physical and mental health.

Furthermore, computers can lead to feelings of isolation, because of the time users spend disconnected from the real world instead of interacting with other people.

That is why I believe we should be able to take advantage of the numerous positive aspects of computers without allowing them to negatively affect our lives. It is essential that we take a responsible approach toward the use of computers and be mindful of any potential harm they may bring.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
