Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people.

In today's world, computers are an essential part of life for many people. We rely on them for communication, information gathering, and entertainment. However, there have been serious side effects to the widespread use of computers.

For starters, computers can be incredibly distracting, leading people to become less productive. People can get caught up in online activities and neglect responsibilities and relationships in the real world. Increased amounts of screen time have also been linked to health risks such as obesity and vision problems. 

On the other hand, computers can also be incredibly beneficial to people. They allow us to stay connected with family, friends, and colleagues, no matter the distance. Computers can also facilitate learning and collaboration.

At the end of the day, computers are an indispensable tool in many of our lives, but it is important for people to use them responsibly and in moderation. Too much reliance on our computers can lead to unhealthy habits and can even be detrimental to our health. 

I urge readers to consider the potential negative effects of computers and to use them responsibly.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
