The setting of Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead" heavily influences the experience of the cyclist and the challenges they face. The cyclist navigates a road that is described as "rock-strewn" and "gutted," with boulders and deep footsteps. This difficult terrain creates a number of difficulties for the cyclist. The constant presence of rocks, boulders, and deep footsteps can not only wear down their energy levels, but can also damage the bike, increasing the chance of flat tires or broken drivetrains. The constant presence of these obstructions also increase the risk of injury, especially with a sprained ankle occurring if the cyclist hits a large rock.

Along with this, the cyclist navigates through a wide array of swaths of foliage. Overhanging branches and deep brush can further impede progress, with the cyclist having to veer away or dodge these elements, increasing their exertion and the risk of injury. The cyclist also faces the added difficulty of sweltering temperatures and oppressive humidity, adding to their general level of exhaustion.

The combination of the hazardous terrain and oppressive forces of nature serve to add increased stress and difficulty to the cyclist's journey. The difficult landscape serves to impede progress and increase the risk of injury, while the oppressive temperatures and humidity add to the cyclist's exhaustion, creating a challenging and dangerous ride.
