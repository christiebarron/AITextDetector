The Empire State Building has an astonishing history, including its unique ability to dock dirigibles. Although the concept of allowing dirigibles to dock at skyscrapers was not uncommon in the early part of the twentieth century, the Empire State Building was the first skyscraper specifically designed to accommodate them. Despite this ambitious plan, the builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles in actually allowing dirigibles to dock. 

One of the biggest obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was the aircraftâ€™s size. Most dirigibles in the early 20th century had an average length of 780 feet and a diameter of 85 feet, which was longer than the entire Empire State Building. In order to successfully dock a dirigible, the building had to be designed with a 50-foot long mast that was easily identifiable from air so pilots could easily recognize it.

In addition to the size of the dirigible, the designers of the Empire State Building had to take into consideration the extreme winds present in New York City. One of the main challenges was designing the mooring mast to have an internal strain system strong enough and heavy enough that it could hold the airships when faced with the strong gusts of wind. It was also important to ensure that the mooring mast was constructed sturdily enough that it could bear the weight of the large aircraft.

The Empire State Building also needed to include other technical improvements to allow
