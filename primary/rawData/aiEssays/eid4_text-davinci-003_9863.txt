At the end of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho, the protagonist is thinking about a biology test she had been studying for. She contemplates the cycle of nature and how nature will eventually regenerate and start anew, symbolized by the hibiscus plant, and draws a connection to her own life and the prospect of taking the test again. The implication is that, just like the plant, the protagonist can overcome her struggles and have a second chance. This metaphor can serve as an inspirational message to the reader.
