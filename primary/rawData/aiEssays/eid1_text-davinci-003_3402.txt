Dear Editor,

I write this letter to share my opinion about the effects computers have on people. Computers are incredibly helpful in many ways, but they can also create serious problems.

On one hand, computers can be incredibly advantageous. They can offer access to a wealth of information and resources, provide entertainment, and even make many tasks simpler and more efficient. Computers can also help us communicate with family and friends, spread news quickly, and enable us to work remotely.

On the other hand, computers can have a detrimental impact on people. Computer addiction is a real phenomenon and can become a major issue, especially when it begins to affect a person's daily life. They can cause eye strain, headaches, poor posture, and even sleep disruptions. Also, with the prevalence of the Internet, computer use increases the risk of cyberbullying and online attacks.

In conclusion, computers can provide a lot of benefits, but they can also be detrimental to both mental and physical health. Therefore, I recommend using computers in moderation and taking the appropriate steps to protect yourself online.

Thank you for your time and consideration. 

Sincerely, 
[Your name]
