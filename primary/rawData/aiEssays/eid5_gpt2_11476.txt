The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' seems to be the same. One of the main obstacles in her finding work in the political struggle was that she was told her father was a member of the IRA – a reference to his membership in the British Nationalist Party – a fact which may have had some bearing on her decision to return to the UK.

'It was almost like I was a part of the IRA,' said Morris, who was the only person to know the identity of the man who allegedly killed her father in 1987. 'And who could have known about it?'

'I was like, how can anybody not know?'" added Morris, who spent eight of the 10 days researching the book and who admitted she found little evidence that members of the group had been involved in organising this event. "I was only trying to help to get this book out there. I was like, how can anyone not know? … To tell a story about a mother's death means that you have to put your story in their head."

She added: "We had Protecta coming through the door and, if not for the fact that there was a police officer walking through, we might not have been able to get the interview with it."

In addition, Morris says some of her friends had asked her about her 'gift to write about the IRA' a few weeks after her return to work.

The memoirs are part of a major series
