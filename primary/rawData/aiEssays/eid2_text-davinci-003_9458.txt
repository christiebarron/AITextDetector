The topic of censorship in libraries has come up in many conversations lately. As an avid reader, I can’t help but be weighed in on the issue. Libraries offer a wealth of knowledge and entertainment, many of which come in the form of books, music, movies, and magazines. It would be a tragedy to strip these mediums of certain material due to offensive subject matter. 

Consider what it means to censor something: to remove or disapprove of certain materials, based on standards or opinions of what is considered appropriate or desirable. While some may deem a book, movie, or song inappropriate, that does not make it any less valuable or meaningful. Whether it is challenging social norms, sharing complex perspectives, or simply providing entertainment, a wide range of material should remain available to an open-minded public.

Furthermore, censorship in any form can have a number of damaging consequences. Executing too much control over what can or can’t be accessed can stifle creativity and prevent citizens from forming their own opinions. People should be challenged and empowered to think independently and form their own conclusions. Also, censoring certain materials could send a message of censorship of ideas.

To be fair, libraries should be mindful of the content on shelves. Memorable and offensive material should be age-appropriate, with varying levels of difficulty. Libraries should create spaces that can facilitate meaningful conversations and allow citizens to express themselves.
