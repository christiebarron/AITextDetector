Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, captures the complex feelings of nostalgia, longing, and love with his vivid and detailed memories. The reader begins with his first chapter detailing his death of his father, which sets a moving, reflective tone that follows throughout the memoir.

The stories Rodriguez tells bring to life his Cuban-American upbringing, from his life in the family's small apartment in New Jersey to their long trips to visit family in Cuba. With the combination of vivid descriptions and sentimental reminiscences, Rodriguez crafts an intimate mood of nostalgia and heartache. Through each chapter, the reader experiences the bond and strong connection Rodriguez has with the places and people in his life.

One of the strongest feelings created in From Home is the theme of longing. Rodriguez writes of his nostalgia for Cuba, and the sense of longing to feel at home in one place or another. He delves deep into his memories and emotions of both Cuba and America and comes up with a fascinating sense of what it means to be an immigrant, and the feelings associated with the experience. His thoughtful meditation on nationality, language, and identity gives the reader space to think about how the world is increasingly interconnected and the lives of people who were born and raised in more than one country.

The mood of From Home is one of deep introspection and emotion, as the reader experiences the poignancy of Rodriguez's stories and his reminiscences.
