Computers have many effects on people. For example: "The person has an increased propensity to drink alcohol. And that can result in emotional distress and mood swings." People who have more emotional problems, however, may not generally suffer when they drink alcohol.

For decades, scientists have believed that alcohol exposure may interfere with how people use the brain and other components of our body. But little research on the subject has shown that alcohol intake can interfere with the ability of certain brain regions to produce chemicals, resulting in increased activity of the neural circuits supporting emotion and cognition in the frontal and executive systems, as well as cognitive function.

When researchers tried to understand how alcohol was able to alter the brain by changing the chemical makeup of certain parts of a small number of brain structures, it was not surprising to believe that it was possible to improve the ability of certain areas by drinking alcohol.

But until now, scientists were unable to do so.

What scientists now know: The role of Alcohol in the regulation of emotions is not well understood

While the potential for the association between alcohol and a variety of neuropsychiatric conditions has now been documented for more than 70 years, studies on brain regions involved in the regulation of emotion have not found them to be especially important.

In 1999, for example, the National Institutes of Health awarded the NIH's Human Substance Abuse and Alcohol, Food and Nutrition Research Program a $3.8 million award for its work in the treatment of
