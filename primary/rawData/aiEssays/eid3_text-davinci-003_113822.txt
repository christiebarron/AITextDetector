In Joe Kurmaski’s short story “Rough Road Ahead,” the setting plays a crucial role in the central conflict of the story. The main character, a professional cyclist, is faced with a dangerous, mountainous road that blocks his path to the finish line. This uphill road is full of tight turns, narrow spaces, and a shifting terrain that threatens to derail his career. 

The tight turns require the cyclist to pay close attention to his controlling movements in order to make it safely past them. As the terrain shifts, so does the cyclist’s speed. He must adjust his timing and pace to account for the sudden dips and inclines, or else risk losing control. Instead of simply racing upwards, the cyclist must concentrate and exert energy to navigate past the numerous side roads. 

The narrow paths also require patience and skill—especially since there are times that the cyclist must accommodate or avoid other vehicles. With another racer in the background, the cyclist is pressed to keep his composure and stay on course. The combination of the many tight turns and narrow paths puts the cyclist in a precarious situation. He is constantly under pressure to make the right decisions and avoid mistakes that could potentially cost him a championship.

The setting of the story creates an additional level of tension and pressure on the cyclist, making his journey even more difficult. It forces him to remain focused and attentive to his surroundings, making the overall race even more thrilling. The
