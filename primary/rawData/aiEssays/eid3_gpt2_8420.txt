Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

This is the first time the setting has been included in the main page of this guide.

Since early 2017.

The cycle guide is updated continuously.

Some details, like the time that the setting is in place, are missing. Please note that the Cycling Advisory Committee also adds some information.

For more details on setting your bike, please refer to the cycling safety guide on page 19.
