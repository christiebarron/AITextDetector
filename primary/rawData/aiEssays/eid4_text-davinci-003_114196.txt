The narrator of this poem, a student, is reflecting on their difficult life. They are trying to pass a hard test, and they are worried about it and feeling overwhelmed. The final line of the poem is a reminder to the narrator that even if they fail the test, they can try again when spring arrives. The imagery of the snows melting, geese returning, and flowers blossoming is meant to be encouraging, and to remind the narrator that with another season comes another chance.
