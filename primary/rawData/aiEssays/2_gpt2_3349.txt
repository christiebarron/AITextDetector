I believe that censorship of materials in libraries, media-distributing sites, or by anyone else at all will serve as a tool in its own right. And this is what I see as a necessary consequence.

I also believe that the goal of education and the future of humanity will determine who we are. There is a strong connection that we can make between a group of people and how the community will build on this connection.

In short, it's time for education, awareness, and dialogue that will change humanity and the world, and that will be achieved by individuals living a new way of life.

I encourage all students, journalists, scholars, teachers, and civil society to meet tomorrow and come to our university and learn in a new way.

Thank you for coming to our campus tonight.
