The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it presents an idea of an age of the soul, which seems to be coming out at the same time as we're heading into the age of flesh. It includes a number of other pieces of writing I haven't explored. We're going to be getting older as we age.

Katherine: So what is the writing process like?

David: No, there are just so many different aspects of each novel I do in different genres. I try to keep things on the cutting room floor to try to create them, but it's really about how I interpret the story. It's just about how I look at the author and look at the whole thing.

Katherine: What do you know about the character's personality?

David: I've never done a character's voice before I was in high school. It was really just because when I was writing my first novel when I was 14 I read The Man, that I got that kind of an edge which I had to play with overand do this whole thing with the voice…not just in the main course but over the course of the books and through the whole book…

Katherine: Oh, and I think there's actually some great ideas there for him in the book.

David: Absolutely. I've never used the='

Katherine: Right—and that's not gonna tell me about your style or personality.
