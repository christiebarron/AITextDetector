One time I experienced laughter in my life was when they showed me the way to Mecca. They said it was a beautiful way to go. It makes you feel good and you can go all night. We were there in front of Mecca. One time they asked if I was going to have a meal with them. I said no as I didn't eat before. They said they don't eat meals in the United States. I said well you know people ask for special food in America where the special food is. I said that there are places that can be found in the food in Mecca. They said I will come to a restaurant and we can make the meal together. We made the meal. They said there are some other places that are more expensive but that is how we made it. They said that we could bring $30,000 a week. One time I was talking to them and asked where they would pay for food. They told me that the cheapest place in Mecca is $10 and they said they could save $10 a night. I said that money will help them stay here for a few years. One time I was sitting with my husband where they took us to a restaurant. We ate the dishes. We drank the juice from the water and cooked them. They said that the only thing that is unhealthy and expensive is the food. It was very hot and dirty. It felt good to come out to a place so beautiful for a meal, but it was also very filthy
