To the Editor:

In todayâ€™s world of rapid technological development and advancement, it is no surprise that computers have had a huge impact on our society. While this technology has certainly been invaluable, its effects on people need to be carefully considered.

The proliferation of computers has changed how people interact and communicate with one another. With ever more powerful devices and networks, people have become less likely to seek out real-world interpersonal contact. This can lead to isolation, depression, and even disconnection from the physical world.

At the same time, the easy access to information and resources provided by computers can be beneficial to our knowledge and understanding. We have more resources than ever before at our fingertips, allowing us to learn and grow on our own accord.

On the whole, I believe that the effects of computers on people need to be taken into consideration. We must remember to practice balance - engaging in healthy amounts of physical interaction and activities, while also making use of the plethora of knowledge available to us through computers.

I urge readers to recognize and reflect on the consequences of computers on our lives and strive for a harmonious balance of technology and physical presence. 

Sincerely,
