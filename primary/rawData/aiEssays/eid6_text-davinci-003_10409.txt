When it opened in 1931, the Empire State Building was designed with an eye to the future by including a mooring mast located on the building’s 103rd floor. The purpose of the mast was to make the Empire State Building the first-ever man-made structure to allow dirigibles to dock.

Despite the enthusiasm for this futuristic idea, the designers of the Empire State Building were faced with several obstacles. Many of the problems they faced, such as the difficulty of securing dock rights and finding materials suitable for mooring, had never been encountered before. This posed a unique challenge when it came to designing the mast.

The height of the mooring mast was another challenge. At the time, the highest allowed elevation for dirigible mooring was 500 feet. The construction team shortened the mast to remain within this limit in order to remain in compliance with the New York State Building Code. The mast also had to be made from lightweight material, so Aluminum was chosen as a compromise.

In addition to constructing the mooring mast, the designers also had to contemplate the navigational and weather issues that would be encountered when docking such a large aircraft. The Empire State Building was designed to accommodate dirigibles as large as “the Graf Zeppelin and the USS Los Angeles”. Therefore, the navigation system had to be very precise and reliable. Furthermore, the mast was designed with rain collection troughs and wind drift deflect
