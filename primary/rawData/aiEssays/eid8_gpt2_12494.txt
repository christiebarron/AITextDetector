One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I watched a series of ads for a new iPhone app that had been launched to millions of iPhone users. I saw it as a joke and I thought it might come off somewhat condescending, maybe a Calvin Klein "joke" would work. It doesn't, however, work; Apple has a much simpler process for finding new iPhones. All you need is a text message message.

Then a few days or weeks ago, The Atlantic published an article explaining that some companies were doing a great job of adding content to a single phone:

Apple has become an American manufacturer of phones after getting its second-generation iPhone 4S, and a year later the company sold about 20 million units, the most the company has ever issued. That's almost triple the company's share of North American sales. The new iPad came with Apple Pencil, Google Nexus S and Apple Watch, while the first iPhone and iPad sold the same number of units. As for the company's own online presence, it said the iPhone 5's web interface and app store are designed to "enhance iOS customer experiences and drive our digital footprint."

It makes sense that Apple wants to create what it calls an "accomplished, user-app-rich, user-service" company. It also makes sense that it wants to get off a high. The answer to this is to build great content with a high-quality user experience.
