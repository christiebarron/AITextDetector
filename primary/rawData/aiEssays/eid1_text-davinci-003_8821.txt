I remember sitting in my living room with my best friend. We had been inseparable since we were little kids and I was so excited for the evening ahead. We had decided to watch a funny movie and just kick back and relax after a long week at school. 

The movie was hilarious and we sat there for what felt like an hour with tears running down our faces. Our laughter was so loud that I'm sure my neighbors could hear us. At one point, we both looked at each other, still laughing, and I could tell we were both thinking the same thing â€” that we were so incredibly lucky to have each other. 

We finally ended up taking a break from the movie to get some air. We both grabbed one of my mom's back patio chairs and placed it against the side of the garage. From there, we could see all of our neighbors and all of their different lives. It was great people watching! 

But the best part was when I heard my neighbor's kids laughing. I turned to my best friend and smiled. We both started to laugh with them, all of us just as happy to be part of the moment. We laughed together for what felt like an eternity, and it was in those moments that both of us realized how lucky we were to have each other. 

Laughter is special; it can bridge the gap between two people and I am so thankful for moments like this one.
