I believe that censorship of materials in libraries in Europe is a key factor to the European Union achieving its goals for free expression and freedom of expression, particularly as regards our freedom of speech," an EU spokesperson added.

"We reiterate, at this time," the spokesperson added, "that the European Union cannot engage in such practices when it is concerned about the rights of its member states. Such practices include the illegal use of electronic media such as social media, the unauthorized sharing of sensitive information and, if a content has been seized, the dissemination of material on a major network operated from abroad."

The spokesperson continued, "Those actions undertaken by countries in the EU or elsewhere do not promote freedom of expression in the EU and cannot therefore necessarily promote the promotion of intellectual property rights. The use, distribution or sharing of information from the EU or elsewhere violates legal and constitutional principles and is not in any way conducive to protecting human rights and freedoms and other human rights."
