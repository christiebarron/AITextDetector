Computers have many effects on people. Think about people who are in denial, which is when I tell them to quit complaining so I can show them the truth. To be honest I would really rather see people that are not as hard as they look, are willing to look, and are open to honest discussions than someone who feels they know less than many people and wants to make changes, or does not care enough about the community to do anything.

It is also true that we have more of an obligation to people, including myself, for not having more empathy for others. Many people feel that I just cannot understand their feelings and have tried not to ask people for their opinion. If I have been successful in telling them I am sorry and wish I could give them some more empathy, that may be OK.

There may be times, such as my personal life, where I will try to explain things differently. This can be challenging. However, there are times when that's ok. This may not always be true, but it is often the most effective way to do it and certainly not the most difficult.

I wish that there was an easy solution to getting as far as I could into becoming a professional with that help. I really would, but it is not as easy as I would like it to be. If you are a person who is going through all this, you will benefit greatly from this and the learning we all do in this community (a lot).
