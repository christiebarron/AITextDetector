I remember the time my mom asked me to babysit my little sister for the first time. I was only ten at the time and I was really unsure of what I was doing. I was so scared that my little sister would get hurt or end up crying for no reason. I had never really taken care of someone before, let alone a toddler. 

My mom reassured me that I could do it and she gave me some tips of what to do to keep my sister entertained. I followed her instructions and did my best to keep my sister happy. Things were going great until my little sister started to cry. I didn't know what to do and I started to panic. 

At that moment, I remembered what my mom had told meâ€”to remain patient. So, I stood up and walked slowly towards my sister. I knelt down in front of her, and in a calm voice, I asked her what was wrong. As I listened to her explain her situation, I noticed her crying slow down a bit. Seeing that I was being patient and understanding, I asked if she would like some help. 

My little sister smiled and nodded. After that, I was able to help her with whatever she was struggling with. She ended up calming down and she even thanked me for being patient. From that experience, I learnt that being patient can be difficult, but it can also be rewarding.
