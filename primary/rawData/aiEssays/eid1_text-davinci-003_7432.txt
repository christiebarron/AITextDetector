The author ends the poem with this line in order to create a powerful image that expresses a sense of hope and reinvigoration. By visualizing a future in which the hibiscus is in bloom again and the speaker is prepared to take the same test they struggled with before, the author conveys the idea that no matter how daunting a task may be, there is always a chance to try again and make things better. This is a positive message that allows readers to consider their own struggles in a more optimistic light.
