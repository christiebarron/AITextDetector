Dear Editor, 

I'm writing to share my opinion on the effects computers have on people. It is my belief that computers are an incredible tool for resourcefulness, but they can also be an obstacle to learning and risk to our health if misused.

In their simplest form, computers can offer a wide range of information and opportunity and empower individuals to understand more about the world on a global scale than ever before. From unique perspectives about human rights, to news media outlets, or even opportunities to seek employment-- computers have endless capabilities to transform lives.

On the other hand, dependency on computers can lead to mental health issues and physical health problems. As technology advances, so do the risks involved. Too much time sitting in front of a computer can cause cognitive diseases like depression or insomnia. Plus, exposure to electromagnetic radiation can increase risks of cancer, heart disease, and chromosomal damage.

For the safety and health of our society, I urge the readers of this article to actively reflect on the positive and negative implications of computer use in their lives. I contend that computers can enhance the lives of people, but like any powerful tool, we must use them wisely. 

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
