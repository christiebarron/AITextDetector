The striking image of the Empire State Building is iconic, standing tall and proud in the skyline of New York City. However, back when the building was first constructed, its designer, William F. Lamb, envisioned something more – the ability to ‘dock’ airships, or dirigibles, on the building's mast. The idea seemed radical – and posed a considerable challenge to the Empire State Building’s builders. 

The mast, or ‘mooring mast’, was built 400-feet above the building’s roof, at the then-unheard of height of 1,250 feet. This was a daring construction in and of itself, as at the time, no other building had a mast reaching even close to the same height as the Empire State Building’s. To make the mooring mast both safe and effective, builders had to overcome several obstacles.

The mast had to be extremely sturdy to support the large vessels that would dock at it. This meant that the majority of the mooring mast was built with solid steel and reinforced concrete – 1000 tons in total. This gave the necessary strength and stability, but also required a great deal of time and effort with the construction. Additionally, workers had to install other special tools onto the mast, such as ladders, platforms, and a winch. These were to make it easier to access the mooring mast for service and maintenance without having
