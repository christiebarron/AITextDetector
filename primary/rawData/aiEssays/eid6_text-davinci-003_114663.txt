The Empire State Building has long been a symbol of innovation and progress. When it was planned in the late 1920s, the architects had the innovative idea of allowing dirigibles -- passenger airships -- to dock at the mast located atop the building. However, the idea of "mooring" dirigibles at the building presented a number of difficult obstacles.

To begin with, the Empire State Building was significantly taller than any other structure of its time, standing at 1,454 feet. The mooring mast located at the top of the building was 200 feet tall, making it even taller than the tallest directory of the Eiffel Tower. Such an unprecedented height made docking a dirigible a major challenge. Since the airship had to bring its own supplies and equipment, including long cables to tie down the craft to the mast, the size and weight of the supplies needed would prove to be a major obstacle. Furthermore, since the airship relied on wind conditions to maneuver, the right level of wind was necessary to safely dock a craft atop the building. 

In addition to these challenges, the cost of bringing dirigibles to dock at the building was prohibitively expensive. The infrastructure for mooring a dirigible would have cost a significant amount of money, and the docking would have required expensive equipment and supplies. Furthermore, the airships themselves were expensive to operate and maintain, and their limited range would mean that the mooring mast at
