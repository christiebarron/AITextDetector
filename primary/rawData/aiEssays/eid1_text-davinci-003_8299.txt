The Empire State Building was a feat of engineering that set a new bar for skyscraper construction and continues to be a luminary in the world of architecture today. While it was an incredible success, the most ambitious goal was to make the building able to accommodate dirigibles docking on its tip. As a result, planners had to overcome a number of unique challenges before the dream could become a reality.

The most immediate challenge was the sheer size of the building itself. Dirigibles of the day were massive beasts and building a tower that could withstand the tension exerted by the rigid airships was no simple task. The amount of weight the structure could accommodate and how permanent the fixtures had to be was a major unknown. Fortunately, the design ingenuity of Empire State Building architects and engineers overcame the challenge. Reinforced steel frames and masonry pegs helped lock the giant tower into place while an intricate network of metal poles on the roof provided a place for the dirigibles to moor.

The second, and perhaps most unknown, challenge to the dockable tower concerned air traffic control. Dirigible flights could still be unpredictable, so a system had to be devised to manage the flights in order to prepare the tower and ensure the safety of passengers. To do this, directors of the tower invented the 'mooring mast', an ingenious structure that reached into the air and provided the necessary warning system. Essentially a device that sent out sound waves in order to detect when a
