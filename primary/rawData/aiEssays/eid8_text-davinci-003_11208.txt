 

I had been working with my new colleague for a couple of weeks. We had been getting along okay, but there was never any real connection between us. Until the day it happened.

I had been working on a project and had made what I thought was a mistake. I sat for a moment, panicking, when my colleague suddenly let out a big laugh. It was such a loud, boisterous laugh that I couldn't help but laugh along with her.

We continued to laugh together for a few minutes, until sheer exhaustion settled in. Then we sat there in the silence, still smiling. In that moment, I felt a closeness with her I hadn't ever felt before. 

The feeling was a welcome one, and we've been friends ever since. Laughter breaks down the barriers between us and brought us closer together. It was certainly the best mistake I ever made!
