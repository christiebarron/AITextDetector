I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a failure. These publications are the tools that have allowed us to do so much to educate society to a greater degree."

According to Taki, when asked why such a statement was relevant, he replied: "I have not done so for my students. My students and the media don't speak to me at all. I have already said that my students who are using my books and resources are the first generation of people in Africa born and raised by an African government to engage in a critical, pluralistic, progressive, open and democratic dialogue. All of which means that we have an obligation to speak up so that Africans know better about other people's perspectives and ideas than we have."

On the issue of censorship, he spoke about the need to ensure "that Africa does not become an isolated nation where political prisoners are allowed to enter with impunity and that they do not have to pay a fee for their participation". The Ministry of Information said all the documents in Kame Kame Kame Publications (Kame KAM) will be published at every library and it would be "unacceptable to allow books that have been censored in our country to leave libraries without their proper legal and financial licence".

Asked whether publishing Kame Kame was in the interest of African people, Taki said, "I don't know that a word could be said to "defend" or defend this country and all South African children.
