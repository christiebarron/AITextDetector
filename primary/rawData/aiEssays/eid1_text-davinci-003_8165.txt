The idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was the subject of much research and development,but in its completion faced several obstacles.Built in New York City from 1930 to 1931, the Empire State Building represented a modern marvel of architectural engineering, but the plan to bring airships to its mast presented a unique challenge.The primary problem revolved around the design andconstruction of the mooring mast, which stood 350 feet above the building’s top floor and was meant to anchor the dirigibles.

Despite the advanced engineering of the Empire State Building, the demands of the mooring mast presented an unforeseen challenge both to the building’s designers and to the manufacturers of the airships.The size of the mast had to be large enough to secure a substantial sized dirigible, yet the engineering of the building floor had not taken such a load into consideration.The solution proposed was to make the mast adjustable in accordance with the size of the airships, allowing it to be fully extended when accommodating the bigger dirigibles and retracted when he lighter ones required mooring.

In addition, the anchoring system was a question of great debate.The original idea was to simply secure the dirigibles to the building itself,though this was discarded in favour of a pivoting steel tube that could tilt to accommodate the ship’s weight. However, the difficulty was in finding a way to balance the weight of the mast and air
