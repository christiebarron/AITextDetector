The ending of "Winter Hibiscus" by Minfong Ho is a reflection on resilience and the determination to keep striving despite the challenges of life. By ending the story with a promise to retake the math test in the spring, the narrator is symbolically expressing her perseverance and faith in a brighter future. As the narrator looks forward to the symbolic rebirth of the hibiscus in the spring, it serves as a reminder of her own ability to return stronger than ever, just like the flower.
