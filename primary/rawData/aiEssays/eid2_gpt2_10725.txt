I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a moral and necessary duty of freedom even in the light of an environment of violence to protect our freedom. That right is protected by the First Amendment and I would like to suggest a link between the Library of Congress decision and my work. If you would like or need further details of how I work on this topic please contact me. – Anonymous

So in the spirit of freedom, what are the policies and opinions concerning this issue? There are many opinions, but in my opinion the information and public issues need to be more clear, that is to say the information needs to be more clear, and then people who use it will not have it out of control, or they will be denied access or will be denied information. For those that want to use these issues as examples, I hope the discussion will be constructive and relevant and as it is people will share their views. I am happy to provide you with my answer if you want it, and I hope you will help out! – Anonymous
