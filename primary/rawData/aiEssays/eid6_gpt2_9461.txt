Their next step was to go back to drawing up plans for the Empire's main lobby. The plan would have asked the building's owner, architect Robert J. DeWitt, to design a space for him to store a computer desk. It was a tricky question, too. The building's top floor was not exactly covered with brick, and a high-end piece of office-only technology, an inflatableexpensive version of Glass, might have added more mass but might not have added enough floor space.
