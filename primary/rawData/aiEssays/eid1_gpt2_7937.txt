Computers have many effects on people. It affects all those processes. We can't predict exactly what the effects will be. That makes it a great place to start. You'll see some of these effect-related things but it's really a lot of people doing real-world things.

Here's the basic thing I've learned over the years. I've never seen a study like this before, or even once. All they need is the money to hire someone with the numbers to do a field study, because you do something in real science. A real-world job, right? There is plenty in science to pursue. Then you can look at other fields and ask some of the "students" to do a field, and you'll get a lot of bang for your buck. And they'll look at, you are right, why do they have to do that? You can look at, you're right, they're doing it in real-life. If you want to do a field study then you must understand that you're doing it under the assumption that an open source community of your students will do the work. But if you don't, you'll have a big problem. You've got so many other people that you are dealing with that much work behind the scenes to do it. I mean, the idea of putting in a community of people that I believe are the backbone of an open source project isn't really scalable at all. I mean, I can
