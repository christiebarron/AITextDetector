I had a job interview at a company that I was really excited about. I made sure to look my best, print my resume, and rehearse answers to potential interview questions. The interview was scheduled for 2pm, but an hour past and I was still waiting. I was beginning to get antsy and all the prepped answers I had rehearsed started to slip my mind. Just when I was ready to ask someone what was going on, the interviewer came out to apologize and let me know he had been caught in a meeting and was running late.

I was tempted to let go of my pent-up frustration and react negatively, but I decided to remain patient. I knew this wasn't the interviewer's fault and I didn't want to start off on a bad foot. I smiled and nodded and waited patiently for the interview to begin. 

I'm glad I waited, because it ended up being a great conversation and the interviewer was very impressed with my ability to remain patient. It paid off in the end - I got the job! I've been using my patience ever since to tackle new challenges and keep a level head.
