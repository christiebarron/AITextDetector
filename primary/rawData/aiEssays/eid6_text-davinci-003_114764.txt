The task of allowing dirigibles to dock onto the Empire State Building was an ambitious but ultimately not successful one. This task, if successful, would have represented a great technological leap forward. Despite the ambition of the builders, they faced many obstacles in achieving this.

The idea of allowing dirrigibles to dock onto the Empire State Building was first proposed by Thomas Lamb, the architect in charge of the building’s design. Lamb ensured that the building was designed with a view to facilitating the dirigible docking system. Once construction of the building was complete, the Empire State Building Company worked on constructing a mooring mast to be added to the building’s deck. 

The task of constructing the mooring mast was easier said than done. Before the mast could be erected, the builders would need to make sure that the mast’s mooring lines were strong enough to secure the airship in strong winds. After considerable testing, it was determined that the existing steel and cable combination was not capable of doing this. 

Another obstacle was the sheer size of the mooring mast. It was constructed over 150 metres in length, and had 13 beams that extended out from the centre, and numerous turnbuckles and cables that connected to the airship. In addition, the mast also required pulley systems, block and tackles, and winches to fully operate. Additionally, the builders wanted the mast to be aesthetically pleasing to
