The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, some of the towers could fall apart after just a few months, while the most powerful towers had long, costly construction days. Because the Empire State Building was being designed in the 1970s and 1980s, these problems would occur more commonly in the last few years.

Second, building blocks that would likely fall apart over centuries of time also came into play when building materials needed their own unique shape. The Empire State Building's "Hangover-like" and its "Double-Twist" joints were designed around the "two ends" that would usually hold together the four corners of the building, a structure known as a "dumb" joint. Because the upper edge of the structure had two "dumb" joints and some large, flat surfaces on its roof, an elevated portion of the structure needed its own "triangle" motion, and building blocks that could only be seen by the view provided by the Twin-Twin rear ends would have to find new angles to keep the shape of the buildings. Finally, the building blocks could only be seen by the tower's eyes.

The second issue to have to overcome is the building's need for large, wide, "dumb" joints, which would give the towers an even greater look. But even building blocks that would otherwise fall apart just once or twice would get an added-up appearance of their own.
