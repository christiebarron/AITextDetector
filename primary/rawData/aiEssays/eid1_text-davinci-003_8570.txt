I recently visited an older relative in the hospital and was shocked to find her in so much pain. We talked for a long time and I could see the discomfort in her eyes. Despite my own worries and concerns, I was determined to stay as patient and calm as possible.

I listened to her stories, held her fragile hands, and reassured her that everything was going to be alright. I reminded her that no matter the difficulty, things will eventually get easier. She thanked me for my understanding and patience, and genuinely seemed to appreciate it. 

I didn't leave the hospital until she smiled and even then I asked if there was anything else I could do. She told me that I had done enough by just being there and being patient. I couldn't have agreed with her more and left feeling grateful that I had the opportunity to be there with her in her time of need.
