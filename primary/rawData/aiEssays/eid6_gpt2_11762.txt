The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In fact, there was little room for an elevator, although it was possible to construct the tower in two ways. One would have been for the elevator to be made of glass, which would have meant that if the pilot used a solid glass material, it would actually make the elevator shaft lighter. The other was for the elevator to be made of wooden.

To accomplish either of these, the architects had to make sure that they could hold the various types ofYES. There were many, including the first three tiers, where the ship had to be made of some kind of wood. Even though wood could also make a ship larger, the second tier required that the ship was made of metal. Even that requirement was met by designing another wood tier, which contained both glass and lead. Wood could also be produced by adding various metals to produce more steel. Wood had a negative value and an upward value, whereas lead and lead were negative. There were also materials that were hard, which did not circumcision the ship, but did not leave a dent in the structure. For example, the first stone at the lower level was probably used to increase the thickness by several hundred centimeters.

Some of the builders even developed the use of high performance engines. The first such type of engine was shown at a recent show. If the ship was to be made of glass and lead, it would also need to be
