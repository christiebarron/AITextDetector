One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was talking to her, I laughed and then I went back out there with the crowd, and she smiled back. It was the best way to come and sit down with her, and the funnier she is to be in front of the camera, and it brings her an emotional connection and a sense of comfort.

We did have problems with our son and we had some family disputes with the girl, so our relationship was solid. We had problems with the relationship though. It was very hard to get the kid back for a while, and it was hard to keep him. There were probably a few children that could have helped, and he was still struggling to learn. If we went with any parents we would try and tell them how much he needed, and how much it would cost. So we had two problems, and one was because we thought he wanted to go to school and was not able to do it. Some kids will talk about the cost, and some kids will say no, and some kids will say it's for Christmas. Some kids will say, 'If you take one more minute for your kids, you're not going to get that, either.'"
