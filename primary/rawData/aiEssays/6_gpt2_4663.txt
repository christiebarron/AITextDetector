The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Among them was a lack of public spaces for the use of the building's two elevators. More recently, the Building Council's planning supervisor, Michael Oates, approved a 4-acre extension of the Empire State Building where the dirigibles could dock, but the work stalled because the building's ceiling required that the elevators be lowered so the builders could move the dirigibles.

Even in places where dirigibles could be positioned as soon as they could reach the ground, the FAA's Office of Design and Standards (OFSS) requires that such construction permit be issued, not denied: for example, in certain construction scenarios, requiring an FAA approval to proceed with the construction of a dirigible in an area where the lift would be unable to move. In 2011, for example, the FAA granted an extension for the construction of a second dirigible in an area between 2.5 and 1.5 acres, while the FAA granted an extension for the construction of both a second and third dirigibles in an area of less than 12 acres. The exemption in 2011 expired within 60 days of the FAA permitting approvals (Section 2303).

The FAA, Oates said last month, "had no interest in pursuing this matter. Instead, we had an expectation that the public would be able to use any public space for the purpose of providing public goods." That expectation was
