I believe that censorship of materials in libraries and archives is unacceptable," said the official (and no doubt most popular): "Because this is, frankly, censorship of materials that would not violate copyright and may result in severe physical and psychological harm to the individual in question."

Some critics, who say they can't take it anymore, are saying there are too many examples of "censorship" in our nation, and that it's very, very dangerous.

I think some of the statements from people like David Frum, who are against censorship that is "unacceptable" and "harmful."

I think a lot of this was created for the internet. I'll give a lot of credit to the Internet in a lot of ways. Let me tell you one thing. I'm one of those people. I'm not arguing that censorship is bad or harmful, but I'm not arguing that the problem is over.

The internet should not be characterized as a place to discuss or engage with politics. I'm arguing that the debate needs to go elsewhere.

On the subject of pornography, and why I thought censorship was so bad, one of the things I heard from George Takei a few years back was that I thought at no point was anyone commenting on what's happening in this town.

The debate was about the way porn is viewed and shared and is being used within.

This is the type of viewpoint that should be considered.
