Dear [Recipient],

I am writing this letter to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. By and large, computers have had a profoundly positive impact on people’s lives—both professionally and personally.

Professionally, computers allow us to work faster and more efficiently. From document processing to complex calculations, computers simply make it easier and faster for us to get things done—which ultimately leads to increased productivity. Secondly, computers have helped people to stay connected worldwide. By using social media platforms and the internet, we can communicate with anyone around the world at any given moment. This has made staying in touch with people a lot easier than ever before.

Finally, computers have allowed us to access new forms of entertainment. From streaming movies and TV shows to playing games on our phones and Xboxes, computers have made it easier for us to find fun and entertainment in our daily lives.

In conclusion, computers have been nothing short of a blessing. They have made our lives easier and more efficient, helped us to stay connected with anyone in the world, and they have allowed us to have access to an unprecedented amount of entertainment. Therefore, I urge the readers of this letter to consider the positive effects of computers in their daily lives and embrace them accordingly.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
