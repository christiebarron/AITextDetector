The creation of the Empire State Building in New York City presented a unique challenge to the builders: allowing dirigibles to dock with the structure. In order to accomplish this, many obstacles had to be overcome. As described in Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s ‘The Mooring Mast’, these obstacles included finding a suitable structural design, updating safety regulations, and constructing a viable dock.

The first major obstacle facing the designers was to find a suitable structural design which could bear the load of the mooring mast and mooring cables to allow the ships to dock safely. Additionally, the designers had to consider the structure’s integrity during strong winds and to construct the mast at the height necessary for proper mooring. Various alternatives had to be considered, such as grade-bearing columns, bundled cable systems, and steel frames, before settling on a solution.

In addition to ensuring the structural integrity of the design, safety regulations regarding the mooring mast had to be updated. These regulations were developed with larger vessels in mind, which did not take into account the significantly smaller dirigibles. Special attention had to be paid to aligning the specifications with those of the dirigibles, as well as with any other new technology that was developed in the years between the regulation’s establishment and the Empire State Building’s construction.

Finally, a viable dock had to be constructed with enough space to allow the
