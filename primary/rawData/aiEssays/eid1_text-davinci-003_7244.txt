In Joe Kurmaski’s poem, “Rough Road Ahead,” the features of the setting have a tremendous effect on the cyclist. The cyclist is on a road full of “loose gravel” and “broken glass,” which present a very difficult terrain for the cyclist to traverse. The cyclist has to negotiate sharp stones and crushed glass that harshly jut against the tires. The cyclist has to also be aware of the “broken pavement” that is a risk of causing a dangerous imbalance in their bike. The cyclist has to deal with strong gales of wind that forces the cyclist to struggle and struggle, potentially risking exhaustion. All of these features of the setting make the ride even more challenging for the cyclist. 

The cyclist, though warned ahead of his journey, still decides to push on and take the road. This illustrates the cyclist’s courage and determination to move forward despite the challenge and difficulty of the road. The cyclist’s experience shows that despite the great obstacles, one can still have the courage to tackle difficult challenges. 

Overall, these features of the setting force the cyclist to take on a great challenge. Due to these features, the cyclist can experience both physical and mental hardship that will eventually strengthen the cyclist’s will and courage. Through this poem, Joe Kurmaski shows how taking difficult paths in our own life can improve our strength and resilience.
