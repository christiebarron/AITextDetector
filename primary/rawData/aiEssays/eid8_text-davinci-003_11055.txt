I had been out to dinner with a friend of mine and the conversation had been particularly lively. We were talking about all manner of things and some of the topics had been quite serious. So when I started laughing uproariously about something that my friend had said, I could tell that my friend was a bit taken aback.

But then I noticed that the more I laughed the bigger my friendâ€™s smile grew. And soon enough, my friend was laughing along with me. That's when I knew that laughter was really the most powerful thing between us. We laughed for what seemed like ages and when we eventually calmed down we both felt so much better. I knew then and there, that laughter was indeed the shortest distance between two people.
