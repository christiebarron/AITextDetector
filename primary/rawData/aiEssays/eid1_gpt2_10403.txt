Computers have many effects on people.

The most difficult thing for me is that computers all have the same set of rules—you can do everything, you can code something, you can change it, you can tell people all that stuff—but I don't have that feeling of having to do every single move of every computer on the planet.

You have internship opportunities, but you don't have to do every job. The rest you can do is use your imagination and get your way before you go to college. You can get out and run.

It still hurts a little bit to think about how hard that is. If I were to write a software programmer I'd always be working on something that could break if I was not careful. The idea was always that computer programming is hard, but I'm more interested in the business than the technical side. I have an idea and I want it. I don't know where people will take that.

What are the challenges you see in being able to get work after college?

The problem is that some people go through the long path of being in graduate school before becoming software programmers. And a lot of them get to the point where they lose interest in the subject. It can take a couple of years and people
