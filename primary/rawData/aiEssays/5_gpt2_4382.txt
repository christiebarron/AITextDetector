The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' may only further increase as it makes it a book that is well-covered by the mainstream media and shows the growing impact of climate change on people and society worldwide, with many looking outside the West.

The author explores the role climate change play on humanity after it is over, the way it impacts people, the effects of pollution, the environmental impact that humans will cause and how it can be prevented or treated. All three of these topics are featured in the book, with the most recently coming up on the subject on the site Climate Change Denial.

As the US and UK prepare to vote on the US Republican primary candidate, David Cameron, who will be in the UK on 26 September, have all expressed hope for a new US climate plan which they believe would be 'as good as any other on environmental issues, including climate change.' But these hope seems to have fallen on deaf ears in these three countries as the climate debate intensifies.
