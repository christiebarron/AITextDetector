It was my first day of college and my roommate and I had been in the dorm for a few hours. She had already made several friends and I was feeling a bit left out. Suddenly, she burst into the room with an excited look and began pulling out a small puppet. She said that her new friends in the dorm had been talking about a game they could all play.

She explained it to me and I couldn't help but burst out laughing. The game essentially involved all of us gathering together and taking turns acting out scenarios with the puppet. I had never seen anything like it before and the sheer ridiculousness of the idea was enough to keep us all laughing for hours.

We spent the next few days in the dorm playing the game, each of us taking turns being the lead actor or actress in the puppet show. It was a great way to bond and I felt like I was quickly becoming friends with my new dorm mates. We would all laugh together through the nonsensical scenarios and it was the first time I could feel truly relaxed.

Laughter has definitely been the source of many of my best memories. Strangely enough, it was also the thing that helped me settle into college life and get over my initial insecurities. This game brought us closer together and I'm thankful for the laughter it shared among us all.
