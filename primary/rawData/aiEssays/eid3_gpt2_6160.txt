Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. A simple, very smooth driving choice – it's not as if there's any obvious difference between the roads or driving style. However, the fact that they feel like they get the most enjoyment out of some of the streets at night seems to be the point where some people find that road to be rather fun – perhaps because of its many, many routes leading to and from the surrounding area. In cycling the cyclist needs space to ride, to be open and to be able to find and manage the surrounding areas without getting dragged into traffic on them. It can be a lot of fun, especially when in the'short run,' when cycling through a large amount of other streets. As the bike becomes increasingly popular and more established, the sense of fun may have been lost. There need to be "harder roads to navigate" – roads that are both open and pleasant – to a cyclist's liking – to the point of being enjoyable – this is likely if the route were more restricted.

Other interesting features are the addition of a new power line; the turn signal for both the left and right hand brake pedals (where other brake pedals are visible on the road) has been added. It really helps that an easy access to other roads makes for some interesting cycling journeys. In particular, it's interesting to see an increase in ridership, as more people cycle and cyclists use some of the less crowded areas
