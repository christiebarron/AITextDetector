The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first was an obstruction called the North Wall separating Washington, D.C., from New York. Construction of the North Wall was under way at the time of the Revolution, when many of the towers were still constructed. (In that era, two towers were completed to form the Empire State Building. One tower was constructed in 1847 in Kansas City, then the other in New York, eventually being built in a former Confederate post, in which it was installed with the American flag. The other tower was constructed in 1868 in Cleveland, then abandoned for the Empire State Building.)

These new towers required an immense amount of building permits. There were, as you'll see, several times when Washington and the capital were deemed too unsafe. For example, during the Revolution, while President George Washington was visiting Russia, he met a Russian-born architect named Alexander Dostoyev, who was known in Russian as a 'duffel-kulak' (the devil).

The Dostoyevs worked out two plans to avoid the safety hazards. Either by adding a section to the outside of the structure or by adding a roof. And both plans were executed with great success.

The problem was that this was too far inside the American city of Washington. The tallest tower had to be in Washington. If they didn't have any more permits to begin with, then the
