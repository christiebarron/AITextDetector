My friend and I were walking down the street in the city after a long day of sightseeing. We were tired and our feet were aching, so in the silence we both began to scowl. Suddenly, he started making strange noises that I had never heard before. I was completely confused, and I asked him what he was doing. He just gave me a mischievous grin, and then he started looking around the street like he was looking for something. 

That's when I noticed the old man across the street. He was walking slowly, with a long cane, and his posture was slightly bent. Suddenly, my friend started laughing hysterically and I just couldn't help but join in. We laughed so hard we almost fell over. We laughed for what felt like minutes, and when my friend eventually calmed down, he told me the old man had dropped his cane. It was rolling around in the street like a wheel, so of course it was funny. 

In that moment, laughter had bridged a gap between two strangers, bringing joy and warmth to a cold and grey city street.
