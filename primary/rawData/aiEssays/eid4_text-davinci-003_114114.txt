The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho serves to emphasize the theme of determination and perseverance despite obstacles. The protagonist, a young Chinese emigrant in America, is determined to prove her worth as a student and has been studying hard for the citizenship test. Unfortunately, she fails the test because of her anxiety, but she is determined to try again the following year. In the last sentence, the narrator focuses on the hope that, when spring returns - a season of new beginnings - the protagonist will find success in retaking the test. This ending serves to emphasize the idea that no obstacle is insurmountable with enough determination and will.
