The building of the Empire State Building, which occurred between 1929 and 1931, faced a great many obstacles. One of the most unexpected was the decision to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the world’s tallest building. This was a remarkable challenge that included questions of safety, aerodynamics, and city ordinances.

The problems associated with allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building began with the safety of passengers and bystanders in case of a crash or malfunction. Dirigible technology was still in its infancy and the designers of the building had to factor in the possibility of a disaster. They had to come up with a durable mooring mast that could hold up in high winds and also be strong enough to support the gondolas that the dirigibles carried.

The Empire State Building’s location in midtown Manhattan also posed a challenge in terms of the aerodynamics of the docking process. The air currents around the building had to be studied in order to make sure that the dirigibles could stay on a steady course. In addition to that, the city ordinances of the time had to be taken into consideration. The flight paths had to be approved by the city government in order to ensure that they did not interfere with other aerial traffic.

After much consideration and deliberation, the plans for the mooring mast and the necessary city ordinances were approved. In May 1933, the first dirigible, the USS Los Angeles,
