I remember the first time I ever met my now-husband. It was at a mutual friend's party and we had both been invited. We were standing in the same cluster of people in the living room when I said something funny, and my husband laughed. Now, I'm not sure who was more surprised, me or him, but we both just started cracking up. Everyone around us was laughing as well, since the joke was pretty good, but it was the connection between us that was special.

Since then, we laugh together often and we've even developed our own sort of language based on inside jokes. Wherever life takes us, laughter is always a part of it, and it's one of the most important things that keep us connected and happy.
