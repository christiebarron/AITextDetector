An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a very beautiful woman with blue eyes. She came to me, and for the first time, she came to hear me speak. She was very brave to come and sit on my lap, because she didn't want me to tell her that I was a cancer researcher. A very brave woman in my life was a huge advocate that we should work together â€” a woman who thought about cancer as a woman and as a woman with cancer who couldn't get anything done. We worked incredibly hard not only by not talking about it, but by not only talking about it. And she got cancer. That's very important. And then she found our love and we just started feeling it and I'm looking forward to what we get out of that.

And she did find us and she found the way that we fight against cancer. When we're still young. I think her diagnosis is that in a little while the cancer goes away. And the thing that gets me so sad about her, even though she's a different type of woman compared to her doctors is how we treat our cancer patients. She treated us and she just got cancer. And she didn't just get cancer. That cancer is there. We are fighting in our corner. It's not in that area that we're fighting or that we're not fighting that we don't need to fight. And I hope we fight together. A big part of that is about being patient
