One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I started to watch porn as a teenager, which for some reason had become my way of showing people I was sexy and had an image of a man dressed as a nun. This wasn't a true depiction of my sexuality, and I was still young at the time (not that it's a bad thing to be young, but it was pretty much too late for that). But it was something I couldn't handle. In some ways, it's been an almost year on, and it took me almost a year to sort out the question of when that day would come and where I was going to land. So this month I started asking questions. My first question was if it was okay for my mother to feel so comfortable seeing me as a man anymore or if it was okay that I should continue using what I saw as an authentic way of showing off. I said yes, and at the same time, it seemed clear now that I was trying hard not to feel uncomfortable. I think it made me feel more authentic. I thought it showed I care and that I was truly happy as a man. I thought it also let me focus on my own sexual issues, so that in the long run, maybe that may be a good sign for me." As I was getting more comfortable with living now, the first question I heard became something like "where am I going to go after I see my mother see that she hasn't seen me at all
