An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was trying to have a baby, trying to do things for our family that I would never have done, when someone I was making decisions around died. And it didn't just happen to one of my friends in high school.

I used to see the parents who didn't give any consideration to us having kids, and I looked back on it and said, wow, it's so fucking special, I guess we should give it a shot and just keep going. And that was our family.

We went to the hospital, and we were in an assisted bed, and when I got off the phone, the nurses said that they thought there was something wrong with the brain, right, but I looked at them and said, ok, what's the problem there? What's the problem, what happened? And they were like, okay we didn't mean to hurt you, we're just going to help you, but we're going to keep trying to do your best here. And then I went to work, worked hard, I felt really good.

So we've been doing this for four years, and it just kept getting worse all the time. We've been there. And we're going to keep getting better, because we're going to know who's going to be here next week, and we have to do that, and then eventually, we'll know where we have to go next.
