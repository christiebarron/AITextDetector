One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I walked into a party at midnight and saw two men standing on rooftops, laughing. The party went on and all night I thought there were no ghosts living there, but apparently something is very strange. The men are all dressed in dark clothes... but they look real. So I asked them: "How did you last tell people that you left the party?" The men said: "I took you there. Because I want to share our memories of you with our family." After a while they explained that it was just to send out a message to the world. Well they were quite charming as well. After the time expired they left me wondering if I had any further time left.

What makes you come back to your old self in the future?


Do you always remember your past? Any new memories? How often came back to that side? And where did you meet your brother and sisters before the time you left? Did the relationship develop into a platonic relationship or something different?


You remember the same thing from your childhood and you think: Who doesn't?

Oh my goodness! All of these pictures have been so long and vivid so you might forget if you do. So let me write more about you in a few days, if you want.
