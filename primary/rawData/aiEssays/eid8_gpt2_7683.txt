One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I used to get myself in trouble for saying "s" in a joke about you. I went to the gym for an hour to get a new razor. The reason I got there was that I wanted to be able to write in a way that people could say things like "Hey, you're gonna pay for my hair." In the words of my dad, "People who don't like my hair want to be like me." I was so excited.

The challenge now is to find the right level of humour. If you've got this kind of creative person and they have good humour – then you've got it.

It's not just about getting people to say things like "Oh, that sounded like an interesting idea…"

It's about creating a sense of humour in the audience. When you have a great idea and someone says something so funny, they'll go and see it again. Once you have that balance, you can make your audience feel more like a parent, an elder, an older person. And then you can have more of that kind of a sense of humor, with people listening to you when you say something really funny and they want to watch you play with it. They're going to like your name and then they'll go back and forth talking about how you're funny. There's going to be a very real connection with that.
