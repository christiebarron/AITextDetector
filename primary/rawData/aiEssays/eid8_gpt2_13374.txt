One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was playing Dungeons & Dragons while my partner used to put together a very big list of ideas - it's just that the magic works and that's how magic works".

Now, it's only recently that a bit more than a year, though. For all of you players out there who're struggling with being left out of Spirit Guides as a rule of thumb: there is one more rule you'll need.

1. Always have a guide (or the book you love!). You're the one who is on the wrong end of a chain. If your partner uses any magic items, they also use this rule for their guide (if this happens to you, you could be on the wrong end of it, too).

2. Never, EVER go rogue - just be respectful of your partner's opinions about the rules themselves.

3. Don't do this every time you find yourself missing someone in a game :)

4. If you see someone in the crowd of 30, then tell them to go find them.

5. I love seeing the same guy on one page in a Magic: the Gathering book! This might not always go smoothlyCREATE YOUR OWN FAQ (not sure how to do this if you're having a hard time with it...)

6. Always be respectful of your partner's feedback about magic items AND guides. This rule applies even for guide-only players.
