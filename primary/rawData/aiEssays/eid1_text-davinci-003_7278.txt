The setting of 'Rough Road Ahead' by Joe Kurmaski plays an important role in the cyclist's journey, serving as both an obstacle and an aide. The story takes place on a winding mountain road, its stark peaks and sharp curves creating a treacherous landscape. The steep inclines and winding paths challenge the cyclist's ability to keep his momentum, as the lack of oxygen at higher altitudes makes it more difficult to draw breath. Meanwhile, the natural beauty of the environment serves as an inspiration, inspiring the cyclist to push on despite the physical discomfort.

In addition, the setting creates its own unique set of challenges. Contending with the inclines of the mountains, the cyclist often has to rest and regroup in order to continue his journey. Winds also play a role, causing the tyres of the cyclists bike to skid and slip. The sharp curves and treacherous terrain also create unease. Despite these hardships, however, the cyclist ultimately perseveres and is able to reach his destination.

The setting of the story serves to reflect the cyclist's internal struggle, his determination and courage presented in contrast to the elements of nature. The setting and its features provide a test for the cyclist, although ultimately his grit and self-belief serves to carry him through. It is this determination and self-belief that allows him to survive the harshness of the environment and ultimately reach his destination.
