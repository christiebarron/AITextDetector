I was recently waiting at an airport for a connecting flight. As I was standing in the line to board my flight I noticed that the flight was delayed. Even though I was already running late to my destination, I decided to be patient and not take my frustration out on those around me. 

Instead of getting angry, I took a deep breath and tried to make the best of it. I reached out to my family and friends to pass the time, and even made a few new friends in the line next to me. 

As the waiting period grew longer, I remained patient and understanding. I didnâ€™t give in to my worries about the delay because I knew that the delay was out of my control. The airline staff even apologized for the delay which made me feel a bit better. 

In the end, I finally boarded my flight and eventually reached my destination. I am thankful that I chose to stay patient during this difficult situation and that I was rewarded with a successful and stress-free experience in the end.
