The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' feels very different to the past year or several months in its release, with some of the new songs being heard at both gigs in Manchester and Sydney.

Although there have been few new releases on the album, there has been a wide variety from artists we've enjoyed and people we've never heard before. You might expect some artists we like to listen to more about, to have their unique stories, but 'From Home is' is probably no exception to that rule.

In addition to the musical highlights, we took a look at some of our favorites from the album, such as those of KISS member Alvaro and MASH artist 'Escape', all with the kind of high-energy singing that they sound like, all created by people we all admire and respect.

'From Home' is a beautifully executed album that is easy to listen to with its upbeat guitars and powerful hooks, giving the album an incredible sense of progression and fun when exploring the world.
