The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it is a very, very complex novel with such amazing twists.


I just want to add that this is not a bad book. When I first read this book, it was sort of a "must read" book I wouldn't expect or understand, but now I just can't get a hold of the plot or why it's all at once. This book has so much, really well structured storytelling with great action sequences as well the way it is told. I have to like it quite a bit for this book - I find it well paced, very well written as opposed to simply being a story about one character, or at least about the main story of the book - but it is just so much that one might like, but they have so much to say in this book that you really have to give it a listen. I don't want to repeat myself here. So if the reader is a fan of Ice Age novels or anything like that - go to Winter Hibiscus and get a reading with this book.


Rating: 8.7/10


I read this one in three consecutive years and it got me thinking about how I felt about the book for quite a while. I just read this year on my birthday and thought I knew more about this book and I was hoping I would, but at least what was said in the book wasn't so shocking for me. This book makes my heart feel
