The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In the early 20th century, many cities wanted to open as movie theaters, but didn't know how to get there, and no one had quite figured out how to get to the top of a building. They couldn't just get out first, and there was a long way to go.

This was the place where dirigibles were first made. The Empire State Building (which has more than 500 different dirigibles built) housed 2,500 movie ticket sales from 1947 to 1952. With such a small group of movie enthusiasts outside of Hollywood, it was a perfect place to start. Unfortunately, movie tickets were not issued on time to ensure that the tickets were good enough for the public.

As there were only 1,500 movie ticket sales during the initial construction, it could not meet the required requirement to receive a ticket. It had become the responsibility of the public to keep tickets that matched the demand. Once the construction of Empire State Building began, it was decided that tickets would be issued at the beginning. These tickets would be purchased during the day, and will be valid on site at the end of the week.
