Computers have many effects on people. As people grow older, their brains begin to become more vulnerable to other factors.

While cognitive decline can slow down any development, people might die from accidents, mental illnesses, and other causes. The brain does not last forever, but that is not the point. When we stop using computers and other technology for our daily lives, we end up making a lot more sense of reality we know. Because of this fact, researchers are now working on developing better treatments for Alzheimer and developing treatments for Huntington's diseases.

The study was supported by the National Institute of Aging (The National Institute on Aging) and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

This research was supported by the Office of Naval Research.
