The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The problem is that both the ground level and the ceiling of each building are covered by a thick layer of cement or cement blocks that allow people to step only to a few feet above ground level. When the builders built three more floors to go on each other they faced a problem with their ground level. The first tower would have a diameter of 50 meters to 200 meters and was built in the early 1980's. The second would have two floors (including a stairway) and five levels (including elevator shaft). Finally, the third tower would have to be built in the 1990's and covered by a similar material â€“ a sheet of solid, concrete. This would be covered with solid stone.


While in the early 1980's builders of the Empire State Building discovered how fragile all of the cement structures were, they also discovered how difficult it is to break the concrete blocks that would be in place between the floors:

"While they did not find the concrete, they found concrete blocks that would help their builders take better measurements. The concrete blocks have been broken down into a three-dimensional array by two large steel pieces on a large base. The metal joints are two 1/2-x2-thick pieces that are attached to the concrete and have to be removed. The concrete block structure is made up of a thin sheet of solid concrete and it has two vertical parts connected at the top,
