As I settled into the tiny cafe chair across the table from my friend, I couldn't help but chuckle. There she was, frantically trying to lick the cream off the top of her latte before it dripped any further. Though it was somewhat of an anxious feat, even in this hushed atmosphere, I simply couldn't keep my smile hidden. By a stroke of luck, she had managed to fit her entire tongue onto the tiny top and was now delicately maneuvering it around - all with an expression of absolute concentration forming on her face.

I reached across the table and gave her an amused nod of encouragement. This only seemed to confuse her further, her tongue now completely stuck to the cream and unable to move any further. I tried not to laugh as I watched her struggle, but eventually I couldn't help it. I erupted with laughter, shaking my head with my hands on my temples. Her face formed into a huge grin, and all at once we were both laughing louder than we should have been in such a quiet place. 

Though the time we spent together was brief, it was moments like this that made our friendship so special. Our laughter was a form of connection that no words could explain. In those times, I shared a familiar sense of familiarity, of home. No matter the situation, no matter the conversation, a true friendship was defined in our laughter.
