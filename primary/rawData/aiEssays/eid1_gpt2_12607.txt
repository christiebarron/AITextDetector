Computers have many effects on people. One of the biggest is that they increase susceptibility to disease and other stressors. The researchers showed that mice exposed to a stressor were more likely to experience weight gain when obese.

According to the team, the researchers say the more a person is exposed to stress, the healthier they become about themselves and the less likely they are to become obese.

"In obese mice, the main effect of fat restriction is to improve cardiovascular health and to raise body weight," says study author John T. Hutton, M.D., Ph.D., co-author of the study, one of the study's lead investigators. "Fat restriction also causes changes to the way brain cells process food, to the way their immune system is activated. These changes affect the expression of the major cytokines that control the activity of the cells.'

The study involved 1,200 subjects in eight different populations.

Researchers found that the genes which play a key role throughout the brain were located on the dorsal anterior insula, the insula-striate nucleus of the brain, and the ventrolateral insula. This includes the genes involved in body weight gain, which can be linked with fat.

The researchers found that one of the specific genes, called IL-8, is located on the ventral anterior insula, the insula-striate nucleus of the brain, that's known to be involved in obesity.
