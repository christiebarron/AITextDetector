The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. But more recently, they will have to overcome the same problems they've encountered before.

As reported by Forbes, the project's financing arm, AEG, plans to begin a $450 million contract with AEG in April for the state's first multi-story, $7 billion-plus apartment building that will serve more than 90,000 people at an elevated height for the first time. Those construction and public-private partnerships could allow the construction of a "mini-state" with up to 811,000 residents. The project will add more than $4 billion to the $300 million state budget by moving to a place known as "The Capitol." AEG hopes to finance the project with nearly $50 million in state funding, as well as an additional $25 million in federal aid.

An elevator is projected to be built for each room at the Capitol.
