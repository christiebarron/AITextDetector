One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was about two years old! When I started writing this book I was extremely excited to read it. But then I heard a lot about all these girls in the story, including that one. I thought maybe it was because there are few guys in this story who have these funny, cute personalities! What did you think?

Do you have any plans for future memoirs?

Thank you so much for reading my book!! ðŸ™‚
