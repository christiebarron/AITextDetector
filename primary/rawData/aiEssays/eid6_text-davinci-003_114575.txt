The construction of the Empire State Building in New York City marked a monumental feat of engineering and an enduring work of architecture. Though its construction was completed in 1931, one ambitious goal of the designers of the building was to include a platform where dirigibles–passenger airships–could dock. Although this idea was never carried out, the obstacles and difficulties they faced offer insight into the difficulties of engineering an unprecedented feat. 

The Empire State Building presented a unique challenge for engineers designing a platform for the docking of dirigibles. This was due, in part, to the fact that previous docking sites had been located on open land, rather than on tall skyscrapers. The main issue with docking on top of the Empire State Building was the high winds associated with the surrounding urban environment, which could potentially put too much strain on the dirigible. In addition, the building’s height presented another obstacle. To attach a platform to the building, engineers would need to construct a 100-foot-tall mooring mast. Building a mooring mast of this height would require a complex engineering feat, and as the building itself was just over 1000 feet in height, the task was daunting. 

The idea of a mooring mast of such a size posed numerous questions for the engineers. In the book The Mooring Mast, author Marcia Amidon Lüsted explains that the mooring mast would have to be strong enough to securely hold the
