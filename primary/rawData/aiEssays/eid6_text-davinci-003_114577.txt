The builders of the Empire State Building encountered several obstacles in allowing dirigibles, or blimps, to dock at what was known as the mooring mast. These obstacles included a strict timetable, a unique building structure, changing technology, complex safety regulations, and even public opinion.

The initial goal was for the Empire State Building to be completed within 14 months, a timeline that left little room for additional research and design for the mooring mast. Due to this time crunch, resourceful engineering solutions had to be developed quickly. Furthermore, the building’s structure, while magnificent, posed its own unique challenges. While high enough to allow the blimps to dock, the mooring mast needed to be securely attached to the building while also leaving wasted space in the interior of the structure largely unused.

The ever-changing technology of the day also presented its own challenges. Even as the mooring mast was being designed, the dirigibles of the 1930s were rapidly becoming obsolete as they were replaced with airplanes. With the changing technology inevitably came changes in safety regulations and additional requirements. Furthermore, the events of the era – the Great Depression, relevant news stories, and the fears of this new technology – all heavily impacted public opinion, and a blimp docking at the top of a skyscraper was not a favorable image.

Ultimately, the designers and builders of the Empire State Building persevered, finding solutions to the obstacles they
