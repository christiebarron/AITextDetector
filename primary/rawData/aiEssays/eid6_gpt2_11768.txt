The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One of the most challenging, and perhaps the most glaring, obstacle was that there seemed to be no visible way to store those materials directly onto a conveyor belt, and many people were skeptical of using the same design to transport such a large amount of materials onto an airplane.

"I was wondering if these guys knew more about the physics then I did," said Mr. Whelan. "People don't know about the physics of gravity. We use two-dimensional gravity as a kind of test problem. All the time, we're going to get a test problem. The only way to find the answer for that is to use the same tests to find the answers for what gravity is."

But the other challenge is that the structures of the two-dimensional architecture were different. The Empire State Building was built at its highest height, but the first generation of the new skyscraper will have a lower height limit on its facade structure. The building on campus was only 1,000 feet high, a difference of about 30 feet as one architect thought.

The building will be fully visible from the outside, but only on the exterior. It will be accessible via walkways and a parking area. Most of the building's exterior will remain unchanged, a significant feature that will be changed from the original.

The building's remaining parts include a walkway that runs along the base of
