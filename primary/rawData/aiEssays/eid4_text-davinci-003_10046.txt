The author is using the hibiscus as a metaphor for her struggles with school and her feelings of inadequacy. By ending with the hibiscus, she is expressing her hope for renewed hope and strength to tackle the test again. She has found solace in the hibiscus and believes that she can take the test again when it blooms in the spring and the geese return. This metaphor serves as a source of resilience and hope, and serves as both a reminder and motivator for the protagonist.
