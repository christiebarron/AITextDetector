Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. In fact, all of the bike lanes in the city were built around them. As we move closer to the city limits, I believe that the streets around the central part of the city that was designed to support cyclists, the west to north and south to east all have been changed or widened by the removal of bike lanes.

In 2015 I traveled along the A3 for 18 days in a row, with no real success in the race of ideas. The last place I went was when I went on a two-week bicycle tour, and I never saw many of the cyclists along the way. There was only one time when it actually worked for me. I was at Bike Park in Manchester for two weeks, and it was the first time I saw or heard about a cycling project there. It was amazing when I realized that with some sort of major expansion of bike lanes and bike lanes on the east side of City Centre.

The one city that was truly built for cyclists, even though they didn't exist in 18 days, was Manchester. In this city you can see many different paths, paths through different parts of town and areas, and you can see how the streets of Manchester have become more and more paved with all the bicycle lanes that were supposed to be there.

A bike lane is something you can build along the bike path to support the bike path to its next destination.
