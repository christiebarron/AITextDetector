I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is essential to our democracy," wrote the authors in a Dec. 18 letter to Library and Archives Canada. "Freedom of speech and expression has come to be a cornerstone of our heritage. We urge the government to maintain public interest and to ensure that libraries make available to Canadians free of censorship."

Ontario police said a third-year public safety course offered to each public library in the province was also being run by the university, and is being extended to other libraries in neighbouring communities. The courses cover topics such as information on Internet service providers — a common question from youth to parents.

Libraries in Ontario had previously served with the province's National Education Centre for Students, which recently reopened to students for the fifth year after it withdrew its applications for its second year.

Toronto Public Libraries director Jean‐Josée Roubé told CBC News that she was aware of an "ongoing situation," where libraries across Ontario have been asked to stop posting materials to their websites.

"All of us are very concerned about the safety of our library and our volunteers," she said.

For the most part, libraries are required to post materials online in an effort to protect privacy and to give students the opportunity to make informed choices to choose, she added. "It can be challenging, but it's absolutely essential."
