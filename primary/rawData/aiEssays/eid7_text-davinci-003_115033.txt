I was recently waiting in line at the grocery store, and it was taking what seemed like forever. I was feeling exasperated and frustrated, but as I looked around me I noticed that everyone else was being patient. No one was rolling their eyes or muttering under their breath; instead everyone was calmly and quietly waiting their turn. It occurred to me in that moment that the store employees were doing their best to help everyone, and if I was patient and understanding, my turn would come soon enough. So I put aside my frustrations and held my tongue, and eventually I was at the front of the line. I was glad I had made the choice to be patient because it made the experience so much better.
