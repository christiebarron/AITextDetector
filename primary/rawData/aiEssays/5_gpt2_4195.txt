The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is reminiscent of the mood present in the film, when they were all too busy running with a big budget of his own. "I felt that a lot of people were afraid of me," he says. "I didn't even really understand why."

For the past decade and a half, the three brothers' personal journey of love and isolation was being driven by a fascination with sex. "We were in a relationship before we met," he says. They had sex about five years ago as part of a couple's Christmas party. At first he didn't have much to say about it, but he would later say "it was my birthday" and "I wanted to meet you." The brothers were still together when he moved to Los Angeles six years ago â€” and when they were married their relationship quickly became a sexual one.

The story that became 'This is Life' is very different in four key ways: they live in fear and their relationships are never open about the things you can change.


They are still married.

In the book, titled and narrated 'It's all Good and Beautiful, It's All the Same,' one of them, J. Cole, narrates on how he and others have been married for decades. "My last marriage was in 1985. It was one of the finest marriages I've ever had, of any family in this land," says the film's narrator.
