To the editor:

Censorship in libraries is a highly debated issue. Many argue that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, should be banned if they are viewed as offensive. However, I strongly disagree with this notion. All materials should remain in libraries, and patrons should be allowed to make their own decisions about what they read and watch.

At the core of the debate about censorship in libraries is the question of whose taste should dictate what materials should be available to the public. If certain materials are removed from shelves, it implies that the opinion of a few is deemed more important than the rest of the public. This approach goes against the principles of a democratic society that respects diversity of thought.

In many instances, censoring materials can also stifle conversations around difficult topics. This has a particularly detrimental effect in libraries, which are supposed to provide a safe space for people to explore all sorts of ideas and exchange opinions. Patrons, including low-income and marginalized populations, should be provided with all the material they need to make informed decisions and expand their horizons. 

Therefore, I believe that libraries should not be engaging in censorship, and all materials should be made available to the public. While patrons may choose to avoid certain materials, they should be given the opportunity to make this decision for themselves. Only then can libraries fully embrace their role in providing people with equal access to knowledge and ideas.
