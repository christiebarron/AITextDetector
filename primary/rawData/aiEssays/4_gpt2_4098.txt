The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because we don't want 'em to be the suburim to our favourite characters, to our hero who becomes the last child of Noah the sheep at the end of the world. The story focuses on the idea of a child born without a mother and its implications for life, which of course has ramifications in the world as the story progresses.

What does Winter Hibiscus also look like in the context of their life experience, specifically with the new protagonist Tanya? What does that mean for their relationship with the younger protagonist Tanya? It is also interesting to see how Tanya manages to re-grow with one arm, since she became the main focus of the new protagonist's arc, instead of being 'the first one to grow up' when Tanya barnstorms with a broken arm, she goes on a 'love spree,' she kills a few wolves at once, and then she brings the other children back together from nowhere as if she had already been there! To really appreciate this, I think we're going to get to hear from Tanya from the POV of one of her own children, since she is always on the lookout for new things.

The novel ends with Tanya, as she is her second child through this second, she does some very interesting things throughout, the protagonist makes up some very strange things into a 'true story' without any of the kids being told exactly how they got their powers
