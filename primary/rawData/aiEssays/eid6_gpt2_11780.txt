The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The two-storey building has a ceiling-to-ceiling canopy, which allows people to use the building as a walking shelter.

"It's going to take a long time," says Robert K. Siegelmann, who worked at the Sotheby's National Gallery until the design of the building changed.

"You're not going to make it up in the dark on your day off," K. Siegelmann says.

While there is an abundance of high-quality material on the market for this special purpose object, there are only about 5,000 dirigs available for sale today, and the project of erecting the three-storey Empire State Building will be even more exciting, with thousands of dirigibles projected to be installed over the next decade.

"One of my questions in looking at the building is, 'How do we make one of the best models of this kind of space? Would it work in the middle of a war?'" K. Siegelmann says.

The Empire State Building has some 7,000 dirigbs each side. Each, as seen by Siegelmann,
