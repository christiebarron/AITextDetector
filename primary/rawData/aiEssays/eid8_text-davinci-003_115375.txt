It was the night of my fifth-grade class's holiday dance. I had been repeatedly asking my crush – we'll call her Piper – to dance with me since it started an hour ago, but she wouldn't budge.

Finally, as the disco song "Stayin' Alive" came on, I got up the nerve to actually go over and try to ask her to dance – just as she unexpectedly turned around and yelled "Go for it!"

I must have looked so embarrassed and nervous, because she started laughing. I started to laugh too and I couldn't stop. We looked at each other for a few seconds, both of us laughing uncontrollably.

Her laughter was contagious and I couldn't help but laugh harder. Next thing I knew, we were dancing together on the dance floor. Even though it was only a few songs, we shared a lot of laughs – and created a memory that I won't forget.
