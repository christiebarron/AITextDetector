Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. You see 'Rough roads' across a region in the West, and on such a vast stretch of land, many are difficult or unsafe to navigate. It's common, for instance, to see a large group of cyclists walking on two sides of a road, or a handful that are on two different fronts. Similarly, some streets can be highly exposed to dangerous conditions.

An example of this is North East London, where cyclists do not pass through the intersection of St Helens Way and Old Bridge Street at these times. "I've seen in the past when a few hundred cyclists were passing through I don't really even know if it was safe to pass," says a cyclist who works in the area. "Most of my clients walk through the intersection of Old Bridge Street. I've seen a few hundred on the other side of the road. It looks awful but it's quite safe."

Other examples are at intersections such as Newington and the South Tower – particularly on the South East side. There, the potential for a collision can mean a steep drop from one side of the road to the other in a matter of seconds – the same effect could happen at an intersection like this.

The idea is to offer cyclists an escape route from the danger on either side of the road – as opposed to an experience where one side of a road is too close to the other. "
