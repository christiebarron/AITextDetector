The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because, in its quest to restore the family, it ends tragically. He and their brother Jaina realize that "a few days after the fall of the Winter Solstheim Gate," Winter, too, is consumed by the nightmare."

It is a good idea for fans—and readers—to have a look at this, too, because the book reveals so much about Winter's past. He is a man still living in a dream, who spends his time at the Snow Lake Zoo. It is a nightmare. Every time Winter's body touches the Snow Lake Zoo. Winter will die. Winter will die at the hands of his past. Jaina is the one who will take her.

As Ice Storm continues, we find his family, Winter, his older brother, Jaina, the first family in a million years to die—a family they cannot shake. Jaina wants to be there, but if it weren't for this letter, Jaina has probably gone, as if they had a second chance. And Jaina believes that she is alive.
