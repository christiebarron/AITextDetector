I sat across from my Grandma and we chatted about our days. We always had a lot to talk about, as I was very close to her. 

Suddenly, I made an offhanded comment about a situation I had been in, and Grandma got the giggles. Before I knew it, we were both cackling together. It was the best sound Iâ€™d heard in a while.

The laughter kept rolling, becoming infectious. Grandma's carefree giggle was contagious as it spread across the room. Suddenly, my phone dinged with a text, and that was enough to make us both burst out laughing even harder. 

We laughed until our faces hurt, until there were tears streaming down our faces. Even when the laughter started to die down, we both kept looking at each other and cracking up.

At that moment, we both knew that laughter really was the shortest distance between two people. It had brought us back together in a way that no conversations ever could have.
