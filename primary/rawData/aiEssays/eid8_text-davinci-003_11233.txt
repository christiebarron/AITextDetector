I was hanging out with my friend, Melissa, at her house and we had been talking for what felt like hours. Throughout the conversation she had spun many hilarious stories and I had too. Yet after she had told so many, I found myself struggling to come up with something new. After several attempts, I resigned to an awkward pause in the conversation.

That was when Melissa began to laugh. It wasn't the type of laughter that was light or happy. It was a long sustained chuckle, almost as if her body was relieving the tension in the room. I couldn't help but laugh along with her. We laughed and laughed until tears formed in our eyes. 

Eventually, we composed ourselves and continued our conversation. Our laughter served to inject new happiness and lightness into it. I thanked Melissa for her sense of humor and she thanked me for mine. I learned that day, the power that laughter can have when it connects two friends and brings them closer together.
