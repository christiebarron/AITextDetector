An example of a time someone in my life was patient was someone in my 20s, a long-term resident/resident who needed time to get his family settled in Washington, DC. He was extremely fortunate that his family eventually ended up at the same time, because he found a place he would never share. I remember talking to our first friend, who worked in a law school system there. He is an incredibly strong person. I am not sure what to say and we didn't want to spoil the suspense. So we called (my friend) and he said, "Good job. We have to come back. Do it." That's when we pulled into our driveway to get to his house. The other co-worker walked us back to his office then took us through the process of being admitted (for a period of time). He said the first time he tried to come out was early when he was 25 years old. We didn't plan to go for much longer, and he is actually a terrific guy. He would sometimes make an elaborate presentation in front of people, usually, explaining that he was so new. He does seem to be very patient, his life feels very natural but he is an extremely strong person. Even going to our office, which is very different here than when he came here in the year 2001, I was still surprised there didn't seem to be that much separation between work and home. After this we had our house made in two sets of plywood
