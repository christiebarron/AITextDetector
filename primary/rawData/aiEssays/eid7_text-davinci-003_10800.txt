When I was in middle school, I had a friend who was dealing with a lot of issues at home. She didn't have a very stable family life, and it could be hard for her to focus on the present moment. Even though I could tell that she was struggling, I tried my best to be patient with her. I would check in regularly, just to see how she was doing, and if she was ever overwhelmed, I would talk her through it. 
 I remember one time she was really upset about something her parents had said to her. Stricken with emotion, she couldn't form words and I could tell she was trying to fight back tears. Instead of pressing her to talk, I was patient and let her talk when she was ready. Eventually, she calmed down enough to tell me everything that was going on, and we even talked about ways she could cope with her situation. 
 Being patient with her showed her that I cared and that I wanted to be with her in her time of need. Our friendship got even stronger through that difficult moment and we still remain close today.
