When I was in third grade, I had the worst math teacher. She was strict and expected us to understand concepts that were way above our level. I struggled with basic addition and subtraction and it made me become frustrated with myself. 

One day during a math lesson, I couldn't understand why the answer I got was wrong. I kept going over the problem again and again but the answer didn't seem to change. I started to feel frustrated and wanted to give up. 

My math teacher noticed my distress and stopped the whole class to come to my desk. Instead of scolding me like she normally did for not understanding, she calmly asked me to explain what I was doing and why I thought my answer was correct. This surprised me and I started to relax a bit. 

She patiently listened to my explanation and then quietly showed me where I had gone wrong. I was relieved that she didn't get angry with me and instead tried to help me in a positive way. I was grateful for her patience and understanding, and from that day on I worked even harder to understand the math lessons.
