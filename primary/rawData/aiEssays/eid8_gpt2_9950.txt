One time I experienced laughter in my life was when a student named Chris put his hand up to me on the ground after going over to me and said "Hi you too." I think it kind of struck me as funny, to be honest. In fact, I've been thinking about it all the time. I saw "The Big Bang Theory" as something that felt very specific, like a comedy. It felt very contemporary, very specific, like its own thing and different experiences. One time I saw a woman come up to me and say, "Hey, how you doing?" and I said: "I've got something to tell you." A few years ago I saw "The Hangover" on CBS. As you may know, Comedy Central is based in Los Angeles. I actually started writing them when I was a kid, maybe 11. I said, "How are you?" I said: "I went through a lot of good things. I'm in shape. I'm doing amazing now." And when I said I didn't want to come in to life, [I thought] "Oh, man, I don't know." I don't want to play the "Bumblebee" character because I don't want to act all this time.

I'm not kidding: you're very serious about it. I believe that we are the most open and accepting and open-minded of any comedy group since TBS. I read about the "Blindspot"
