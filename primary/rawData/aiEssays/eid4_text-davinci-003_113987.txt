The narrator of the poem, a young girl, is reflecting on how she is feeling trapped in a cycle of testing and school which, in her mind, is difficult because all she wants to do is appreciate the beauty of her home. She admires the winter hibiscus and wishes that school testing and the pressures of work and assignments were not taking away time from her that she could spend enjoying the moments outside. The narrator is looking to the coming spring as a time of hope when things will change and she can have a break from the test-taking routine. She feels that if she can just get through the tests until the spring, then things will look brighter and she will be able to take the tests again and feel more hopeful about their outcome.
