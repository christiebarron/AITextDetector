I believe that censorship of materials in libraries should not occur.

In July, a judge in Minneapolis dismissed some of the charges filed by the ACLU on behalf of an artist living under a government-funded library who alleges he was bullied and bullied in the 1980s by a local high school book club. He ultimately had the opportunity to contest the charges that the police found a copy of his work that he was reading at the library. The judge agreed with the allegations against him and decided a case with no evidence of bullying under Minnesota law could proceed. But he also said that the government had no legal basis to charge that the author's work was protected if he wasn't telling the truth.

"This is not fair and appropriate law," Minneapolis judge Tom Ivers said in a statement sent to The Christian Science Monitor on Monday.

"In fact, our primary goal, as a church organization and as a community, is to help create a Christian environment in our community, provide appropriate service to our members, and uphold the dignity and rights of all people."

For years, Ivers, chairman of the Minneapolis Society of Historical Writers and the Minneapolis Academy of Social Studies, has been working with the city's library system to protect his work. Though recently he was appointed to the city's board of directors, he now serves as director of the library's Public Affairs and Public Safety Division. He said the government has not responded to his complaints and he wishes the city would investigate.
