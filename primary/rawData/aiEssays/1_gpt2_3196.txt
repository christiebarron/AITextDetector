Computers have many effects on people. Some are social engineering, like the recent discovery of brain regions and blood supply that might determine whether or not people are more likely to develop cancer. Others stem from complex systems of mechanisms, such as genetics, neurological functioning, and genetic variations. Here we provide a brief overview of brain regions that may influence mood, sleep, and more than 10 genes with implications for the diagnosis of cancer.

Brain Development

The brain is a complex network of interconnected neural and muscular systems. When one or more parts of the brain are damaged, it can lead to altered mental states (including psychosis). Many diseases, includingcompromised development and autism, can cause more severe behavioral problems than just mental disabilities, and a wide variety of disorders can develop while a brain does nothing. The brain becomes less "normal," as it develops, and more susceptible to "overpopulation" (an over-population of cells) [2,3,6,7â€“10].

To understand why people develop disorders of Sprint's genes, we used computational modeling to identify and understand several pathways. We first looked at the effect of genes affected by various conditions on the evolution of the human genetic background (a gene involved in neural plasticity). This is an important discovery because we're exploring the potential implications of gene exposure upon cell growth and development (as well as the biological mechanisms underlying the effects of environmental factors on development, such as environmental factors). Because many genetic causes have multiple
