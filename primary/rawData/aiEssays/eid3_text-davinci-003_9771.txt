In the short story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, the features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. The setting is a remote, mountainous, coastal wilderness, where the protagonist is cycling for the first time. The terrain is rocky and hilly, adding to the physical difficulty of the journey. The cyclist is carrying a full backpack, making the ride even more challenging. 

The physical setting presents numerous obstacles to the cyclist, and her emotional response to the surroundings reflect this. As she cycles, the hilly terrain causes her to become increasingly exhausted. As she struggles up one of the peaks, she begins to feel a sense of dread and anxiety growing in her. Her physical exhaustion is matched by her emotional exhaustion, and she becomes overwhelmed by the remoteness and harshness of the scenery. 

The environment of the coastal wilderness acts as an antagonist to the cyclist. Not only does it provide a physical challenge to overcome, but it also triggers her internal fears and anxieties. The rugged terrain forces her to confront her own physical and emotional limitations. 

The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead” present a dangerous and difficult journey for the cyclist. The physical environment is an external force that tests her strength and courage. The terror of the wilderness forces her to confront her personal limits as she struggles up the hills, and the sheer remoteness of the setting often leaves her feeling lost and overwhelmed.
