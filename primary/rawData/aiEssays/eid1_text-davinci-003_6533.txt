Dear Editor,

In this digital age, computers have become an integral part of everyday life, particularly due to their convenience and versatility. As a result, the use of computers has been on a steady rise, with the majority of people relying on them for work, education, communication, and information. 

However, with the increased use of computers comes the potential for detrimental effects on peopleâ€™s behavior and physical health. It has been proven that extended periods of computer use, particularly among children and teenagers, can result in attention deficits, poor postural alignment, obesity, carpal tunnel syndrome, and eye strain. Excessive computer use can isolate people from their family, friends, and the community, as well as lead to poor decision making and socialization skills.

Therefore, I urge everyone to be aware of the risks associated with computer use and take measures to minimize them. Parents should place limits on the amount of time their children spend using computers and strongly monitor their activity. Individuals should make an effort to engage with others and to take regular breaks away from their computers. 

It is all too easy to become overly dependent on computers, and the negative consequences of such overuse should not be ignored. 

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
