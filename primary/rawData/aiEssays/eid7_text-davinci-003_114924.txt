When I was a child, my mother was a single parent and had to juggle multiple shifts at work while caring for me. Even though times were tough, she never lost her patience with me. She set a good example by trying to stay calm in tough moments, and that's something I've remembered throughout my life. 

One example that really stands out was when I was in middle school and wanted to join the soccer team, but my mom didn't have the money for the equipment. Instead of getting frustrated with my wishes, she patiently encouraged me to find another way. She helped me set up a meeting with the coach to see if I could volunteer at practices and games by doing odd jobs in exchange for the equipment. The coach agreed and it was a win-win. 

I'm so grateful to my mom for her patience during that time. I learned so many important lessons from her example and I constantly try to practice patience in my own life now.
