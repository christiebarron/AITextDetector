The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first was the very stringent requirement that some of the tubes must be connected to a steel carriage so that two passengers could be pulled into the cabin by an attendant using a lift.

The designers feared that having a large number of such tubes within the building would be very costly.

Then, in 1838, the American Civil War began.

When World War Two ended, the Empire State Building remained vacant for several years.
