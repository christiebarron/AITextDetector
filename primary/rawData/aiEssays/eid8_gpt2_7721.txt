One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was walking through the office of the New York Times. It turned out that when I took a picture of the president with the camera, he leaned over and made the caption "My Time at the Office." It felt like the White House would be like a giant sculpture.

There was a moment that turned me on when I really came up against something. You know, I was very lucky. I just had this experience to bring together to show our respect for the office. There were two things I loved most about it and one I hated the least: the fact that I was writing things this way (as I write, on all seven of my novels). In fact, he had this idea. His idea was that we might not know about the first 100 days of the Obama presidency or even the last eight years of the administration until after they were inaugurated, when they're at, for the first time, the highest legal heights. That's an amazing idea.

So I looked at the Constitution, and I read it, and I could do everything in my power to get the president to sit down and think about these things for 10 or 10 years and not wait a second for anything from those people to come out and talk about. It was really amazing that this was so easy to do, because I had only just begun the third chapter of another series of books.

I also have a very personal thing on this
