Narciso Rodriguez's memoir From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives is a collection of personal recollections from the designer's life, both from his upbringing and from his adult years. Rodriguez has crafted a memoir that is reflective and introspective in its exploration of identity and self-exploration. The tone of the memoir is one of nostalgia, yet it carries a sense of hopefulness and depth that gives the reader hope amidst the reflections of one's own life.

The mood of From Home is often melancholic, with Rodriguez turning inward to explore his past, the places he has been, and the memories associated with them. He is reflective, not just of his own life and experiences, but of the world around him, and how it has affected his existence and identity. Through this, the memoir sets a strong, nostalgic tone, one of remembering what was but with the present firmly in one's mind. This is highlighted not only through his memories, but through the visual images he shares from his travels around Latin America, the United States, and the other places he has lived.

By the end of the memoir, the mood shifts to one of hope
