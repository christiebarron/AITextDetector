One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I sat next to my grandmother with a gun drawn. At one point I threw a bag full of weed into her face. My grandmother took a shot, shot the gun which pierced her face and it struck her eye socket and left a black mark on her right arm. I would not go home alone now that we were still married. After my uncle opened his bag of weed there was no one there. Then I found that I could open an envelope at one of my cousin's friends and see the receipt for $300. I put two dollars in the envelope and looked at it and it was $500. The money went straight to the girl and then to her grandma so it is what it is. But it was not to my grandma. Before she died I had tried to keep a picture in my car to see it all up the next week. And now when I saw where my picture will go I will do the same. I have not tried to get a divorce. But I understand that I cannot. I want a wife. We have six children in all. And what does my Grandma say when she sees that picture of my grandpa? The picture that I saw from the man's side of my family? I think I remember that woman. She will be the wife when I die. She will be on her deathbed with my family and those I have loved.


How long did you get my picture in my car
