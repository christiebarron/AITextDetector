The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The "Beverly Hills" dam was just one of many dams built to replace the Empire State Building from 1912-1918: another one included in The Empire State Building: The Story of Building a Nation, was installed in 1913. The first of the new dams was completed on March 7, 1914, as part of a larger reconstruction project known as the Great Northern Trail. The trail connects the two existing dams with the original One Hundred Mile Wilderness for hiking, riding, and wilderness recreation.


The "Bigger, Better" dams were erected in both 1906 and 1917 and continued down until the early 1920's, when the Great Western Trail was completed in 1927.
