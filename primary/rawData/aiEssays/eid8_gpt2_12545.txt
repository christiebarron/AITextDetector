One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was walking on the sidewalk and my boyfriend decided to run away. The guy I was talking to said a loud "no." At that moment, the guy on the sidewalk stopped and he put his hands up and said, "I'm sorry," and said that he was sorry for what he was doing.
