One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I heard my uncle tell me that he felt the same way about me as I did when I was growing up. My uncle went to school, his first job was with an airline who took a lot of my friends, they were quite funny. I also learned that this "big idea" had to be tried by everyone to see if it could work. I have to say I had no desire to do that sort of thing. All a man should want to do is be loved by others on the same page.
