The features of the setting in the story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski greatly affect the cyclist in a multitude of ways. 

The terrain of the country road on which the cyclist is traveling is an important feature that affects their journey. The cyclist is forced to navigate the narrow, windy, and steep roads that continually slow them down. These roads are often littered with debris from the surrounding forest, including rocks, sticks, and leaves, which further obstruct their path and reduce their speed. Additionally, the dense vegetation of the sides of the road makes it difficult for the cyclist to see ahead, making it even tougher to navigate the path.

Another feature of the setting are the animals scattered throughout the forest. As the cyclist travels, they frequently have to dodge the animals that make their way onto the road. From squirrels to deer, the cyclist must continually be on the lookout for wildlife, making it difficult to concentrate on their riding.

Weather is the final important feature of the environment that affects the cyclist. As the cyclist travels, the changing weather conditions are a constant hindrance to their progress. From heavy downpours to intense heat, the cyclist must always be prepared for the changing conditions.

Overall, the features of the setting greatly impact the cyclist in “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski. From the terrain to the animals to the frequently changing weather conditions, the cyclist must constantly be aware
