One evening my friend and I were walking home after a night out. As we strolled arm-in-arm, my friend commented on the beauty of the stars, noting that they brought perspective to the troubles of life. With a smile, I joked that they could also provide perspective on the fact that we felt completely lost. We both burst out laughing and began to look for direction.

We kept laughing, sometimes pausing for a few seconds so we could catch our breath. It felt good to laugh together like that. As our laughter began to calm down, my friend found a landmark that could help us know where we were. We stopped laughing in order to figure out a way to get home, but after we had found the right path, we shared a few more laughs as we walked.

Laughter brings us closer together in those moments when we need it the most. I'm grateful for the moments when laughter provides that bridge between us.
