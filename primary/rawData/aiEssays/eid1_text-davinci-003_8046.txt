The construction of the Empire State Building was a great feat for engineers of the early 20th century. With its spire almost 500 feet higher than the tallest existing structure of the day - the Chrysler Building - it was the first of its kind to feature a mooring mast for dirigibles, and accordingly aspired to revolutionize air travel. Unfortunately, this bold plan encountered a number of serious obstacles.

First and foremost, the mooring mast needed to be exceptionally strong and heavy in order to manage the strain of docking a large dirigible, which could easily be weighed down by the weight of its passengers and cargo. Constructing a mooring mast that could endure such a load while still remaining within the buildingâ€™s architectural framework was a huge challenge. The engineers working on the Empire State Building had to experiment with new materials, many of which were not available in the 1930s, in order to create a mast that was both strong and lightweight. This was further complicated by the large amounts of money needed to develop and build a custom mast.

The other major obstacle was the inherent risk of creating a structure that would be exposed to the elements. Weather could easily take its toll on the mooring mast, making it unstable and dangerous to navigate. Constructors had to examine a range of weather-proofing and stabilizing solutions, including various coatings and supports, to ensure that the mooring mast was suitable for air travel. Wind could
