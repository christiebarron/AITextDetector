The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. This was due to the fact that the building was so large and tall that it represented a unique engineering challenge. This essay will discuss the various difficulties that needed to be overcome in order to enable dirigibles to be safely moored at the Empire State Building.

At the time, airships were a relatively new form of transportation and the technology to safely dock them onto a towering skyscraper was still in its infancy. In Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s book, ‘The Mooring Mast’, she states that the original plans for the Empire State Building had provisions for the mooring of airships, albeit with a much smaller mast than was eventually constructed. The first obstacle faced by the builders was the sheer size and height of the planned mast. The mast would need to be strong enough to withstand the buffeting winds at the top of the building as well as strong enough to bear the weight of the airships.

Another challenge the builders faced related to the construction materials of the time. Lüsted explains that the current materials available for erecting the mooring mast, particularly the metal trusses, were not of sufficient strength for such a gargantuan structure. They would need to be either redesigned or replaced outright in order to create a mast strong enough to safely dock airships.

Another obstacle was the
