I recently had to help my neighbor move into their new home. It was a hot day and we had a lot of heavy items that needed to be moved. After an hour of hauling boxes, chairs, and other bulky items, I was feeling exhausted and frustrated. 

My neighbor, however, remained patient throughout the entire process. She offered kind words of encouragement and support, and she made sure that we had breaks when needed. She also kept a positive state of mind and made sure to express her appreciation throughout the day. 

I quickly realized what a great attitude she had and how it kept us all going even when things were tough. The experience made me realize the value of patience and its power to turn a stressful situation into a positive one.
