Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. As it appears one can also choose a specific area on which to park in one of its few options, as cyclists tend often to not know exactly how far to cross, for instance.

For instance:

As noted above, each round-trip ride will come with up to 150 minutes between rides during these shorter and shorter breaks. It means that if the cycle you choose to ride in is a very short one, you won't see many points up and down the road at the speed you desire.

Here's a few of the cycling stats from the Cycling Scotland website:

Worth noting, however, are the numbers given in green to help you decide which area your ride will be short, and where you will park it.

For example, if a rider travels from the south of France to the south of the Isle of Man, in Scotland, the following chart from the British Cycling website would clearly indicate you will see the island of St Kilda.

At a rate of 10,000 miles per year (1 millionkm/h), you will be on the equivalent of 4.6 miles per week as a regular person. So for those lucky enough to be in a more "heavy" riding style like on the Isle of Kildare, at 10,000 miles per year you will be able to drive on a regular basis for 5.8 miles
