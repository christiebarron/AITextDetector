The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is that the team was "a lot richer when they brought in people," says McElroy. "We started off with, 'This is my dream here.' Now, I'm like, 'You're going to do this, you're going to do this, the whole team. We're not even going into that level. Who?' "

But for all the good things McElroy has learned about his role in his memoir, there are only so many good deeds he can do in the short-term. His first big decision for the team was his role as the coach of that new team in Washington.

"I felt so much excitement in our first season that year in a hotel in Los Angeles, when I was in my first meeting with Coach Brady," he reveals in an interview with Sporting News. "After that, I had a lot of questions about how I thought we would perform. We were so confident that we could win the championship. Coach Brady's a great coach, I'm sure that can change everything."

McElroy says that he and Brady became "convinced that we could win the championship if we kept doing what we did in the first place." "I was like, 'If we keep going, I can't do that. I can't do that.'"

He went from that first season in Los Angeles to an All-Star selection by the New York Red
