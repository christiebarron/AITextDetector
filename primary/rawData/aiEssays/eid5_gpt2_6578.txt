The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' follows several women who have shared their experiences and shared personal stories about a period when homosexuality got so bad it was taking place on a scale unheard of. These women discuss their journeys and make clear what it's like to have the unwanted urge to become a gay person. The book's title is "A New Gay-American," but it is the title that carries its full weight.

The women show us why there are so many gay people, and why one in 30marks us, and why there's a need for more. And we look forward to reading these stories.
