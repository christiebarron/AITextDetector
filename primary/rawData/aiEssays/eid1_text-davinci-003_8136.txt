The Empire State Building in New York City has been a world-famous architectural marvel for nearly a century, but many people may not know that it was once something even more impressive: a dirigible port. The engineering feat of allowing these large airships to dock to the Empire State Building's 34th floor required overcoming several obstacles, as described in "The Mooring Mast," a book by Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted. 

The book recounts how the Empire State Building needed to be reinforced to accommodate the enormous weight of the airships. Its structure already needed to be taken into consideration, as its extraordinary height was not designed to withstand the pressures and strains associated with such a large vessel. To increase its stability, the mooring mast was placed deep into the existing base of the building, creating an open-topped metal cylinder about thirty feet high with three access points around it.

The book explains how the mast was not only reinforced, but also designed to be aerodynamic so the airships could dock safely. This was achieved by creating an air-filled chamber within the mast, which allowed the building to remain stable and reduce turbulence from the airships. The mooring was also equipped with mooring lines, which extended from the mast to the ship and provided a secure attachment point. 

In addition, the book highlights the engineering required to determine how to accommodate the humans that would accompany the airships. The Empire State Building was out
