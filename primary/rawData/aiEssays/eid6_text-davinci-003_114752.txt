The idea of a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building to provide docking capabilities for dirigibles was a bold, ambitious move by the building’s designers. But to its credit, it was an ambitious move that paid off. Unfortunately, the challenges of making such a novel idea a reality were far from easy and required a level of design and engineering prowess that many found unbelievable.

The main obstacle to the realization of the Empire State Building’s mooring mast was the weight factor. The building was already supported by 14 steel columns that were necessary to ensure structural integrity. This meant that any additional weight added to the top would cause it to become unstable. As such, the engineers had to design a mast that was incredibly light but still able to withhold the pressure of docking dirigibles. To this end, they settled with a flagpole design, making use of triangular trusses to hold the weight of the airship and giving the mooring mast a very distinct look.

Another issue to consider was wind resistance. This was especially important given the size of the dirigibles that were expected to dock at the mooring mast. The engineers designed the mast to fit within the existing steel columns, meaning that it was mostly enclosed and as such it could reduce wind resistance and remain stable even in heavy winds. Additionally there had to be an emergency breaking mechanism installed in case of a mooring failure as the force of the Dirig
