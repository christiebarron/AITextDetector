Dear Editor,

I am writing to voice my opinion that computers have had an overwhelmingly positive effect on people. They have provided us with access to opportunities that would have otherwise been quite unavailable.

From allowing us to quickly and easily access information, to creating jobs in the industry itself, to providing us with entertainment such as gaming, computers have revolutionized our lives in profound ways. The level of connection fostered by computers has been incredibly beneficial and far-reaching, facilitating faster communication with someone half a world away than ever before.

Computers have also enabled better use of time. They have reduced the amount of time spent waiting for a task to be completed. We also are exponentially better connected to the world in which we live, with information that often corroborates and expands our understanding of it.

Finally, the levels of productivity unleashed by computers has improved our lives in many ways. Generally speaking, tasks are completed more quickly and efficiently than ever before. From the ability to automate repetitive processes to the use of algorithms to solve complex problems, computers are helping us to get more done in less time.

I hope I have been able to convince you that computers can have a profoundly positive effect on people, and that the opportunities and benefits that they offer should be embraced.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
