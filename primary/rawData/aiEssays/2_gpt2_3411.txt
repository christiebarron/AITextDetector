I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is illegal under the European Union." In addition, the EU's National Library Association is against new licensing for materials on its website.

"European national libraries have the right to access, but not remove, the materials they wish to. But they do not have the right to control whether they restrict free speech or not," she said.

Pelosi's office declined comment. In response to my story, the E.U.'s Library Director at the time, Dr. Martin Raskin, said, "I wouldn't be surprised if a law passed in the future which would prohibit libraries from prohibiting political content or the writings of individuals in political positions is upheld. As I said, it's part of the European Union's intellectual property protection treaty. This would not be a new restriction imposed on our public libraries, but this current one does not address our cultural and religious freedom.

"The law already allows for religious material, but the language is in English, and this includes works that have a certain political content in them, such as the work of Thomas Paine or John Locke, but not those that are otherwise free or non-free of religious content."
