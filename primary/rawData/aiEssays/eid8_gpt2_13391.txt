One time I experienced laughter in my life was when a few of me had been trying to escape a bar that just happened to be my home. We decided to go into something with some friends after a couple of drinks. Our friend's mom and I had left us. We had spent many years in the band. The night before, the night before a big tournament in which our music was nominated, she mentioned that we should be going to Las Vegas. We had been looking for something on the first day that we could go down to California where we could play. I wanted to take the next day on my way to Vegas but was disappointed that we didn't have a chance to do so. I remember that in our room the band was singing a song and we were laughing through a few of the verses. That's when she said, "We all hear the same thing, that the good singers can't sing. Just because they are playing doesn't mean they can't sing. Your heart is your friend." This was a good thing for us because in our hearts we sang our favorite song about us and my mom and I were able to do so much more.
The reason why I am here today but who I am going to be is something that I am excited to share. I am thrilled to have the chance to meet all different people as musicians. The main event is the performance of "You Are The One" as well as the "Your Song" which I found a really catchy
