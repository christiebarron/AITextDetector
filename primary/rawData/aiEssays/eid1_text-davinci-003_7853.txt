In his memoir, From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso Rodriguez paints a vivid and contemplative portrait of the many intertwined elements of the human experience. His heartfelt stories are filled with emotion, as he reflects on his faith, sexuality, and heritage, and the struggles of his childhood in New Jersey.

Throughout the memoir, Rodriguez skillfully creates a melancholy mood. Whether recalling his struggles with food scarcity, or his disconnected home life, there is a heavy sense of sadness that hangs over the narrative. These feelings are compounded by intense loneliness, and the sense that Rodriguez is observing his life from an outsider's perspective, rather than truly living it. At times the loneliness is palpable, as he grapples with the difficulty of parsing out his identity as both a gay man and a person of Hispanic heritage.

Writing in a vivid and sparsely poetic style, Rodriguez builds upon his intensely personal experiences in order to tell a universal story. His detailed and introspective scenes offer insight into the healing power of friendship and self-love. By embracing his roots and unlocking the understanding of his true self, the introspective mood of the memoir is replaced with a sense of hope.

Overall, Rodriguez has achieved an impressive feat by opening a novel window into his personal and spiritual journey. From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives is a powerful testament to the power of story and self-expression, and leaves readers with a gentle reminder to appreciate, accept, and cherish
