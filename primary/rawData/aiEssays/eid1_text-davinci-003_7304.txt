In the short story "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski, the features of the setting contribute greatly to the cyclist's plight and experience.

The story takes place on a “bumpy winding” mountain road in the Rockies. The rocky, hilly terrain of the road makes it difficult for the cyclist to make forward progress. The uphill and curves in the path cause the cyclist to have to constantly brake, slow down, and put in more effort to take the challenging turns. This combination of never-ending terrain changes and inclines take a heavy toll on the cyclist and discourages him in his journey. 

The setting also adds an element of danger to the cyclist's journey. Being in the open mountain without guardrails or other cyclists, the possibility of falling off the side of the cliff or encountering wildlife, creates an air of concern and vulnerability. Additionally, the sun going down and darkness looming threatens to increase the danger of his ride.

The cyclist is also disheartened by the scenery itself. The long winding road can at times create a sense of loneliness and isolation, making the cyclist question why he puts himself through this arduous journey. The dull colors of the mountains and steep inclines can be further discouraging to the cyclist, threatening to break his mental strength and motivation.
