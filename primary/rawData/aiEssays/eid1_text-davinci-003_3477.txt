Dear Editor,

As we move further into an increasingly digital age, computers have become a staple in our daily lives. It is my opinion that computers have profoundly impacted both the lives of people and the way we communicate.

Most people these days rely heavily on computers for their basic needs. They can be used for remote learning, working, searching for information, and more. People can also use computers to stay connected with loved ones no matter where they are in the world. Computers have revolutionized countless industries and the way we interact with others.

However, this does not come without consequence. Due to their convenience and widespread use, humans have become overly reliant on computers. Studies have shown that using computers for too long can lead to physical and mental health problems such as eye strain, repetitive strain injury, and neck pain. On an emotional level, computers have caused people to become isolated from one another and can negatively affect relationships.

When used correctly, computers can be an invaluable tool in both our professional and personal lives. Therefore, I believe that it is important for people to be aware and educated on how to properly use computers. With adequate training, people can learn how to balance their computer usage with other activities
