In the poem "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski, the features of the setting play a key role in affecting the cyclist on their journey. For example, the cyclist traverses a "gravel-strewn road" that provides a bumpy, uneven, and treacherous surface. This makes it difficult for the cyclist to maintain control and balance, and forces them to navigate each curve and patch of gravel with great caution and care. 

Moreover, the poem's setting also provides a sense of solitude and seclusion. The poet describes the cyclist's ride as being "silent, like snowfall," conveying a feeling of empty remoteness that is further amplified by the line "beneath a twilight sky." This reinforces the sense of isolation, with the cyclist the only living presence in the vast expanse of nature under the moon and stars. 

Furthermore, the imagery of "icy trails yawning wide" implies a daunting and intimidating element to the cyclist's journey. Despite being in the middle of a peaceful landscape, the unknown terrain combined with the icy patches casts an aura of fear and uncertainty on the cyclist as they try to gauge the strength of each stretch of icy surface. 

In sum, Joe Kurmaski's poem effectively utilizes the features of the setting to evoke a sense of fear and uneasiness in the cyclist as they grapple with the difficulty of the terrain and the overwhelming sense of solitude that pervades the entire
