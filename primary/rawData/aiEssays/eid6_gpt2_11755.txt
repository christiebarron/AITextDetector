The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The most daunting was the issue of what to do with lasers. To enable the use of a special type of laser light, the Empire State Building would need to employ a laser-based technology called a microprocessor.

The microprocessor contained a set of hardware instructions that would allow the laser beam to reach the material. When this is correct, it can be used to cut the beams more easily. The other problem was the problem of building the buildings themselves. If the laser beam is limited to a certain part, it is difficult to keep track of which part is where on its axis. To keep track of which parts should be on each side of the main roadway, the construction engineers built multiple sections of a structure in a huge warehouse. They made the structures out of wood and concrete, while the buildings were made out of glass and aluminum.

Once the buildings were built, the microprocessor worked out a way to program the lasers into their configurations. With the microprocessor, a computer program could be activated to generate electrical currents on the building's roof beams, to generate power instead of trying to run a mechanical circuit. Once the microprocessor worked its way through the building, it worked out that all the electrical elements of the building connected to each other made up the building's magnetic field. An electrical discharge could occur where the wires were disconnected from the walls and columns that had been connected in the
