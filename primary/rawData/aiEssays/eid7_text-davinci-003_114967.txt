 

One day, I was at the grocery store waiting in line to buy a few items. After I had waited for over ten minutes, the cashier asked me to wait for another few minutes as the person in front was having trouble figuring out how to pay by card. Being the patient person I am, I simply paused and waited patiently as the person ahead of me worked out the issue. Surprisingly, it took them over fifteen minutes to get it right!

Throughout the entire process, the cashier and I talked and I was genuinely understanding and encouraging of the other person. When they eventually sorted out the issue, I gave them a big smile and even offered to help pay for their items. 

At the end of the day, it was worth it. I had the opportunity to teach myself a lesson in patience and kindness, and in the process, I might have helped brighten up someone else's day.
