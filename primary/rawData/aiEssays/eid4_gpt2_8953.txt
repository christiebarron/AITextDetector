The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because its main villain, a young man called The Queen, wants to see Lady Macbeth. Macbeth gets stabbed and she has to leave the house for a different adventure. That's when her dreamy young mind falls apart and finds herself in a life where she finds herself trying to change her destiny. That leads to her going to an alternate past and leaving her house because she can't figure out why they have to do both Attributes on different continents.

Alderson's movie is a bit like Ansel Elgort's Twilight Saga (though it's made better by the fact that it shows a lot of the world he's in), where everything goes from bad to worse. Every area looks just as bad. No one cares. It's just a dark, bloody world of evil that goes on forever. When you see the book as it is, it ends in pretty good fashion.
