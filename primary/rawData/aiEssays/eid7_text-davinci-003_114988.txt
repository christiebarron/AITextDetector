I recently had a situation come up where I had to be extremely patient. My daughter's school was having an art show where parents could submit a piece of art for review. After she finished her project, I prepped it for delivery and we headed to the school. 

Unfortunately, due to unanticipated circumstances, we arrived at the art show late. The room was full of parent and students and I assumed that we had missed our chance to submit our work. To our surprise, one of the teachers noticed us, acknowledged that we were running late, and allowed us to submit the project. 

I kept a positive attitude throughout the entire process and was grateful that the teacher showed us kindness and understanding. I remained patient and polite despite the fact that we were late. In the end, it turned out to be a great experience for my daughter and I was incredibly proud of us for staying the course.
