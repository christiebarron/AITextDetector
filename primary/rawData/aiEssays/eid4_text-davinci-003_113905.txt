Minfong Ho ends Winter Hibiscus with this thought because she is trying to emphasize the idea of resilience and the hope associated with renewal that comes with the passing of winter. The hibiscus is a symbol of growth, potential, and rebirth, and the school test is a symbol of new knowledge and experiences that are still possible. By juxtaposing the two, Ho is suggesting that with the right attitude, anything is possible and anything can be overcome.
