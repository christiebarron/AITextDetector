Dear Editor, 

In the wake of recent censorship discussions, it is important to consider the impact of censorship in libraries. Many people argue that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from library shelves if they are found offensive. However, I strongly disagree and believe that all forms of censorship should be avoided in libraries and other public forums. 

Not only does censorship silence those that may be contrary to our views, but it does not actually prevent people from obtaining the “offensive” materials. With the internet, it is not possible to completely ban or censor materials, and even library censorship can be avoided by simply finding it elsewhere. This renders censorship in libraries useless, as it does not actually accomplish the goal of preventing access to the material. 

What’s more, censorship sets a dangerous precedent that can lead to sweeping restrictions on other forms of expression. Allowing censorship in libraries sends the wrong message- that certain topics can or should be avoided. Nobody should be able to decide what is or is not acceptable to read or view. Libraries should be places where free speech and the exchange of ideas can take place, and censorship should not be allowed to silence the voices of those that disagree.
