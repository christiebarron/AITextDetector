Kashmir High Court verdict.

At a hearing before the Supreme Court on Friday, the court issued a verdict on the issue of the copyright infringement lawsuit against one of the libraries in the Karnataka state. (Sri L. Krishanti)

The judgement in the issue came at an inconvenient time for the government of Karnataka, as the Supreme Court held that the copyright infringement lawsuit in these states should not take place in the news media. The judgment came after the Karnataka government withdrew the case in 2008, following which the judgment of the High Court directed that information be shared by the judiciary to determine whether the information was protected by copyright. The government also sought a reply from a government solicitor, in which the government asked the court to reverse the judgment on whether the court should not intervene, given the importance of the issue in Karnataka.
