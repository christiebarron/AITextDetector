An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when the first person in my life became suicidal. He or she left school and had another one left after he or she took his or her medication. She left in fear.

The first person I told to get on a suicide pill was I didn't want anyone being scared for my life that they could come back.

I am very proud of my parents saying I can't have suicide, but they gave up, because that's what happened.

It gives out hope, and that's what I find is most important.

He said, "You mean to say, 'Don't say anything. Do your job, do your work and not speak to people that may be feeling depressed.' But, to my mind, if you have a mental illness, if you are an athlete I want to be there with you to make sure you do what is best for the athletes." (Well, that's not what I'm trying to say.)
