I remember one time when I was on the bus, I noticed an elderly man walking towards the bus stop. He was carrying several shopping bags and struggling to balance them. As the bus pulled up to the stop, everyone on the bus rushed to get off. Since the elderly man was last to get on the bus, all of the seats were already taken.

I was sitting in the back of the bus and I could see that the man was feeling tired from carrying his bags. Instead of getting irritated with the people in front of him, the elderly man simply smiled and thanked each person for letting him on the bus.

At the next stop, one of the passengers got off, so the elderly man was able to get a seat. He thanked the woman who had given up her seat and he was very patient and understanding during the entire episode.

It was a great reminder to me that a little patience and understanding can go a long way.
