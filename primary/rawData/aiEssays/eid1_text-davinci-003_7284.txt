In the short story "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski, the cyclist's journey is heavily impacted by the setting. The story takes place in a rural area during the winter, where the cyclist must battle elements of nature. The cold weather is the most pressing element, as it affects the cyclist’s physical endurance. The cyclist’s hands become numb, making it difficult to grip the handlebars. Clothes also become bothersome as the day progresses. The road is full of potholes, straining the cyclist's concentration. Additionally, trucks passing by kick up blinding clouds of dust and debris, making it hard to focus on the road ahead. Lastly, the day is cloudy and the air is damp, providing little light, making it hard to see clearly.

All these elements of nature make it difficult for the cyclist to ensure his own safety. The cold temperatures threaten his physical endurance, while the cloudy day reduces his visual acuity. The potholes constantly distract him, making it hard to focus on the road. The passing trucks create conditions in which visibility is diminished. All these things contribute to an environment of uncontrolled risks.
