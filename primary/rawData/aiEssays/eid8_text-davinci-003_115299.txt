It was one of those days at work. Nothing was going right. I felt deflated and exhausted by the end of my shift.

But when I got home, my husband was waiting for me with a big smile on his face.

He started to tell me a funny story. At first, I couldn't help but roll my eyes. I wasn't in the mood for jokes.

But as the story went on, I couldn't help but start to giggle. Soon, I was practically rolling on the floor with laughter.

And then my husband did something I had never seen him do before. He started to laugh with me. I was amazed.

I wasn't expecting him to join in. I thought that he would just crack a joke or two and then go on with his day.

But instead, he found it just as funny as I did. We kept cracking up until we were both in tears.

That laugh was a wonderful thing for our relationship. Laughter made us both feel so close and connected. I realized that laughter really is the best way to build a strong bond between two people.
