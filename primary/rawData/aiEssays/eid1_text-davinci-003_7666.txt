Minfong Ho ends the poem Winter Hibiscus with this line to show that the narrator will not let her fear of failure prevent her from taking the test again in the future. The hibiscus symbolizes her resilience and determination to keep going despite her fear. The imagery in the line also helps to illustrate that spring always comes after winter and that it will bring new beginnings for the narrator. The image of the geese returning and the hibiscus budding are signs of the change and growth the narrator will go through in the new season.
