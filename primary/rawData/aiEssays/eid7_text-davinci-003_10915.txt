A few months ago, I was travelling from my home to spend the weekend with my grandparents. I hopped onto the bus, and when I sat down, I noticed that the person sitting next to me was coughing and sniffling constantly.

At first, I was a bit nervous. I already had a cold and I was worried that I’d get sicker if I stayed near him. But I didn’t want to be rude so I decided to stay.

During the entire ride, I kept my distance and tried to be courteous. He thanked me for being so understanding. I could tell that he was embarrassed and worried that he was making everyone else on the bus uncomfortable.

As we got closer to the stop near my grandparent’s house, he started sniffling more and more, and I could tell that he was really struggling to keep his symptoms under control. He apologized for being sick and asked if I wanted to switch spots with him.

Rather than leave him, I stayed in my seat and offered words of comfort. Seeing that I was being understanding, he thanked me and said that he’d be more careful to not bother anyone else on the bus.

I was so proud of myself for being patient and compassionate towards this person. I know it wasn’t easy but I’m glad I was able to stay calm and show kindness.
