The narrator of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho ends the story with this statement to emphasize the cyclical nature of life. This phrase brings the story full-circle, symbolizing that through experiences--including failure--one learns and can overcome obstacles. The phrase implies that the narrator will have the courage to retake the test despite her prior failure in the hopes of experiencing success. The return of the snow and geese signify a beginning and a fresh start for the narrator, as they often do in literature. In this case, the narrator is hopeful yet realistic about her circumstances, allowing her enough motivation to come back in the spring and try again.
