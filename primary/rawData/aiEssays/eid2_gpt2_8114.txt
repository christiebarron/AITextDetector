I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a necessary counter-revolutionary process" to stop censorship. There are some cases we suspect of censorship of books without attribution, for instance. A lot of people want to tell us that they use their library, a computer, to get free books. They try very hard to avoid copyright infringement. They just can no longer use copyright in public libraries. Their libraries have been closed down, and they need other means of using that library.

But it still doesn't cover books. Why should they have paid copyright fees? It doesn't work, though a lot of people used to pay their fair share. If anyone paid copyright fees, you might get some of it. That's why they don't really need them anymore, because they'd be paying nothing. What's wrong with that?

We should pay more than we take in. The money is there, because people will buy it without having to pay royalties. The problem is we still don't have to use it. We haven't given anything for our copyright collection to this generation. We just have to trust to have good software. The more libraries there are, the easier it would be for publishers to make a profit off of those books, the longer it takes to build those, the safer it is for everyone (to say that books not made legally available for use outside the copyright marketplace would be destroyed in vain).

What is clear, though, is that all this isn
