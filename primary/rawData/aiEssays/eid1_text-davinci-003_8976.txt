Dear Editor, 

With the prevalence of computing technologies in our lives, I believe the effects of computers on people have become increasingly more relevant.

These days, computers are pervasive in nearly every aspect of our lives, from business to education to social media. We rely on them to carry out any given task, in the same way that we used to rely on pen and paper. We are even becoming more dependent on them for communication and gathering information, as well as for entertainment.

I believe that computers can generally have positive effects on people in a variety of ways. Primarily, it allows us to accomplish tasks faster and more efficiently. Also, inviting us to become engaged with a wide range of activities including research, collaborative projects and even creating art. By providing access to unlimited knowledge, computers can improve the quality of lives, especially when it comes to education or health care. 

Additionally, I think that computers can also be useful in allowing us to more easily connect with other people virtually. This could be especially beneficial for those who are more introverted or who live in more rural areas. This gives people the opportunity to socialize with others, share experiences and ideas, and even create communities of their own.

While computers can be useful and beneficial in so many ways, itâ€™s important to recognize the risks associated with over reliance on these machines. Without unplugging from time to time, we can easily become disconnected from the world around
