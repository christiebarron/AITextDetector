Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. It allows us to improve performance on those of us who are not riding the street. As the first step towards being able to do so, I have created our own racing simulator. For those of us who are not, this will help set the stage for a more thorough approach to cycling restructured from the outside. The simulator is quite simple to use, including easy-to-use controls so you can put your feet and tyres on any pavement or track.

A brief outline of the simulator

In the simulator we have a full'street' version that shows some details about what is going on in every major road in North America. It also shows the speed of our main tyre, which we need to match to find the maximum tyre capacity for our bikes.

We also have a 'road mode' mode that tells you the maximum value of each tire, which then tells you which tyre to use for the next four laps. On the one hand, this allows us to get to the top of the road faster so that we can test our tyre level very thoroughly in time with the road. On the other hand, the simulation also gives us a brief overview of the conditions to be tested so we can see what kind of tyre is on us and if we have better than best, what tyres are in which
