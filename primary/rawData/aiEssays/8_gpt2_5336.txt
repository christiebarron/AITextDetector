One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was playing on a local guitar club; it was all in my head, at the time. I was just a kid, I played an instrument with no playing experience. When we played I used to laugh, and I said it's so funny why can't I go away? We would hear another couple of laughs in the music, so I had to laugh.

I always wanted to do an album. I guess I did for about four months before I would start doing those albums. I guess I also didn't do something that would break anybody in my life. I wanted to go out in my life, have fun doing things that I'm a kid, but I didn't need to be part of the music anymore, you never know how much I wanted to do something before it would have stopped making me laugh. One of the reasons what I came up with is, this album would play a lot, I would have a lot of fun doing it for a while and then it would stop really fast. When you do that as a kid all you do is do it for a month or two before you decide, because it's too late. I know what it takes to be there. It's too late to be there. I just didn't even put that much effort into it yet. At the same time, it took me 12 years before
