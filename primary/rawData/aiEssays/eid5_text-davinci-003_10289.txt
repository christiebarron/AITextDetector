The memoir From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez has created a poignant mood that evokes both sorrow and joy. Written in a sincere and honest format, the book is composed of personal experiences, memories, and reflections of the designer’s life.

The memoir begins at a place of sorrow and reflects on Rodriguez’s struggles and anxieties. He describes how his parents were unable to stay in one place for long, as they moved from a “shack” in Puerto Rico to the streets of New Jersey. Consequently, Rodriguez was never able to form any firm relationships with friends or neighbors. Instead, he had to turn toward his family, for comfort and security.

Despite these hardships, the memoir takes on a more optimistic and uplifting tone as Rodriguez recounts various moments of joy. He pays homage to his childhood home since it was the “blueprint” of his life. Additionally, he’s thankful for the small moments of joy that remind him of how far he’s come, such as when he was able to buy his parents a home. 

His memoir tells a story of both suffering and beauty, giving readers a glimpse into his life. He manages to weave together sorrow and joy in a way that reminds us of the beauty of life and the struggles we all face. Rodriguez has created a stirring and profound emotion throughout his memoir, enabling readers to connect to his experience. He
