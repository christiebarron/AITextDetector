Building the Empire State Building in 1931 was an ambitious and daring endeavor. The fact that the Empire State Building included a mooring mast in its designs was even more ambitious, as it prepared to be one of the first buildings in history to serve as an airship terminal. While the building of the Empire State Building was difficult enough, the engineering of the mast posed a significant challenge to the builders.

The designers of the Empire State Building wanted the mooring mast to be able to safely dock dirigibles, which was no easy task. Before the mast could be built, they needed to consider several key factors. The first was its height. The mast had to be tall enough to allow the dirigibles to moor, but not too tall that the elevated platform which passengers used to disembark would be too far off the ground. It also had to be tall enough to accommodate the extended tail of the zeppelin so that the rudder was above the rooftop.

Another obstacle was the materials used to construct the mast. Because it needed to be able to withstand the strong winds that come with airship arrivals, the mast was built with strong steel girders and a duralumin alloy skin. This made it light and incredibly strong. It also had to be able to withstand strong vibrations to minimize movement and make docking easier. Part of the mooring mast was sunk deep into the ground with set foundations. Finally, due to the presence of other tall aspects
