The Empire State Building was famously seen in the 1933 King Kong film, but it also once featured something much less cinematic – the first mooring mast for the docking of dirigibles. Constructed in 1931, the ‘stub mast’ was built on the 79th floor of the Empire State Building and opened the skies to airship travel. However, there were many obstacles that the builders had to overcome in order to allow dirigibles to dock. 

The most pervasive challenge was the unpredictability of the weather conditions in the area. The winds sweeping the New York City skyline were known to be erratic, with gusts and whorls that changed with frequency and intensity. It was essential that the mooring mast be able to withstand these variables and anchor a dirigible securely while also not damaging the airship itself during docking. Engineers had to consider the impact of wind speed, visibility and ‘thermal column’ (a frenetic column of air) when designing the mast. 

The construction of the mooring mast itself was a difficult and delicate process. The mast had to be made from steel, but in addition to being strong enough to withstand the winds, it also had to be light enough to not burden the airship’s landing mechanism. While it had to be sturdy, it also had to be built to precise specifications - the mooring mast had to be a specific height, width and weight so as
