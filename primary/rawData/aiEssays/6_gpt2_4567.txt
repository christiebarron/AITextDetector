The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One was the fact that the Empire State Building was constructed in London, England.

The building had to be located at Wembley Road and the two sides were on the same site. It was then decided that all three blocks of the complex that are located in Wembley Road would be attached to the building without any special miracle. This was difficult because they were on different floors. At a final meeting in January, 2010 the decision to attach the two pieces of the complex to the building was made.

However, there was a problem with the new design of the building. The building had to be constructed on the old London street. The two new buildings in the two existing sections were not built as designed. All the new sections were on the same site. They were very easy to build on and had the right layout and layout detail. The two existing sections now came with 3 floors, 3.5 ft and 9' tall walk-in shelving units. The walk-in shelving units are located at either side of the elevator shaft and the older one is on the lower level.

Therefore, it was decided that all the existing sections and walk-in shelving units were used together in one new building. This gives the architect confidence that the walk-in shelving units in the new building should not obstruct the main hall. It was important to install the walk-in shelving units
