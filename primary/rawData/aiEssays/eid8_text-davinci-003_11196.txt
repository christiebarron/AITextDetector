I remember the first time I met him like it was yesterday. We were at the same party but I was too shy to make the first move. He noticed me from across the room and I'm sure my face started turning red when he began making his way to me. We made small talk for a bit and the next thing I know we were both laughing hysterically. We had the same sense of humor and that's how I knew we were going to get along. The laughter that night was the start of a long journey together as the best of friends. We still always make sure to include laughter in our time together to keep our connection strong.
