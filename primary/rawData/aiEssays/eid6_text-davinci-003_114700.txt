The construction of the Empire State Building marked an ambitious undertaking and the successful completion of one of the most iconic structures NYC has ever known. With its soaring heights and regal shape, the building welcomed millions of visitors over the years, including, for a brief period, the largest passenger airship in the world: the Hindenburg. However, the architects and engineers who allowed it to dock faced a unique set of obstacles—obstacles that had their roots in the very structure of the building itself. This essay will explore the obstacles faced by the Empire State Building’s builders and engineers in allowing dirigibles to dock at the building.

By the time of its completion in 1931, the Empire State Building had been designed with little consideration for dirigibles. This meant that the necessary infrastructure, such as a mooring mast, was not in place. The only way to make dirigibles viable was to construct a custom-made mooring mast specifically for the Hindenburg, which was much larger than previous airships. With the Hindenburg measuring in at over 800 feet long, twice the length of the Empire State Building, the design of the mooring mast had to be precise in order for the ship to be safely docked.

The engineers then faced the challenge of finding land high enough to support the mooring mast. Thankfully, they were able to find a suitable plot of land on the building’s top floor. This allowed
