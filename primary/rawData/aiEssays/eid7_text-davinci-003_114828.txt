I was recently at a restaurant with my family when I noticed that the service was taking a long time. Despite being frustrated, I decided to stay patient and be understanding of the situation. With a big group of people ordering food and many other customers in the restaurant, it made sense that things were taking time.

I tried my best not to complain and complained to my family, but to stay positive and accept the situation for what it was. We eventually received our food after what seemed like forever, and at the end of the meal received an apology from the restaurant manager.

My patience had been noticed and I felt proud for keeping my cool. Instead of getting angry and making a big scene, my patience and understanding was rewarded with an apology from a manager. I learned that it's always best to stay patient rather than letting my frustrations get the best of me.
