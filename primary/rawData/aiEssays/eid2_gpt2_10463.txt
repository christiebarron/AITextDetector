And, according to Reuters, most U.S. libraries have no restrictions placed on how they handle copyrighted materials they carry.

Of course, there could be unintended consequences for how they should operate. For example, there's the potential to restrict free speech in other ways. This could lead to the release of information that may inadvertently be used by a group that opposes the U.S. government.
