Computers have many effects on people.

How to find out

The researchers tracked data collection rates over a large five-year period from 1990 through 2007. They then analyzed the changes in computer science, social life and information technology activity over those three years to look at how much people have changed using computers.

Over that same time, they looked at what that study shows consumers do online; what has been done with their online use through technology or services; how people use the Internet to interact with their friends; and how people are able to interact with information online or offline.

The researchers found data from two main streams of people. Those who spend some time searching for information online (i.e. searching for a favorite online movie) and those who are more likely to interact with people online (i.e. watching a number of other people watching), were more likely to spend time looking for information that they may not have already had.

To get to that level, the researchers looked for potential trends that could be tied to both people's activity on the Internet and the types of information being shared online, so they looked to social media websites and other online media that showed that people are more likely to use social media rather than looking to see information.

The data was then analyzed for specific factors as well as an overview of how people use social media.

As for Internet use rates, they then looked at it again to see which factors influenced people
