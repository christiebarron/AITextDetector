Computers have many effects on people. Most of which vary from person to person, from illness to age to gender. We have no knowledge of any effect of people's own physical, emotional, or mental health on the quality of their lives. However, we do know that there are different effects of different parts of the brain on individual people.

But, what is it about these effects that gives you the advantage of helping others? Researchers from MIT and Penn State have come up with a way to do it for people, so that you will benefit from it too:

Researchers from NYU and Penn State use a technique called "brain imaging." Brain scans can tell you how the neural pathways that lead to thinking, reasoning, and feeling are affected and are being mapped out. This process is done in the form of image-scanning images and a technique called stereographic and photonic (polarization) imaging, which are available in many physical models. Brain imaging allows researchers to look at brain regions involved in thinking, reasoning and feelings and to get a better idea of what's causing a person's brain signals to change. Those brain changes can be associated with mood, arousal or depression. When a person does some of these thoughts, they tend to go through the opposite pathway, giving rise to brain changes, and vice versa.

The brain scans and the brain imaging of students used the same technique used for other research using humans.

The differences between the two approaches are
