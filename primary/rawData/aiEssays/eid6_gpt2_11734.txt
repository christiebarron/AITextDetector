The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. For example, if a dirigible were to dock on top of the concrete wall at the lower control tower, the dirigible might be locked inside and no one would see it.

In 1961, American design historian Richard A. Rector patented the "Walls and Towers" concept. He wanted to encourage the design of a vertical structure to be as flexible as possible to allow the elevator to remain at the bottom until the elevator was pulled up on top of it. Rector believed that the structure should be able to climb to the top of any vertical or horizontal structure. Because of the low weight and easy structure, the roof would be more difficult to crack.

Lines on the Building's roof, then, were to have been made to hold the wheelbarrow in place.

On April 2, 1958, with the new design, A. Mancini and J. E. Rutt were hired by the New York Federal Building Department to create a vertical and horizontal design for a building at the height of 1,600 feet above sea level.

As early as 1957, the architects and their consultants had suggested to build an elevated tower that could allow the building's lower sections to remain safely upright.

As the tower was being constructed, a bridge and a walkway were being developed by an architectural firm: Dorset International/Chapel Hill. In the
