An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my family member, who died after being violently assaulted by a homeless man. He couldn't remember his name but his mother said his name was David. He had a history of PTSD before he was beaten to death.

A former police force commissioner says there is good evidence of a serial killer who targeted both women and men at the same time.

"It just happened within a single night," says Chief William Bratton.

Former New York police commissioner Robert Rice believes this pattern of serial killers exists today.

He says he was approached by the government when he was in the city of New York last year while sitting under a bus in a New York City park. While there he and six other employees and his assistant pulled up to an ATM that had been set up near a hotel where the man's wallet was kept.

He asked for two $3 notes to help with his case, but all were refused.

"He came up and told us he came from an out-of-state background and wanted to come back at me for the money I was sending," said Rice.

"It took us a couple of minutes to decide our options that he was mentally ill and wanted to go back," added Rice. "One of us didn't know anything about him and another one didn't know anything. We were told later that he had no relationship and had nothing to do with me."
