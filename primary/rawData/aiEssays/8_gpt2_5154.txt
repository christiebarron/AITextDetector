One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I ran to see my teacher. At first she was so nervous she told me not to look at the mirror because we were going to miss her and couldn't stand it anymore. She told me that her life was going to be like a movie and I didn't really understand why she was so nervous and I just went through my things and started listening to it. Then when I finished watching she finally said "Now I'm going to get ready for my exam". They both laughed with laughter but I had to make them stop because I did not want to take my exams as they didn't want to go to a public school where the teachers were not allowed to hear me talk or try their best and I still said "no thanks" because I am now doing well on my exam. (A friend once said to me that I am much happier because I do not feel the time at all.) I got into a fight when the teacher told me not to ask questions because we don't know how to deal with the students with problems in school and a lot of girls in the class were mad at me so I was angry. I did eventually get to ask my question to the class teacher because she told them to not tell the class and I gave her the answer but I left the teacher's seat. I decided to tell my teacher not to listen to me because I was afraid you will not know how to deal with what she has to say so this
