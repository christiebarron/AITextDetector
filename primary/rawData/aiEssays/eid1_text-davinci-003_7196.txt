The cyclist has to traverse a very dangerous route, which includes grueling climbs, tight switchbacks, and treacherous descents. The danger of the route heightens the cyclist's senses as every misstep carries a potential consequence of serious bodily harm. 

The geography of the area in itself can make passage extremely difficult. The steep hills can cause fatigue even for experienced riders as the amount of energy it requires to ascend could quickly sap energy reserves. Tight switchbacks also create a vast difference between the uphill and downhill paths, wherein an unexpected turn in staircases can quickly turn into a ride of terror.

The short story also notes the visibility due to darkness is further impaired by clouds, creating a potential hazard.
