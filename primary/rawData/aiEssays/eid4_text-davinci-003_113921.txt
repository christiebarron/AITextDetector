This is the narrator reflecting on how their determination and hard work will pay off in the future. It reinforces themes of perseverance, resilience, and hope that had been running throughout the story and ending with this thought gives the narrative a feeling of reflection, closure, and optimism. It also serves to remind readers of the cyclical nature of life and suggests that the narrator believes that things will eventually look up for them and they will pass their test. Additionally, the final phrase also ties in with some of the imagery from the beginning of the story (e.g. the geese and the melting snow) to further emphasize the metaphor of cyclical, ever-changing nature of life.
