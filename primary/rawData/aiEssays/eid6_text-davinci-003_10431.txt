The construction of the Empire State Building in 1931 was a monumental feat of engineering. One of the most ambitious aspects of the design was the proposal to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. However, the project encountered a number of obstacles that needed to be overcome in order to make the vision a reality. These are described in detail in “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted.

The primary obstacle that the Empire State Building’s designers had to overcome was the sheer height of the building. At 1,250 feet, it was more than twice as tall as the tallest building of the time. This presented a major challenge in figuring out how the massive airships would be able to maneuver through the city’s airspace to reach the top without endangering the lives of those below and the structural integrity of the building itself.

The Empire State Building’s designers also had to contend with the challenges posed by strong winds that could make it difficult for dirigibles to approach the mooring mast safely. To address this, they had to create mechanisms for the dirigibles to be tethered to the mooring mast in order to keep them steady and avoid the risk of a collision. This was made even more challenging by the fact that the building was located in Manhattan, one of the windiest cities in the United States.

Furthermore, the engineers had to work out how the air
