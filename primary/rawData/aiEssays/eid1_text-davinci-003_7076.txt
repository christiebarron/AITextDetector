In an increasingly digital world, however, libraries are becoming more and more sensitive to the growing demand to censor materials deemed as offensive. The line between censorship and freedom of expression is a difficult one to draw and many problematic materials exist in library collections.

In response to this challenge, I am advocating the use of “selective censorship” in libraries to support a free flow of relevant and accurate information while simultaneously preventing exposure to materials that are offensive. With this system, library patrons have the opportunity to choose materials for their own purposes without being unduly restricted by a blanket ban on materials deemed to be offensive.
