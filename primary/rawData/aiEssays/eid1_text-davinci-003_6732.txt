As the technological world advances, computers are becoming more and more integrated into the lives of people everywhere. There’s no doubt that computers are incredibly beneficial for any number of tasks, ranging from job-related activities to entertainment to staying connected with family and friends. But is the digital age improving our lives in the way that we think it is?

I believe computers have the potential to benefit the lives of individuals – however, it is not always the case. Despite their benefits, computers can have an adverse effect on people in many ways. When not used appropriately, computers can lead to physical health problems from sitting in a chair too long or too frequently, or mental health issues such as addiction, isolation, and depression. It can also limit communication with others, by replacing face-to-face interactions, and limit the amount of physical exercise people get. 

We should be mindful of the amount of time we spend using computers and be sure to get sufficient exercise, communication with others, and breaks from the screen. It is important to see computers as a tool and to limit the use of them, in order to ensure our physical and mental well-being. 

I urge you, the readers, to think about the effects computers have on people. While computers can be an incredible asset, it is essential to remember to balance our use with other important aspects of life such as physical activity, socialization, and introspection.
