One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I tried to speak to my father about his own son's situation. My father stood there staring at me out of the corner of his eye, while me and my friend did our best to look out of his eyes. "Dad, your son's situation is tragic. I would like to express to you that I hope you do get better," he said with a little smile.

In this case, the only hope in all of this is something much bigger that you could ever hope to reach. I hope you realize that this may not be something you can even reach for.

When I received my letters of commendation this morning, I realized it was for a reason. I was hoping that I would have found something. Maybe I could have found something to be grateful about. Maybe I would have found something to be thankful for. I did find love in someone whom I just met and they loved me.

The truth is, people love you. People love you as well as they would love to love another. So I can empathize with you now that I'm so sorry that you have to go through the pain of so many people losing their loved ones in so many very difficult circumstances.

As people, we know that the worst part about life is that those who never receive what is given are given at a very low price as well as the worst part of being alive. It is hard to make those sacrifices
