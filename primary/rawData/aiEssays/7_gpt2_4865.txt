An example of a time someone in my life was patient was an ex-girlfriend of mine who had to be treated with drugs. We'd take things in the morning from her bed and she'd tell them, 'I was reallyhhhhhh…' And she made love to me, which had the opposite effect on her. I made her think, 'I know what I'm doing with I guess', and she'd kind of cry and say 'I don't know. He's totally in love with me.' And then I don't really know where he is coming from, and my brain sort of turns 'I don't know. I don't 'know' anything at all'. And then she says, 'I know', and I feel a big relief…

Do you think a lot of people have difficulty getting their emotions under control?

No, because we can't keep them under control. But I think that's something I see a lot of people do. They just have not learned how to feel and they don't have any sort of sense to express themselves anymore. And I think when you're really caught in the dark, like I was in the middle of this and the only thing that's real in this is something like, 'I'm sorry, but I didn't mean to hurt you. You need to be more carefree. I was in some sort of denial when I opened the door when you saw me and I didn't know what I was talking
