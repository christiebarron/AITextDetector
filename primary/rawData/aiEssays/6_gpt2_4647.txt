The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. On Dec. 22, 1958, the Empire State Legislature held an emergency meeting to consider whether to add an elevator to the Empire State Building. At one point, only 8,000 people attended, but the building still has room for 100,000.

The Assembly had scheduled their meeting, and the event was met by a crowd of 7,000 people.

An elevator was also proposed but declined, but it was deemed more practical to use it to transport the Empire State Building and a new skyscraper near it. A feasibility study on using a dirigible as an elevated transport vehicle was then submitted by Councilman Mike Cramer in November.

After Councilman Cramer accepted the study, construction work continued to be carried out on the Empire State Building until 1965, when it was completed.

Today it has housed the first public elevator to the Empire State Building.

On Dec. 22, 1958, on the morning of the event, the State and Congress met and agreed on a number of issues relating to the Empire State Building, including the building's location in Queens, the future of the building and the future of the current state of New York.

The House Committee on Transportation passed a bill to end the DIA system, which prevents the construction of an elevator in Queens or New York City. The measure passed the House with a vote of 18-5.
