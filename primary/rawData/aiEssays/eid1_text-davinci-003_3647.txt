Dear Editor,

As technology continues to advance, computers play an increasingly important role in almost every facet of our lives. But with this newfound dependence come several serious concerns about their effects on people as a whole.

The impact of computers on people is widely debated. Some people posit that computers are beneficial in that they increase access to information and make daily life easier. However, there is evidence that suggests the opposite – that computers cause emotional isolation, less physical activity, and skills deficits.

From what we’ve seen of the last several years of our society, it is the latter of the two arguments that stands out. For one, as humans interact more and more with computers, there is an observable decrease in the amount of physical activity we do. This sedentary lifestyle can lead to physical health issues, such as heart disease, diabetes, and obesity.

In addition, people’s communication skills are also declining, bringing with it more social isolation and stagnant interpersonal relationships. Studies have also shown that repetitive computer usage can result in decreased spatial reasoning skills – an invaluable skill that is essential for navigating our three-dimensional world.

It is obvious that the effects of our technological advancements should not be overlooked. We must talk frankly about the effects of computers on people and find better ways of utilizing them more responsibly and in moderation. Moving forward, it is essential that we are mindful about how using computers influences our lives.

Sincerely,
