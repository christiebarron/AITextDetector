An example of a time someone in my life was patient was her husband, who had cancer when she was 10 or 11 years old and had been battling pneumonia for six years. During the course of her chemotherapy, she had to start drinking pills like a lot of her older siblings did, which eventually caused her to stop going to school. At 14 she began receiving medication to alleviate the symptoms of chemotherapy. She would take one or two daily capsules that gave her an hour to walk and ten minutes to speak. One day I came home from work and was just eating my lunch, my mom walked into the kitchen and said, "Hey, my dad's at work." I thought she was going crazy. Her dad was at lunch and was taking her to my office for lunch, so my dad started taking me to my office. I thought it was the happiest moment of my life."

The day they met, she developed an anxiety attack and began vomiting a lot. She was going back to work the next day at 1 a.m., and was unable to walk and talk. My mom told me it was the best day of her life, which is how the doctor diagnosed her with cancer.

Over time, my mom started taking her medication to ease her anxiety. She developed headaches, dizziness, and trouble swallowing in the hospital.

As a young woman, my mom was diagnosed with Stage III Hodgkin's disease; however, she never saw the disease again.
