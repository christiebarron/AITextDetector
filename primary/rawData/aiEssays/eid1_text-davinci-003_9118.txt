Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my opinion on the effects computers have on people. In this day and age, computers are becoming evermore ubiquitous, playing an important role in our daily lives. 

At first glance, computers appear to be Game Changers, helping us to become more productive and efficient. However, what people often overlook is the potential health impacts associated with too much time spent in front of the computer screen. 

Negative consequences such as increased eyestrain, neck pain, and poor posture can creep in if we are not careful. Computers can also disrupt motivation and productivity by allowing for frequent distractions and procrastination. 

The key to a safe and productive relationship with computers is to set limits and create boundaries. That means taking regular screen breaks and limiting exposure to blue light. It also means consciously avoiding disruption and maintaining focus on the task at hand.

All in all, computers offer tremendous advantages, but itâ€™s important not to overexert ourselves with too much screen time. I encourage everyone to use caution when it comes to computers and related activities.

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
