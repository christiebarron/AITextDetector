An example of a time someone in my life was patient was about 12 years old when my brother and I were sleeping on the grass at home when one of the officers walked past. He saw his brother coming out with a gun. At one point he started putting on his boots and the gun just went off," he told News 8.

He says he knew the weapon was his and he shot it with his wife's safety vests and saw a gunshot.

Another witness tells News 8 the bullet went straight up, and she says the gun felt more like a gun.

"It felt like a real trigger ball but I think I was more nervous because as soon as it went down, I just kind of felt safe because I can't really do anything. It goes straight up you know what I mean? So I couldn't really feel a thing for it and so I just thought 'oh my God, here he goes to get his wife' and was like 'wow, what the fuck is going on down there.'"

Kerr says the suspect may have been carrying an AR-15.

"I think they have been thinking all these ARs for over a year but there's two more ARs out there that I don't think that he had. They knew it for months. I think we don't know what the gun went down, I don't think anyone was going to do anything stupid."
