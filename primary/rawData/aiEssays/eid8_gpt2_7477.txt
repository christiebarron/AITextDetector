One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I heard her saying that she had just finished her work as a child because she needed to take care of her grandmother after the first week. I heard it all so hard that I could barely sit still. It felt so good to hear this, but I felt a whole lot worse after that. I felt like I was losing a little bit of my connection with the world. I don't know why people should feel sorry after witnessing what they did. I don't want to kill any more humans for not thinking these things are right. I can't hold my tears. I can only hope I am not in another world where I am no longer an utter fucking hypocrite. The only one who has any respect for the lives and souls of these people is my mother. I need to know that in order to truly care for my family a human can only do that which has meant so much to me, and my only other hope is to see more of her every day. I want that to become true to me. We are the ones doing the killing of others. And there is no more chance than I have of ever being able to find out my mother in the future to let me know how she feels. It's not enough. I need to know about this world more to start healing.
