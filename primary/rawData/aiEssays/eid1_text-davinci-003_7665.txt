The ending of Minfong Ho's poem, "Winter Hibiscus," implies that the speaker was using the hibiscus as a metaphor for hope—hope that when spring returns, they will be given a fresh opportunity to take the “test” again, whatever it may be. The poem also implies a sentiment of patience, as the speaker trusts that “when the snows melt and the geese return,” things will become better, as will the opportunity to make a fresh start. In this way, the ending of the poem acts as a reminder to the reader that there will always be a chance for improvement; that difficult times and challenges can be overcome with hope and patience.
