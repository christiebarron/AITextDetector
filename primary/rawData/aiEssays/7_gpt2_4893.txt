An example of a time someone in my life was patient was an 18 year old man who had been through an operation and had been given a drug as a last resort. While he was in the bathroom he noticed an ice cream cup on a pile of ice cream on his way home from work, faithfully serving himself as he and the rest of his family.

He was unaware it was his dad who was going to get his treatment and wanted to find his mother's place on the family. The doctor informed him that his mother had died and that her head had been removed. This left him with absolutely no choice but to get his life back. His father didn't appreciate helping him or the fact that he could go into that room in an attempt to make certain he was going to die, nor needed help from his parents.

Now you know.

What you see here is the story of the father of a young man suffering from dementia. To the rest of us who will be thinking for themselves that he, his mother and his father could have been treated with compassion, decency and respect. As for those from his own family who would be harmed by this same type of situation, to say I could be "treat him" because of his "disgusting" behaviour would be an understatement.

But, at least now, you know what I mean.

What I do not mean is that my family cannot be treated as I could. As I said earlier
