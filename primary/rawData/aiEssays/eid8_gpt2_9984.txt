One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was 10 years old. I was so proud to learn that she thought this was the coolest thing she had ever done. Even though I wanted to go on a "walk with my sister to the beach" thing at my school, I was not interested because I didn't want to be a "lady." I was more interested in what she would say to me once they both had their clothes pulled back or something.

For me, she is so cool and so kind. I am such a different person when I was 3 years old than I am now. She is such an amazing woman.
