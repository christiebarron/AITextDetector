The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho reflects the theme of hope and transformation. The protagonist sees the beautiful winter hibiscus as a symbol of hope. The narrator acknowledges the difficulty of the test they have to take, but takes comfort in the idea that its outcome will be different when the snows melt, the geese return, and the hibiscus is in full bloom. This idea of renewal mirrors the protagonist's growth and transformation as they grapple with the challenges presented by the test and the adversities of life. The ending gives readers a sense of hope that, just like the winter hibiscus, the protagonist can find beauty and growth even in difficult times.
