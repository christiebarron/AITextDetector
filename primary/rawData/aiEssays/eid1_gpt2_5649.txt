Computers have many effects on people. That is, from improving their performance to creating more jobs, which in turn leads to further wealth being created. So while I think this is interesting, while some economists would like to emphasize economic rationality, most economists agree that economic rationality isn't at all what I want it to be, which is why our economic system fundamentally creates money. In fact, as I write this I'm starting to get a bit annoyed by economists because I'm being a bit more intellectual. So, at a fundamental level, yes, there aren't many scientists who understand that one of the three main goals of the economic system is to create more things: increase productivity, improve wages, make goods smaller and more people are productive. The main problems have been addressed by other studies that have shown that the economics of scarcity of jobs means that we have to replace people by someone else.
