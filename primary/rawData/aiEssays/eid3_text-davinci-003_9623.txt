The setting of 'Rough Road Ahead' by Joe Kurmaski is highly relevant to the story and plays a considerable role in how it affects the cyclist. The most notable feature of the setting is the rough terrain that the cyclist encounters. The road is severely bumpy, filled with holes and other hazards, making the task of cycling much more difficult. The landscape itself is very remote and desolate - it is clear that the cyclist is miles away from civilization and has no one to turn to in the event of an accident or breakdown. 

The physical environment of the ride also takes an emotional toll on the cyclist. The extreme loneliness of the road raises feelings of fear and unease about the journey, and makes the cyclist feel very isolated. The long, hard roads make the cyclists focus on the task at hand and keep them alert and alert to any potential hazards. In the end, this strong focus is what allows the cyclist to endure the grueling ride.
