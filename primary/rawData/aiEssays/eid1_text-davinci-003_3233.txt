I am writing to bring to your attention the effects computers can have on people, and to state my opinion on why using computers can be beneficial.

When discussing the effects of computers, it is important to note that computers are vital for modern life. From performing simple tasks like keeping track of your finances or multi-billion-dollar systems that enable businesses to run more effectively, computers are ubiquitous. They are used in almost every field whether it be business, education, communication, or entertainment.

When discussing positive effects of computers, it is important to recognize the way computers have made our lives easier. Everything from communication to learning is easier with computers. Learning can now happen at the click of a button, and knowledge can be shared around the world.
