The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is not a secret, but it has been shared with the world for a long time.

The novel follows the lives of Emma and her boyfriend Andrew, from the outset, to the tragic end, when they discover there's a girl in their lives who is missing and their family is struggling for survival.

In their attempt to survive, Emma is sent to the "Houses of the Damned" but they're overwhelmed by the love of their lives, especially a girl who's been missing from their home town for almost a year, and who, like Andrew, would like to be part of their family.
