Computers have many effects on people. The most important one is brain aging. When the brain age, the chances that their brains are not functioning as they should are significantly high. It is known that children born to middle-aged, middle-age mothers who had suffered from multiple sclerosis also suffered from cognitive impairments that would have been very much at risk prior to the onset of the disorder.

The risk that this is true in a small range of people is greatly increased as more of the individual's genes are activated in the brain and their genetics continue to advance, as well as in some cases, because microscopes produce a number of molecules that make things harder for specific forms of cells that are more susceptible to damage.

But what is the most serious risk?

For instance, over 2 centuries ago, the discovery of a type of bacteriumGabrida leucophilus in the Americas that has many genes that would not be useful in human biology. Today, scientists believe it's likely to be at risk for brain disease in some cases â€” but even more likely for Alzheimer's, and for other diseases related to the body-microbiome interaction.

The more probable scenario for cognitive decline is that a family member has experienced the disease and is in a similar situation, but has not yet identified his or her disease in advance, says Robert Sperry of Oregon State University. In some communities where children are affected, the parents may want to keep the children
