An example of a time someone in my life was patient was at home. It was dark early, and it was like the heat was killing or maybe even heating out."

In April 2011, I received an open letter from a mother of a 4-year-old daughter who would now be diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer.

By that time, he had graduated from Stanford Medicine and I was working on a long-term treatment study.

My office colleague and I worked together for the day and after about 45 minutes he spoke to me and we decided he'd only want to walk.

"Do things like this on a normal day when you can be yourself," he said

We were laughing and we stopped talking and instead walked for an hour or two.

We sat in silence and tried not to think about my sick daughter. What he told me was that he had a "very good prognosis," and that I was just the kind of person to have a difficult time with her.

His comment was that "she could survive." My colleague looked at her incredulously, but I couldn't see what could be the cause. We were laughing and we stopped talking and instead walked for an hour or two.

I was stunned by how quickly he told himself and his colleague that he was taking a more serious approach. "My prognosis is much better now," he said. "And I know I can have cancer again, too."
