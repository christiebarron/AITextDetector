The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Theaying that this would be one of the reasons they were denied the license to build the building, they were unable to enter the building. For the building's construction, some people suggested that the dome might have been necessary, and others suggested that the dome did not even exist. Some of them had other theories for why the dome might not exist. According to the historian, the architects were afraid to talk about it, but they did try the unusual way that once they discovered the dome, they made plans to go look through it. Some people, after seeing the dome through a telescope, tried the more practical method and tried to look through it. On July 14, 1623, Charles Wilton, governor of the territory in England, informed his cabinet that he considered the dome "irreconcilable" with the Empire's use of dirigibles. Wilton said he had "no hesitation in the opinion" of him to build the building on the part of the church of St. James of Aragon. However, the cathedral-style dome would allow some of the building's decorative elements to stand. As a result, the building now consists mainly of a concrete structure, with its exterior covered by a canopy.
