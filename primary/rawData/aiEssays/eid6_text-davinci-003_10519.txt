The builders of the Empire State Building faced a variety of obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at its peak. As detailed in “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, these challenges primarily stemmed from the building’s architecture and its location in the heart of Manhattan.

One of the most pressing difficulties in permitting dirigible docking was the height of the building. At 1,454 feet, the Empire State Building was – and still is – the world’s tallest building and the idea of allowing dirigibles to access the uppermost portion presented a variety of challenges. Primarily, the sheer height of the building would have placed a dramatic strain on the airships’ engines, which would have been forced to work harder as they attempted to achieve the building’s upper-most heights. This would likely have placed the payloads the dirigibles were carrying at greater risk of becoming damaged due to a combination of turbulence, loss of power, and the height at which the airships would have been operating.

Additionally, there were concerns around the airship pilots’ ability to safely navigate the congested and narrow Manhattan skyways during their approach to the building. The pilots would have needed to navigate their way through busy metropolitan airspace, and the risk of an accident – particularly if the airships were carrying passengers and freight – remained considerable. As such, the skill of the pilots and the reliability of the engines
