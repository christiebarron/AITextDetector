The building of the Empire State Building and the inclusion of a mooring mast to allow dirigibles (or airships) to dock presented a number of significant obstacles. One of the main challenges was the size and complexity of the mooring mast: to effectively accommodate large dirigibles, the mast had to be made of large and heavy steel sections, fastened with ninety thousand rivets. Furthermore, the mast had to include two pneumatic cushions surrounded by netting, which could each support the weight of an entire airship. 

Then, it was necessary to figure out how to attach the mooring mast to the building. To do this, the builders had to design a framework of steel beams to support the mooring mast, and devise a system of cables and winches to keep the mast steady when an airship was docked. The framework, which was supposed to hold the mast upright and steady, had to be able to withstand the powerful winds that sometimes buffeted the Empire State Building in New York City. 

The final obstacle was how to secure the mooring mast and framework to the roof of the Empire State Building itself. This process required a complex system of anchors, bolts and brackets to be installed in special holes in the roof â€“ a feat that was all the more difficult considering that the mooring mast weighed more than ten tons. 

Ultimately, these obstacles were overcome in record time; by
