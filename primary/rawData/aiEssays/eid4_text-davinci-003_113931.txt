At the end of the story, Ho suggests that a feeling of optimism is necessary to overcome fear and resistance to change. The protagonist has used her inner strength to make an important change in her life, which she has been avoiding, by standing up for herself in a time of conflict. By referring to the things that will return in the spring, Ho implies that the protagonist will also have the strength to face her challenge when it arrives. She has learned that she must take risks in order to live a fulfilling life, and views the upcoming challenge as a chance for growth rather than something that will hold her back. The hopeful ending helps to demonstrate resilience and the power of positive thinking.
