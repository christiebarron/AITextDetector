Dear [Name of Newspaper],

I am writing to share my opinion on the effects computers have on people with your readers. In my opinion, computers have had a positive effect on people as they have enabled us to become more connected, innovative, and productive than ever before.

In today's technologically-driven world, computers have enabled us to communicate with anyone, anywhere, and anytime. Through the internet and various applications, people can connect with unknown people and build collaborations and networks with them. The possibilities of global collaboration and communication have opened up a variety of opportunities and made us more productive.

The invention of computers has also enhanced our ability to solve problems quickly. Thanks to advances in computer technology, problems can be solved with the power of algorithms in a fraction of the time compared to before. This increased level of efficiency allows us to become more innovative and use our limited resources more effectively.

Finally, computers have allowed us to access a wealth of information and knowledge at the click of a button, increasing our understanding of both traditional and new topics. Whether it is for school or work purposes, computers allow us to draw from data and knowledge from all over the world, thereby making us global citizens. 

In conclusion, computers have enabled us to become more connected, innovative, and productive. Therefore, I believe that computers are an asset that can positively impact our lives.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
