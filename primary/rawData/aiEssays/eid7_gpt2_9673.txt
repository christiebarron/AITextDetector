An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was at the bar after work. I never heard my name called, and it felt kind of lonely. I was just really sick when I walked in the bar.

How did we go about being patient?

After we finished talking at the bar the next morning, I asked if we could make breakfast. When everyone was finished, I offered them a nice plate to have for lunch. My mom would drive them over to me. I've talked to some of the friends who tried to pull me off the bus.

How did you go about making it work out?

There had been some good work out for us. We were in great shape and would be back in business by the time we walked into town.

Can I say more about how successful or how successful you were doing before this?

The first year I worked at The Pub as your manager we were able to take care of quite a few of our customers. We were only looking at 2, so it didn't take long to grow us, especially when you come from a business that was doing that well. At one point, we paid $9,000 for an average day-to-day business, inDb.

But then we realized that we had put Seems Like Work to good use. InDb, we took orders from clients with a lot of work to fill up inventory and order for their order
