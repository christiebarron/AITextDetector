Dear Editor:

I am writing to provide my opinion on the effects computers have on people. As technology increasingly advances, people are more and more reliant on computers to complete daily tasks.

For starters, computers have made work easier and more efficient. By automating jobs, computers allow us to save time and money. This makes companies more productive and efficient. In fact, many companies operate entirely online, allowing them to employ remote workers and increase profits.

Another advantage is that computers provide us with a useful platform to access information. We can easily search for news, watch videos, and purchase products with just a few clicks. Computers also offer entertainment, with the ability to play video games or watch movies. 

However, this reliance also poses various risks. Many people are concerned that computers impairs the ability to think critically and independently. We may become too reliant on the device to conduct research and think deeply. We can also become addicted to technology, leading to mental health issues. 

Overall, I believe that the benefits of computers outweigh the risks. By utilizing computers, we can gain access to a wealth of information and enhance our work efficiency. However, we must also be aware that too much reliance in technology can be detrimental.

Thank you for considering my opinion.

Sincerely,
[Your name]
