Dear Editor,

As technology advances, computers are becoming an integral part of our everyday lives. With this, it is important to consider their effects on our society. While some people say that computers can be beneficial, I believe that computers have a negative effect on people. 

First, computers can disconnect us from the world around us. Instead of interacting with people in our community, we may find ourselves spending hours in front of a computer screen. This can reduce our social skills and prevent us from forming meaningful relationships with others. 

Second, computers can also lead to inactivity. When we spend long periods of time in front of a computer, we may be tempted to skip physical activities like going outside or playing sports. This can lead to an unhealthy lifestyle and decrease our life expectancy. 

Finally, computers can also promote dangerous behaviors, such as addiction and cyberbullying. People who are exposed to computers for too long may become less responsible and more prone to digitally harass others without understanding the consequences. 

In conclusion, I believe that computers can have a detrimental effect on our society. We should use computers responsibly and only in moderation in order to prevent these negative outcomes. I hope that I have convinced you of the dangers of overusing computers. 

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
