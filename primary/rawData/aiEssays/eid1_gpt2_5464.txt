Computers have many effects on people.

One big one is the need for complex computer programs that can only be achieved by humans.

The biggest of these is the complexity of programming. A few hundred years ago, if the world had no computers, there would be problems if it did not have simple programming concepts. Modern computers would not have any complex programming concepts because such concepts are so popular in science fiction.

Nowadays, computers are far more complex. Since we don't have very good at writing complex complex programs, computer programming is still very difficult.

When I tried to do some basic computer programming in high school, I was too exhausted from doing my homework.

I took an exam at middle grade that told me to write simple programs. I did so easily and I didn't even have to learn that much computer programming.

In the computer world, this is no surprise: computers are used to solve complex problems. They don't need you to program on your own. This kind of programming is quite important for both programmers and students.

Let's go over some simple examples. For example, look at another example called "A simple program which is impossible to solve". Just because it is impossible that you can write it does not mean that it is impossible. It is even possible that it could be completely possible to solve any problem. (Even if you couldn't. The whole thing would be called "The Big Idea").
