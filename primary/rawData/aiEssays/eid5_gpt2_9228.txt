The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is, of course, somewhat surprising. If you've read it now and are a keen journalist then you'll instantly know that these characters are some of the smartest, most fascinating and most interesting stories you've read in your life. In all honesty, perhaps I would have taken a liking to that book a second time. But once you have read it, it's not all that confusing and it's not so big a deal.

The story starts with the discovery that many people do not know about the Holocaust, and we're not the only ones. And in that sense, The Holocaust is an essential history lesson and this is another story about how we came to be at war - that we have lived through many different stages of being in the world and can feel the changes coming. And it's also about how other people come to understand us even if they didn't live at all.

So what sort of story do you want to tell to your readers?

A story is a series of conversations, for sure. But these conversations have to be very powerful, they have to be told with passion, they have to be very personal. And it has to involve a lot of emotion, and it has to have some real character. And these conversations must do that with a great variety of people because you don't want to have too much.
