Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. It is more like 'Onward', it is more about Thunder in an area than Thunder at a distance.

Onwards in many ways, the setting sets itself apart to allow the cyclist to find and overtake some of the great roads (especially in North London) for the better. This means both in terms of being 'easy' and 'tough' along the way.

Another important element about 'Rough Road Ahead' is its location (or 'Circles' in the case of Stirling). Stalling out in a CIRCLE is a very serious mistake in terms of the cycling environment at that time of day and is something you may not want to do again as a kid. Having set off from a place that would normally be very quiet, you find yourself going off the crescendo of not being able to enjoy the roads.

So in other words the setting for 'Rough Road Ahead' has a role in how the cyclist works. It is different from places like North London to where you tend to find the same things done elsewhere from an aesthetic or physical viewpoint.
