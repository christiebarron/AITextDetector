The narrator of the poem, a young girl, is reflecting on her inability to focus on her math test due to her interest in the hibiscus bush outside her window. She wishes to come back to the hibiscus bush in the spring so that she can take the test again and let her curiosity be her teacher until then. The ending of the poem suggests that the narrator has hope that the coming of spring will bring with it new possibilities, and she is optimistic to begin again. The poem serves as a metaphor for the universal need for restorative moments, when the beauty of nature can help refocus and rejuvenate the soul.
