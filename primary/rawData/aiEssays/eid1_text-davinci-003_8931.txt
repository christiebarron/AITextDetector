Dear Editor,

I am writing in response to the ongoing discussion around the impact computers have had on society. It is true that computer technology has provided us with great comforts and conveniences. But I believe there are significant drawbacks on the people.

For starters, having access to computers can be immensely distracting for people, as the internet is awash with various enticing or harmful content that can derail a personâ€™s productivity. This not only affects people's health and academic or professional performance, but it can also rob them of their interpersonal experiences, leading to feelings of loneliness and depression.

Moreover, computers cannot replace human creativity and intellect. Although computers can be programmed to do great things, they cannot be expected to replace the uniquely human qualities of compassion and creativity. This is why I believe computers should be used sparingly and with caution. They should also be seen as tools and, where appropriate, be used to enhance human life and potentially transform it.

Lastly, the reliance on computers might make people vulnerable to cyber-attacks. We should therefore strive to educate people about the risks associated with computers, and ensure that they can protect themselves. Cyber-security should never be taken lightly.

In conclusion, computer technology is a valuable asset, but it should not be taken for granted. We should be aware of the potential drawbacks that can arise from using computers.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
