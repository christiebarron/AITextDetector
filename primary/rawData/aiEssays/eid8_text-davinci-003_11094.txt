I was sitting in my friend's living room one night, chatting with his family. It was the sort of conversation that had no real direction, and we all just kind of went with it. We were each sharing a funny story or a silly joke here and there, and the atmosphere was light. Then, out of nowhere, my friend's mom said something so outrageously funny, we all started laughing hysterically. We were laughing so hard that tears were streaming down all of our faces. We laughed until it didn't even feel like any time had passed, and I couldn't help but take notice of the closeness I felt between all of us in that moment. I had known these people for a long time, but that particular encounter filled the room with an almost electric energy. Even though it felt like minutes had passed, it had only been seconds, but those moments of shared laughter felt like they had connected us in a way beyond words. In that moment, I was really struck by how laughter had bridged the gap between all of us in a beautiful way.
