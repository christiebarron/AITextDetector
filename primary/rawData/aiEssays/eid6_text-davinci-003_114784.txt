The construction of the Empire State Building marked a significant milestone in the advancement of modern architecture, particularly with its large-scale dare to be the world’s tallest building. The bold ambition of the building’s designers even led to briefly considering installing a docking station for dirigibles atop the building’s roof. This would have been a monumental feat, as it would have been a challenge to build a landing mast and mooring system that could withstand high winds and keep what would be a fully loaded airship from crashing.

In the book The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, this project is explored in great detail. According to the book, such a task would be an incredibly ambitious undertaking that would likely take years of effort, at a considerable expense. The mast itself would have to weigh hundreds of tons and measure almost 800 feet tall, extending above the roof of the building. What’s more, the mast had to be made of covered wire to prevent chafing, which would in turn require even more strength and stability. Also, the design needed to accommodate different sizes and weights of dirigibles, including the more prevalent passenger airships of the time.

Constructing the mooring mast would be difficult enough, but it had to also be integrated into the building’s existing structure. This meant changing the building’s foundation, making alterations to the roof, reinforcing the walls, and ensuring
