The ending of the poem Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho serves as a hopeful reminder that through hard work and determination, one can succeed. The speaker was unable to pass an important test and has used the blooming of the hibiscus in the spring as a symbol for the time when they will try again and persevere. This metaphor implies that if there is passion and effort put forth, a person can achieve their goals, even if they were not successful the first time around. The poem also emphasizes the power of nature, changing seasons, and the cycles of life and death. The return of the geese and the melting of the snow are not only symbols of hope for the speaker, but also evidence of the vitality and beauty found in nature and the world around us.
