In Joe Kurmaski’s poem “Rough Road Ahead”, the features of the setting play an important role in the cyclist’s journey and affects them in several ways.

The cyclist is described as ascending a hill, with “jagged rocks,” and “a steep grade.” The physical obstacles of the hill and rocks increase the difficulty of the cyclist’s journey. The cyclist’s strength and endurance are tested as they power through the strenuous uphill climb, their “hands and feet [aching] in perfect harmony.” In addition, the dark colour of the sky and lack of stars foreshadow that the cyclist may have an unpleasant experience ahead. 

The atmosphere of the poem is also affecting the cyclist. The wind is described as “biting and cold,” which can be uncomfortable and tiring to ride into, especially after the cyclist has already began to tire due to their climb. The cyclist has also been journeying for “many miles” already, and the wind may serve to remind them of the long road they’ve already navigated, and perhaps of the long journey that still lies ahead. The wind also began “whistle[ing] a lullaby of miles,” which may serve to comfort the cyclist, reminding them of the miles they’ve conquered.
