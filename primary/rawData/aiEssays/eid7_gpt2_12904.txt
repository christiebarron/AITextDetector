An example of a time someone in my life was patient was with friends. When our home was in a flood, they were on a search party with a young boy on his shoulders. They would call the child as they got off the boat and leave him on and on, and when the boat had left the scene, their boat suddenly came out of the water and they followed it up with some of the other students.

These days, I keep coming back to that kind of story of the people who did what they did, of the students who went overboard, and the children who went out in the ocean with their lives at stake, and it's true that my own life sometimes goes off at the seams, too. The things like that may give a hard edge roasted in some people's subconscious. After all, it's that kind of life that is so traumatic to those people.

You were the first to call the ship, of course!

You don't tell us what was going on in the boat or how I arrived there.

I don't remember. I mean, I'm sure you had a good experience. It's the best we'll ever have. It's all so long â€” even if you don't know yourself, and we only have this memory from my first time here. We never thought of it as anything special, and for a long time I couldn't say the same about my boat being one of the things you saw last time.
