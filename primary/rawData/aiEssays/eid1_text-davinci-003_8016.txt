The Empire State Building, the tallest building in the world for many years, was constructed in the early 1930s as a destination for both traditional airplanes and airships—or dirigibles—to dock. However, despite the ambitious intent of the builders, allowing the safe, efficient docking of these dirigibles posed a significant challenge that would test the ingenuity of even the most innovative engineers.

The main issue standing in the way was creating an accessible way for ships to dock safely and securely. A traditional system of harnesses would not be usable, as such a system creates too much drag that could restrict the airship's manoeuvrability. To address this issue, engineer and designer Karl Arnstein—who was head of engineering for the world-famous dirigible manufacturer the Zeppelin Company—was hired to design a mooring system that could be used for the airships. His solution was the mooring mast.

The mooring mast was a tall steel tower attached to the Empire State Building that provided the necessary support for the airships to dock safe and securely. Crucially, this mast was designed to support the weight of the airships, but also to be flexible and move with the airships should they become caught in the wind – providing stability and flexibility as well as eliminating all of the extra drag. This mast was also equipped with a series of pulleys and hooks that allowed for the lines from the airship to be connected and held safely in
