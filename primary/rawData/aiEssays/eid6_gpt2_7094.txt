The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

The original Empire State Building was one of the first in the Union with the New York City Archiving Association (which later renamed the building the Archival Building), and it was built under the direction of then Mayor Abraham Lincoln for the Empire State Building. It is listed in the American Museum of Natural History and has many interesting features.

One of the most significant features is the Empire State Building having been designed by a young American architect, Andrew Jackson, and had its first meeting with construction crews starting in 1922 when a tunnel led up the center steps into the tower, providing an important building block for the city to build a massive new airport and skyscraper. Jackson's own company of architects, The Rockefeller Brothers, began making dirigibles during the Great Depression until the end of the decade.

One of the most intriguing features of the Empire State Building is the fact that the building is based on the original stone roofing used in its design during the construction of the US-Mexico border wall in 1869.

For this reason, during the development of the Empire State Building, the building was heavily modified to make it even more of an original building built on an exact copy of the original stone roofing.
