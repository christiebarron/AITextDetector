I remember the first time I met my best friend. We were studying together in university and we seemed to instantly click. We were studying about theories of microorganisms and microbes at the time and the lecture was incredibly dry. It was hard to stay focused and motivated. 

But then my best friend said something that made us both laugh. It was a such a small comment but it completely changed the mood of the room. We instantly bonded over that moment, and we've been best friends ever since.

We joke around and laugh all the time now, even when our conversations don't seem to make sense. It's like we have our own inside jokes and our laughter will just take over anytime, anywhere. 

It's amazing to have a best friend to share that special kind of laughter with. No matter how crazy life's been for the both of us, we always know that a shared moment of laughter will make it a bit better.
