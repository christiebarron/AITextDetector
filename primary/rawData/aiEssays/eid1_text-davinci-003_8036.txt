The Empire State Building was designed with the capability to allow dirigibles to dock at the top. Dirigibles—or airships—were large helium or hydrogen-filled balloons equipped with propulsion systems, control systems, and gondolas, used for a variety of purposes. The desire to accommodate these lighter-than-air vessels in the sky was ambitious, and builders encountered a variety of obstacles in their effort to enable dirigibles to dock at the top of the building.

The first obstacle the builders faced was the design of the Empire State Building itself. At the time of the building’s construction, there had to be a way to connect the massive steel frame in order to make a mooring mast—an enormous steel beam that could support the dirigible’s weight—tall enough to support an airship. The mast had to be lightweight enough to reach high above the roof of the building, yet strong enough to remain upright and retain the tremendous weight of an airship. After considering the material options and settling on steel, the team had to devise a design that could handle the weight of the airship without destabilizing the building.

The second obstacle the builders faced was the cost of the mooring mast and its installation. To build and install such an expansive, complex structure required a significant investment. Aside from the costs, the builders had to make sure the mast and its accessories would remain compliant with the regulations from the aviation authority
