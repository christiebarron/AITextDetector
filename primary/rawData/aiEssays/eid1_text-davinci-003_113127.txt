Dear Editor,

I am writing in response to your latest article regarding the effects computers have on people. As someone who, like many others, has grown up with computers, I strongly believe that while certain elements of the digital world can be damaging, the benefits computers bring far outweigh the negative consequences. 

From my perspective, computers have enabled people to become more productive and efficient in many aspects of life. By doing so, computer technology has had a positive influence on the economy, and it is responsible for most of the major breakthroughs taking place in science and medicine. Additionally, computer technology has had a tremendous impact on the way people learn and communicate with each other, which has allowed us to belong to an ever more connected global society.

Of course, computers can also have negative effects on people. Excessive use can lead to a sedentary lifestyle which, in turn, can cause serious health problems. Likewise, too much time engaged with the digital world can lead to the neglect of important relationships, withdrawal from work and other activities, and enhanced feelings of isolation. 

These negative effects, however, should be addressed at an individual level, not by curbing the use of computer technology as a whole. Indeed, when used in moderation, computers can be a major resource for enhancing human lives. Therefore, instead of abandoning computers and the digital world in its entirety, we should use this technology to its full potential and educate people about how to make correct use
