Libraries are a vital part of the educational journey of any individual, but with that comes the responsibility to provide materials that are appropriate for all members of our community. Censorship plays an important role in ensuring this responsibility.

The books, music, movies, and magazines that are found in public libraries are available to the public, which means that the possibility of them being offensive is a very real one. As such, libraries have a duty to provide a safe and appropriate space for all members of our community of all ages. It is important to recognize that offensive materials can include not only those that promote violence or hate speech, but that contain explicit or inappropriate content that may lead to triggering reactions. 

Traditional censorship has been applied to the content of public libraries since their inception. By limiting the availability of certain books or other materials, libraries can create an atmosphere of safety and respect. Content that could be potentially harmful to some members of our society, like those with mental health issues, should be treated with caution. With that responsibility of protection comes the challenge of ensuring that certain materials are still made available to members of the community who may wish to access them. It is important that libraries ensure that any censored materials are made available at a different institution, such as a college library, where individuals over 18 are able to access them.

Overall, libraries must reach a balance between protecting the needs of the wider community and the rights of individuals to access materials of their own choosing
