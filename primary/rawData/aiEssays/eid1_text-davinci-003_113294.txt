Dear Editor,

I’d like to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people today. With advancements in technology, computers have become an increasingly important part of our everyday lives. While computers can certainly make our lives easier and more efficient, I believe they also can cause serious damage to our lives and wellbeing.

First of all, computers can be a major distraction from enjoying the here and now. We can be so focused on staying up-to-date with the news or responding to emails that we end up missing out on important conversations and events around us. Additionally, they can be incredibly addictive. If we’re not careful, we can become consumed by social media, and even succumb to cyberbullying, an issue that has been steadily on the rise.

Furthermore, computers can contribute to poor physical health, due to the lack of exercise that comes with prolonged use. Research has shown that staring at a screen for extended hours can cause vision problems, as well as neck and shoulder pain. 

If used with caution, computers can be great tools for work and recreation. But it's important to not let computers become a crutch for our relationships and physical health. Therefore, I strongly believe that people should limit their computer use and focus on real-life activities. 

I hope this letter has helped readers understand the potential adverse effects of computer usage and convinced them to use them in moderation.

Sincerely,
