The idea of building a skyscraper that enabled dirigibles to dock on its roof was first proposed for the Empire State Building in the late 1920s. This pioneering idea, which had never been implemented before, presented a number of obstacles that had to be overcome. 

One of the chief obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the challenge of safely attaching the massive airships to the roof. Dirigibles typically used a mooring mast to secure themselves in the air, so the builders realized that the only way to successfully achieve a docking was to construct a mooring mast on the roof. However, the sheer size and weight of dirigibles meant that the existing mast designs were not suitable. It was necessary to develop an innovative mooring mast system that could hold the weight of the airship while also protecting the building itself from damage.

Another challenge the builders faced was dealing with windy conditions. Dirigibles needed a large open space to dock, but the roof of the Empire State Building was not wide enough to accommodate them. This meant that the existing mooring mast designs had to be adapted to use cables that could be extended to provide a natural windbreak, allowing the airships to anchor safely. In addition, the cables had to be designed in a way that would not impede the movements of the airships when they were docking.

Finally, the builders had to consider the safety of the passengers and crew of the
