These uneven conditions make it difficult for the cyclist to keep her balance and momentum. Additionally, it exposes her to possible injury if she is not careful with her bike. 

The third feature of the setting is the mountains that can be seen in the distance. Even though the cyclist can't even think of reaching them, the sight of them serves as a reminder of her goal and keeps her from giving up. Despite the rough conditions of the road, she takes encouragement from the prospect of one day summiting them.
