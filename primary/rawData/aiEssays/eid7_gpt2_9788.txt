An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my niece from Michigan who said hello and asked if she wanted to play a game. She seemed surprised to find out there was one game out and she wanted to play it. So when my niece came home from school, she said to myself "Is there something on the way?" I said, "Well, yes." So, she said if she had any questions and we got her to join us, then how could we put together that?

The second time in my life would have been the very first time I got into this game. I've tried to follow my uncle, my aunt and my cousins and friends across that town before. On the way my uncle had my brother-in-law turn round to ask where they were from and it was a lovely place:


My uncle, my aunt and my cousin walked over and he explained where we came from. So, they came into our house and I said, "What are you doing here?" My aunt turned around and said, "Who are you and where are you from?" so I went into the attic, I ran out and had a little game of it and my aunt and my cousin pulled a chair, I came out and ran to his house and it was in its original design by his brother. For a while, I figured that he was looking in his window and he's looking at me and saying, "Look, my brother! Look!"
