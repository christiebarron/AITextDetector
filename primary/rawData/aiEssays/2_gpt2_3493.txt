I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is one of the root causes of the proliferation of pornography. As we have noted previously here and elsewhere, for example, the Library of Congress currently has 100,000 pornographic publications available for download – over 100% of which are from pornography. For some, all this has been a result of the proliferation of video games or'media devices' – both of which are a source of pornography.

It is therefore my view that these new censorship practices are not only damaging to students reading books on the Internet and in their homes, but can be an essential part of the ongoing censorship of the library. In spite of the efforts of libraries and other institutions to create this kind of community based online communication, they have not gone far enough. Many libraries are also still being bullied in their attempts to do the right things for their users but we have seen some very clear examples, for example the attempts to force people to stop and question pornography in public through social media, to stop people from reading porn on school computers or the internet. The problem is not only that the proliferation of pornography does not only make people less sensitive to online interaction but also it takes too much time and expertise. The problem is also based on lack of literacy, which is exacerbated by the limited information available for individuals to look out for in the wilds and mountains. I believe this will prove a major source of problems for our libraries as they lack effective methods of collecting information about those we may target
