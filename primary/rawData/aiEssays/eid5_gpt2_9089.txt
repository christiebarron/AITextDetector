The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is so intense that, upon first reading, I'm tempted to take her at her word about the harsh world she encounters in the book. Her character describes how she was "showed her face" and the cold stares and murmurs she receives. The intensity of the book is also felt in the scenes where she interacts with others and sometimes she is almost to herself - just imagine watching a television or watching music while she is writing her book. Her mood when she tells jokes – and what she thinks of her fellow readers – is so deep, so deep that, more than a year and a half have passed since I was first writing her book. She doesn't feel a sense of accomplishment, a sudden need to prove oneself. A reader who has spent a lifetime thinking about the world outside of their own lives and the world of their friends often thinks of her as such, too, even though it is very hard to imagine these things in her imagination. This is the reality that many people encounter as they come into contact with the world outside of their own lives, or think about the world in their own minds. They often think that they are in control of their own thoughts, their own problems, their own lives; these are the only things that are within their grasp. This book is as much her writing as her characters; the world she goes to and fro with is filled with life as well as feelings and emotions.
