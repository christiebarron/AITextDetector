The Empire State Building, located in the heart of New York City, was built from 1930 to 1931 as the world's tallest building. While the building was being constructed, there were ambitious plans to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock at the roof. However, the builders faced numerous challenges that would make this feat difficult to achieve.

The most significant obstacle was the size and weight of a dirigible. While lighter than a traditional airplane, a full-sized dirigible was still large and heavy, and the designers of the Empire State Building had to take into account the stress an airship would put on the building's frame. Dirigibles were also dependent on mooring masts, or poles, to secure them in place while docked. Since the roof of the Empire State Building was already loaded with a tall broadcasting antenna and a water tower, there was little space for a mooring mast.

Furthermore, the mooring masts of the time were inadequate for steady and secure docking. Various mooring mast designs were proposed, but none of them could be proven effective. Marcia Amidon Lüsted, author of The Mooring Mast, noted that in most cases, “the wind pressure from an airship of that size would be enough to topple even the strongest of mooring masts.” 

The designers of the Empire State Building also had to consider the weather conditions in New York
