I was in the gym, looking forward to an hour of focussed exercise. I was about to begin my push ups when a group of people walked in. To my dismay, they were wearing noisy conversation and loudly playing music on their phones. As I looked around, I saw that other people in the gym were starting to get frustrated; their expressions of annoyance were quite clear.
I was tempted to tell them to keep down the noise, but I reminded myself to stay patient. I took some deep breaths and refocused on my exercise.

Eventually, the group decided to leave and I finished my workout in a peaceful atmosphere. I was proud of myself for not reacting in the heat of the moment. I knew that my patience was rewarded with a better atmosphere and a successful workout.
