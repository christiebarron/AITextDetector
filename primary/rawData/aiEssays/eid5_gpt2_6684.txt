The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is'

It is not what she did that prompted Ms Trump to publicly question her patriotism.

She was simply doing what she liked to do - and she was proud to be who she was.

Ms Trump's personal lives and work as a celebrity businessman have been largely insulated from public view, but one of the more sensitive conversations she had about Trump, who was born in New York to an undocumented mother, is her childhood memories.

Before she ran for president in 2016, Ms Trump was a regular on the New York Daily News talk show, whose weekly coverage of President Trump's early days in office was widely regarded as a major reason for Mr Trump's rise.

Mrs Trump also revealed to MSNBC's Joe Scarborough that a man who was raised by immigrants tried to get her to run for president without telling her.

"He said he'd seen the girl on the TV show, and asked her who they were - she said she didn't know - she didn't even know he wanted to beat her, he thought she was the winnercemic mother-of-two who'd come to America and had lived there so long," she recalled.

"And of course there was a little bit of resentment around that. And this was after we had a debate. He knew, and after the campaign, he said he was very annoyed, he felt something bad was happening about him, but very little remorse."
