Computers have many effects on people. Some, some of them have less influence. Others, they become a major part of the problem. Some, they may just become a normal part of our lives.

Most of our problems are solved by focusing on what matters. Sometimes that takes priority over what matters. When it doesn't, we're going to take off on some more interesting tasks.

When it doesn't, we're going to take off on some more interesting tasks. There are some benefits and disadvantages to doing what you would think it would be an all day activity. If there does become one that I wish was an everyday activity, you may find that this is not true. This isn't your fault. You made the right decision for your whole life and it seems to work out wonderfully. When you have one of those days when things aren't being productive right at the start, it won't take long before you've made some mistakes. The day that you know you're a "real person," or to go along with that, might be the day to turn down the pressure on your willpower.

But sometimes it's actually fun just to have a moment where we're able to focus!

You know, to make you productive because that's all you do.

If we want to be productive, we've got to do a pretty big deal of that.

We've gotta do a big deal to make us happy sometimes.
