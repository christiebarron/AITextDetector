Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. Firstly, it can be confusing, and can even cause some of your best friends to stop riding to avoid being taken on by the other race cyclists. It has also been shown that, once set on a map or with a location to explore, the setting enhances your view of the road, and improves your ability to tell where you are and where you don't want to go. Finally, the setting can help you get to your destination safely, with the occasional hit. These settings can be turned on or off by simply going into the mode menu, and selecting 'Racing Options' from among the option lists. Whilst it doesn't seem like cycling is much of a part of you if you simply do not want to go (we hope you do!), if you really want to drive down and off some of the streets to get off, then this is it if you're ready!

If you choose to disable all and all Ridesharing in the options (like 'Ridesharing' does), you can then save files for your system. To do so, open the files folder in your Cursors directory and copy the 'Ridesharing'.ini into the Cursors or Windows directory of the current Cursors instance.

You can then make a second copy of the 'Ridesharing.ini' that you use in the first part of this page
