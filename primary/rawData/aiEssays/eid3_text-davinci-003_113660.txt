The features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski’s story “Rough Road Ahead” have a significant impact on the cyclist’s experience. The road is described as “steep and unforgiving,” filled with numerous “unwanted hurdles” that must be overcome in order for the cyclist to reach the top. The challenge of the terrain and the fear of falling off add to the cyclists sense of accomplishment as they progress on their journey. The cyclist also faces the uncertainty that comes with not knowing what’s around each bend and the fear of meeting “cyclists going the opposite direction.” All of these elements add to the tension of the story and create a sense of dread as the cyclist moves closer to their destination.

The ruggedness of the landscape helps to heighten the sense of anticipation and dread in the story. The cyclist must constantly monitor their bike speed, their balance, and the state of the road. The constant changing of terrain and the challenging nature of the climb require courage, focus, and effort, all of which show courage and resilience. 

The features of the setting also provide the cyclist with a sense of accomplishment when they reach the top. The hard-won battle against the elements of nature and the challenging terrain prompt a feeling of euphoria in the cyclist, an “indescribable exaltation” that comes with having finally reached the top.
