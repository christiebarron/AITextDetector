I remember one particular time when I was in line at the grocery store and there had been a huge rush of customers ahead of me. I had gone to the store to pick up a few essential items on my lunch break from work. The woman in front of me had about 10 items in her cart, and the cashier was going slowly as she bagged each one. With every second that passed I started feeling more anxious - I could feel my frustration rising as time ticked away and I saw my lunch break, and chance to get the items I needed, slipping away. 

Just when I was about to snap and tell the woman to hurry up, I remembered that patience was a virtue. I took a few deep breaths and instead of becoming angry or impatient, I just tried to stay in the moment and practice mindfulness. I reminded myself that everyone is just doing the best they can with the situation, and that rushing the woman ahead of me wouldn't help the situation. After a few minutes of waiting, the woman was done and I was up - and thankfully my lunch break had not been completely wasted. 

The lesson I learnt from this experience was that patience really is a virtue. Even when I was feeling stressed and frustrated, I was able to stay calm and practice patience, and it yielded a positive outcome. I have since used this lesson in many other scenarios and found that being patient and understanding often leads to better outcomes - both for me and for everyone
