It is undeniable that censorship is a controversial issue when it comes to free speech and expression, particularly in public libraries. Whenever the topic is discussed, it tends to spark heated debates. In my opinion, certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should not be automatically removed from shelves in libraries even if found to be offensive. 

The role of a public library has changed since it’s inception. It has become more than just a sanctuary to check out books and study. Libraries are part of the community and often serve as hubs of intellectual and cultural activity. It is highly important for libraries to remain accessible and open to people from all backgrounds, in order to foster discourse and encourage learning. The censorship of certain materials can create a negative atmosphere of discrimination and discourage open thinking. 

Furthermore, censorship strips citizens of their right to freely explore their individual preferences and beliefs. It limits opportunities to discover new ideas. It is important to remember that everyone’s opinion is valid regardless of whether or not it is accepted by the majority. A library should not be expected to endorse any particular view or belief; instead, it should serve as a safe place to explore books, music, movies, and magazines
