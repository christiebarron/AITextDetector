The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. A few years ago, NASA launched a program allowing dirigibles to dock at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The launch was preceded by a failed effort to send a dirigible aboard the ISS in 2006.

One of the most contentious issues was the space shuttle's docking facilities. In 2008, the company that owns the space shuttle, Delta, approved an arrangement that allowed the shuttle to dock on a pad at the back of the shuttle. However, officials at NASA, and the government of Japan, were outraged over the deal and decided to try to force the shuttle to dock there themselves. One of the engineers that worked with Delta sent two engineers to get it to dock, and he and the first engineer managed to get the docking pads and attached sensors along with three other components by placing pieces on a wall at the back of the shuttle as opposed to one-by-one on the sides. When the design of the pad and the parts on the sides of the shuttle were completed by the end of January, the four engineering engineers who worked on the shuttle could not dock there.

On July 11th, 2008, the Washington, DC-based Commercial Crew Union took to space to ask NASA and NASA officials to provide the public with a version of the original design so that NASA could finally decide what to do about docking at the station.

NASA's new docking pad will now consist
