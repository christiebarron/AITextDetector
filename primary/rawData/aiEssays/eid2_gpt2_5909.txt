I believe that censorship of materials in libraries, schools and any such thing is absolutely necessary, and to do so only by some means is wrong.

The way the government says it is going to protect its users and their rights is, to put it simply, to "protect all people." That means banning anyone who uses copyright, all other creators, all media that has nothing to do with content or any other form of communication, all web sites. The government is trying to make this very clear for all the different freedoms. On August 12, 2017 the British Press Association published a damning statement against the government's policy on copyright, and demanded that people defend the copyright in general under its powers. The statement made it clear that there was still a fair and just process under which there was an issue of fair use in the production of copyrighted material.

"This must cease immediately," said the letter. "From within our own community there must be a sense of community. We demand that, to the extent possible, all the creators of our material be able to provide support for our efforts. That we should also ask copyright owners for their support."

Although that's not a clear quote from the letter – not all copyright owners agreed with the statement – many are beginning to acknowledge that those who say otherwise are actually making themselves extremely uncomfortable. It seems that the issue comes up all the time when the Government has threatened takedown requests.

The first copyright case under the DMCA came in April
