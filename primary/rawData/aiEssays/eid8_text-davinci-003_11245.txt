I was on a road trip with my long-time friend, Linda. We pulled over to take some pictures of a scenic overlook, but when we got out of the car I noticed something about the view that I couldn’t quite put my finger on.

It wasn’t until Linda made a comment about it that I realized why the view seemed so familiar.

“Wait a minute,” she said, “isn’t this the exact same view as the famous photo from two years ago?”

We both started laughing and I couldn’t help but think how grateful I was to have a friend like Linda who could always make me laugh, even in unconventional circumstances. 

As the sun began to set behind us, we both commented on how beautiful the view was now that we appreciated it for what it really was—the backdrop for a timeless moment between two friends. We laughed and took more pictures, enjoying each other’s company. 

That day was an indicator that laughter really does heal and help us grow closer to one another. Even though there was nothing particularly funny about the situation, our laughter was the perfect understanding between us—a bond that I knew would last for years to come.
