The memoir From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, by Narciso Rodriguez, creates a thoughtfully reflective mood. The book is full of memories of Rodriguez’s childhood growing up in New Jersey, his mother’s influence on his creativity, and the shaping of his identity through family and his embrace of Latinx culture. 

The memoir creates an intimate atmosphere. Through Rodriguez’s vivid descriptions of stories from his childhood and the influence of those around him, there is a sense of nostalgia and comfort. Rodriguez often expresses admiration for his mother, siblings, and other family members that have been instrumental in helping him find his own path. His recollections of these moments create a warm and welcoming feeling for the reader. 

At the same time, there is an undercurrent of relatable loss throughout the memoir. Rodriguez often reflects on how his feelings of displacement—of not being part of any single culture and no longer having his loved ones close by—connects him to the multicultural experience of his peers. His memoir frequently alludes to the idea that experiences of loneliness can nurture creativity and uniquely shape who we become. 

The juxtaposition of warmth with pain throughout From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives highlights the importance of emotion in memoirs. This memoir effectively creates a mood of remembrance and reflection, invoking the reader to remember their own past experiences while also inspiring them to take their own journey towards self-discovery.
