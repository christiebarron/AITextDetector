One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was 12 years old. At my sixth birthday party I looked across the street and found a little black box on the wall and said, "If you would like a copy of the book about the Bible for me, you can just have it on eBay for $30. You can also order a copy online." I bought it and it cost a lot of money. I'd thought that this was a great way of illustrating scripture, but I actually really enjoyed it because there was no way to see through a black box and a Bible is just a book. I bought in the Bible.

At the time what I did was really a hobby, and I'd become a full time pastor at a Christian church for the next several years. The church needed me to help them get together with parents to be good parents. It was just a good thing. I knew I'd be able to help with the family, because they were just a good family. When I did my first session with my Pastor I felt really good. Then, my husband said he'd been having trouble doing his work in the fields, so I started seeing the pastor as a role model rather than a preacher.
