Computers have many effects on people. An experiment that looked at "dysfunction", or how well the brain responds to stress, showed that people with a high level of brain activity can perform better at solving problems than those without a high level of brain activity. One person with a high level of cognitive function should be able to do well at social activities such as making friends, and so on...but some might be better able than others because of the number and complexity of the environment around them, the person's mental state. One experiment that looked at how stress or other factors in the environment affect the brains of people with different levels of brain activity measured all of the people who lived during this period (30% in the West, 18% in Scandinavia), and determined the best models for predicting how well things would be the next year or two. The researchers discovered that people with higher levels of cognitive ability tended to be more productive and successful... and so this could be related to greater social skills being obtained from their skills rather than less. One way to think about this is that by having a higher amount of cognitive ability, people are more likely to succeed. This is a very important factor in how well people do in a world that has so many social problems, including poverty and unemployment. However, these differences don't tell us about the overall quality of the society. A lot of the same things can be said about the people who live in countries with very high levels of stress: in some
