The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They also faced problems at various levels of government over the use of dirigibles in public housing.

But as they worked hard to meet the new requirements, building permits and housing permits for both the first and second floor of the building got more stringent. The developers at the time considered giving some dirigibles and some of their sub-stresses to the First City development or even constructing a residential tower over the building itself. By 1997, the city had set out guidelines to determine whether the use of dirigibles should be allowed by the Empire State Building project.

The City Council passed Resolution No. 28 in 1999 stating that the use of dirigibles was in violation of local zoning laws and would be a violation of the city's First and Second Amendment rights. On July 6, 2002, the City council passed Resolution No. 26 that prohibited the use of dirigibles on the Second City development.

After that, the City Council approved the design and construction of a large building at the corner of Main St. and Central Ave. to honor the heritage elements of the building and to mark the historic city skyline

"The First City has a proud heritage, an area that had gone through a lot of development before the building was completed. Today it takes over all of the buildings on Main Street," said Robert Gisby, executive chef and manager with the New York City
