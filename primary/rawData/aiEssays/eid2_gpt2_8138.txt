I believe that censorship of materials in libraries does not occur solely because a library is "staged" and its patrons keep it open. We hope to make it abundantly plain when we publish that our copyright can, and will, be used to facilitate the rights of creators to communicate their work, and to create products and services, and to promote the culture around it, regardless of which side is victorious in this battle.
