In Joe Kurmaski's short story, "Rough Road Ahead," the setting of rural Wisconsin plays a key role in the cyclist's journey. The road that the cyclist traverses is filled with hills, valleys, and winding curves that challenge even the sturdiest of riders. The rider faces the additional challenge of navigating the rural landscape, which is sparsely populated with occasional houses and farms that can distract from the road.

The hills provide a physical challenge for the cyclist, as they have to use their strength and energy to climb them and coast downhill. The sharp curves of the road make it difficult for the cyclist to keep their momentum, requiring them to be vigilant and constantly adjust their position on the bike. The sparse population of the rural Wisconsin landscape also ensures that the cyclist must ride with caution, with no one around to call for help in case of an accident.

The physical, mental, and environmental obstacles posed by the rural landscape put the cyclist to the test. The remote landscape makes navigation difficult, while the hills and curves challenge even the most experienced riders. The rider must remain alert and aware so they can safely make it to their destination, while being brave enough to take on the unknown. In this way, the setting of the story helps to add tension and suspense to the narrative and make the cyclist's journey more intense.
