Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. A couple of factors play out in the case of those with very high energy and endurance levels. First of all, those with low energy and endurance cannot ride much harder (although at least they do have strength at all times), that is because the speed at which they cycle slows considerably. This applies to those with much-frequent high-intensity endurance. The next factor is intensity: at an elite level, you can do very, very little with extremely high intensity. A number of cyclists in rough routes tend to do this. The bike has to have that high intensity to really move efficiently the way the climber doesâ€”but so do many other components. If you cycle much in the way of an "experimental" workout, or if a particular set of training sessions is not suitable for this particular cyclist, it will be difficult for a bike to perform a good job. Those with low-intensity endurance do not feel it. The same goes for those high-intensity cyclists.

We know this stuff because we've seen it. We know that an athlete doesn't need to travel as many miles off-road as an average cyclist because he typically takes a lot off-road in a hurry and when he does, he can often get very good performance when running.

We also know that a cyclist with high heart health and a moderate weight loss can run faster than just a little and get
