I was at a party with my new friends Pete and Jane. We were in the middle of a lively conversation about our favorite movies, when Pete suddenly made a joke that I didnâ€™t understand. Jane saw the confusion on my face and burst into a fit of laughter. I soon found out that Pete had just made a story out of a wildly misinterpreted movie plot. We all laughed so hard that my stomach started to hurt. Every time I thought it was over, Jane or Pete would make another joke or point out something I had missed out on. It felt wonderful to be in that moment. It felt like we were bonded together in that moment and forever connected by that shared laughter.
