I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a great mistake and should be condemned in the first place. I urge you to refrain from restricting or destroying existing library materials (including non-public documents). If you have been a patron or a teacher at a library for any reason, please email your comments to rachael.korschel@lighthouseonline.org. If you don't see something in your spam folder, please send me an email with a link and I will add it. Please also let me know of any problems I may have with your application.
