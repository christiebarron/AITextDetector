The author uses the story of a young girl's experience with a winter hibiscus to illustrate that there are opportunities to learn important things in every season of life. At the end of the story, the girl chose not to take the test, but the final line shows us that she will be revisiting this experience in the coming season. The idea is that with the knowledge and insights she has gained through her experience with the winter hibiscus, she will be better prepared for the future. The ending is meant to serve as a reminder that there is not a single moment in life when we can't learn something profound or gain a new perspective.
