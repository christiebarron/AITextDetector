When I first started dating my now fiancé, I still remember the very first time we laughed together. We had gone to a comedy show and our seats were in the back. The jokes were so funny, we couldn't contain ourselves. We laughed until our sides hurt and tears ran down our face. Even though it was our first date, it felt like we had known each other for years. It was then that I knew we had a connection that would last forever.

Our relationship has grown since and we still laugh together constantly. We try to find ways to brighten each other's day and bring a little humor and laughter into our lives. We know that laughter and happiness are the foundations of a strong relationship, and we recently even bought a joke book to share and laugh together—it is one of our favorite activities.

We always laugh at the same things, sometimes finishing each other's jokes before one another has even finished speaking, and it feels like a special bond we share. We are always laughing, but never at each other. We simply enjoy being able to connect and express ourselves with humor and laughter. 

The best thing about our relationship is that we make each other laugh, and that's why I'm looking forward to spending the rest of my life with him.
