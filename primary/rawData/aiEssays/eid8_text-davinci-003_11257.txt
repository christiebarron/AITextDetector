I remember when my best friend and I would always get together for what she liked to call our "stupidity bonding" sessions. We'd always get together and just talk about all the silly things that had happened to us or the funny conversations we'd had. We'd tell each other stories until we were practically rolling on the floor with laughter.

One day, we got together and started talking about our craziest experiences. We laughed and laughed, and then I told her the one about the time I was walking down the street and saw a man in a bear costume riding a unicycle. We couldn't stop laughing about it. I was in tears and just barely able to breathe.

It was one of those moments I'll never forget. We laughed so hard that my stomach hurt. And it was such an important reminder that no matter what is going on in life, itâ€™s important to make time to just laugh and enjoy life. I'm so thankful for that moment and the many laughter-filled memories that followed.
