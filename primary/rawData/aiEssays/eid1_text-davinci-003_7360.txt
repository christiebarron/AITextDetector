In Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead”, the setting plays a crucial role in the cyclist’s journey. The dark, gloomy atmosphere of the open road, highlighted by the looming mountain, serves as a reflection of the cyclist’s emotional turmoil. The road is a winding path full of twists and turns, metaphorically paralleling the cyclist’s turbulent path of self-doubt and despair. The cyclist has decided to take a chance and try the mountain, an action that symbolizes courage and greater growth. Despite the fear and pain associated with taking this risk, the cyclist’s mind is filled with hope to overcome these obstacles.

The setting provides a place of intrepid isolation for the cyclist to take part in his daring venture. Despite the loneliness, it is essential for the cyclist to continue his quest alone as it forces him to confront his fears and anxieties head on. His bravery and determination take him to the peak of the mountain, an empowering achievement that would not have been achieved if he did not take the courageous chance and persevere through the hardship of the road. In this way, the features of the setting act as a powerful symbol of hope and growth, even in the darkest of times. They set the stage for the cyclist’s journey of self-improvement and confidence. The setting, therefore, dynamically shapes and supports the cyclist’s personal journey.
