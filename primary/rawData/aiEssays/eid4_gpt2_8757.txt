The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because of the series' unique characters and the unexpected ending we get when the team discovers something magical is coming.

"It was a big change for us to be able to come to the end a little differently in a way that was very hard in other books," he tells EW. "And it is an incredible feeling knowing that I've been able to write this story and get that final book off the ground."

Winter Hibiscus #5 from Image is set for an April 9, 2015 debut in the UK and Australia.
