The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' has come to a head in the U.S. this week as the Senate and House are considering a sweeping bill to undo Obamacare and replace it with something that can be seen as an alternative to government-issued health insurance. In the process, this bill threatens to make it much harder to keep a job â€“ especially for a spouse.

According to Sen. Steve Daines (R., S.D.), who works with the conservative Heritage Foundation, more than 1 in 4 Americans are either unable to get insurance or have been unable to get Medicaid. In the U.S., the median age is 36, but the rate is rising at an alarming 44 points per 100,000. For working women, even the rate of uninsured is more than two-thirds.

The Senate bill to repeal Obamacare is an issue that the conservative Heritage Foundation has long pushed for in support of a health care reform bill called the Individual Mandate Plan that would prevent Americans from having a federal benefit for a health insurance plan. In 2011, an individual mandate became part of the definition of health coverage. Under the original health care law, which took effect in 2007 and was expanded by 2014 through expanded exchanges, people with an existing insurance plan would be allowed to get health insurance on the new plan.

"Right now, the health insurance market is an awful mess," said Sen. Susan Collins (R., Maine) during her Thursday hearing.
