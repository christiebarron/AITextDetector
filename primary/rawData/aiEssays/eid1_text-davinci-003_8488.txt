I was waiting in line at the grocery store when I saw an elderly woman in front of me. She had a full cart, and was slowly rummaging through her vouchers and coins. I could tell that counting out the exact change was taking longer than usual, and I could feel the person behind me getting steadily more impatient. 

I remembered my mother saying to me once, "Patience is a virtue" and I breathed in deeply. I reminded myself to be tolerant and understanding. Instead of joining in the impatience of the others around me, I counted my blessings silently in my head.

Eventually, the elderly woman finished up and I stepped up to the cashier. I was thankful that my patience had paid off and I was able to get through the line unscathed. In the future, I will always remember to stay patient, no matter what the circumstances.
