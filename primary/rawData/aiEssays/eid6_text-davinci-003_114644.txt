The designers of the iconic Empire State Building had to overcome many obstacles in order to make the docking of dirigibles possible. One of those obstacles was the fact that the building had to be designed so that the dirigibles would be able to line up correctly for easy docking. The designers had to think outside the box and come up with a creative solution, which included the placement of special mooring masts on the top of the building. 

The mooring mast was a large metal pipe or pole with a conical cap on top. This conical cap would act as a cove, keeping the dirigible securely in place as it was being docked. Additionally, the mooring mast was designed to rotate with the wind, allowing the dirigible to turn with the wind and face the proper direction for docking. This was essential as the dirigibles were large and could not turn easily on their own.

Another obstacle the designers had to overcome was the safety of both the passengers and workers involved in the docking process. To ensure the safety of workers, architect Wallace Harrison developed a “sky port” system. This system included the installation of steel cables along the sides of the building which could be used to secure the dirigible in place as it docked. Passengers could also remain safe by taking the elevator or stairs down to the ground level.

Finally, the designers had to take into account the changes in air pressure, temperature
