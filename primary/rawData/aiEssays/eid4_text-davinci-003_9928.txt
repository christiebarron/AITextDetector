At the end of the story, the narrator has failed to pass the citizenship test due to her lack of English. The story ends with the narrator reflecting on how she will take the test again in the spring, when the snows melt and when the cold season is over. This serves as a metaphor for the narratorâ€™s own hope for a better future where she can prove she is capable of passing the test. The narrator clings to the hope of success, just as winter hibiscus clinging against all odds in the cold winter. This is a hopeful message to readers to never give up and carry on despite the struggles and hardships.
