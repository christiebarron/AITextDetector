The obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock was the limited space and the intense wind pressure within the city. According to ‘The Mooring Mast’ by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the Empire State Building was initially designed with a mooring mast for dirigibles and airplanes, but the plan was eventually scrapped due to the environmental conditions present in the heart of a bustling New York City. 

The space within the city was sparse and — as with the rest of the building — every inch of the airship dock needed to be maximized. To make matters worse, the swirling winds around the structure would have dramatically increased the difficulty of maneuvering a large, slow-moving airship into the dock. It was simply too dangerous for operators, passengers, and those on the ground to even attempt such a feat. 

Furthermore, the dock itself — called a mooring mast — was a source of great structural strain. Although the mast was of an impressive size — 200 feet when calculated from the 102nd to 86th floor — it would still not be enough for a large zeppelin to fulcrum against the building. Even if they could manage to latch the airship onto the mast, the weight of the zeppelin and the strain of the tugging cables would be too great for the building to bear. 

Ultimately, the builders of the Empire State Building had to accept that
