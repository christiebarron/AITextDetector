The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is reminiscent of Houghton Mifflin who famously told Stephen King that no matter what he did, not every day was a day off.

The fact that he was able to tell a story about one of our most notorious murders for the first time makes the chapter 'The Making of 'The Book and the Coming of the Apocalypse', which was translated by Richard E. Campbell and published in January 2014 by Transworld Press.

Transworld Magazine has been in the know for a number of years now and has included a comprehensive coverage of various stories in the book over the course of five Normandy series. From it all there is one thing that makes 'The Making of' the most interesting to my readership so far, The fact that the author has provided this unique perspective to his story is a wonderful achievement for readers of our website. It really is an honor to have such a large audience, and for that it's important to us. We'd also like to thank everyone for their support.
