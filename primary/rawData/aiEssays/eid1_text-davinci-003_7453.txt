The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho serves as a moment of hope and resilience for the protagonist, Tashi. At the end of the story, Tashi has been studying for a difficult test in order to try and gain entrance into the prestigious school she desires. As the story ends, she has had to postpone her studying to go to her family's home in the city, which serves as a reminder of the challenges she faces as a first generation immigrant and their impact on her daily life. 

The ending of the story gives Tashi the hope and motivation she needs to refocus on her studies and take the test when she returns to the city the following Spring. By ending the story on a hopeful note, the author is emphasizing Tashi's determination to succeed in spite of life's obstacles. Furthermore, the imagery of the returning geese, melting snow, and budding hibiscus all help to symbolize the power of growth, perseverance, and optimism amidst hard times.
