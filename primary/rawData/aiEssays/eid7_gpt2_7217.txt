An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a patient who was dying from a heart attack. We were both on the floor and everyone stopped to see where his heart was beating. We had to get a hold of him to make sure he was dying and get the most important information out there. In the first instance, I wanted him to be conscious and conscious. But then he died a day later. You can't get to that by sitting around doing nothing. That's really sick. I was trying every move I could get my hands on to make this happen.

There is a lot at stake here and I can't imagine being a medical assistant in that environment.

I am. I have a doctor and a surgeon in my class and some kind of certification, training. They're there with you and your patients. For the best possible care, you have to know how to act on your experience and act with compassion. And the only way to do that is through kindness and understanding, both within and without that environment.

What do you believe most in when working in a medical facility? One thing that I can say is that working with patients requires a holistic approach. You have to understand how you deal with patients in a way that doesn't place emphasis or emphasis on a particular person, but it's not too restrictive on your practice, because you are going to find people that will be affected by their experience of life as they change throughout the year.
