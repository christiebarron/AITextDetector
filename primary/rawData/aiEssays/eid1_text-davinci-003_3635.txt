Dear Editor,

As technology advances the way people interact with computers has drastically changed in the past few decades. From the days of old desktop computers and bulky laptops to tablets and smartphone devices, I would argue that the overall impact of computers on people cannot be overstated.

First and foremost, computers have revolutionized communication. Not only can people speak to each other in real time via video conferencing, but they can also send documents, pictures, and other digital media in seconds. This technology has not only made communication faster, but it has also made it global; people can now interact with family and friends from all over the world with the click of a button.

Additionally, computers have had a profound effect on education and business. In the classroom, teachers are able to use digital tools, such as online quizzes and interactive whiteboards, to engage students. In the workplace, most companies make use of computers to streamline processes and to increase efficiency.

Above all, computers have enabled people to conduct research and access information in ways that would not have been possible just a few decades ago. With the internet at their fingertips, people are now able to explore vast swaths of data, find answers to complex questions, and generally broaden their understanding of the world.

For all these reasons, I am certain that computers have had a tremendous effect on modern-day society. It is my hope that readers of this newspaper will come to the same conclusion
