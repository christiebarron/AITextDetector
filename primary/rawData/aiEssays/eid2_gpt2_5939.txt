I believe that censorship of materials in libraries would work for a number of reasons too. If the contents of libraries have become the target of copyright infringement, then I believe that these are likely to take precedence over legal remedies. In my mind, then, the main problem has to do with the extent of censorship currently available to all book publishers. Therefore, I think it's fair to look at what is available, and what copyright holders are going to be doing to protect their rights when the library and all its supporters move to censor the books at the library's behest. If there are only one course of action that we can take, it would be to take some actions, without fear of being blocked. In fact, I would argue that we must act together more aggressively. However, to help facilitate the eventual suppression of the books at the library, I believe that there are, in fact, quite possibly better means to go to the library to block. The first step is to simply remove all infringing material from all books within a particular library where it is likely that an infringement case would be heard. Once that has been done, the act of blocking becomes an actual public health campaign. The third step is to prevent books in a library from being copied by anyone in a particular way. There is no need to do this by stopping what the bookshop does. It's just a matter of blocking the books so that they are no longer a target of copyright infringement.
