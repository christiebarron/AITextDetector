The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because I have never told you about winter solids.


It's hard to explain, except for the first couple of paragraphs, that this is why I wrote Winter Hibiscus. It is difficult to describe because that's what I wrote back then, and I've written a lot more in the book recently. But at least I can't deny the possibility that I will be writing winter solids in the future:


I wrote Winter Hibiscus because I had no other idea what winter solids were. For those who don't know that I write winter solids from scratchâ€”as though there's no one else who does. Summer soliders are not really good at it. If they were, they probably were not all that great. If they were, at least they were fairly nice. It will be fun, but my aim is not to make more than five or six of them in any single book by winter soliding.

There's also one last interesting bit. There's a book by the same author, called The Autumn Solids, about how they might not apply in the future, I assume?


Right, but this was a really cool one that I thought that the idea of a collection of winter soliders would be useful. So I didn't have that book. I have just a short summary of what I wrote about Winter soliders in general because there's a good deal of information
