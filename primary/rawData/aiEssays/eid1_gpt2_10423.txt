Computers have many effects on people. These are like cars, but they do have things like teleconverters and they have cameras. What we have is a sort of the world of video, where people want to see some things they won't normally see before they can get their eye over them. I think the human brain has this great advantage so it can read stuff faster. The way it understands that, when you watch all this stuff and you sit and stare at these things, then you'reCPAN.

And then you see that that's what's making the PC so appealing. People see things with so much imagination that you don't see the video at all. I always think of my PC as being a metaphor because I think it's a metaphor for computers and that doesn't come with much in it. When you watch the screen, you can always see it, even in the living room. That's what I think is the key thing. It is this incredible, this incredible power it powers, these superpowers that I think are going to drive the next generation of computing. They're going to bring about a revolution for the whole world, it should put a big dent into what we view as the world. And that was the big idea that I had, the idea that we are going to put computers to the test.
