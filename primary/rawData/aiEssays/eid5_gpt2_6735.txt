The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' feels a little like the story of the book.

On the day you die, you write: "From Home's stories are no different from this. It's the only thing we still remember as being true â€” and a real truth." Even now, on a cold day in Paris in 2013, I feel as though I might not know more about the subject. That's all I have to worry about. All I'll regret is that I haven't tried to write them down now: they're all too much.

The memoir started out as a meditation on the loss of two beloved, but neglected, books. Now, I wonder if the memoir will also be a meditation on the loss of the love you have, and the loneliness, grief, fear and loneliness that accompanied it.
