 

I remember when I was in high school trying out for the winter musical. All my friends were so talented and confident, and I really wanted to be part of the show too. I was determined to practice my audition song every day to make sure I would do well, and the day of auditions arrived. 

I waited hours for my turn to sing, and when my name was finally called, I was so nervous! Nevertheless, I remained calm and patient as I stepped forward and reminded myself that I'd been practicing hard. I sang my best and felt a sense of pride and accomplishment when it was over.

Amazingly, I got one of the lead roles! It felt like such a great reward for having been patient. It taught me that if you're consistent in your hard work and persevere in the face of doubt, good things will come.
