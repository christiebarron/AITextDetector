One time I experienced laughter in my life was when in a discussion with one of my favorite comedian, we agreed not to laugh with his face. This was my first time getting into comedy and the first time to get a laugh from him. He was a little bit nervous about it, so I was excited to see if it would make him laugh. We talked for a bit, and had to move on.

As I started getting into comedy, I noticed the excitement in his eyes when I moved from theater to theater. It seems like there's no one in the world who isn't afraid to show off their new book.
