The construction of the Empire State Building posed a great challenge for the engineers and architects involved in the project, particularly due to the fact that the plans included the installation of mooring masts to enable dirigibles to dock. As explained by Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted in her book, The Mooring Mast, this was a unique and ambitious idea for the time, and the obstacles encountered in enabling the building to accommodate dirigibles were considerable.

The first challenge was that the plan required the installation of a mooring mast, which was not a common feature on architectural structures. There is no historical precedent for the installation of mooring masts on individual buildings, meaning that the designers had to devise a unique solution for the Empire State Building. The mast had to be primary strong and rigid enough to safely able a dirigible to dock without compromising the structural integrity of the building itself. As well, the installation had to be sized and positioned correctly to create a stable mooring environment, while also remaining unobtrusive.

Additionally, the designers had to account for the structural and environmental effects of dirigibles docking at the mast. High altitude winds produced during the docking process could cause sizeable vibrations in the mast and the building itself, which meant the mast and related support mechanisms had to be particularly robust in order to mitigate such risks. Furthermore, the approach and docking manoeuvres would create significant air turbulence, which had to be taken into account to ensure
