I was recently shopping with my son, who can be quite a handful. We had been in the store for what seemed like hours and it had been a tiring experience for the both of us. I could tell he was getting overwhelmed and began to get antsy and irritable. However, instead of losing my patience and letting my emotions get the best of me, I took a deep breath and chose to be patient.

I started by using a calm and gentle tone of voice as I told my son that it was time to leave. He wasn't very responsive and began to grumble. I knew he was frustrated and I completely understood, so I gave him some extra time to process his feelings and take his time. Eventually I was able to get him to leave the store and I thanked him for being so understanding.

Being patient in this situation really paid off. My son was able to recognize my understanding and took the time to process his feelings. By the time we left the store, he was in a much better mood. It was a valuable lesson for both of us in choosing to take a deep breath and be patient.
