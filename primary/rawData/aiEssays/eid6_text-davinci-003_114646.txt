The Empire State Building was a feat of engineering when it was completed in 1931, working around the clock for several years with a team of over 3,000 workers. One of its features that doesn't get enough recognition is the idea imbedded in its design to permit dirigibles – or airships – to dock at the top.

In order to make such a construction possible, the workers had to build a platform on the 81st floor, above the city’s skyline, that would be strong enough to accommodate the weight of the large airships. Not only was this task incredibly difficult considering the short deadline and limited resources, but also because the airships themselves were so new and unpredictable.

In addition to the physical challenge, there was also an issue of public opinion to consider. In a period when rapid urbanization and modernity were feared, the Empire State Building with its ambitious design could have been seen as a competing threat. This made it necessary for the builders to occupy a careful balance between the aspirations of the new project and the city’s traditions.

Fortunately, according to the book ‘The Mooring Mast’ by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the directors of the project managed to do just that. They designed the platform with the strength and size it would need in order to moor dirigibles, but at the same time made it aesthetically pleasing, with elegant neo-gothic detailing.
