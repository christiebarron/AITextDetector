An example of a time someone in my life was patient was during an episode of the sitcom The People's Wedding when my husband was on her maternity leave, at 15 weeks, and her birth was delayed in order to help our daughter get her degree and help save the family from economic collapse. We called up my friend and saw they didn't talk to each other like these couples like other couples do. I told my friend about all the things I told him, some were great, and some were great and the other one was the one that was right. I called all of the doctors, teachers, teachers of our school, and friends, and the parents' of the kids; my friend was able to get the same relief as her mom in her time.

I have been lucky in life. In fact, I've done so much to improve my life and make a difference for those in need around the world. With that in mind, I was thrilled to share this with you. It will be your story and your life story, to be shared with your children, and to be part of the future of your children's care.

Today, I wish you all the success you and your loved ones deserve. I know it's not fun and you can take some time just by using this time or going there. I know your parents have loved you for who you are, and that's a testament to every single person you know or has seen.

Thank you so much
