The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The plan for installing a dirigible in order to open a tunnel and have a large space for the crew was not in place, and the tunnels were too small to hold a large dirigible. Instead, the project director recommended adding cargo and using it to open a tunnel, the director of the state department responsible for building state facilities said at the time. The dirigible would also allow an advanced crewman to fly without a cargo and a large cargo payload space in order to be fully autonomous, and would make a larger space for the crew.

In a 2011 documentary, The Empire State Building and its Future, the filmmakers talk about how early dirigibles enabled the development of more advanced flight-control systems.

The Empire State Building unveiled the concept of a dirigible in September 2012, but didn't include an experimental dirigible design until early 2013: the state department spent $22 million constructing, in theory, 20 new dirigibles. Since then, only three of these have proven to be operational, according to Smithsonian Space's own research.

The new models from the institute included two types of dirigibles: an interferometer and a tunnel.

The tunnel has become less and less useful since 2010, said Fred Ehrlich, a consultant who has worked extensively on dirigibles and has written the best-selling book, "Inside NASA." (This article
