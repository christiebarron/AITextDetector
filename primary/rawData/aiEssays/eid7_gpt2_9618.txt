An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my boyfriend, the late Mr. Paul, who has been a regular member of the A.S.F. I went to him to take his last test. Mr. Paul was not going to be on the A.S.F. until we could find a job that wouldn't be too stressful. This was not an easy situation to have, with the risk or frustration the employer was in the process of putting in place on him.

I went on to do several interviews and this was not the best way to make my own decisions and I have often wondered when I have come back from that type of situation. I felt that if I put in the time, I would have made the best decision now and I would have kept the A.S.F. job, and since I had worked closely with Mr. Paul and had a great work history, it was a little easier now to decide when it is better to leave the A.S.F. or go to a new job.

The next step is to talk to our CEO about doing the job we did and having a good time at the company. I did some basic marketing for the A.S.F. but it also meant having an interview so he didn't know what he was missing. This worked for me and my family as well. It also didn't make any sense to talk to our CEO about quitting the A.S.
