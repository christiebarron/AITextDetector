The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because of the book's "real" themes: the suffering of the world's many inhabitants and the unspeakable brutality of slavery, which can become violent and terrifying when treated properly. It also points the way toward new beginnings, with a number of characters being forced to make their way in life that are more vulnerable than they are comfortable with.

The novel continues to explore the possibilities that many of us are facing in our lives today. While it seems to be very hard to get a good grasp of what actually makes a real life story tick, it's great to have all of these characters around to play an essential role in a character's life. Even the writers of this book, David Ament, David O. McKay and Dan O'Neil, found ways for us to be reminded of "The Wire," where, during a tense break, a female character makes herself comfortable while dealing with a murder that she just has absolutely no idea is happening. This novel's first step in developing a book where the stories are presented is to find a way to tell a fair, balanced, and realistic story of "The Wire." When all the characters work together to accomplish the goal of achieving closure, and are in a good place for it to happen, the story gets closer and closer to the end.

This was definitely an important step in developing my own work after reading the first book and coming to know the original characters better.
