One of my most vivid memories comes from a party my family had a few years ago. My aunt and uncle had come to visit, and all the family members were together to celebrate my grandparentâ€™s 60th wedding anniversary. Everyone was in high spirits, making conversation and enjoying the food.

One of my younger cousins had been trying to learn a new magic trick with cards. Throughout the party, he had been showing his siblings and cousins the trick, but it never quite worked as he had hoped. He had been continually practiced to get it right but finally, gave up. My aunt and uncle, who had been observing the situation in amusement, then suggested one last try.

My cousin agreed and began to set up the trick. All of us watched carefully, not quite sure if it would work or not. When he came to the magical part where he had to flick the card away, he instead ended up sending it right into the neighbor's garden. We were all speechless at the sight. But soon, we all burst out in a fit of laughter, even my poor cousin who was embarrassed. 

It was an uproar of laughter that I hadn't experience before. I remember watching my cousin turn beet-red from the laughter and embarrassed, but still joining in. It was a moment that effortlessly brought everyone closer together, and as I look back on it, I still couldn't help but smile.
