One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was trying to get a job in college. If you didn't get the job because the president was worried about your status, it would've hurt and it was a bit like that. I was the one that was concerned about not having the work ethic. I was the one who was in college, working hard, but there was no way for me to pay my debts. I had to take care of them because they were being written off, which wasn't something I liked. So then, we worked hard and earned our way out. I had a lot of money and they gave me hope. I wanted to move away from that. I never was happy with people.

The reason I left was due to the government going down. I had the experience that if you leave to a white lady, it happens to you. It happens to women who don't speak English so well. If something happened to the President, that wouldn't work. My only answer was to stay home and learn how I did it.
