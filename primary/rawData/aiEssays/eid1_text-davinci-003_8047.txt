The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock atop its iconic tower. The most pressing obstacle was the massive wind currents generated by the draft of the high skyscraper. The winds were so strong in these areas that they made it impossible for the airships to maintain a steady course as they prepared to moor.

To deal with this issue, the engineers had to design a system that was capable of supporting a full-size dirigible. Their solution was the construction of the mooring mast, a towering, steel 300-foot spire, to provide a stable platform for the airships to dock.

Unfortunately, even after the installation of the mooring mast, the airship pilots still encountered difficulties due to the extreme turbulence in the air currents. The extreme winds would cause the airships to dance and lurch, making it almost impossible to make the connection to the mooring mast.

In an effort to make the task of mooring easier for the pilot, the engineers designed a motorized winch system to help secure the airship in place. The winch system allowed the airship to slowly be snagged and secured onto the platform, thus ensuring a safe and secure mooring.

The engineers also worked to ensure that the airship crew had easy access to the landing platform. To do this, they built a series of ramps and walkways connected to the platform.
