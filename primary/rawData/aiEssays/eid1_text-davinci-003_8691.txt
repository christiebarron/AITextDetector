I remember the first time I met my soon-to-be best friend. We had been assigned the same group project in one of our college classes and had the task of introducing ourselves to the others in the group. As we each went around sharing our names, major, and hometown, Tracy mentioned that hers was Austin, Texas, and I heard myself saying, "Seriously? Like the home of Weird Al Yankovic?" We suddenly burst into a fit of laughter and I could tell right away that this was going to be the start of something special.

The rest of the project was oddly enjoyable as we joked around and laughed. Tracy even started humming some of Weird Al's songs every time we started talking about something out of sync, and then we'd both dissolve into another round of laughter.

By the end of the project, my cheeks were sore from smiling and laughing. I had made a life-long friend that day. We've been inseparable since then, through thick and thin, and the bonding moments that began with laughter in the middle of a project room have been the most lasting and meaningful memories.
