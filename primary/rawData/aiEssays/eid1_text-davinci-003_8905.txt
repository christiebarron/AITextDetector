Dear Editor,

As an everyday user of technology, I want to voice my opinion in regards to the effects computers have on people. In my opinion, computers have had both positive and negative effects on human behavior.

On one hand, computers have enabled people to stay connected with friends and family with various social media platforms, texting, and email. Additionally, computers have allowed people to do tasks more quickly and efficiently without having to spend a great amount of time and energy on completing the task. This creates an atmosphere of ease and accessibility for people, as well as opportunities for work, research, and entertainment.

At the same time, however, computers can also have a negative effect on peopleâ€™s behavior and productivity. Many of us are glued to our phones and computers, which can take away from physical activity, outdoor exploration, and connecting with family and friends in person. Technology has also made it so that some people are overly reliant on their computers and are unable to complete tasks without the assistance of their technology.

Ultimately, I believe if used correctly, computers can be a beneficial tool. They can provide us with a sense of connection to the rest of the world and aid us in our work, research and everyday tasks. However, we must remember to limit our use of technology and shift our focus on being more active and spending more time with family and friends in person.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
