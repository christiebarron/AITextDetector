I was shopping for a new car recently, and I ended up spending the entire afternoon at the dealership. I had gone in knowing exactly what I wanted and had come prepared to negotiate the price, yet I found myself getting increasingly frustrated and trying to rush the process along. 

That was, until I came across the salesman Joe. He was confident without being pushy, and much more patient with me than I’d been with myself. He took the time to explain the finer details of each model, and answered all of my questions without making me feel rushed or silly. He calmly listened to my concerns and answered them in a way that made perfect sense. 

I ended up leaving the dealership with the car I wanted, at the price I was hoping to pay, and I attribute a lot of that success to Joe’s patience and understanding. I am so grateful for his guidance through the process, and it reminded me that even in the most trying and difficult experiences, it’s important to remain patient and present.
