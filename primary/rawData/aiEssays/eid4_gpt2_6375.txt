The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it's an important piece of the puzzle. It's one of those books that you're always looking for, even if you don't know much about them. I loved the chapter on water, the page was beautiful and my husband always gave me the best answer. I really like the chapter on snow, the chapter he said about making sure his son stayed clear of the ocean when he was growing up because it gives you a unique perspective into him growing as a young man. I'm a big fan of that and even though it's a difficult book to deal with, it's one of those books that he's written for us.

My personal favorite is the chapter that describes the use of fire as a tool of war. I find that a good way to tell us things about our war was in its execution. On the other hand, the character is extremely well-rounded. He likes the fact that he's an alcoholic. He doesn't get along well with his colleagues â€” which is sad, because he probably doesn't understand the value of alcohol.
