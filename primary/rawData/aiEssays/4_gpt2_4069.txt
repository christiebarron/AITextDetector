The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because, like many things, the story has to work. Winter Hibiscus starts out as a funny or disturbing story of survival. The hero's journey is so much more fun. The novel takes a very, very deep approach to the story. But when you're trying to find an end in Winter Hibiscus it's a little frustrating. Especially when you're just reading. Because if that happens with Winter Hibiscus, you end up with the best stories that you'll ever read.

The book is all about a poor white lady called Alice who gets caught up in Chicago's great crime story. I can't help but want to hear your favorite crime story or the stories told by the victims in these cases. And yes to those who complain about bad writing and bad dialogue, because when you do read, as I did here, you will hear that all the characters in Winter Hibiscus are in real-life.
