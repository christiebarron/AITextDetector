Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects of computers on people today. I believe that computers have a significant and positive impact on our lives.

In this digital age, computers are essential for our day-to-day lives. They help us with our work and provide us with the latest news and information that we need. Computers allow us to communicate with people from all around the world and access a greater variety of resources than ever before.

The impact of computers on people is far greater than many people think. Computers give us access to online courses and learning resources. They even enable us to pursue work online, giving us unparalleled flexibility in our careers. What's more, with more people staying at home during the pandemic, computers are allowing us to stay connected with our loved ones and our communities around the world.

Not only do computers offer convenience and flexibility, but they also challenge us to think differently. Every day we come across new technologies that challenge us to think more holistically and creatively. Not only do these new technologies offer us more possibilities, but they also help us to become more efficient and productive.

I believe computer technology and the digital age offer unparalleled opportunities for bettering ourselves and our communities. We should embrace them and use their power to the fullest. 

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
