Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion about the effects of computers on people. In my view, computers have brought about great changes that have many positive and negative effects.

On the one hand, computers have become integral to our lives, not only as digital tools but also as our primary source of information. Computers have made it easier and faster to find answers to our questions, enabling us to stay connected with family and friends. They also allow people to work from home which is very helpful for those with disabilities or health problems.

On the other hand, computers have also brought about some negative effects. People can become easily addicted to them and neglect their productivity in the real world. They can also cause physical ailments such as headaches, neck pain, and carpal tunnel syndrome.

In conclusion, computers are both a blessing and a curse. They offer convenience in many areas of life, but they also have some downsides. So, I believe it is important to use computers in moderation and to take precautions to avoid any negative impacts.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
