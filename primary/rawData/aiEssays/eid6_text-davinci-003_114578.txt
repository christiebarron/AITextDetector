The Empire State Building was an engineering marvel when it first opened in 1931, and it quickly became a symbol of New York City. Its unique design, featuring a spire, was designed to include an at-the-time revolutionary feature--a mooring mast for docking airships and dirigibles, such as Germany's Graf Zeppelin. However, constructing the mooring mast posed a number of challenges for the team of engineers and architects responsible for the project.

Firstly, the wind conditions at the building's lofty perch posed a major obstacle. High winds could present a danger to any airships attempting to dock, and the truth was that no one knew for sure if the winds would be strong enough to support the weight of a large airship. Engineers had to carefully take wind velocity readings and use other statistical evidence to decide how strong the mast should be, and how far away from the building mooring any airships should be.

Another major problem was the available technology. No one had ever built a mooring mast such as this before, and so engineers were experimenting with a variety of new concepts. As noted in “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, this required “ingenuity, cooperation and precision” as engineers used methods such as wind tunneling to test the strength of various components, as well as developing new materials to better withstand the wind.
