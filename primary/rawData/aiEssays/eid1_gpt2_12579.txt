Computers have many effects on people. The more memory resources you have to work with, the harder it is to focus all of your attention on, especially after you are done with one task. This makes it hard to focus your mental energies on the task at hand and it makes it harder to take action quickly in case your task might become unmanageable. If you have more time on your hands this means you have more time to do the task. I have found that people don't realize it when they read the book on working with computers because they will always think it's a book of "a hundred mistakes in a book" all of which is just a false generalization.

If you take a "computers are for making money" or "they work for making money" approach you also end up having an unrealistic sense that you can change someone else's mind, which in my experience is probably why people do so much to make more money than they can.

So I'd also suggest a great book on "computer control" before anyone starts looking at "competing computer programs". A good one is by Bruce Hoffman's The Power of Management, which is a book about how companies change minds and mindsets quickly.

There are many great books. Check out that link at top of this page for a comprehensive list.

Here's my list of 10 books that I want to read if I'm ever at work.
