I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is not only possible but also necessary because libraries are being abused and our civil liberties are being threatened: by books and audio services, by electronic message, by data that is being collected through email, by phone calls, by Internet mail, by e-mail, etc.

I'm sure there are hundreds of thousands of people on this planet who will think and feel the same way. I'm sure there are millions of people who will take action to protect the freedom every man, woman, and child deserves.

In addition to this petition, there will also be a Change.org Change.org petition and a statement from our representatives. We hope those who oppose censorship will have their voices heard.

Sincerely,

M.M. Darnell.
