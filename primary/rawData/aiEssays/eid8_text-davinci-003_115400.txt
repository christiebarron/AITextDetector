I will never forget the day I first met my future wife. We had both arrived at the same party at the same time, and I was determined to make a good impression. So when I saw her, I summoned up all my courage and struck up a conversation. After a few moments of small talk, I noticed that she had an amazing laugh.

It was a laugh that came from deep within her and it had a contagious quality that made me want to laugh as well. So, after a few lighthearted jokes, I asked her if I should tell her a funny joke that I had heard earlier that day. She agreed and I told her the joke.

The joke didn’t land as well as I had hoped— and judging by her reaction, she didn’t find it particularly funny— but somehow the joke sparked a shared experience of laughter. She laughed not only at the joke itself, but at my delivery and our shared embarrassment from its failure.

That moment of shared laughter forged an immediate connection between us. We stood there, both laughing and smiling in a way that felt like we had known each other forever. From that moment on, we were inseparable.

We have been married for fifteen years now, and even after all this time, one of my favorite things is still her laugh. To this day, it can still spark a moment of shared joy and connection.
