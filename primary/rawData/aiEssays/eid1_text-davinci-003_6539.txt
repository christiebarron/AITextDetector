Dear Editor,

As the use of computers becomes increasingly ubiquitous, there is no denying that these devices have changed the way we interact with one another and our environment. Over the last few decades, computers have affected us in both positive and negative ways, and it is up to us to determine which outcomes are the most beneficial for our society.

While the use of computers has certainly made our lives easier in certain ways, from facilitating communication and facilitating tedious tasks, there is convincing evidence that computers’ influence on people has too often been detrimental to our overall wellbeing. One accounting of this is the presence of a digital culture of multitasking, which is known to increase stress levels, reduce the pleasure of everyday activities, and even lead to physical manifestations such as fatigue and headaches. There is also mounting evidence that computers have a profound impact on sleep patterns, with it often being difficult for people to remain focused on one activity without being distracted by their devices.

Furthermore, as computers become ever-more integrated into our lives, there is the risk that we become overly dependent on them. We risk becoming inflexible in our ability to think for ourselves while relying too heavily on technology for solutions to our problems. This could lead to a lack of original thought and a reliance on the digital world for all our needs, rather than exercising discretion as to what is best.

Overall, it is important to recognize that computers have both positive and negative impact on people’s lives
