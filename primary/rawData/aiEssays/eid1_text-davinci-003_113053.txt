Dear Editor,

I am writing today to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. In this day and age, computers are an integral part of our lives, both in and out of the home. As technology advances and becomes more and more accessible, people have become more reliant on computers for communication, work and entertainment.

However, I believe that, although computers can be incredibly useful, they should be used in moderation, as too much reliance on technology can be detrimental to our health, both physically and mentally. Spending too much time in front of a computer screen can affect our posture, eyesight, and even our sleep. It can also make us more prone to stress and anxiety and can reduce our social interaction.

I think this is an issue that should be taken seriously. People should be encouraged to break away from their screens every now and then and engage in other activities. Schools should also be teaching young people about the importance of taking regular breaks, and finding a healthy balance between technology and their health. 

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely, 
[Your name]
