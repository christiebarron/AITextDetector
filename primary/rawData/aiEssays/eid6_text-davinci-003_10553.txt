The Empire State Building was an ambitious project that sought to break records for the tallest structure in the world. In order to make the building truly monumental, the innovative designers thought to add a docking station to allow dirigibles to dock. Although this seemed possible on paper, the engineering feat was more complicated than they imagined. In Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s book, The Mooring Mast, she outlines the many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to make this plan a reality.

The first challenge the builders faced was ensuring the sturdy structure in order to hold the considerable weight of a dirigible. To compensate for the added strain, the ship’s engineers specifically designed the mast to fit the building’s framework, extending it 500 ft. into the sky. The sheer weight of the mast was not the only problem, as the additional force of the wind and moving airships posed a great challenge for the designers. To combat this, the mast was built in two sections; the base was tied down to a steel frame set in the building’s foundation and the top of the mast was attached to the building’s roof. This stabilizing structure kept the mast from swaying too drastically underneath the added strain.

Another obstacle the builders had to surmount was determining the best material to construct the mooring line that would safely attach the airship to the mast. The purpose of the line was to serve
