In the poem “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. As the cyclist prepares to embark on his journey, the winding roads, valleys, hills, and heat of the summer sun serve as a physical challenge to be overcome. The cyclist is urged to stay on the road, despite the challenges posed by the environment.

The winding roads work against the cyclist, demanding a constant vigilance to remain on course. He infers that the “valleys dip” and “upwards roll the hills” making it physically and mentally tiring for the cyclist. The heat of the summer sun does not help either, creating a physical struggle to make it up the hills.

The environment of the poem also affects the cyclist's mental attitude. His determination to reach his destination despite the obstacles presented by the environment is evident in the imagery of “pushing on past potholes” and “hills topped with sand”. The cyclist’s refusal to be deterred by the challenging environment is a testament to his character and the strength of his spirit.

The cyclist’s courage in the face of adversity is essential to his success. The poet draws a comparison between the rider’s resolve and that of the sun, praising the cyclist for his “tenacious” and “constant” effort despite the fierce heat.
