I recently had the opportunity to observe a great example of someone being patient. I was visiting my cousin and her family at their home. My cousin's son is a very active two-year-old who loves to explore and test his boundaries. His parents had left the room to take care of a few things and the toddler had started to wander around the room. In that moment, I could sense the tension building up as he was slowly but surely getting closer and closer to the kitchen counter. Suddenly, he tripped and fell to the ground.

He started to cry and immediately his mother came rushing in from the other room. Instead of scolding him or getting angry with him, she spoke softly and in a calm, reassuring tone. She swept him off the floor and comforted him until he stopped crying. She then calmly reasoned with him, telling him why he shouldn't touch the kitchen counter.

I was deeply impressed by my cousin's patience. It must have been very hard for her to remain so composed and patient in that moment. She could have easily scolded him or reacted with anger, but instead, she calmly explained the situation to him and comforted him through his sadness. 

I learned a great lesson that day about the importance of being patient in the face of difficult situations.
