I believe that censorship of materials in libraries was one of the first initiatives of Marx and Engels. Many of the material that circulated in France in the beginning was to contain propaganda or material directed towards a higher purpose than that employed by society to produce results, so that it would produce no change. But the more effective propaganda would be the material that could be propagated in libraries, but which the proletariat could not.

All this suggests that Marx and Engels did not want to censor the writings of their contemporaries in their own time or in Europe. They decided to concentrate on the works of Marx and Engels. After Marx's death in 1841, the great majority of the English newspapers and magazines became very friendly to the "liberal" view of Marxism. They continued to publish "Marx the Communist" and others of its works. This gave rise to the idea that the English newspapers were more enthusiastic than the French publications. The French newspaper "News-Gazette" ran three stories, as did the English German-language daily "Welt am Sonntag" (the Sunday newspapers were the great literary presses) and was among the first newspapers in Germany to publish "The Communist." The Communist would often publish in German because it was popular among the masses. Marx and Engels became the first American papers at the beginning of the twentiethcentury.

However, what would become of the Marx Papers was not always a news event that took place at the Library of Congress or the National Gallery in Washington DC
