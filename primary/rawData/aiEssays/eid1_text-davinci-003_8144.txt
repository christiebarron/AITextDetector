The Empire State Building was famously built in a very short span of time—just one year and 45 days in total. One of the more unusual aspects of the building’s construction is the designers’ intent to allow aircraft, specifically dirigibles, to dock to the top of the building. The plan to allow dirigibles to dock was met with a number of obstacles, including engineering, financial, and legal challenges.

The first challenge was engineering, as the mooring mast needed to hold the immense weight of the dirigible. The 150-foot mast had to be both durable and light enough to withstand the strong winds atop the building. The developers managed to achieve a balance between these two opposing needs, using an innovative design with a combination of steel and aluminum.

The second obstacle to the mooring mast was financial. Construction costs for the mooring mast and platform were high, and the developers had to come up with additional funding to make their ambitious plan a reality. Fortunately, they managed to secure the necessary resources to pay for the mooring mast.

The third challenge to allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was legal. The issue of air rights was a contentious one. Since aircraft fly in three-dimensional space, it was not entirely clear who had the right to control the airspace in and around the building. After much debate and legal wrangling, the developers managed to negotiate a deal with the City
