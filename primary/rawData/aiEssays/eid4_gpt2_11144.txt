The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it opens up the reader'sck into some of what is in place today." - Michael B. Brown

"Winter Hibiscus was a book written with inspiration. I love the idea of this being a series exploring a theme of the world. The main character, an innocent young boy- who has just made it through much of his teenage years - who has finally come face to face with his parents and how he sees life and love both in the world of life itself (and in the past) - and also in the world of love as its own reality (with its own eaten by a love inextricable from that of the world to which it has to belong as a person and the world of love, that is, in so many ways, glove-like and all those other things and things and so on.")

- Patrick L. Walker

"I do not think that the world that was made by the world that is still there is that where there is no such thing. The world is made in my eyes by a desire to find something that is not my own. And I am not so sure that the world that is lost is so hopeless. But I think Winter Hibiscus is an epic, an unmissable masterpiece." - Steven A. Kirkland

What a book to read for the ages! You can bet that you've played a lot of the series together and loved
