I had gone out to dinner with my girlfriend recently, and we had both laughed throughout the night. We had gotten so into it at one point that several of the other patrons had turned to look at us! We were oblivious, and just kept right on laughing. 

The thing that had started it all was when my girlfriend had given me a silly look and I had just cracked up. We got talking about silly moments from our childhoods, which had both of us in stitches. We were soon creating jokes out of each otherâ€™s stories and playing out little skits that had us both giggling. 

We had forgotten everything else around us. There was no rushing, no worrying about who was watching us or who might hear, no thinking about what anyone else was going to think or say about us. We were in our own little world of laughter, and it felt like we had been there forever. 

The dinner was over all too soon and we had to leave, but the laughter would stay with us and bring us together in a way nothing else could. It had warmed us up, filled us up with happiness, and made it easier to handle the other bumps in our relationship. Our laughter became like a code for us to get through anything.
