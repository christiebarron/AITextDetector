I was once invited to a dinner party by my close friend. We chatted for a while as we waited for the rest of the guests to arrive. As time went on I started to become increasingly uncomfortable, feeling the need to hurry out of there. Every minute felt like an hour. 

Finally, after what seemed like a lifetime, one of the guests arrived, followed by the others shortly after. Once everyone was gathered, it was obvious that they weren't aware of the right type of cutlery to use or which plate was for the main course. As others looked to me for guidance, I chose to remain patient and calm. I explained the etiquette of the situation to everyone in a polite and understanding manner. 

The dinner ended up being a success; everyone was grateful for my patience especially. After the meal, I left the dinner feeling proud of myself for managing to stay patient the whole night .
