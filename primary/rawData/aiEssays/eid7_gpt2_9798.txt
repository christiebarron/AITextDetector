An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the first time I met someone who had spent time in hospice care or a hospice hospital, and I felt very lucky to have them. They'd come home and we'd talk about it and they'd say, "They're there." That was a great moment. So it was so much fun."

What do you think of how Dr. Shukla and his colleagues have conducted a pilot study. They've been able to replicate a particular event in some people's lives. Can they replicate it?

Dr. Shukla: It could be used for more than anything in terms of a hospital patient who is on antisocial psychiatric medication, and I think that's probably a good thing. Even without it, there wouldn't be that need for such a pilot study. It would mean the patient would now be able to talk freely with the therapist about what the condition was when they visited him or where their condition was, and they wouldn't lose their capacity to interact with this person, which they were doing when he or she was on antisocial psychiatric medication.

In other words, I don't know if Dr. Shukla could replicate the event, but it would theoretically help to put a broader category of individuals in clinical care more in keeping with the broader needs of people in mental health care at large.

Is there anything else you'd like to point out?
