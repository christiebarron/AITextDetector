Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion about the effects of computers on people. I believe that computers have both negative and positive effects on people.

On one hand, computers have allowed us to explore the world like never before and have made many processes more efficient and easier. They help us in our work and hobbies, such as finding information quickly, playing games, making art, learning new skills, and more. Additionally, computers have allowed us to stay connected with family and friends who are far away.

On the other hand, computer usage can also have a negative effect on people. In some cases, these effects can be serious. People are vulnerable to cybercrime, which can be carried out through personal computers. Excessive use of computers can reduce physical activity and lead to poor physical and mental health. Additionally, exposure to inappropriate content, such as violent or sexual content on the internet, can have a negative effect on the mental health of children and adolescents.

Therefore, I believe that while computers can be incredibly useful, we must also be aware of the risks they pose and strive to find a balance between their positive and negative effects.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
