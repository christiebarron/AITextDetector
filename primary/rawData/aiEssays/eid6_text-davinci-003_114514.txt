The building of the Empire State Building during the 1920s and 1930s presented a range of obstacles to its builders. One of these obstacles was the decision to allow dirigibles (airships) to dock. This was a difficult task due to the fact that the upper floors of the skyscraper had to be especially reinforced to bear the weight of an airship.

The mooring mast for the dirigibles was specially designed for the task by a team of engineers, and the building incorporated a state-of-the-art, 400-foot mooring mast that was capable of suspending the airship while it was docked. The mast was so strong that it was capable of supporting the weight of an entire hydrogen-filled airship, and required an extensive steel network of reinforcements and cables to be properly installed on the Empire State Building. The mooring mast was even designed to be weatherproof to be able to withstand high winds and other inclement weather.

Due to safety and structural concerns, dirigibles were not always allowed to dock at the Empire State Building. Pilots had to pass rigorous safety tests and obtain special personal permits issued by the building's management in order to dock an airship at the mooring mast. Additionally, the difficulty and expense in creating the mooring mast had to be weighed against the safety aspect of docking airships. 

In spite of the engineering challenges, the mooring mast was finally
