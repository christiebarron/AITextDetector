The Empire State Building was an impressive feat of architecture in its day, and there was a desire for dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. However, not all the obstacles facing the builders of the Empire State Building were related to the architecture. Innovative engineering was required to create a safe mooring for the dirigibles at the top of the building, and the builders faced a variety of significant obstacles in this effort.

The first obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced was creating a mast structure which was able to support the weight of a docked dirigible. The mast needed to be firmly anchored in the side of the building and be strong enough to withstand strong winds and other unpredictable weather events. This proved difficult as the mast had to be lightweight and not interfere with the supporting architecture of the building. To address this challenge, the builders designed a telescoping steel mast that could be raised and lowered as needed.

Another obstacle the builders faced was determining how the dirigibles could safely dock at the top of the building. Unlike airplanes, which can slow down and land on a tarmac, dirigibles lack this capability and therefore must use a mooring system. The builders had to decide on the best way to do this, and settled on a mooring mast system as the best solution. The mooring mast was made of a diamond-shaped frame with steel cables that was able to catch and hold the dirig
