I recently moved to a new neighborhood, and I was having difficulty meeting people and making friends. I was determined to make the best of the situation, however, and decided to be patient and give it time. 

A few weeks later, my neighbor invited me to a community barbecue. I was excited to finally get to know some of my new neighbors. At the barbecue, my shyness and anxiety quickly melted away, as everyone was so kind and welcoming. I found myself talking to new people, sharing stories and laughing. I was glad I had decided to be patient and give the move some time, as I had been able to build relationships and make friends within my new community.
