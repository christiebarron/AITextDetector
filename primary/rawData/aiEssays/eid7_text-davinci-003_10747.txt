I remember one time when I was in line at the grocery store and an elderly couple was in front of me. They seemed to be having difficulty at the checkout, and the cashier was taking a long time to help them. They were having a language barrier, and the cashier had to repeat the same thing several times so the couple could understand. Although it was taking a while and I had somewhere I needed to be, I stayed patient and waited my turn. I could tell the elderly couple was very grateful that I was being understanding. Eventually the cashier figured out how to help them and they moved on with their day. Even though I had to wait, I was glad that I was patient and showed understanding to the couple.
