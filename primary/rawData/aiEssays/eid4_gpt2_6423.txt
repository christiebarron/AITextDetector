The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because I didn't want to leave it too long. I'm working on a new book about it and I've got to make sure I get it ready. It's a lot like winter books.

Are you aware of or familiar with the way that you've been writing for so long that it's hard to get the attention of those who don't already look at it?

Well you think they probably already are. To have written it yourself you're really afraid of what people will think. The fact that it was so well read made it easy to do that, just because they had read it and that's what's the key you want to see in a book. I like when a book is very well written it can tell you something about people, too, that's the story of what really drove me when I was reading Rossi. I can feel the power to express that, to make such an impression. I can see myself writing it as an outsider.

You've had a lot of success writing about your children. What was it like growing up and how did you get involved as a writer for children?

It was kind of strange, really. I think they were only about 4 or 5 when a boy was born. It was probably as early as 8 or 9 when I wrote the first children's story for the first time, I have a little brother that just turned 16 on June 25th
