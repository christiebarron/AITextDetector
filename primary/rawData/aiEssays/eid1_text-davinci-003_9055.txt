To the Editor:

I am writing to opine on the effects computers have on people. Nowadays, computers are so prevalent in almost every area of our lives that it’s difficult to ignore their influence. While they have certain benefits, I believe that computers have had a largely negative impact on our lives, and I would urge your readers to consider this point.

The biggest concern I have is with the social effects computers have had. Too often we avoid meaningful interaction with one another in favor of communication via computers. Whether through text messages, video chats, or emails, we could all use more face-to-face interaction. By replacing physical interaction with digital alternatives we are damaging our relationships and our mental health.

The other issue I have with computers is the amount of time people waste on them. Whether it is spending hours a day watching YouTube videos, caught up in meaningless online debates, or scrolling through pictures on Instagram, our lives are being overwhelmed by computers. This wouldn’t be so problematic if people used this time to do productive things, but often it’s just wasted time.

While computers undoubtedly have their advantages, I strongly feel that the drawbacks far outweigh the benefits. I urge your readers to consider the effects of computers in their lives and strive for a more balanced approach. We should be conscious of our interactions and use computers to help us, not hinder us.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
