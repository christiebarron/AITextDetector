Dear Editor,

I would like to express my opinion on the effects of computers and technology on people.

In todayâ€™s world, computers have become an essential part of our everyday life. We rely on them for a variety of tasks, from communicating with friends and family, to finding information for research, to entertainment. While computers are undoubtedly beneficial in many ways, experiences have shown that they can also have an adverse effect on people if used and accessed inappropriately. 

For example, computers can cause mental health issues such as depression and anxiety. The Internet can be a dangerous place for children, with many of them exposed to cyberbullying and other dangerous activities. There are also potential physical side effects from too much computer use, such as poor posture due to hunching over a keyboard or developing "computer vision syndrome" from staring at a screen for long periods of time. 

Given the potential risks associated with computers, it is important for us to be mindful and ensure that we are taking necessary steps to protect ourselves and those around us. Developing effective habits to protect us online, such as regularly changing our passwords and keeping our devices locked when not in use, can help protect us from malicious activity
