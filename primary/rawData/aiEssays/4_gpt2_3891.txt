The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because the characters are back as they start to show their weaknesses more often. I loved the tone in here, especially when they all get involved with being more badass as they grow better as humans.

But what most impressed me during this series was a little book called "The Girl's Magic," which also shows the real-world struggles and problems this series faces when we read stories such as this. The idea of this series being about a beautiful magical girl who makes something and uses it to reach her goal of becoming the greatest warrior in all of history was truly quite appealing. The book could end as a couple of lines but I didn't expect that a few years of watching these characters struggle with being better than everyone else, especially with what they know. I got so hooked on this series that I ended up liking reading these characters. Some characters showed no signs of slowing down, others were even better.

It was also interesting to see what kind of people read these characters, so many of them, you've certainly seen a few. Some are heroes of the real world, some have some sort of bad luck at dealing with the magic, and sometimes some have terrible luck. I wouldn't call them like super heroes but I like the fact that they're so interesting, that they all end up getting more stories published and more fans (I think you can read all of these reviews about them and see them all, even after folders
