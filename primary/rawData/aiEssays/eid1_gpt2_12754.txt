Computers have many effects on people. For example, some people are less willing to spend time working on their work. These people might find work less time in other departments, or their workloads are not consistent with their interests (for example, they struggle with certain skills outside of their own field, such as computer architecture). More importantly, they may find there are too many other skills to work from without at home.

One such factor that can cause people to put their work off for good is that they have too much time behind them. Research on why these people often take long breaks has suggested that, after being away from home, many others are overworked or otherwise unable to manage their schedules.
