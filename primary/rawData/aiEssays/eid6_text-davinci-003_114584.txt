The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when allowing dirigibles to dock on the colossal skyscraper. Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s “The Mooring Mast” provides an extensive overview of the feat of engineering necessary to enable large aircraft to dock at the Empire State Building.

The primary challenge was the need for a strong and secure mooring mast that could handle the weight of a large dirigible. To tackle this issue, the builders created an 8-story steel mast towering above the observation deck. A large airship elevator was designed to haul the aircraft up from the ground to observe the skyscraper. This elevator, along with supporting structures, was built with a reinforced steel frame, held together by almost 600,000 rivets. 

The construction of the mooring mast was complicated by the fact that the observation deck was already completed, meaning the engineers had to design the new structures around existing material. They had to consider the weight of the mast while still ensuring it could remain securely attached to the building. The large elevator needed to be positioned so as to not overpower the existing structure, while remaining strong enough to withstand strong winds. The mooring mast was eventually approved, and the elevator was anchored to the observation deck and its walls.

In order to give the aircrafts clear access to the mast, the Empire State Building’s roof was extended by another 50 feet, bridging the gap between
