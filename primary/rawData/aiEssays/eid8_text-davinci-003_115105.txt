I remember the summer before my seventh-grade year like it was yesterday. We had just moved to a new neighborhood and our families were determined to make it work. Everyone was trying to get to know each other and to find common ground, so my family got together with our new neighbors to have a cookout on the first weekend.

We all tried to make small talk but it felt a bit awkward — like we were all the new kids in the cafeteria. After some time, the conversation lulled and there was a moment of silence that felt like it was going to last forever. That was until my brother casually said something witty and it immediately triggered a wave of laughter from every one of us.

The laughter filled the air and it was like a wave that kept on going, slowly washing away the tension that had been lingering and replacing it with joy. For the first time since meeting each other, we all felt really comfortable and connected. What started with my brother’s joke continued on for the rest of the night with us all telling our favorite jokes and laughing and having fun.

I think it’s true when they say laughter is the best medicine. That day was proof of that. From that moment on, laughter was what kept our friendship strong and connected us all. It was like a golden thread that held us together and helped us to become one big and happy family.
