The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first barrier was a section of the north wall blocking access to the East Side of New York City. The third barrier Reinhart found was under the center of the Empire State building, where the original construction of the Empire State Building was located, which made it difficult for the builders to dock.

The next barrier was beneath and across the ground. The last barrier, built through the fall of 1945 when the Empire State Complex came under attack by the Germans, closed both of those blocks open. It was discovered by a U.S. Navy shipwreck that had been submerged on Dec prosec of 1948 when many of the survivors of the Titanic sunk, as well as those on board, aboard a German submarine. One can only assume that much of the Empire State Building was completely destroyed during the first invasion of Japan.

Despite all of the obvious obstacles, the Chinese did manage to build some of the tallest structures in the world at their tallest.
