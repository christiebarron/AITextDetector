I was out with the girls and we had just finished a round of drinks at the bar. We were all in a good mood and ready to start having some fun. 

We decided to go to karaoke and sang along to all the classics. We were having a blast and everyone was starting to get a little bit crazy. 

Suddenly, one of my friends started telling an old joke. We all knew the punchline, but we laughed anyway. As we were laughing, she kept telling different versions of the joke, each one sillier than the last. We were all rolling with laughter, my sides were starting to hurt and the tears began streaming down my face. 

The karaoke host must have heard us, because he began to laugh too and before we knew it, the entire bar was filled with laughter. It was the best kind of bonding moment with my friends. We were all bound by our shared laughter and we knew in that moment that our friendship was strong. 

I still let out a chuckle whenever I think back on that night, and itâ€™s always a reminder of how powerful laughter can be.
