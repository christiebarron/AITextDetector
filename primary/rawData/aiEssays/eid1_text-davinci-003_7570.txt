The final line of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho is meant to symbolize the narrator's hope and determination. She is determined to pass the test in the spring and continue her studies and education. It is also a reminder of the power of nature to offer new hope each year, with the return of spring and the snows melting away. The hibiscus represents the promise of spring and the promise of what could come next, if she is determined and works hard.
