I was on vacation with my best friend last summer and we had such an incredible time. We were up late talking and the conversation suddenly shifted from our classwork to movies and TV shows we both liked. We started to tell each other our favorite jokes and started to laugh so loudly we both ended up in tears. 

As our laughter subsided, the room became so quiet that it was almost uncomfortable. I remember looking into her eyes and in that moment we both knew that we'd shared something really special. We started laughing again and it was one of those moments where you just can't help but keep laughing and you can't remember why you started laughing again in the first place. 

That night was one of the best nights of my life and I'm so thankful that we shared that moment together. I'll never forget how much joy I felt and how we were able to connect through laughter.
