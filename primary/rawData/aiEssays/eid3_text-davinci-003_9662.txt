The setting of “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski has a significant impact on the cyclist’s journey, from start to finish. The cyclist rides through hilly terrain, dense forest, desolate plains, and an ice-encrusted mountainside. Along the way, the cyclist is presented with numerous obstacles such as strong winds, steep terrain, and unpredictable weather.

Each features of the setting contributes to the challenge of the cyclist's journey. The hilly terrain creates an environment of climbing and descending hills, challenging the cyclist’s endurance and stability. Furthermore, the dense forest creates an environment of trees, brush, and other debris, which can lead to unexpected falls and injuries.
