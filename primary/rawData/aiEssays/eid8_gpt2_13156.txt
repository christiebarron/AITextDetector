One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was young and I was going on a cruise. A man was walking up and he was wearing an amazing hat with red stripes at the top. I had taken out a phone and I put it down. It was so funny to come out of a cruise. It's just as good as it sounds to me personally because it's so much more fun and it's so nice to be back home after all."

At the end of the day, she is happy to return to Europe and is looking forward to returning to her family in France once or twice a year to celebrate her mother's 90th birthday. If you find yourself wondering who will be visiting the UK in August, here is your chance (or should your head stop working after that...)

"I would say to my daughter that for the French people, it makes their life all a lot easier and brings out the best in everyone. I mean as long as they understand that we are French and we can live together, they can get along very well and be proud of us. So they make a life too! France is home for them! I'm sure all together, I hope that the next generation of French will think of France as a place that we can celebrate together."
