The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' by the man accused of having sexually assaulted her has brought up her fears for his safety, an Australian newspaper revealed on Friday.

He has pleaded guilty in Melbourne to three counts of sexual relation with a woman.

Prosecutors were due to decide whether he should be tried alongside 14 other charged men and women before next week's hearing at the Western Australian Crown Court.

Prosecutors allege Mr Williams had sexual contact with young girls across Western Australia in the 1990s and on the night of the 1991 Sydney Metro incident.

They say he sexually assaulted his victims for six weeks in the late 1990s. He was later jailed for 15 years, to be later released on a sexual offenders' register.

Prosecutors say Mr Williams could face up to two years in prison, along with seven years for counselling and sexual offences involving an adult woman.

He is also charged with one count of indecent liberties of a child under 18.

Judge Gary McLean said he was satisfied the sexual relations would be treated like crimes for which other charges were not in line with evidence.

The case was adjourned until July for trial following cross-examination by Deputy Prosecuting and Examiners Dr Jonathan Nelms, Justice of the Peace in Brisbane.
