The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Many would not see a single building in the main attraction, the massive John F. Kennedy tower, so they opted for the Empire State Building to stand alone. It was built in 1913 by James Connolly and was made a part of Nationwide Children's Hospital in Cleveland. The building was eventually placed on loan by the Carnegie Foundation in 1955.


One of the most successful building techniques used in building dirigibles was that of the flat on the building edge. A vertical piece of plywood was mounted on the top on which several strands of wire was woven. The wire then was hung onto the edge of the roofline as the two ends curled down to form the triangular center of the cylindrical structure. Another technique employed was that of the flat on the building edge. Wider wire was hung directly in front of the edge of the roofline, on opposite sides of the building. This technique was so successful, that U.S. senators would use it on Capitol Hill on the morning of the third anniversary of the building.
