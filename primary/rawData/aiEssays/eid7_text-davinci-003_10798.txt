I recall a time when I was at the grocery store gathering my weekly items. I proceeded to the check out line only to find that there was an elderly man in front of me that seemed to have difficulty counting the money on his debit card. As the line got longer and longer, I watched the cashier with patience and understanding. With a gentle smile, he assured the man that he was being taken care of and asked us all for our patience. After a few moments, the man finally got the transaction completed and I stepped up to the register. I thanked both the elderly man and the cashier for their patience and continued on with my day.
