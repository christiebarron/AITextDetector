The challenge of installing a mooring mast for dirigibles at the now-famous Empire State Building in Manhattan was hugely ambitious and has since become a unique part of the building’s history. In ‘The Mooring Mast’ by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the numerous obstacles encountered by the construction team are outlined in great detail.

The mooring mast would have allowed for the mass transportation of goods quickly, safely, and efficiently throughout Manhattan. In order for this to function, the mooring mast was designed to extend from the Empire State Building’s 83rd floor, 1,050 feet above the ground. However, the building was already occupied, so the team had to work fast and be incredibly precise. The mechanics of constructing something of such length and complexity, while tenants remained in the building and businesses continued to operate, was a Herculean effort.

The weight of the mooring mast was another major obstacle. If it weighed too much, the building’s structure may have been put at risk; if it was too light, it would not have been able to sustain the strong winds of the passenger dirigibles attempting to dock. The mooring mast had to be an ingenious combination of strength and flexibility. The team worked around the clock to make sure every part of the mooring mast’s frame was up to standard.

Perhaps the greatest of problems the team faced was
