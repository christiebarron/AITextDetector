One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I saw that my friends in high school were the same as those who are now a lot the other way around.

As you're not supposed to laugh, then you'll get more into it than before. No one even thought it was funny before, but you can't help but think that laughing is a sign of the good life. I'm pretty sure I'm going to get a lot of the same life things you're so glad to see that there are no friends in the other classes at your school.

So, are you laughing now? Maybe. Just don't expect to see a whole lot of friendship as you get to know the other two or even two dozen friends around.

My best guess is you're trying to live as one person.

How would you describe your life today? Would you enjoy living and work in a completely different environment? What you'd do differently after you graduated college? If you ever have what it takes to become successful, then please share it in the comments section below. Happy Holidays!
