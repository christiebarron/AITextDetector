The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

• The National Park Service and City and County of New York provided a free permit to a construction crew who had been tasked with removing all of the structures. But the permit was denied due to concerns that if the permit went against Federal or State law, it would be enforced against the workers.

• In 2008, the Federal Highway Administration gave permission for a tunnel that will carry cargo from the Empire State Building to Brooklyn's Williamsburg Airport. But a legal battle ensued at a federal court. After more than a year of litigation, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman dropped the case after complaints of excessive government intrusion into government contracts.

• In April 2013, a federal judge agreed to hear the case. On Jan. 30, the district court in New York agreed to stop enforcing the ban. But the judge has since agreed to allow the construction contractor to keep his permit, despite a lack of court order.

• On May 6, 2015, a federal judge in Seattle granted New York's request to end the ban.

• A Federal Civil Rights Commission hearing is underway in Manhattan.
