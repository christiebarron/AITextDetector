The Empire State Building is an iconic skyscraper located in New York City, that was built in 1930. The original design of the building included a mooring station for dirigibles, or large airships, at the very top of the building. As Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted examines in her book, The Mooring Mast, the construction of this mooring mast ran into several different obstacles.

One of the first challenge faced by the builders of the Empire State Building was the design of the mooring mast, which had to be strong and versatile enough to support the large ships. To that end, the engineers chose to construct the mast out of steel and reinforced concrete, making it strong even with the intense wind and air pressure the dirigible would have to endure. Additionally, the mast had to have a curved design to help guide the dirigibles into its docking position.

The second challenge the builders of the Empire State Building faced was making sure the mooring station was located in the correct place. The mast was too short to be able to reach the airspace above the Empire State Building, so in order to ensure that the dirigibles could dock safely, the mast was extended to nearly 435 feet by the time it was finished.

The next and most important challenge that builders of the Empire State Building faced was making sure the mast could safely accommodate dirigibles of all sizes and shapes. The complex shape of the dirigibles
