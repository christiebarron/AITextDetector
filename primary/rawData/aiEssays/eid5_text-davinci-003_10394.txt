The memoir ‘From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives’ by Narciso Rodriguez is an invigorating, intimate exploration of his complex relationship with his Cuban heritage. Through his personal narrative, Rodriguez weaves a powerful tapestry of emotion that evokes feelings of warmth, nostalgia and longing.

The memoir begins with a vivid description of Rodriguez’s childhood, from the smells of his childhood kitchen to the sounds of his mother’s voice. There is a palpable sense of nostalgia here, of fond memories and a longing for a simpler time. This nostalgia for his childhood home is a pervasive theme throughout the memoir and is reflected in Rodriguez’s wistful, reflective tone, which evokes a sense of melancholia. 

Rodriguez expresses a deep respect and admiration for his home country, consistently referring to it in reverential terms. This reverence is palpable in his descriptions of Cuban life, culture and people and conveys a feeling of rootedness, a feeling that there is an essential part of Rodriguez that is irrevocably linked to his home country. 

The mood of the memoir shifts as it progresses, moving away from wistful nostalgia to one of determination and appreciation for his home and his place in the world. This shift is underlined by Rodriguez’s unwavering commitment to recognize his Cuban heritage and pay homage to it in his work.
