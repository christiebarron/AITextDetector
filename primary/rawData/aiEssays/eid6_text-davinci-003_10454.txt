The Empire State Building was the pinnacle of innovation and engineering when it was built in 1931. Its construction was no small feat, and the completion of the building was marked by their ambition to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. It was an ambitious goal that ultimately resulted in the building of a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building. 

The Empire State Building was a perfect choice for what was to be the first mooring mast in the United States. It was a technically adequate structure, standing at an impressive 1,454 feet with sufficient open space at the top to accommodate a dirigible and the necessary mooring gear. Despite the obvious potential to make this endeavor a success, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of obstacles in their attempt to accomplish the feat.

One of their biggest challenges dealt with the engineering. The plans for the mooring mast had to be modified to accommodate the deck of the dirigible. The mast had to be strengthened to bear the weight of the dirigible in its extended position, and the cable systems had to be revised to ensure a safe and secure docking. 

In addition to the engineering challenges, the builders of the Empire State Building had to develop a solid plan for the transport of passengers and freight via dirigible. This required them to carefully review the access points and landing areas as well as plan for the logistics of delivering passengers and cargo safely to their destination.
