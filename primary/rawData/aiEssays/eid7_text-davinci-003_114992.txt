Everyone experiences days that challenge their patience. I remember a time I had to be incredibly patient. It was the summer before my senior year of high school and I was applying for a job as a lifeguard at my local pool.

I applied and I was called in for an interview that went really well. The manager was very pleased with my experience and told me he was going to put my application on the pool's hiring board. He said the process would take some time and that he would be in touch with me when the board had reviewed my application.

I was so excited for the job, but I had to wait. And wait. Weeks passed and I heard nothing back from the manager. I was a little frustrated and I wanted to let him know I was still interested in the job. 

I decided to be patient and wait a few more weeks and putting my enthusiasm on hold. Finally, after a month of waiting, the manager called me and offered me the job.

I was ecstatic to have the job, but I knew I was only offered the job when I demonstrated patience. The lesson I learned stays with me to this day: patience is a virtue that often pays off.
