Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

Firstly they look at the number of wheel forces, ie in the centre this is how many you have to reduce under braking or increase when moving forward. The more wheel forces, the bigger the change in stopping speed and this is an indicator of a bad braking situation.

Secondly they also look at other factors â€“ for example in the mean time when braking down (from start to finish). This shows the number of times you must use force and this affects the number of trips and trips you must keep in your car, especially if you do not take charge of the car. The better the braking state the better.

The good news is that these methods are very precise and often take the cyclist into account.

But a slightly different picture is seen when you choose to put them together.

If the cycling conditions are well balanced you could still improve braking state and thus you might not have a significant drop in stopping speed.

But in other situations it can be a little challenging to find the right setting.

When driving on rough roads this makes for a more relaxed situation where braking is always in your control. Especially if you plan on cycling a little bit, and have a limited amount of wheel forces.

A closer look at this can tell if the conditions are very right for you; such is that tyre-type braking or not.
