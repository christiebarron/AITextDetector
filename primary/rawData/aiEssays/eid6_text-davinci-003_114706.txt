At the opening of the Empire State Building in 1931, the most remarkable feature was its ability to allow dirigibles to dock at the 102nd-floor mooring mast, an engineering feat that had been long awaited. However, the project of constructing a dock for dirigibles was wrought with obstacles, particularly in the face of the numerous technical issues and safety concerns that had to be addressed. As detailed in Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s The Mooring Mast, constructing a dock for dirigibles at such a height presented numerous unique engineering challenges.

Structurally, the mooring mast needed to be strong enough to withstand the force of the dirigibles docking and undocking, as well as the wind and strong gusts of air that often occurred in New York City. As lighter-than-air crafts, the docking procedure for dirigibles also posed a unique engineering challenge. To dock the dirigibles, the Empire State Building had to be outfitted with a system of secured cables and tension springs that could support the weight of the craft and keep it in place.

Additionally, the docking procedure at the mooring mast also addressed important safety issues. Because the mooring mast was located 872 feet in the sky, builders had to design the dock to ensure that the dirigibles didn’t collide with the building or with each other in case of a sudden gust of wind. Architects and engineers built the m
