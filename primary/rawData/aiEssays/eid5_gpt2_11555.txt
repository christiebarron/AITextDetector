The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is that the book's focus was on the real and how things felt in the world. "We were both so happy that the world was right, and so we used words to describe who we were," he writes. He then turns to the book, which is based on some of his own experiences as well as stories about other people in their lives.

At times, he makes it seem as though some of the stories are completely wrong — for example, about the 'bad dog', who's a racist, is portrayed unfairly in the book. But for those who wish to read more about his interactions with those he believes are victims of slavery, it's difficult; it's not too much to read about his relationship with his partner's father (he denies this is part of the book), but he did not hide his sexual feelings for the parents of a slain black boy in the 1970s, and his subsequent relationship with his girlfriend (he told her he loved her), and the lack of support during his struggle with depression and mental illness (he refused to take psychiatric medication due to depression). He also had to endure his own trauma, like his own childhood, which went beyond the book. During each chapter, he told his story, and made people realize that, although he wasn't saying anything in that memoir — because he said it too often — his experiences in real life were not what motivated him to write the book.
