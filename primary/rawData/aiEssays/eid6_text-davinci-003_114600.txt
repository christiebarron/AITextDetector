The Empire State Building was iconic for its role in popularizing the American “skyscraper” concept and was once slated to accept dirigibles, or large airships, for docking. Unfortunately, due to a variety of difficulties, the plan never came to fruition. The major obstacles facing the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock relate to the small-scale technologies available to them and the airship’s unique size and design.

One of the largest challenges of accommodating dirigibles for mooring was the availability of suitable technologies to construct the airship’s dock. At the time, the hydraulic systems necessary to raise and lower vertical lift masts were still relatively rare, and land-based construction options were limited. The existing mooring mast consisted of two large masts for airships to tie-off and could only accommodate single point mooring, which was notoriously unreliable and would not have been practical for regular docking of dirigibles. The sheer size of dirigibles also complicated the situation, as cradles typically used for aircraft were deemed too small, and the existing platform would have been unable to support the heavier airships.

While some railed against the idea of having dirigibles dock on the Empire State Building, with safety being the primary concern, the basic truth was that the proper equipment and technology were simply not available to make it possible. The lack of suitable designs for
