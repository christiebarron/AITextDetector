Computers have many effects on people.

In the early 2000s, a computer built from components made from lithium was discovered on the California coast. Researchers had suspected the building had already been fabricated a million times and they immediately set about to check on and study it. For almost 2 years, they looked for traces of lithium-ion batteries in the sediment from every point on the planet.

The scientists found traces of hydrogen and zinc in some of the sediment below the site which is considered a natural geological layer. In the mid 2000s, they set about to find out what the exact chemistry of these materials is.

But they couldn't find that out.

"The sediment had not been observed since the 1970s. And there was no clue about the composition in place," recalls Jeff Davis from the University of California at Berkeley. "This made it very difficult to get a real sense of the chemical structure of the sediment."

When the University of California at Davis scientist Dr. Eric Schoenbach analyzed the sediment samples, he found that there was a big difference between the results of his lab and what their collaborators had seen in the sediment.

The scientists had found that lithium-ion batteries come in four different types. Lithium is a mineral composed of three parts in three parts, lithium is a compound of three parts in three parts, and lithium bromide is a compound of six parts in one part. The results of Dr. Davis's lab
