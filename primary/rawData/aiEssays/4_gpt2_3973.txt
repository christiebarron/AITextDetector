The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because the main characters die. They're not at their best, they still are in good stead. On one level this is really nice…but it ends up being a long slog that you just can't go back to, even if it gives you motivation to continue. It had to be done this way, and it was done this time, which is kind of a shame, but it was a nice finish.

In "The Sword of the Red Hand," they are called assassins and the main protagonist was only a normal kid. He's a thief from a wealthy family who tries to steal the "Sith Sword" from the town that he runs: The Red Hand at night where the Sword of the Red Hand was first placed. The book is mostly a collection of pages of information, including a couple of new characters and the town that was eventually destroyed by the Red Hand. That being said, they are still really good.

They also return to their primary heroes, the Red Hand and the Swordsman, and are joined by the Black Nobles, the Assassins, and the White Knights.

The story ends with a mysterious white knight who falls into darkness. The swordsman's name is Gokor and he was actually given to his lover instead…. He can't do that, he is dead.

When the book was released it was available in over 60 languages, including Chinese, French, Russian, Japanese
