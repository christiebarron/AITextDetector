Dear Editor,

I write to express my opinion on the impact that computers have had on people’s lives. In our increasingly digital world, computers are becoming more and more integral to our lives, and as a result, their influence has grown exponentially.

While they have revolutionized many aspects of our lives, it is also important to acknowledge the potential risks associated with computers. For one, there is the potential for digital distraction, as more people become increasingly entrenched in an online world. Also, with the prevalence of online communication, people’s attention to traditional social etiquette has been severely diminished, impacting the way people interact with each other.

At the same time, though, computers have also provided immense benefits. Through their sheer convenience and connection to vast amounts of information and resources, they can significantly expedite daily tasks and allow us to access knowledge like never before. Additionally, computers can provide invaluable connections, as they allow us to communicate with people from all over the world and cultivate meaningful relationships.

It is clear, then, that computers have had positive effects on people and their lives, though this should be balanced by the potential negative effects. I urge readers to consider both sides of the debate in order to gain a holistic view on the impact computers have had on our lives.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
