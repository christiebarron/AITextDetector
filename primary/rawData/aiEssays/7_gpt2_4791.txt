An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when we'd travel on a cruise ship. Sometimes it was four hours in the sun, sometimes it was two hours in the sun

We were at the same pier every week. It was hot and the water was all wet. The crew came back each day with us and brought in buckets that were huge. We had a pretty clean water supply and we could all sleep comfortably.

At one point, we got caught in a storm and had to wait six hours at a time for people to return. Our boat was so filthy it was all washed up. We'd go to church or go to dinner and then someone would get out of the boats. I think the only time that we used to leave for those two hours at a time was during the day when we were in the shower. It was disgusting.

How do you feel today that I've seen so much positive light in the last three years?

We're talking about 50 percent positive, and that's the best thing about it. It feels great now. The other part of that was that people are still talking to me about the life changes I've made in the last year and a half.
