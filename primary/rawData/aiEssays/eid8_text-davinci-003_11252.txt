I was meeting my new roommate for the upcoming school year. As I nervously entered the room and introduced myself, I couldn't help but notice how my roommate was also feeling the same nerves. After introducing ourselves, we were both standing there in an awkward silence. I knew I had to break the tension and just as I opened up my mouth to say something, my roommate bent down and started busting up into laughter.

At first, I didn't know what was so funny, but soon I was laughing too. Soon we were both hysterical and I felt as if the walls between us were being broken down. We ended up talking for hours. The conversation never really stopped and I ended up loving my new roommate, who I eventually got to know as one of my closest friends.

We laugh together all the time now and I know that laughter started it all. To this day, I will always be grateful for the laughing that started our friendship off right.
