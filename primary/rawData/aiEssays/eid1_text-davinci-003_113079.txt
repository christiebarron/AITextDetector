Dear Editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Now, more than ever, people rely on computers for their daily lives. People can accomplish tasks, shop online, find entertainment, store information, and access knowledge from various sources. 

While these tasks hope to make life easier, there is no denying the fact that computers have the potential to cause psychological and physical health risks. For example, spending a long time sitting in front of the computer screen can cause stiffness and stress in the eyes, neck, and wrists. Additionally, excessive use of computers is linked to increased risk of anxiety and depression in adults and children. 

With this in mind, it is important to recognize that computers can be used for both good and bad. We should not be so quick to demonize computers, as they can effectively be used to improve education, communication and research opportunities. We can utilize computers as tools to help us solve problems and improve quality of life. However, the only way to achieve this is to set reasonable limits for our computer use. 

Therefore, I urge readers to recognize the benefits and the risks associated with computer use. A balanced and well-regulated approach to computer use can help us maximize the benefits while avoiding any potential harms. Thank you for your time. 

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
