One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was in sixth grade. I had no idea what had brought it on... and no one would tell me! No one would explain. So, when my teacher asked me, "You need to do this, you poor dog... tell them what you saw. This is the way you can have fun, because not everyone takes that to a wholehearted level... the teacher probably takes offense at your behavior if you do not show yourself."

That's what I am.

I was fortunate enough to meet the author of this blog, Richard Harris, as well as several other artists and illustrators as part of my series on creativity. He is truly a master of this art form and I am grateful for the work you are doing, and if you feel compelled to support me in making this video, you can do so by turning a few dollars at www.designeroftheart.com.
