The Empire State Building has long held a fascination for its monumental size and grandeur, and especially for the concept of dirigible docking, which was built into the building by its architects. While the idea of allowing airships to moor was appealing to many, the reality of the obstacles which had to be overcome to make this idea a reality proved to be a difficult challenge.

The most significant obstacle facing the builders of the Empire State Building was the height and weight of the building itself. Although they had originally designed the building to support the weight of many dirigibles, it was not until the completion of the building that it became clear the structure was simply not structurally sound enough for the airship traffic they intended. As a result, it soon became apparent that additional steel had to be added to the design. 

An additional obstacle was the matter of how to safely accommodate the dirigibles. The space available above open areas, such as Central Park, was not sufficient to hold more than a few dirigibles and was out of the question anyway due to the inherent dangers those crafts posed in densely populated areas. Therefore, the only option was to moor the airships to buildings. 

In the case of the Empire State Building, engineers set about creating a device known as a mooring mast. This required them to build two sets of reinforced columns with which a docking cable could be attached in order to properly secure the dirigible. The m
