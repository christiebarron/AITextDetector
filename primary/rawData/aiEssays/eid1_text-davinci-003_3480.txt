To the Editor,

In this age of ever-increasing technology, computers have become a near ubiquitous part of our lives. I believe that this increased reliance on computers has had both positive and negative effects on the people of our world, and that it is important to be aware of both when considering the effects of this technology.

On the plus side, computers have vastly increased the amount of information available to people. Through the Internet, people can access unlimited resources within a matter of seconds. This access to knowledge and other types of resources has opened up a world of possibilities to those who seek it, helping them to grow and expand their horizons.

At the same time, computers can be a danger when used excessively or in isolation from real-world relationships. They can lead to social withdrawal, loss of motivation, and physical health risks due to lack of movement and exercise caused by spending long hours in front of a screen.

In order to ensure the potential benefits of computer use while avoiding its risks, I understand the need for moderation and control. I believe that the key to reaping the rewards of computer use is to keep it in balance with other activities and to ensure that time is spent away from the screen
