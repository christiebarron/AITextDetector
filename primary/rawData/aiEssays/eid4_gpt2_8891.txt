The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because of a series of events â€” such as George Orwell's 1984 and an ongoing series of articles written by Harry Potter author Nicholas Shkreli, which include quotes from the book.

The Guardian (UK) reported on Snowden's leaks at the beginning of the month:

"The National Security Agency has been ordered by former British Prime Minister George Osborne and the UK's secret court of justice to send an application for the case against former Washington Post reporter Glenn Greenwald as the subject of public interest protection orders in the UK."

The Guardian also reported on former CIA analyst Edward Snowden, who leaked NSA documents on foreign surveillance for the mass surveillance of telecommunications users at the US-run Central Intelligence Agency's National Security Agency.

Snowden, who is believed to have made the documents public, spent six months in the US, where he fled late during a three-hour raid in 2011 and spent a year hiding out in Ecuador.

On Friday the Guardian revealed what it described as a "massive cache of emails" had also been recovered from Snowden's home. The Guardian report said the cache, which is worth $1.1 million, was recovered from an iPhone, iPad and laptop in Hong Kong as it traveled throughout its length, while the mobile phone from the location was accessed by the US National Security Agency.
