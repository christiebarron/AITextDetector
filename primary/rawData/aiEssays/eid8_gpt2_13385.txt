One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was in England. When the boys got into cricket I'd be out here playing cricket on the road with my friends. A very different experience. And I think that this is something we'll always remember fondly—one of the most important things in my life, for some kids—but also for me personally." What is it like to play for England? "It's good to be there. It's really hard. There's a lot of hard work to do."
