An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my father, who I met years ago and who was about 35-years-old. He had been very ill since early 1996 with cancer. At that time I knew I was ill as a child and was going to be in a hospice care or hospice fellowship. My father was an early adoptee, and it was his first time seeing someone I had cared for and care for. I think now that we are nearing that anniversary I feel pretty fortunate that that person is able to show all of me how much I care for myself and his family. I'm still not sure what else may have happened to my father. I hope that my father will not have to go, but he has already passed on so if you know what he has to do, please help him. Thank you, Tom.

On this specific point: I still have a message from a friend that came to me after much research and much prayer. She took to her blog over the past several years and, while I hope it gives hope for the life lost, I do hope it helps those of us who have spent more than our fair share of our time with others living with cancer to be able to connect with each other at all times. I'm sure that from this point forward she's going to continue to live a life that can last her entire life. It's a living life. Her story should be very much worth sharing, even
