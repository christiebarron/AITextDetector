The Empire State Building was an impressive feat of engineering when it was opened in 1931, but the team behind the construction faced a difficult task in allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. This project presented a number of obstacles that had to be overcome in order for the plan to be successful. 

The first obstacle was the design of the Empire State Building itself. Because of its height, any mooring mast affixed to it would need to be exceptionally tall in order to be difficult for dirigibles to reach, and the building was not originally designed to accommodate anchors for such a gripping system. As a result, engineers had to come up with creative designs for the mooring mast and its associated anchoring system that could withstand the strong winds and height of the building. 

The second obstacle for the project was the weight of the mooring mast and anchors. The mooring mast, which would also need to be made of a lightweight material in order to minimize drag on the airship, was expected to be twice as heavy as the airship and anchor combined. This weight restriction made it difficult to construct a mooring mast to safely support the airship.

The next challenge was ensuring the mooring mast was strong enough to support the airship, as turbulent winds could lift the airship off its anchored position. Engineers had to design cable grips for the airships that were strong and secure enough to be able
