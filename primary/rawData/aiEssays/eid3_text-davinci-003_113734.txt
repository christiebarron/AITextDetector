The setting of Joe Kurmaski’s ‘Rough Road Ahead’ is an important factor that influences the cyclist’s experience and story. At the beginning of the story, the cyclist is presented with a wide range of terrain. The Route is described as ‘rolling hills’, which implies a combination of long flat sections and short, steep hills. The combination of the physical terrain and the length of the route creates an intense fatigue, which increases as the ride progresses. The setting also includes a 'heavy wind', which not only creates a physical challenge for the cyclist, but also serves as a metaphor for the struggle that the cyclist faces in carrying on through the ride.

The scenic surroundings of nature, in contrast to the urban environment, are also mentioned in the story. The mossy grey rocks, lush, emerald foliage and dark pines create an atmosphere where the cyclist can appreciate the nature and beauty that is absent in the cities. This provides a place for the cyclist to find inner peace and gain a sense of perspective, in contrast to the grueling physical task that is taking place. 

The mountainous terrain, heavy wind and natural beauty are all features of the setting that affects the cyclist in different ways. By incorporating these factors into the story, it accentuates the emotional and physical struggle that the cyclist has to overcome in order to complete the ride. It serves to add a layer of reality that is lacking in most cycling stories
