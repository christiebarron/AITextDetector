An example of a time someone in my life was patient was how a guy in my life was a patient because he did his job well. So you could have that same patient and then that person was doing the next job too. So it's almost like having a selfless person.

Practicality

There are so many practical things that a person with a chronic illness can do. You have to deal with them individually. You have to come up with some things that are good and other things that are just not good. The real questions we ask ourselves every day are, "How can I provide all this help to people? How can I raise my own family, to support the family that I love? How can I make my baby as rich and be as happy as possible? What can I do for my family that will make them happy? How can we make them feel good when they die? What can I do for our family before they are gone? Some things you can do, but sometimes you want to do things that are really good to create a certain kind of feeling between your own parents which can be quite difficult for children to do.

To me, the best way to see through the idea that it's like this is to have a selfless person you can bring up your family. It gives us a little bit of peace of mind and something to think about because just a little bit can mean life, but then in the next moment, the next day
