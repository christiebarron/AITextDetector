Dear Editor: 

I am writing to express my opinion on the effect of computers on people. My opinion is that computers have had a positive overall effect on people, and I would like to explain why I believe this to be true.

First and foremost, computers have greatly increased efficiency in the workplace. Previously, it would take days or even weeks to research a topic or complete a project. Nowadays, with computing tools, this process has been drastically shortened. Computers have allowed people to work smarter and get more done in less time. 

Additionally, computers have opened up a world of opportunities for people to stay connected online. Social media sites, email, and instant messaging allow us to interact and keep in touch with people from all over the world. In a way, computers have helped bring people closer together. 

Finally, computers have greatly improved our access to education. Online classes and study materials are now available to anyone with an internet connection. This means that knowledge is more accessible than ever before. 

Given all that computers have done for us, it is safe to say that they have had a positive effect on people around the world. I hope that this letter has persuaded your readers to agree with me. 
 
Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
