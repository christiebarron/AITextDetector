I’ve always been someone who loves to laugh and I believe that it can be one of the best ways of connecting with other people. This was particularly evident recently when I went out for a meal with my friend. We hadn’t seen each other for a while and I was a little nervous about how the conversation would unfold. I didn’t need to worry though, as without needing to prompt it, we just seemed to find ourselves in a hilarious conversation.

Before we’d even finished our meals, the two of us were laughing and joking like old times. We shared stories, found humor in the mundane and made jokes at each other’s expense! In that moment, I felt a connection with my friend that words couldn’t express. I knew that we had built a bond through our laughter and it just felt so special to be among people for whom laughter was the norm.

As time went by, I began to see more and more how important laughter can be when connecting with people. It can break down barriers, spark conversations and help to create a unique bond that will last a lifetime. Laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people and I love it for that reason.
