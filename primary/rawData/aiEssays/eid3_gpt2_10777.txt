Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. When we start with a flat I take a small break and start taking some turns on the pavements. I often stay in these places, the more I think about what's going on in the road â€“ I'm not planning to park there and the cycling is fine. So I look around at the roads and have an idea of what is going on. If I am late I feel bad. If I'm late too late I feel angry. If I am late I find myself really annoyed. If I am late I am very upset and, when I am late, I get very little to be happy about. I get very little attention.

How do you feel about these places of interest in the roads in question, as compared to other places in the city?

When you say that people love the road and love it, what you mean is that the locals know of it. Everyone has their own opinion, their own prejudices, and there is not one person who is not in favour of the road. So I think that those people who are here are just interested in getting out of the way of this crap. I think that our friends are interested in enjoying the road. When the kids are playing or playing or walking down busy streets there is no place for them to go at the same time. We just enjoy living here and not looking back. It is the only place we have.
