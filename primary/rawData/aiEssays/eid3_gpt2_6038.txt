Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. On the other hand, a wider range of options exists for people to see what they would drive or cycle and what sort of bike they might choose. A wider range of options seems to work for my wife and I. We spend a good portion of our days driving around the country, sometimes taking off on the way or on foot. The main difference between travelling on a motorbikes and on a bicycles is that you have a bigger scope for your use. Our motorbikes have a bigger range of motion options in terms of the ability to stay there, stay up and go fast. But what we do with a wider range of alternatives, though, comes down to how we view the cycling experience. How far along are we on a given curve, given how long it takes us to get to, say, Dublin, or Cork, and how much distance do we charge people when we park, how far up the road we cross each other with our bikes and so on? How many times a week does the cycle go round with us? The answer to each of this can be taken as follows: how many hours on day one and how quickly we can park a car, a bus, or an SUV, because there's a larger space available, and how much distance is there between us.

From now on, we'll call this 'the cycling landscape'. This will include the cycling lanes available
