The construction of the Empire State Building was an impressive feat of engineering and symbolised the height of New York City’s progress in the early 20th century. The original plans included a mooring mast to allow dirigibles (airships) to dock. Although the idea of a mooring mast for dirigibles seemed to bridge dreams of the future with the possibilities presented by modern engineering, the builders on the Empire State Building faced several obstacles which prevented the addition of the mooring mast.

The first was the obvious constraints of building with materials that had not been invented a few years before. At the time of the Empire State Building’s construction (1920’s), steel and concrete were the only materials available for such a large structure. Steel was lightweight yet very strong, making it an ideal material to use in construction, but the big problem facing the builders was structural integrity. Due to its strong weight, construction of a mooring mast which could support an immense dirigible-like USS Los Angeles was a challenge; even though the mooring mast wasn’t required to support the weight of the airship, it needed to be strong enough to resist the natural sway of the airship. 

The second obstacle was one of practicality. Placing the mooring mast so high up on the building would involve significant changes to the building’s original structure. This would mean closing off sections of the building
