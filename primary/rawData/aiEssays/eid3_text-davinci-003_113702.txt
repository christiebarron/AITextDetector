In Joe Kurmaski's short story, "Rough Road Ahead," the setting plays a critical role in developing the cyclist's journey. Set in the desert landscape of the Southwest United States, the setting sets the tone for danger, mystery, and fear for the cyclist. 

The sandy terrain, dotted with tumbleweeds and cacti, is an eerie environment that adds a sense of desolation and mystery to the cyclist's ride. This vast and seemingly never-ending landscape also conveys a sense of loneliness and hopelessness, conditions the cyclist must confront alone. The sparsely populated landscape forces the cyclist to depend only on himself. 

Further adding to the sense of danger, the setting exposes the cyclist to the ever-changing desert weather. The blazing sun allows no relief, and its unrelenting heat creates the risk of heat exhaustion and dehydration. The cyclist must also prepare for changing weather conditions, as a quickly approaching storm is described at the beginning. 

The unique features of the setting allow Joe Kurmaski to set the tone for the danger, mystery, and fear that the cyclist must confront. The sandy terrain, desolate landscape, and ever-changing weather conditions all contribute to the mysterious journey the cyclist must embark on. The setting conveys a sense of desolation and loneliness as the cyclist confronts unknown danger.
