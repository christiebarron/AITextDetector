The setting of “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski heavily affects the cyclist throughout the story. The cyclist faces several pathbreaking challenges such as uphill climbs, curvy hills, and rocky surfaces due to the rough terrain entailed in the setting of the story. As a result, these factors of the setting affect the cyclist due to the fact that it makes it increasingly difficult for them to keep up pace.

As the cyclist positions himself to ascend up a steep incline, they are met with serious challenges due to the setting. Exhaustion is soon to follow due to the intensity of the climb and lack of food and water. The cyclist is also met with a plethora of obstacles due to the setting of the story, forcing them to slow down and losing sight of the hoped-for objective. From time to time, the cyclist also has to pause for a few moments in order to catch their breath and relax their exhausted legs. 

Additional challenges lie before the cyclist due to the rough terrain of the setting. As they learn to adjust their pace to navigate the rocky and curvy roads, they are met with many sudden changes in the environment. At times, the cyclist finds themselves pushing their limits, in order to make it to the top of a hill or even prevent themselves from crashing. 

Overall, the setting of the story heavily affects the cyclist. Through each obstacle they face, the cyclist is tested mentally as well as physically.
