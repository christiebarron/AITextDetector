The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They had not designed and built enough dirigibles to enable a wide variety of functions.

In the 1930s, the government issued permits, which required that the owner install only a single-beam crane capable of moving 1,440 tons of material weighing 1,150 kilograms and producing 1,880 tons of force. (They did not specify where their plans for the bridge might come from.) For the majority of years, all of those permits were obtained without government approval. After three attempts in 1928-29, in which they got a two-year permit for the bridge, the government finally granted a seven-year permit for the bridge in 1959.

On January 19, 1972, after the collapse of World Trade Center One, the Federal Communications Commission held hearings and made recommendations. One of those recommendations was to remove the requirement to mount a single-beam crane. It worked. By March 1974, the bridge was moving 8,200 tonsâ€”just over 40 pounds a day. However, because there would be fewer and less of them to transport material, the only way for a 1,440-ton span to move all the way to the second-story would be something much harder than one-billion pounds a day.

In 1975, the State Department designated the bridge to be used as a national monument and proposed its construction starting on Dec. 31, 1975, and moving back to
