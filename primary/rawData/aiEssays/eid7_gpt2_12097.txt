An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I first got to study with a doctor, I just did some tests to see if I was doing it right. I told her I thought I had done it properly. She thought I was doing it wrong. She gave me the results, it worked and I feel great.

One of the goals of the study is to bring more of the "gut feeling" of being in a hospital, rather than seeing someone who you don't want to be. What she did was, if you walk into the room, to ask why you should be in an ER and the patient says you're afraid of your health, and you don't care. There's nothing wrong with that, and I think that's a really good thing to have in your health care plan.

My life is different, and I know how much care it takes for me to understand how my condition is in general and specifically my diagnosis by doing it. I do a lot of that work in my day to day life, but I try to do it on a regular basis. I go to a regular hospital, I go to a regular doctor's office, I do an exercise session every four to six weeks, and I go to work.

Because of what happened, I got to know who I am, I knew who my condition was in a very tangible way and how much I need, who I feel like I need to have.
