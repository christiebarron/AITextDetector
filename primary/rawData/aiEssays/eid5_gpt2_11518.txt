The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is also seen at the funeral of the late American writer and artist Jack Dorsey.

The US Army on Saturday denied the allegations against the soldier, claiming he had left his base without warning and that he wasn't in the military for any military purpose.

The soldier was assigned to the 1st U.S. Infantry Battalion, 4th Infantry Regiment, near Atlanta, Georgia and posted on a base near Bataan, near Mindanao, was killed after being fired upon on Monday by about 30 militants from a motorcycle gang.

However officers and special agents have been trying for weeks to track down Dorsey's whereabouts. During their investigation they are looking into what sparked the attack.

Dorsey was found hanging in the Army base after he left the base and was found in the field before he was killed.

He was shot twice in the chest and taken to a local hospital for further treatment.

Dorsey was never heard from again and had not been seen by family and friends until Sunday. His widow called in for his body on Sunday night.

The U.S. Army's spokesman said: "As with all soldiers and their families, it is deeply troubling that this issue was never brought to our attention.

"The unit is following the instructions from their superiors and is cooperating fully with our investigators, in this case the Special Service Task Force."
