The setting of Joe Kurmaski's poem, "Rough Road Ahead," plays a significant role in influencing the cyclistâ€™s experiences. Through the use of imagery, Kurmaski paints a vivid picture of a desolate, sun-filled desert that serves as the backdrop to the rider's journey. The hot, dry air, scattered debris, and deserted landscape create an atmosphere of desolation and exhaustion, which are further heightened by the effect of the relentless sun. The cyclist's efforts to withstand the physical and mental strain of the environment are evidenced when he remarks that "each breath I draw tastes as hot as the road I struggle over".

The type of environment described in the poem also has a tangible affect on the cyclist. The harsh terrain, unrelenting sun, and scattered debris make for a difficult journey. The heat of the sun has an especially draining effect, which is echoed in the line, "I stop to wipe the sweat from my brow, hands like sandpaper and my feet swollen." Heatstroke, dehydration, and exhaustion are all serious threats in the desert and the cyclist's recognition of these risks demonstrates the difficulty of the journey. 

The poem's setting serves as an important framing device in the poem, setting the stage for the cyclist's journey and our understanding of the risks and challenges he accepts as he embarks on his journey. The setting also serves to emphasize the resilience and determination of the cyclist as he pushes onward despite the discomfort and fatigue.
