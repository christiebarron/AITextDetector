One time I experienced laughter in my life was when, in college, I was reading about the Great White Way, and I was like, "It's funny! It's so funny." And I actually tried to relate it to the culture, but it seemed too clich√©. And then you realize at that time you hadn't put your mind at it yet."

How did you experience the experience that led to your joining the Academy? "Well, I found out that I was in fact very active. I was reading about these cultures from the front pages. I was studying American culture, but I was also starting to look at how much other people had experienced this. And that was really the experience of joining a culture that my family hadn't. So it almost dawned on me how much of the history of the human race is about understanding the human species, how much our brains are about thinking and thinking about how we're going to get to a better understanding that's going to allow us better options for making a more healthy future and better future for ourselves. And the people around me were completely committed to that. They had been telling me this for so long they had no idea there was a better choice, and they wanted to be part of it. I've been there for the last four years. These are the ones who taught me about what makes it possible to create the best future for all of us. And these are people I am deeply in love with," says Rupp.
