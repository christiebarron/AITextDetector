Dear Editor:

As technology continues to advance, computers have become a normal part of everyday life. I believe computers are both beneficial and detrimental to people. 

On one hand, the use of computers makes our lives easier. From shopping online to finding information instantly, computers have made mundane tasks simpler and more efficient. Computers have also made it possible to stay connected to loved ones around the world. As a result, computers provide a sense of companionship and closeness for many.

However, computers also have negative implications. Prolonged use of computers has been correlated with physical health issues like carpal tunnel syndrome, poor posture, and eye strain. Spending too much time on computers can also lead to mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Additionally, computers have created a “virtual” world, disconnected from the “real” world, where people can easily get lost in a false sense of reality.

As computers become ever more present in our lives, I urge readers to weigh the pros and cons of their use and use them responsibly. We must take precautions in order to keep ourselves safe and healthy, both mentally and physically. 

Sincerely,
