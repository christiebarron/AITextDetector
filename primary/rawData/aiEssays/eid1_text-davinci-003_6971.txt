Censorship in libraries is an important and complex topic. With the freedom of speech at the forefront of our national conversation, it is important to consider the role of libraries in protecting and preserving that freedom. On the one hand, libraries are places of knowledge, and should not be held to the standards of private businesses. On the other hand, libraries have an obligation to provide equal access to materials without infringing on the rights of others. 

It is important to understand that censorship in libraries is not about removing materials in an effort to silence voices of opposition. Rather, it is about providing a safe and welcoming environment for everyone. In libraries, materials are chosen based on a variety of factors, including whether they expand the diversity of available information or pose a potential harm to patrons. When it comes to hate speech or material that is overtly offensive, such materials should be removed from the shelves if they do not serve the purpose of education. 

Furthermore, when it comes to removal of materials from the shelves, libraries should adhere to the American Library Association's statement on intellectual freedom. This includes having a well-defined process and standards in place for removing materials and providing a clear explanation of the reasoning for doing so. This allows patrons to be aware of why certain materials are not available and helps ensure that librarians remain consistent in their decision-making process.

Ultimately, libraries should strive to create an environment of inclusivity while also ensuring that they promote freedom of thought
