The Empire State Building was the world’s first skyscraper to be designed with an intent to allow dirigibles to dock at its top. Although the original plans provided for this daring idea, the project faced many obstacles along the way. This essay will explore the myriad of difficulties the builders encountered in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. 

In order to permit dirigibles to dock, the building had to be equipped with a “mooring mast”. This 170-foot mast contained cables for the dirigible to tie onto while approaching the structure. However, due to the general lack of experience with airships docking at such a height, the planners encountered difficulty in forming the safety standards for construction. Installation of the mast required special consideration with regards to the wind speed and direction, the structural engineer determined that diagonal trusses were necessary for integrity and to help achieve stability. 

Designing the passenger dock further compounded the difficulty. It raised questions of size and structure, such as how to tube or shutter passengers from the vessel to the platform below. To solve these questions, braced steel tubes were constructed to enclose the passengers transferring from the airship to the building. These tubes served as a horizontal and vertical bridge between the dock and the platform, equipped with safety netting. 

In addition to the stability of the mast and the safety of the passengers, the question of air traffic had to be addressed
