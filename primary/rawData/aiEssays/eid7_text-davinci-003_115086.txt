I recently had an opportunity to observe patience in action. I was visiting my grandparents at their lake house with a few extended family members. As usual, my toddler was darting around, grabbing anything he could get his hands on. 

I could see that my grandfather was becoming increasingly frustrated watching the toddler play and warned him several times to slow down and be careful. After all, my grandpa had spent decades acquiring antiques and neither he nor my grandmother wanted any of their things to be broken.

I was expecting a loss of patience on grandpa’s part, when he instead decided to take the toddler onto his lap and patiently explain why it’s important to be careful. The toddler seemed to understand without fuss, and I could tell how proud my grandpa was that the boy was listening intently.

Seeing my grandpa handle this situation with patience and understanding was a reminder of why he’s been such an amazing role model for me and my family. We’ve all been truly blessed to have him in our life.
