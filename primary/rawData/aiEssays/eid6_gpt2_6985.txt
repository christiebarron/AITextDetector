The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In 1794 they had to find their own way around all that was wrong with the building. They were frustrated by an absence of steel and a lack of safety measures for the crane and its components. Many of those who tried to build the building also lost business and saw their business suffer. The building was eventually removed in 1789 but the problems were not solved until the late 1890s.

The tower which replaced the Empire State building in 1929 had a number of mechanical problems. All were problems of the crane and part of the structural system. The crane would sometimes fall into a wall or cause a problem, making the building a huge undertaking to repair. The roof was covered with ice a few times, and a new layer was added through the removal of the snow from the roofs as some people hoped for the best.

When construction was over and the tower finally came down, all of the problems went away.

In 1989, the new Empire State building was completed and its interior was given a new face. Building was made of steel and the original windows were covered in paint and painted blue. The roof were opened up and finished, and on a higher level than the original. It is an excellent example of the importance of using contemporary engineering techniques.

From a structural standpoint, this is the first Empire State Building with a built-in elevator and has been built with steel as well
