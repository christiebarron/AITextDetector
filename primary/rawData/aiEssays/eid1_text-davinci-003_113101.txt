Dear Editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the impact of computers on people and to persuade your readers to agree with me. In the modern world, computers are ever-present in our lives. With the power to connect us to people and information from around the world, computers have become an invaluable tool in our lives.

On one hand, computers have made our lives so much easier in countless ways. From simple tasks such as shopping and banking to complex academic research, computers have streamlined many processes and made them more efficient. Thanks to advancements in software engineering, computers can even diagnose diseases and perform complicated medical procedures.

On the other hand, computers have a darker side. With such an even distribution of access to technology, we often find that people lack basic communication skills. In addition, our lives are increasingly bound up in the online world. This means that our physical and mental health take a hit as we spend too much time in front of a monitor.

In my opinion, computers are a necessary tool, but they should not occupy a prominent place in our lives. We must find a balance between the virtual and real world. To this extent, we should commit to spending more time reading books, engaging in physical outdoor activities, and interacting with people. And, parents should encourage children to turn off screens at regular intervals.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my opinion.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
