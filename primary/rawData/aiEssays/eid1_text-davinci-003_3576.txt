Censorship in libraries should not be accepted, as it is a form of censorship of our freedom of expression. Libraries should be responsible for providing access to a wide range of materials for its patrons, regardless of the content. There are numerous reasons that support this idea. 

First, it is important to remember that libraries exist to provide access to information, not to make decisions for their patrons on what information can and cannot be accessed. Libraries should not be in the business of determining what is appropriate or not, as this decision should be made by the user. Censorship of materials is unnecessary and serves only to limit our First Amendment right to freedom of expression. 

Additionally, it is important to remember that libraries are a place of learning, and in order to learn, people of all backgrounds need access to all types of materials, including controversial ones. Censorship prevents people from accessing information that could be essential for their learning and personal growth. By censoring certain materials, libraries are denying their patrons access to a platform of knowledge that could further their education and development. 

Finally, censorship in libraries restricts creativity and exploration of ideas. People should be free to express themselves without fear of censorship or judgment,
