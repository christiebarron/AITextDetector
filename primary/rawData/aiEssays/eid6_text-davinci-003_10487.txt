In an era of increasingly radical architecture, one of the most iconic structures of all time is the Empire State Building. The building was designed to be a "shrine to the sky" and included a groundbreaking feature – allowing for dirigible docking. This key feature of the iconic building was engineered and crafted by foundation company Murphy & Hinderman, and required overcoming numerous technical and physical obstacles. 

The initial challenge faced when creating a facility to dock dirigibles involved the design of the mast itself. Securing the siderods, which would later be used to hold the mooring lines for the airships, proved difficult due to the construction not having been designed in first place to support such a heavy load. This was compounded by the added difficulty of seeing the project to completion while keeping the public’s safety a priority. Despite these initial difficulties, the building’s designers, Murphy & Hederman, managed to create a system that could safely support the weight of the weight of the airship.

In order to safely dock the airships, engineers also needed to come up with a system to allow their passengers to safely disembark. To accomplish this, they employed what was called the "mooring mast." This rig was a complex and difficult mechanism to construct which included a vertical ladder, a hoist sling, and a disembarkation platform. The ladder allowed pilots to climb and access a platform to disembark, while the hoist sling was used to allow
