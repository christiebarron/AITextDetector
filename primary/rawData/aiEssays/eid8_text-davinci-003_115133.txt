I was at a party with some friends the other night when conversation shifted to my all-time favorite topic: movies. Everyone had something to say about the latest blockbuster, but I was determined to prove that my favorite movie of all time was the best.

So I started telling everyone the funniest scene from the movie and pretending to act it out. I was in the middle of my impromptu performance when everyone started to burst into laughter. I couldn’t believe it – I had managed to crack everyone up!

The laughter felt like a reward – proof that I had made the right choice of favorite movie. I felt a connection with my friends instantly, as though we were suddenly more than just acquaintances.

It was a wonderful moment, and one that I won’t forget. I’ll never forget the power that laughter had in bringing us all together.
