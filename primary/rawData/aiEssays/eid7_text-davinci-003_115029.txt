I remember one time when I was younger and I had been waiting outside my neighbor's house for what felt like forever. I had been waiting for them to return home and I had been standing outside for almost 20 minutes. Finally, the front door opened and my neighbor greeted me with a friendly smile. I was so relieved that I had waited so long. 

When I asked them why they had taken so long, they told me not to worry and that they were just running a few errands. I was so taken aback by their patience and understanding. Instead of getting angry about my wait time, they immediately put me at ease and greeted me with the same warm smile as before. 

It's moments like these that I remember and treasure. I was patient and understanding and it allowed me to really appreciate the moment.
