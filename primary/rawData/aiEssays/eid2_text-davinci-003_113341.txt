Censorship in libraries is a highly controversial topic, yet one that needs to be discussed. Though library censorship is primarily intended to protect children from pornographic or otherwise objectionable materials, it also places restrictions on people of all ages and impinges on their intellectual freedom. Censored materials, such as books, magazines, movies, and music, can deprive people of access to important knowledge, hindering the exercise of free speech.

The librarian’s role is to impart information, not to censor it. Libraries are integral to the success of a free society, and it’s vital that people have the right to access whatever type of information they deem necessary. If certain materials are considered offensive, librarians should provide guidance rather than dictating exactly what people are allowed to read or view. Placing restrictions upon what can or cannot be viewed inhibits open dialogue and prohibits readers from having the opportunity to consider multiple perspectives.

The First Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees citizens freedom of speech and expression. These rights should extend to library materials, not be limited by censorship. Instilling moral values in children is best accomplished by incorporating discussions with parents and guardians, not by suppressing certain materials. What is deemed inappropriate for children may still be essential for adults to explore and understand. Censoring materials being displayed in libraries eliminates the opportunity for personal judgment and interferes with a person’s right to receive and share information.
