One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my grandmother told me how great of a parent she was. What a great parent that is. So thank you.

And I will continue to share stories with you via email and Facebook if I am unable to or refuse to do so. Thank you so very much.


So enjoy, but don't worryâ€”this is real.
