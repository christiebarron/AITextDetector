When construction on the Empire State Building in New York City began in 1929, one of the ambitious aims of the project was to make the building the first one with an airship docking station. This was to be the first of its kind, and for it, a special mast, called a mooring mast, was to be built atop the Empire State Building. Due to the height of the building, a dirigible docking station could provide short transport for the wealthy commuters of the day.

However, the task of constructing this challenging tower was not an easy one. According to the book, “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the engineers, architects and builders of the Empire State Building faced various obstacles when it came to allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. One of these challenges was the fact that the mooring mast had to be stronger and taller than a regular mast. This was due to the fact that a dirigible, due to its size and weight, would require a substantially stronger and taller mast to tie it up to the Empire State Building. 

Additionally, dirigible docking also posed its own tough technical problems. First, the engineers had to develop the synchronization of the mooring mast and the dirigible’s docking mechanism in such a way that the dirigible would remain secure even in strong wind conditions. Second, the design of the mooring mast had to be
