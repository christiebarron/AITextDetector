I believe that censorship of materials in libraries as it pertains to this bill only affects public libraries.

"Although this bill is not directed by the Library Owners, we can assure you that libraries in the State of Michigan are prohibited from violating a number of laws, including the National Freedom of Information Act, and I hope that you will take action to ensure this is the case in Michigan.

"Michigan State Library employees are responsible for their own safety at all times and they should never be allowed to use materials that violate state or national rules or regulations that they disagree with or have not complied with."
