The construction of the Empire State Building was an impressive feat in itself, but an even more incredible endeavor was the allowance of dirigibles—airships, or blimps—to dock on the building’s mast. This feat posed many obstacles for the builders due to the enormous associated risks. 

The greatest problem was the mast itself. It was deemed too flimsy for airships to land on and needed reinforcing. The construction involved pouring a cement concoction over a steel frame that was three stories tall and twenty-six feet wide. Other weight-bearing features, like guy-wire supports and rollers, were added afterwards.

To ensure that the mast was secure, an anchor was added onto the top to which the ropes of the dirigibles would be tied. It was apparent that a strong wind could rip the ropes, and metal spikes were tucked into the bottom of the mast to ensure that, if a rope snapped, the ship would not fly away.

The process then shifted to the inside of the building, where a variety of mechanisms needed to be implemented in order to facilitate a safe landing for the airships. There were metal pipe channels installed, as well as steel cabins and elevators that were to be used to bring the blimps into the mast, as well as an array of tools, such as winches, pulleys, winding systems, towlines, hand platforms, and other equipment.
