Computers have many effects on people. It's as if someone is trying to use your computer only to come see you in the middle of your home and you have to tell him not to use your computer for that. It's all a bit like that â€” you know, if he calls you a fat bastard, he's no more likely to hear what you're saying. Now, I never had a problem with computers. I have heard everything from the Bible, from people's magazines, from old-time radio advertisements of the day, and I can tell you every time, it was a terrible thing to say. It was like, we didn't have the money to pay for the security deposit. There were plenty of places in the world where computers could go without payment until after a certain time of the month. But it was one or two weeks of my life and they were always coming up in the mail. Even with a lot of money, I never got around to being able to use my computer for some days. It was all an awful burden.

So what's your favorite type of computer?

You should look into that. I loved my computer so much. I think a pretty good computer, but it had the appearance of not having much money but the ability to make millions of dollars a day. At least that was the case when I was growing up, before computers had really started seeing the world, like my whole life.
