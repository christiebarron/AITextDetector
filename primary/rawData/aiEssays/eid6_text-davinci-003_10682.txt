The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when allowing dirigibles to dock on the top of the building. The plans for the skyscraper included the construction of a 200-foot spire that was earmarked for a dirigible mooring mast, but those plans were met with skepticism from the general public and were even viewed as something of a publicity stunt by some. The majority of critics were concerned about safety issues with dirigibles docking in a densely populated borough such as Manhattan, while others were concerned with the structural integrity of the mooring platform and the ultimate success of such an endeavor.

To address these fears, the builders of the Empire State Building tasked a team of engineers to develop a mooring system that addressed the safety and structural concerns. The team developed a complex system of pulleys and cables that allowed the dirigibles to dock without compromising the structural integrity of the building. The entire mooring apparatus was anchored to a massive stone base that was placed on the 72nd floor of the building which gave it the strength and stability to support the dirigibles. The process of anchoring the mooring mast to the stone base ended up taking three months of hard work as the team had to be meticulous and make sure the mooring mast was firmly secured to the building.

Once the mooring mast was in place, an additional set of safety protocols were implemented. A stringent set of requirements were forced upon the dir
