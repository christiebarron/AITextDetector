We were both at school and we were both using a variety of different language and had different interests and different strengths. We loved to laugh and had a great talk and I would often play with her as I played music. It was an adventure and it was always kind of like the moment you play something along the lines of 'I love you but will you please come when you get a good night's sleep?' Sometimes it would be like she would say 'yes' and that would help because they would always be listening to you. She was very playful. If it's me talking to you at work or I am in a restaurant, I was just getting away with it so I just looked like I needed to please. I was a hard worker and she was always there waiting to hear what she wanted. I've played with her in my work. They call me Mrs. Goodin!
