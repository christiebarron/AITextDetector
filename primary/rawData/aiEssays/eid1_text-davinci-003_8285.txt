During its initial construction in the 1920s, the Empire State Building was planned to accommodate docking dirigibles – airships like the iconic Hindenburg. The plan, however, was thwarted by a variety of challenges that the builders faced. Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s book “The Mooring Mast” provides valuable insight into the complexities of the project.

The project was incredibly ambitious. It required the building to be outfitted with a mooring mast, connected to the top of the building by steel cables. The mast had to be tall enough to reach the dirigible and strong enough to withstand the pull of the airships. To make matters more difficult, constructing the mast posed a unique challenge– as the builders worked on the top floor, the weight of the mast increasing the higher it was constructed. This meant the mast had to be built from the outside in, layer by layer, in order to avoid the complicated task of strengthening the building itself.

Additionally, the project proved difficult to finance. Even though the project was approved, raising funds was a difficult task. Airlines and the US military didn’t have the money to equip the mast, and the only other interested investors were dirigible companies, who also couldn’t afford it. The project eventually de facto halted when a major airship carrier, Zeppelin, announced its decision to never use an Empire-State-Building-docking-station due to the associated
