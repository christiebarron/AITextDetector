I have always been a big fan of spending time with my best friend. We used to hang out all the time growing up, and when we met up last month it felt just like old times.

We had been talking and catching up for a few hours when the topic of an embarrassing event from our childhood came up. We were remembering a time in elementary school when we had done something embarrassing on the playground. He started telling the story and soon enough we were both laughing so hard tears were coming down our faces. Our laughter was contagious and it wasn't long before the others in the room were joining in as well.

All the laughter we were sharing caused a strange connection between us, one that could only come from understanding something embarrassing and being able to laugh about it together. We were both so worked up that it seemed like the room was spinning.

It felt so good to share a moment like that with my best friend. We hadn't laughed together like that in years and I'm sure it was one of the happiest moments of my life. This moment made me realize just how lucky I am to have such an amazing friend that can bond with me through laughter.
