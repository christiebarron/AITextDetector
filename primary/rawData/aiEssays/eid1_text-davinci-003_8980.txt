Dear Editor,

I am writing to you in regards to computers and their effects on people. Computers are becoming an integral part of our lives, and their uses are extending beyond the realm of productivity. What many people donâ€™t realize is the profound effect they are having on our lives.

On one hand, computers are responsible for a myriad of positive changes. We are better connected, our education is more advanced, our jobs are more efficient and productive, we can shop and work from anywhere and at any time, and our entertainment opportunities have become limitless. On the other hand, computer use is increasingly linked to physical and mental disorders. Eye strain, carpal tunnel, headaches, neck and shoulder pain, and anxiety are all commonly associated with the overuse of computers.

The truth is that too much of anything, even something as seemingly harmless as spending too much time on computers, can have serious negative effects on our lives. We must be mindful of our computer use and the time we dedicate to it. We need to accept that computers are neither a friend nor an enemy, but a tool, and one that should be handled accordingly. With this in mind, I encourage readers to use computers responsibly, avoiding for too much screen time and being mindful of the physical and mental risks it carries.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
