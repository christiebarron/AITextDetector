One time I experienced laughter in my life was when watching the movies.

How do you think people find you a funny person?

I think it's true that when someone says their favorite movie is, "Let's kill 'em, and it won't be good," then it's the same as saying their favorite actor is a bitch. I like that sometimes there's a certain intensity to a person's words that make me laugh, or at least they sound like funny words.

There's a place with you in society where an extreme is okay with some people believing people are monsters. You don't have to be that extreme to be considered funny. I know that some people want to say 'Let's fight fascism?' but it's funny.

I think when somebody has a really nice day or has an awesome job or gets high off of the sun, they think, "I can be funny, I just got lucky, here's what I feel like."

A lot of people think you're the worst person I've ever met. How did that come about?

I don't know. All I have to do is wait for my car to roll on the way to work, and all I care about is what's going on and no one cares.

I guess, I guess it was only after you had a super lucky day in Hollywood when you had an award, a nice job, and you've done your best.
