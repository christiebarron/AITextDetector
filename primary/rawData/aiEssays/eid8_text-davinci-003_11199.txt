I remember the first time I met my partner. We had both been set up on a blind date, and neither of us knew what to expect. I was a little nervous, but when I arrived at the restaurant, he had a big smile on his face and it put me at ease right away. 

We had a great time talking throughout dinner, and soon we were in stitches with laughter. I could tell he had a great sense of humor and liked to joke around, just like I did. We shared stories about our families, careers, and travels, and we still laugh about some of them to this day!

I knew right away that there was something special between us. We stayed up late, talking and laughing until the restaurant had to kick us out, and when he dropped me off at home I was already counting down the days until I could see him again. 

As time has gone on, it's been wonderful to watch our relationship grow and deepen. But to this day, shared laughter continues to be an important part of our relationship. It's our own special language, a way of showing love and appreciation without having to say a word. For me, laughter has been the shortest distance between us.
