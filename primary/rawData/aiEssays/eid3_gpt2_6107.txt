Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

"It is the most detailed setting on the website, which gives you a very good idea of its general functionality," said Richard O'Connell, an expert in cyclist health from University College London.

"I think its key to understanding and utilising the setting in any way is that you don't have to be a beginner using it to get an awareness of how it works. There are lots of techniques on how to use it to help riders feel comfortable and used as they drive along, and it is as simple one of the key to understanding how it works as well as giving the best advice they can."
