The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' will soon be seen at the Paris offices of UBS, Deutsche Bank, IHS and Thomson Reuters.

In the US, for example, it's called 'From Home is a book on the politics of religion and politics of the United States.'

On Saturday, in an interview with the New York Observer, former Vice President Dick Cheney described the book as a gift to the "New American Century."

"When you read the book," he said, "you realise that it touches not just a moment of history, but a whole lifetime of history."

This is what UBS and Deutsche Bank have been doing to their competitors: providing a "publicly available glimpse" at the political and social attitudes of a country of 13 million people, they say. Their book will tell a different story.

They've been publishing the book about the influence that religion plays in business. The focus is on the two major brands, the company of Cheney's father. In recent years, their biggest investment has been in New World Finance, as their focus has attracted more journalists to write about the company. All the other brands have decided to remain independent in pursuit of making their products more profitable for the company.

It's a new story.

For the other major banks, however, their contribution in history has remained limited to one big story: the globalisation of Wall Street.
