I had been struggling to make the relationship I had with my best friend work. We were growing apart and I was losing hope that things would ever improve. One day, we decided to take a break from our troubles and go out for ice cream. It had been one of those days where everything felt heavy and the tension between us was palpable.

As soon as we started walking into the ice cream parlor, though, something changed. My friend glanced around and then joked about the bright colors and lively music. I started to laugh, too, and then couldn’t stop. It was as if all the worries and fears melted away in that same moment.

The two of us could barely stay in our seats for all the laughter that was flowing. I hadn’t ever seen us laugh that hard before and it felt so good. We continued to talk and joke throughout our time at the ice cream parlor, and gradually, I felt the relationship I had with my best friend begin to mend. 

From that day forward, laughter became an integral part of our relationship. Whenever we needed to de-stress, we’d go out for ice cream or just take time to laugh together. The power of laughter is an incredible force that can remind us of the best parts of a relationship. I am beyond grateful that this day provided an opportunity for us to be reminded of that.
