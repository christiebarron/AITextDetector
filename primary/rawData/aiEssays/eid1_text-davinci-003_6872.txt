Censorship is a hot topic in the world of libraries. As a society, we must decide whether certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.

I believe that these materials should not be removed, as censorship violates the right of individuals to have access to the full range of information and expression available. The right to access and explore ideas and opinions without censorship is a fundamental right of library users. Censorship is the antithesis of a free society. By removing materials from the shelves, libraries would be engaging in a form of book banning, which removes individual choice and freedom of speech.

Furthermore, the removal of certain material may disproportionately affect certain groups of people in society. Those without access to good or any education, minority groups, or those without the ability to access the Internet are more likely to rely on library resources for news and media. By removing materials, we are taking away the right of some citizens to access cultural works, literature, and news that their peers take for granted.

Finally, libraries are responsible for promoting literature and encouraging the exploration and discovery of knowledge, not for acting as arbiters of morality. Libraries should not be forced into preventing citizens from accessing information just because it is offensive or inappropriate. Any library patron should be allowed to access and learn without judgemental interference.

In conclusion, the act of censorship in libraries is unwise and an infringement
