The setting plays an important role in Joe Kurmaski’s short story ‘‘Rough Road Ahead.’’ The story is set in the US during the Great Depression, when the cyclist is trying to make his way from one city to another. 

The road is described as a “rough, pitted road” with little maintenance, full of potholes and “abandoned vehicles rusting along the shoulder”. There are no street lights or signs to show the way, and the cyclist must rely on his own skills and intuition to make his way through the darkness. He is also at a disadvantage because he is riding a light-weight bike, which is no match for the wind and rain. 

The setting makes it difficult for the cyclist to reach his destination. The bad road conditions slow him down and make it hard for him to focus on his journey. This creates an air of tension; he’s unsure of how far he’s come or how much further he has to go before reaching his destination. 

The desolate setting also increases the sense of loneliness felt by the cyclist. He has no one to talk to, and is instead surrounded by darkness and silence. This exacerbates his feeling of helplessness and vulnerability, reinforcing his sense of being alone in a cruel and unforgiving world.
