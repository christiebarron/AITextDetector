An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a person's birth name and how they gave birth to their children," explained Rene, a co-founder of the organization. "They gave the name to their children because they didn't want to have a name that caused embarrassment to themselves too often."

In 2006, a baby boy named Drexel University's Dr. Stephen, who was diagnosed with terminal kidney disease, entered a birthing center, which he spent the next 10 years giving as their own. His doctors thought it was a benign condition, but after nearly a year, the team of neurologists and endocrinologists concluded that it was actually the father's kidney that was causing Drexel to abort, and it was only after the baby was born that Drexel's team began to realize if something was wrong with the baby, and that it might be time for them to make Drexel's child its own.

"To them, the baby wasn't going to survive if they were put on the wrong medicine because doctors had a good idea of what was wrong with the kidney from their initial experience with kidney transplants," Rene added. "These women believed, 'We can fix this by using the best medical knowledge we have.' That's the way they got the message that in medicine we should always consider our own needs."
