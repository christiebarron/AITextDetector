The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The lack of a dedicated dock for the mass of the building and the consequent loss of a valuable and profitable service as a serviceable vessel from the docks caused problems for the shipping traffic. The large number of dirigibles used in the construction of the Empire State Building made ships virtually impossible to transport offshore, which resulted in the large number of dirigibles needing to be built on private land and thus also to maintain an undisturbed and stable shipyard.

While the Navy could dock warships it would not dock military ships off the coast of the Great Lakes and therefore, since open containers were considered a risk, the Army would not permit open container dockings for any purpose whatsoever under the guise of protecting ships.
