The building of the Empire State Building presented a unique challenge for its designers and builders: allowing dirigibles to dock there. This was a revolutionary idea in 1931, as no other building in the world had been equipped to dock aircraft. Despite the enthusiasm of the designers, there were several obstacles to overcome.

The first obstacle was the size of the building. With a height of 1,250 feet, the Empire State Building was one of the tallest skyscrapers in the world. Constructing it to the scale necessary for the docking station was difficult, and the task was made more complex by the fact that dirigibles, which relied on their buoyancy to be airborne and steerable, needed a precise air pressure and temperature to prevent them from being damaged or being unable to control their descent.

The second obstacle was the design of the structure for the mast. The mast would have to reach the height of the Empire State Building's observation deck and provide a sturdy and secure anchor for the docking station. The mast had to be built in two separate parts: the foundation, which needed to be deep and wide enough to support the weight of the mast and dirigibles, and the superstructure, which had to be resistant to both wind and the frequent changes of temperature.

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the designers and builders had to consider the safety of both the passengers aboard the dirigibles and those on the ground. Specialized equipment was needed to keep
