The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is not quite clear, but a lot of the dialogue and dialogues are quite well laid out, and the ending is often very funny. The book is also a perfect example of how a single character can become a multi-lingual character-the same person who could have a real life, and become an enormous role model/assistant/spouse/mother. Of course, the book is short, so I don't actually recommend writing it as fast as I would like it out in the comments.

So if you're new to The Good Wife, don't expect to be in all the moods as the book progresses. If you're one of the first people to get swept up in the series, or you even want to follow along, check out this review from New York Times Bestsellers (the title is even better: "Better Than Sex, Better Than Beauty: The Seven Habits That Make Us Happy").
