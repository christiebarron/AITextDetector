The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because we've started to learn more about the history of the species.

And in fact, it just about concludes.

The most interesting part of Winter Hibiscus is that it has a big story to tell. We've got this little book about this tiny butterfly whose genome was discovered and named after him and this little book from my childhood about which all my favorite books are about and some of my favorite books about spiders are about. And it also has its own little narrative and a story that we know very well. It's just really exciting to read the story that takes place in this little book. They also do some really great science fiction stuff, and I'm just glad that they have so much more to say about it.

I just don't think all of us have this opportunity now to spend 20th Century Science Fiction week talking a little bit about the history of this little butterfly like we do about most other things about biology.

[on the Spider-Man book's name as a "symbol" of inspiration] I did an article back in September, 2013, about an article on how the spider book is an inspiration to our children and grandchildren, all of us. And that was something where people got a glimpse of how we can use comics in our children's education. And it was just really interesting to see just how great this book is.
