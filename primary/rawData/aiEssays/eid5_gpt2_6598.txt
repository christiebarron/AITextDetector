The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' includes an emotional conversation between two teenage girls to which they are invited to join their parents into the woods, where the two girls can share a comfortable friendship for life, the young girl with whom they are having a good time, her parents, whose attitude towards her is unwise; the old girl with whom they are having a good time while watching the movie 'The Girl With Three Bells' and the young girl whose name is Anna.

In each book, Anna is taken to a "special snow lodge" where the girls spend a week with their relatives, visiting them and getting better at their chores while the rest of the boys are left in the cold.
