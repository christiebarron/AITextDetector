Dear Editor,

As technology has become a mainstay of our everyday lives, computer usage has become seemingly unavoidable. While computers have benefited society in countless ways, I believe the effects streaming from them are largely negative. 

Physical health problems, such as poor posture, eyestrain, and carpal tunnel syndrome, are just a few of the physical risks that come along with dependence on computers. There has also been an increase in mental health issues stemming from computer use, such as anxiety, depression, and addiction as well as a decreased focus on outdoors activities.

Despite the advantages that the computer provides, it can also be a hindrance when it comes to developing real relationships, families, and social circles. Because of the significant amount of time people spend on their computers, they often miss out on valuable face-to-face time. With the majority of communication and interaction taking place over devices, the importance of real, human interaction has plummeted.

The effects of computer usage are far reaching. It is my opinion as a responsible citizen that we need to be more conscious of the effects of our technology and how it is affecting us and our environment. By raising awareness, we can help ensure safer and more productive usage of computers.

Thank you for your time, 

[Your Name]
