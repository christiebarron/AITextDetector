An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the time I spent with my partner who was out for an uncoherent trip. I was always having fun and wanted an answer to the question "how do I overcome the difficult time of being an adult, like being blind and deaf, in a crowded school cafeteria with dozens of students?"

And now in my early 20s, this is just how I came out. I had this strong family and two very friendly and kind and well-connected friends and family who are both wonderful people who I always want to be.

We are in a very stable relationship now and it hasn't been any longer. This summer I've learned so much about how to be a good husband and I've learned how to be a human being like nobody could have predicted. In January, I came home from a great trip where I had a big breakfast, which was great and really brought over a very happy and optimistic day. Being married with my partner was the closest I've ever been able to have to a happy and healthy new relationship.

One of those things I learned during my time at Beacon, the hard way, is that the good things that happen when you grow up with someone who truly is who you want are rare. You get to know that person first. You learn to see what makes you want to be and can also find the courage to do that.

So, all in all, this is wonderful.
