The Empire State Building was designed to be a marvel of modern architecture â€“ an iconic structure that would stand as a lasting testament of human ingenuity. Construction of the building began in 1930 and presented a unique challenge for the imaginative engineers who were determined to make the building something special. One of the most daring feats of engineering included the provision of a mooring mast atop the building, which allowed dirigibles to dock at the structure for passengers to disembark onto the observation deck. Despite the challenges that came with such a feat, the engineers saw this as an opportunity to make the Empire State Building stand out even more.

Despite the excitement that the engineers held for this idea, the mooring of dirigibles presented a significant challenge. Even before the project began, there was a great deal of doubters who questioned the feasibility of the idea. Fortunately, the engineers had an extensive knowledge of aeronautics to carry out the necessary design, engineering, and fabrication of the Empire State Building. While the initial design of the mast was relatively straightforward, the primary challenge was the wind forces that the airship would endure at the top of the building.

The engineers had to develop a plan to minimize the force of the wind and allow the airships to safely dock. To achieve this, the engineers designed a two-part mast comprising of a single stack and a series of eight crossed beams. This combination allowed the airships to be tethered to the mast, allowing for the
