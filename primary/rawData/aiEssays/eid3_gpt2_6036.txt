Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

A small group of local, non-profits around the UK have devised a program in which they distribute information on road congestion to cyclists for free from the early hours of any given cycle. This helps to ensure that any person with a vehicle will be able to get there as quickly and safely as they please:

A large number have also been using the 'Roadside Bike Share' campaign to distribute flyers, posters or placards in their local cities for free to encourage cyclists to try to get around it themselves.

The idea for 'Roadside Bike Share' comes at a time when many road users who do not want to ride outside are still struggling to get on roads because of the congestion they're experiencing and the difficulty they're experiencing getting their bikes around.

The programme has raised Â£1.3m and is also looking to raise $250,000 in the next two funding cycles through this Autumn.
