I recently had the opportunity to meet a very special person named John. He was an elderly man in his late 70's and he did not move around very well. He was wheelchair-bound due to a year-long battle with cancer. 

Despite the difficulties he faced, John always had a positive attitude and was extremely patient in his interactions with others. He was very understanding of his limitations and never complained about anything.

One day, I went to visit John and I noticed that his wheelchair was stuck in a narrow hallway. He had been trying to turn it around for the past five minutes and becoming increasingly frustrated with the situation. I asked if he needed help and he told me no and that he just needed a moment.

I was surprised to see how patient John remained throughout the process. He remained calm and tried to think of creative ways to turn his wheelchair around. He gently maneuvered the wheelchair to and fro and eventually succeeded in turning it around. Although it took him some time, he never lost his patience.

John's patience and kindness has taught me the importance of remaining so during challenging times. He has inspired me to show the same patience and calm approach he did in difficult situations. His example will always stay with me.
