An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was running around a school for a week and the teacher was taking my notes and I called the computer and had what amounted to a test. I couldn't remember, so I gave up immediately and made a little mistake but I ended up with all of a sudden losing a second class – it was really a hard case. So if you know someone who's done this kind of work and are in a team and have done so, if they're willing to go to a more formal level of work, that's amazing – but that's a different story.

It's the same with my career … I'm actually actually extremely lucky if I've got a job at my firm or even at a school that I don't currently do the kind of thing that helps people find a professional career. Or if they're young and they've got no intention of continuing their career … and they are.
