The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Building standards of the day were much different but some buildings had the freedom to employ other forms of vertical construction. The Empire State Building was considered a "tower of glory" because of it's wide area, high floors, well-appointed interior design, and strong ventilation systems (all of these combined with its large and powerful buildings are considered marvels by many people who love the state buildings). Yet many did not realize that this type of building would allow for a vertical, "flying" air-conditioning system and high-end refrigeration systems. While all of the main building design features were incorporated in the Empire State Building, no new vertical design was invented. Instead, the Empire State Building took on an unusual form that many didn't realize. It had an elegant, three-dimensional structure that was almost always symmetrical when it opened on Monday and was always tilted (for the best of both worlds).

It's difficult to imagine how much more space a vertical was than any other building, especially if our ancestors envisioned planes before those day. This vertical structure is much more dramatic than two rows of domes at the edge of buildings. It's the biggest possible structure that the Empire State Building took on during its construction. While it was very well designed over 300 years ago, it was really only a matter of time before our modern day airplanes were flown to the skies. While it's important to
