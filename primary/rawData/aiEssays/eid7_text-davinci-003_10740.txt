 

I remember when I was in middle school and we had to take group tests. I was usually really anxious about these tests, but I had a group of classmates that I was assigned to that always seemed to not care about the tests. I had to be patient while they were goofing around and not trying to focus on the task at hand. I had to explain the questions over and over and help them out with the material. I was tempted to get mad, but I stayed patient and stayed quiet. In the end, all my classmates ended up doing a lot better on the tests, and I was really proud of myself for being so understanding.
