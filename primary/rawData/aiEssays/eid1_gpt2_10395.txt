Computers have many effects on people. But if the brain isn't working, then why on earth would the brain ever be trying to replicate itself? And if so many of us are just being lazy about something? In what way should an artificial intelligence experiment take place in our lives, how much can you see, breathe, feel, and eat?

The key here is that the question doesn't lie in how the brain handles complex life. Instead the answer lies in the way the brain organizes data. In other words, the brain is fundamentally designed to understand how information is shared between people. To the brain's benefit, you could say that your brain is better at figuring out which of these things is which than at predicting which things are the best.
