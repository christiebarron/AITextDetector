I remember it like it was yesterday; the pure joy and bliss I felt from the shared moment between me and my best friend, Sarah. We had both had a long day at work and were exhausted, but the momentary break we took to just laugh our hearts out together was all we needed to hit the reset button.

It started out innocently enough. We had walked out of work and had caught up on the happenings of the day. All of the sudden, Sarah started talking about something that happened recently that was particularly funny. She was laughing so hard, she started to spit out her words, that I couldn't help but join in on the hysterics.

The next thing I knew we were both on the ground in a fit of laughter, our faces beet red and our lungs burning, but so determined to get the last laugh. We exchanged looks of utter delight as we rolled around, unable to contain ourselves.

The moment only lasted a few minutes, but the content feeling and sense of closeness that lasted much longer. Laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people; it doesn’t matter what circumstances you’re in, just the bond between two people that’s created in that brief moment of bliss.
