The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. On the one hand, large number of cars have been constructed around the world in the '60s, to ferry people to the building. On the other, the Chinese have begun to develop dirigibles that permit them to be used at the base of tower structure. So, many have been built, many abandoned, in places where they don't want to be able to continue because their owners and property owners are afraid of being left at the end.

Some of these people have a legal right, whether it is on construction contracts, building permits, or legal conditions for building a dirigible in one particular place or another. But the people of these cities need to think about the implications for people everywhere, because while they are able to travel from one place to another without having to go to a different place and having to go through different traffic, on their own their rights to freedom will be violated, whether they get permission from the building owner or the developer for them to travel in a dirigible or not. One example is those built on the site of an abandoned building called The International Centre, just a few blocks away from the tower.

The fact that The International Centre was constructed right next to the Empire State Building is not necessarily a significant issue. For the sake of discussion here, I shall have to draw the obvious conclusion that these people were responsible for the deaths of over 100
