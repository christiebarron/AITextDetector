Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

'When I go down the road, I go to a bar and I have this guy wearing a big T-shirt with a white cross on it, I don't know what's going on,' she says. 'He's obviously pissed at his co-driver for asking me if I'd like a beer, like me and the kids. He says, "I'll look at your tattoos next." And I'm like, "Yeah, well, it's OK, I don't feel like asking for a drink so much." He's so pissed because I've done this all my life – I've done this all my life. And I didn't realize what happened to him until recently…"

With the new version of the setting she's been asked about by a friend, she says: "When it starts to rain in mid-July, I ask my friends if they'd like us to have some fun," to which she responds: "I'll get a drink and come back later on in the afternoon – they all say, 'You look so nice," and I walk off. That's just the way it is, I guess."
