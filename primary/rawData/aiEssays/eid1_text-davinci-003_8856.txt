It was one of those summer days where the sun was bright and the breeze was warm. My husband and I were sitting on the back porch of our vacation cabin, clinking our beers together and basking in the beauty of the nature around us. 

We were sharing stories from our childhoods, the sort that usually trigger a few chuckles. But this story was differentâ€”it was one of his more embarrassing moments and he was really blushing. I saw this and couldn't help but to start laughing. 

At first, I think he thought I was laughing at him. But then I grabbed his hand and said, "Laugh with me now". He smiled and soon enough we were both in stitches, howling with laughter until the tears were streaming down our faces.

As we continued to laugh, we knew that no matter what happened, we would always be able to find joy and comfort in each other. That moment of shared laughter was the reminder of our loving connection, and that knit us closer together forever.
