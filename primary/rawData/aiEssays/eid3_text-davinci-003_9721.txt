In Joe Kurmaski's story, “Rough Road Ahead,” the cyclist sets off for a long ride towards the horizon. The rough terrain and winding curves of the road make for a difficult challenge for the cyclist.

The features of the setting dramatically affect the cyclist's journey. Along the rough road, he faces numerous challenges that require strength, endurance, and skill. In some places, the road becomes so steep that it takes great effort to keep the bike moving forward. The heat is intense, draining the cyclist's energy and forcing him to take breaks to refuel and hydrate. The terrain is also constantly shifting, forcing the cyclist to readjust his riding style. There are narrow ledges where he must go slow or risk slipping off the edge. He also has to navigate through winding curves that challenge his balance and handling.

The wind is often strong, pushing him back and making it hard to keep going. The wind also adds another layer of difficulty as the cyclist must constantly remind himself to stay focused. The cyclist also struggles against the elements which constantly thwarts his progress. He must push through the rain, sun, and snow in order to keep going.

The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead” challenge the cyclist in a number of ways, pushing him to the limits of his endurance. He has to manage his energy and focus while fighting against the elements, sharp turns, and steep slopes throughout his journey.
