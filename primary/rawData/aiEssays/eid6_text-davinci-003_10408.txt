The Empire State Building is an iconic New York City attraction for its art-deco style skyscraper, a classic American symbol of achievement. But what is often overlooked is the building's unique history in relation to dirigibles. When the Empire State Building was first erected in in 1930-31, plans were made to allow dirigibles, which had recently become popular in Europe, to dock at the building. In reality, however, the task was much more difficult than initially imagined.

In “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the obstacles that builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock are explored. The chief challenge in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was providing a safe, strong, and durable mast to which the dirigible could moor. At the time, dirigibles were seen by many as the future of air transportation, so the designers wanted to ensure the safety and stability of the mast.

The designers initially explored using a tower made of steel, but due to the high winds common in Manhattan, even steel towers were not strong enough to provide a stable platform. The designers then turned to using a mast made of lightweight aluminum. However, this presented another challenge, as aluminum masts could not safely be built above a certain height. The Empire State Building’s mast had to be built over 1,000 feet tall to reach the desired height for
