I can remember it like it was yesterday, that day that changed our lives. It was a warm summer day like any other â€“ the sun was shining, the birds were chirping, and my brother and I were both filled with an abundance of joy and energy. 

We decided to play tag in our backyard, running around with wild abandon, when suddenly my brother misstepped, fell over, and ended up in a tangled heap by the garden. I had to try my hardest not to join in the laughter that was bubbling inside me, but I could only hold it for so long. I started cracking up and before I knew it, I was laughing until I had tears in my eyes. 

But then my brother started laughing, too. He was laughing at himself and at me, and it was such a silly sight that it made us both laugh even harder. For a moment it felt as though the world stopped spinning as our little bubble of laughter filled up the entire yard. 

In that moment, I knew that our relationship was forever changed. We started to understand that no matter how serious the situation was, laughter could always lighten the mood and give us the strength to carry on.

From then on, whenever things got tough, laughter was never too far away. It has brought us closer together, and I have no doubt that it will continue to bind our relationship for years to come.
