In Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead,” the setting and terrain play a significant role in shaping the cyclist’s experience. As the protagonist travels down a largely unknown road, the environment forces him to contend with various obstacles that can make for a challenging ride.

First, the winding roads that he follows force him to be mindful of his speed and control of his bike. The terrain he is cycling on is constantly changing, as the roads he is following turn left and right, undulate up and down, and are often lined with uneven gravel and stones. The winding roads also make it difficult to get a sense of how far he has traveled and how much longer he has to go.

Second, the terrain is often quite rocky, making the cyclist pay close attention to the ground beneath his tires. Rocks and stones can cause his wheel to dip or skid, depending on the size and type of the terrain. Furthermore, these rocks and stones are often quite slippery due to the moisture in the air, making maneuvering the bike all the more difficult.

Finally, the weather can be unpredictable, with sudden downpours, high winds, and intense heat waves all presenting their own unique challenges. These sudden changes can cause the cyclist to lose control or experience fatigue and dehydration, further complicating the journey down his unknown path.
