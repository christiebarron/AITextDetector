The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One of them came too late for the construction of a single-family home at a major American construction site. Many had to be left behind to make it in. Others went without.

The same problem arose for new luxury condos. Most were completed by private companies as part of what seemed like a "rebuild a world." But for those who had no need to build a big house in New Jersey, new prices became harder to come by and more crowded and the idea of a home at home became a more attractive investment.
