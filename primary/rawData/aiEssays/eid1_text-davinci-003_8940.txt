As technology continues to rapidly advance in today’s society, computers are becoming an increasingly important part of people’s lives. While these machines can have certain positive effects, studies show that they can also have destructive consequences on people’s wellbeing.

Cognitive abilities such as concentration and memory can be hindered due to the overuse of computers. With the increasing presence of computer activities such as video games or online surfing, the attention span of a person’s mind can be weakened, reducing their natural creative capabilities. Additionally, having too much of a reliance on the internet for information can lead to a decrease in overall knowledge and discourage a person from reading.

Physical effects of computers can be seen in the form of eyestrain, headaches, and backaches due to those who stay sedentary while on them for extended periods of time. Poor posture and lack of exercise can also lead to more serious long-term health issues such as obesity.

With these potential risks in mind, we can take steps to reduce computer-related issues. One way is to limit the amount of time individuals are on their computers. By spending less time on the computer, people can make room for physical activities. Additionally, taking frequent breaks from the computer over time can reduce eye and body strain.
