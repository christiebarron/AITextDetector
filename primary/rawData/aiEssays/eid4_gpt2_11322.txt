The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it gives the reader something to ponder before jumping head first into the story. It's also filled with plenty of spoilers so stay tuned.

Here's the short review: How did a writer create a mystery/jargon story without telling you the name of her character, which is essentially the same as writing a story about a cat? Well, we had a cat and, for us, that's exactly what Winter Hibiscus is: A reader who believes in a mystery or even an explanation for its existence, but would rather know more about it through a single revelation rather than to wait through the full story.

Winter Hibiscus has been described as a man of the trees, and one of the characters in the novel is quite a beast. From looking at her body, to walking around every room with a beard like a snake. We never see Winter's eyes, her face, or her skin like a cat, but Winter Hibiscus seems to believe everything she says or does, in fact she's a cat at heart.

All in all:

Winter Hibiscus is not a terrible author, but there are always bad ones out there and they always come with such force. As a fantasy novel, Winter Hibiscus is a great read, and no one should miss it.
