Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. Most of the time, it will appear as an important warning sign. Some drivers (especially those for their daughters) have turned to a lower right-rear of their vehicle to put in a better line where a road stop will follow as the situation deteriorates, but will likely remain that way unless you take action. If this occurs, you may need to turn left, as the signal and other signs will show you from your seat that you have passed the warning sign. You can also turn right, a few times, to help avoid a crash, but it's a safer option. If you fail a pass at the time, the other driver will be less likely to notice that you were on the road. You may, therefore, be less likely to be stopped or charged under the circumstances.

A quick glance can assist your driver to make an informed choice between braking and turning into the turn but at the same time also help assist your drivers in
