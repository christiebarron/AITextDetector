In Joe Kurmaski's poem, "Rough Road Ahead," the features of the setting have a profound effect on the cyclist. The poem narrates a cyclist's experience in a harsh environment, describing the treacherous terrain and tumultuous weather. 

Throughout the poem, Kurmaski highlights the intensity of the cyclist's situation. The poem opens with a description of the “abundant hills” that “tested” the cyclist and “spilled” him “into road buckets of mud.” The difficult terrain represents a major challenge the cyclist must confront, casting doubt in his or her mind as to whether they will be able to traverse the uneasy terrain and press on through the ride. Not only does the weather complicate the situation, but it also mirrors the cyclist's inner struggle. The “wind razed” the cyclist’s face while the “rain washed.” The weight of this struggle is further reinforced by its relationship with the external elements; the cycler was challenged by the heavy wind and pelting rain.

Kurmaski's masterful use of language to describe the environment allows the reader to experience the full effects of the setting on the cyclist. Through the poem, the cyclist is not only challenged by an intense environment, but is also forced to reassess his or her identity and ambition. Overall, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in profound ways and shape the poem's themes
