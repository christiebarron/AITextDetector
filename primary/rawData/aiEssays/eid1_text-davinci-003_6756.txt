To the Editor:

I am writing to discuss the effects of computers on people. In todayâ€™s modern world, computers are an integral part of our lives. We rely on them to do our work, organize our lives, and communicate with others.

But computers can also have negative effects on people. Many of us spend countless hours on our computers, neglecting our interpersonal relationships and physical health. We become detached from the world around us and our work suffers.

On the other hand, computers can also have positive effects on people. The Internet is a powerful tool for gathering information and connecting with people from all over the world. We can use computers to further our education, work, and travel opportunities.

Overall, computers can be a great boon for us if used in moderation. We should strive to use them to further our knowledge and expand our horizons, while not neglecting our health and relationships.

I urge readers to be conscious of their computer use and ensure that it is not interfering with their well-being.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
