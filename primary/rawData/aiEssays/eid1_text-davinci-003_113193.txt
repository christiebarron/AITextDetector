Dear Editor, 

I am writing to you in regard to the effects of computer technology on people. We have all seen how computers have drastically changed our lives, making things easier and more efficient in many aspects. Some people, however, are concerned about the impact of this technology on our society. 

In my opinion, the advantages of computer technology far outweigh any potential downside. Computers are not only used to make work or studying more manageable, but can also have an incredibly positive impact on our lives. For instance, computers can help connect people across different regions and facilitate learning. With the help of computers, more people can gain access to educational opportunities that were not available before. In addition, computers can help create better work productivity, allowing for more efficient use of time. 

It is important to note, however, that computers can have negative impacts as well. For example, the use of computers can lead to increased isolation and can limit our direct social interactions. It is also important to be aware of how cyberbullying can cause negative effects. To prevent this, we must be sure to use computers responsibly. 

In conclusion, computers are powerful tools that can help revolutionize how we interact and learn. With proper management and awareness of its potential risks, computers can have beneficial effects in our lives. 

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
