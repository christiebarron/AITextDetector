The construction of the Empire State Building was a major engineering feat. Not only did it rise above the skyscrapers of New York City, but it also had the unique feature of allowing dirigibles to dock. This was an ambitious plan, and the builders faced numerous obstacles in its realization. 

First, the mooring mast of which the docks were to be suspended needed to be secured to the building. The mast had a unique design, being over 200 feet in length and suspended from the skyscraper's 86th and 102nd floors. This required a great deal of structural knowledge and engineering prowess. The mast was built with a universal joint to enable dirigibles to steer around the tower, rather than simply ascend and descend trough the middle. This represented a significant challenge in terms of engineering.

In addition, dirigibles required a minimum airspeed and certain amounts of wind for landing. Therefore, a system of windsocks and searchlights were placed on the building's roof. This provided pilots with vital visual cues to help them correctly anchor their ships. However, the windsocks and searchlights posed the risk of electrical hazards, and the building itself risked structural damage if the ships were not correctly anchored. 

The final obstacle the builders faced was the logistics of organizing the air traffic. Although the mooring mast structure was ultimately successful in allowing dirigibles to dock at the skyscraper, the traffic coordinator had to ensure that the airships maneu
