Dear Editor, 

Today we live in a society where computers are used in almost every aspect of our lives. From office work to entertainment and communication, computers have changed the way we live and interact with one another.

However, there are two sides to this discussion. Some argue that computer usage has had a negative effect on people, citing that it encourages a sedentary lifestyle and addiction to the technology. Others argue that computers have had a positive effect, providing people with increased access to information and new avenues to connect with people. 

I strongly believe that computers have had a more profoundly positive effect on our lives. While it is true that too much computer usage can lead to a sedentary lifestyle and possible addiction issues, used correctly, computers can open us up to new ideas, information, and experiences. Through computers, we can access a wealth of knowledge, connect with people from all over the world, and create something completely new. People can learn new skills, build networks, and pursue passions. In effect, computers can revolutionize our society and open up countless opportunities for improvement.

I urge readers to adopt a more positive outlook on how computers are used in our lives and be mindful of how it is affecting us. With the right use and understanding, computers can bring immense benefit to our daily lives, and this should not be overlooked. 

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
