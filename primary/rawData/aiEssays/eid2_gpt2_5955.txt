I believe that censorship of materials in libraries and cultural centers can't be tolerated. When you censor books that may have been written by a student, even if you have a teaching position, that is a significant violation and it needs to be done in a way that makes sense for a community of students and not in the way that universities are used or thought to be used. I don't know what is the proper use for that or is it in a way that can get students and my staff members to sit down and see what's going on and just look at whatever they're reading, etc. (There are plenty of cases where university professors or administrators can't be held liable for student conduct or their actions.) It helps our students better understand that, and that we have a commitment to a free and open Internet. There needs to be some sort of policy in place to make it harder to censor materials that you don't agree with.

The problem with that, of course, is censorship of materials that the public uses for their entertainment. For me, that gets in the way of my activities, and especially of my community of students and faculty. It gets in the way of doing my volunteer work to promote the issues, or what my community says, about education. I am not taking anything for granted for a month. I don't take any money for that. Even if I did be involved, I wouldn't take those days with it.

I have to say that I like
