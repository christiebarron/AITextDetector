The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho is meant to be a reflection of the protagonist's perseverance and determination. The protagonist is determined to retake a test that she was unable to pass in the winter, and sees the blossoming of the hibiscus as a representation of her own growth and potential. By seeing the hibiscus bloom, the protagonist is hopeful that she too will be able to grow and reach her potential. The phrase "when they come back in the spring" serves as a reminder of the cycle of growth, change, and renewal. The imagery of the melting snow and returning geese is symbolic of a natural transition from winter to spring, and thus, from a time of stagnation to a time of growth. The ending is meant to emphasize the protagonist's hope for a better future, no matter the hardships she has faced.
