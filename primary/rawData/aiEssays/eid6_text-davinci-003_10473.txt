The Empire State Building was a remarkable feat of engineering when it was first built in 1931. One of its unique features was the fact that it was designed to accommodate dirigibles that would dock on top of the skyscraper. As remarkable as this may sound, the constructors of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock, as described in “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted.

The most significant challenge was the fact that the building was so tall. At its time of completion it was the tallest building in the world, standing at nearly a quarter of a mile tall, which posed a rather large obstacle to docking dirigibles. While the Empire State Building was one of the most advanced in its consideration of dirigibles, the main problem was that the mast, which was meant to provide the proper guidance for dirigibles to land, was simply not tall enough for them to actually reach the roof of the building without crashing. Even if the mast had been tall enough, the winds of the city would have made it incredibly difficult to land.

In order to overcome this, the engineers of the Empire State building had to get creative. First, they had to find a way to secure the mast so that it would stay perfectly straight even in the face of strong winds coming from all directions. To do this, they constructed a series of stays stretching from the base of the mast to the roof of
