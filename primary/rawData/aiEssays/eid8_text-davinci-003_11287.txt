I was out shopping with my best friend when I felt a need for some retail therapy. We decided to hit up the mall for some new clothes. I was in the middle of trying on a cute dress when my friend made a comment about how it was my color. I laughed, and my best friend laughed too. 

We had a good time in the store trying on different outfits and looking at the different styles. Afterwards, we grabbed some lunch at the food court. 

We were laughing and talking about some of the funny things that had happened earlier in the day. Suddenly my friend doubled over in laughter and pointed to a gentleman walking by. He was wearing leggings with a shirt that didn't quite cover his belly. We both burst out in laughter, and suddenly I felt a real connection with my friend. It was like we could just share anything and have a good laugh. 

The moment felt special, like our friendship was built on more than just words and hanging out, but through laughter and having fun.
