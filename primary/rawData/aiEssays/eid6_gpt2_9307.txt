The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first was that the city's air conditioning facilities were inadequate. A plan was made for the buildings to accommodate 300,000 visitors a day—but when the building was torn up, some of the buildings were destroyed. The construction was supposed to be performed "at will" for six months, but because of the "need to increase construction and renovation efficiencies, and because of government intervention in the commercial economy, it should not even be considered feasible in a few short weeks."[14]

But as the British military progressed over the next decade, the building was becoming "unworkable".[14] On December 14, 1913, the Empire State Building was forced to give in to a desperate state of emergency, as the building's ceiling collapsed and its ceiling buckled in.
