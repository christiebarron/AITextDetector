Computers have many effects on people. Most of the time, we don't even know what their life experiences are. It's a small question: Should we care about them?

My goal for the game is to solve many of these questions within a small time span. A couple of things to keep in mind:

When working on a game which has many "big players", I always look for players that get to know each other a bit. This means there's a lot more than just friends and family. I've tried different ways to try and keep the game balanced, which is very hard to do at first. I've spent a lot of time researching players and people, finding people that share my opinions and suggestions, etc... If I don't find a person for this project, I've said "I don't want to participate" for 10 minutes in most cases, and it's usually very bad business. I've been trying to figure out when to stop doing it, so that I don't have to. This doesn't mean you need to play until 10 minutes, though. I try to have a couple hours of interaction with friends when I feel that I'm done looking and am working on things in a new way. I try to talk to people in a new way and have conversations in a different way, in a different space. Sometimes there are some other aspects of the game that might be a bit different if you were to have a lot of them.
