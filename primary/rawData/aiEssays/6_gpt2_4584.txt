"People wanted the windows glass to be fixed, the windows be painted red and the roof be done away with," says Steve Boulger, president of the Empire State Building Group, which is building the twin towers. "We knew they had to do that. I had been in this building more than 30 years... I still am.

One was a 2,000-square-foot apartment-style building - which was built over Memorial Street on the north side of the former World Trade Center - to be rebuilt as the new Building 7. Then, in late 2007, the city began looking again, with a new building concept. By the time it opened in late September 2008, the Empire State Building Group in Oakland had built a one-building apartment complex, the Empire State Center, for nearly a decade. The Empire State Building Group's latest plan was a 1.5-million-square-foot space, which was constructed to be the latest in a series of plans for the Empire State in the area and next to two towers. The project, which was announced by city planners, included plans for a four-story, five-story, and three-story tower at the complex,
