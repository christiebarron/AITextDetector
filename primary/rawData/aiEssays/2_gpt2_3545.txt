I believe that censorship of materials in libraries has led to an increase in censorship of those materials as well. This has also been due to the increasing availability of technology in libraries that has transformed the way scholars and researchers participate with regard to the content of their literature. In particular, new books have been published which require different types of literary material. We are working with the authors to provide a new format for those wishing to read certain kinds of books and we encourage this by adding a special section entitled "Complement of a Non-Moral Review" within our publication and submission guidelines. We hope to continue this dialog with you and with you, so that more people are able to read certain kinds of books and read their materials.
