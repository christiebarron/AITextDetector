I recently walked into the mall to buy a new pair of shoes, but I was not aware that the store had changed its opening and closing timings. I arrived at 7 p.m., instead of the usual 6 p.m. When I explained the situation, the associate was very apologetic but unfortunately said the store was now closed. I was disappointed, but I remained patient. 

I thanked the associate for his understanding and said that I would return the next day. He smiled and said he would be happy to serve me, which made me feel better. The next day, I arrived at the store with a good attitude, and was pleased to find that the same associate was working again. He gladly let me in and helped me find the right pair of shoes. 

In the end, I was grateful that I had maintained my patience throughout the situation, as it resulted in a positive outcome.
