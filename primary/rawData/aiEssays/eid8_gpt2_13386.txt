One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my family had seen her, and went to see how she is doing. I remember this when she first walked up to me and said, "Hey, this is my wife." I could hear her in their own faces as she talked. It's been about three years now, and we've had much, much better communication. One of my friends once told me that he had had a "choke" at my door because his wife was "sitting right there in front of me looking at her, and she says to her like this, 'Look, my wife's like 'Oh my God! She's got her own dog.'" If you can get along there, good for you!

It wasn't because of our gender but because of people's attitudes towards being a woman in relation to children.
