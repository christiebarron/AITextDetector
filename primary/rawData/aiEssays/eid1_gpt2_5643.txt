Computers have many effects on people. They can cause a person to experience mental instability, depression, anxiety - all sorts of effects which are very hard to control and sometimes even fatal. A couple things that I love about computer programming is that most programmers would always jump to extreme ends, but in computer science it often takes even a strong sense of logic to get people to agree to do something with computers. Sometimes things just get worse from there, but I think what I often find is that when people start using computers to achieve higher goals or to learn to better themselves they start to get more and more frustrated than in most high-stakes scientific research.

So I've been thinking about trying to keep computer science at the forefront of our understanding of how computer science functions, and that's the one idea that I always find so very interesting and so interesting that I'll end up working on a new film, "Computer Science for the 99.9999%", because when it comes to what computer science is, I always feel like I'm really the only one who works with computers at all and I never quite get what I wanted.

It always feels to me like this great power lies in what you can learn from computer science. You won't find a computer scientist in the whole world who is a fanboy for computer science. In my own experience many mathematicians and natural sciences scientists are very technical and a little goofy about it, but they don't really get it, and I think
