I used to work with David, a colleague from my old job who I’d been friends with for several years. We were the sorts of friends who would often tease each other, and our banter was our way of staying connected and showing our friendship.

One day, David was telling me about a funny incident that had happened to him the other day, and I was struggling to contain my laughter. I kept laughing to the point where tears were streaming down my face, and David couldn’t help but join in. His laughter was infectious, and soon the whole department was echoing with our laughter.

The laughter kept going until I was snorting and gasping for air, and David had to hold his stomach to stop it aching from all the laughter.

Since then, every time either of us thinks back to that moment, we burst into laughter, just like before. It’s not only a great reminder of our friendship, but also a reminder of how laughter is a shortcut to having a great connection with someone, even if it’s sometimes a bit silly.
