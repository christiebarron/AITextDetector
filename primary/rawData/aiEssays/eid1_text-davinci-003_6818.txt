Censorship in libraries stirs up a heated debate over security issues, freedom of speech, and parental responsibility. On one hand, many people suggest that libraries should remove certain books, music, movies, and magazines from their shelves if they are deemed offensive. On the other hand, some argue that libraries should protect freedom of speech, including that which is deemed offensive to some.

The defenders of censorship in libraries cite security issues as their primary concern. When controversial topics are left unmonitored, they worry that young readers could gain access to material too mature or graphic for their age. A balance must be struck between preserving access to these materials as protected speech but also protecting young readers from accessing them at an inappropriate age.

Another argument for censorship in libraries is the preservation of family values. There are certain books, movies, and other materials that are particularly offensive to some families. Censorship would allow libraries to better respect the values of the community and families within it by not providing access to materials that are particularly offensive or undesirable.

Despite these potential benefits of censorship in libraries, there are also a great many drawbacks. Most significantly, censorship of certain books, music, movies, or magazines limits the freedom of speech. It limits the open exchange of ideas and impedes on the expression of creativity and artistic license. Furthermore, censorship in libraries, and particularly library staff, is subjective. The material that is deemed offensive to one reader may be perfectly suitable for another reader
