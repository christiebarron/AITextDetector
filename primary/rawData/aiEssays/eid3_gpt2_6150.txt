Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

The most fundamental point to bear in mind in ROUGH AND ROW UP is that there are many things that help prevent roads from being rusted during a major development such as a major highway network change and major road infrastructure overhaul (including in Scotland, Denmark, Australia and some parts of Japan). ROUGH AND ROW UP is set to provide a better idea on how best to avoid road faults for cyclists.

In previous ROUGH AND ROW UP articles I highlighted the areas where roads can be rusted during roadworks. As a cyclist, I tend to look at what can be done before getting on my bicycles. We know that in certain situations, a large quantity of braking at the edge would have to be done first. Even though there is already a standard brake system in Germany, it is not clear if ROUGH AND ROW UP would encourage that to happen.

ROUGH AND ROW UP is more like a road map compared to a road map of road traffic. The most significant changes I had to make were a few changes to the way in which the road was run; more cycle paths to make cycling easier; and the installation of new bicycle gates. In my tests, the key difference in the two scenarios, in ROUGH AND ROW UP, seemed to be the combination of the need to improve road safety; and the need to prevent wheel-wheels
