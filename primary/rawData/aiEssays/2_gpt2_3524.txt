I believe that censorship of materials in libraries will continue in the current censorship conditions and at present, in some cases, will result in an increase of the proportion of books published with the express purpose of promoting an atmosphere of censorship. This is not a new idea, but I believe that today it represents a time of real change. While the freedom of speech and the free distribution of articles and other materials is a fundamental human right, our society today has a serious danger of the undermining of certain public freedoms. All freedom of expression should be protected and protected everywhere. And no amount of censorship that is imposed on academic institutions, political parties and newspapers cannot be taken seriously. I strongly support the establishment of a National Board of Review and have spoken publicly with all the newspapers in Britain regarding this matter.

We are here at last, with the support of the Executive Board of the Society for the Development of Freedom, a British government, to begin considering the issue of intellectual freedom. All academics, journalists, and writers, who disagree with the view expressed by the Executive Board, have a right to make their views known and presented on a level playing field with all the public in the UK. This is our priority to strengthen our position, and ensure that our research does not fall on deaf ears.

The Executive Board acknowledges strongly that freedom of political participation is a "big but important issue" and that freedom of expression is of high value and value that many academics of diverse political affiliations seek to achieve.
