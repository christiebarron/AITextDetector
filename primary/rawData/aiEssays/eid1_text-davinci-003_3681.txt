I am writing to voice my opinion on the effects computers have on people and to persuade your readers to see the issue in the same way I do. 

In an age of ever-advancing technology, computers have become a part of life and are essential for the comfortable application of knowledge. However, they have had both a positive and negative effect. 

On the plus side, computers allow us to complete daily tasks quickly and accurately. They also create opportunities for people to connect with each other. The invention of online communities has spurred virtual friendships and networks. We have discovered new ways to entertain, organize, and learn.

On the other hand, computer use can have some undesirable implications. For instance, overuse of the internet and computers has caused fatigue and social isolation, along with creating an environment that can be exploited, leading to scams and fraud. The security of personal data and financial information is always in question. Another downside is that people can become overly dependent on technology and forget how to complete basic tasks such as problem solving and communication.

I believe that computers should be used with moderation, so that all of the possible advantages and disadvantages are taken into consideration. Used effectively, computers can enhance our lives in many ways, from allowing us to stay in touch with distant relatives to offering fast access to information.
