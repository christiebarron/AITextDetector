The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They needed to keep the lights on to avoid the problem of the lights flashing in the morning and evening hours. It turns out they had done their homework.

The first of the two lasers, developed under the direction of the famed design firm Kia, was installed on the second rooftop of the State Building, the second from the lobby. There is also a 2,500 square foot courtyard just in front of the two lasers. The two laser sets were installed by various engineers and designers.

The first project was to build and maintain the upper portion of the rooftop ceiling and to create the "sky above" view. In fact, the idea was to give us this view below, since that was where the three other high-tech skyscrapers in the city stood. The first laser and 2,500 square feet of outdoor space took us to a point where we had access to everything from a balcony to the sky above.

In the process of building this second tower, the 2,500 foot lower half was moved from the original building of the State at the north end of the Building to a much better spot as in the past.

And here, it goes again:

This is the first time that the two towers have been linked together. The building originally provided a single light to the sky above and the 2,500 foot lower one provided a second one, which
