The Empire State Building, at the time one of the tallest buildings in the world, presented quite a challenge in allowing dirigibles to dock to its mooring mast, located on the observation deck. Constructed in 1930, it was part of a worldwide movement to build taller and taller structures. Far from relying on balloon masts of simpler times, the Empire State Building project employed a rather complicated docking system that needed to meet the demands of the new larger and heavier airships.

In order to make the mooring mast compatible with the modern dirigibles of the day, a unique design incorporating a breathing mechanism created by the Empire State Building explorer, Edward C. Curtis, was devised. This design included a series of fifteen different pulleys, bells, and levers as well as an anchor point that was suspended by a tension cable. The cable could be released in an instant to allow the dirigible to ascend back into the sky.

Although the Empire State Building mooring mast was unique in its design, the biggest challenge was installing and fitting the structure into the observation deck while still allowing it to remain secure and durable. To aid in this challenging task, a fortress of steel beams and columns, providing support sturdy enough to carry the added weight of a dirigible, was constructed. The steel beams were secured by a total of ninety-six steel anchor bolts, eleven on each side, and forty-two on top. Unfortunately, the design of the m
