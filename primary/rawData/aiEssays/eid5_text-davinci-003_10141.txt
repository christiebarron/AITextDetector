The memoir ‘From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives’ by Narciso Rodriguez is a work of beauty and emotion. It’s filled with memories of Rodriguez’s childhood in New Jersey, ranging from his Latinx upbringing and his loving but resource-strapped family, to his struggles to fit in in mainstream society. From start to finish, the memoir is full of a deep-rooted emotion, making it a captivating read.

The memoir's tone and mood are drawn primarily from Rodriguez's reflections about his own experience. He imparts a strong sense of nostalgia throughout the memoir, taking the reader back to his childhood and teenage years, as well as his parents' early years in the United States. Through his detailed descriptions and raw honesty, a palpable atmosphere of sentimental longing emerges. This sentiment is especially prominent when Rodriguez remembers his family's sacrifices and resourcefulness—their love for each other in the face of adversity.

The memoir is further underscored by a subtle hint of melancholy. While some of his reminiscences are happy and filled with joy, others are tinged with sadness. For example, Rodriguez often recounts being made fun of for being Latinx or poor. This sorrowful undertone is offset by his joy when his hard work eventually pays off, as he is accepted into the esteemed Tisch School of the Arts and graduates. His resilience in the face of difficulties is inspiring and uplifting.
