I was in line at the grocery store the other day and the person ahead of me had a massive amount of items to buy. I had to go to the store late and the line was long, so getting out of there soon was not looking very promising. As the cashier scanned the items, I could feel my patience slipping away.

However, I decided that I wasn't going to let my frustration affect my mindset. I reminded myself to simply accept the situation and not to give in to my annoyance. So, I simply stood in line, tapping my foot a little faster than usual, but still with a lot of patience.

The person ahead of me was so thankful that I wasn't making a fuss about them taking longer than usual to check out. As we talked about the long line, they told me that they also had to wait in line for a long time. By this point, another cashier opened up and I was able to check out much faster. 

It was a good reminder of how important it is to be patient and understanding no matter the situation. The person ahead showed me that the same could be done for me when I needed it.
