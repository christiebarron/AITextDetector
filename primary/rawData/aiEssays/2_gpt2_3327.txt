I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is not an effective way of encouraging community participation. As a group, the only thing we do here is talk about them. And it is my hope that the people here who seek to make this website possible might become people who feel the same way. Perhaps that is what their experiences are to us, but they also know they should be encouraged to come here. I ask that every individual, including myself, be able to have an open discussion.

For those who were unable to make it to this meeting, see the following threads.

As requested we will be adding more information about how Open Access works on November 17th and 21st.
