The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They considered using bazookas, or even the smaller, lighter models for aerial viewing, but those efforts ended up hurting the building if the dirigible's weight allowed it to do so.

"My gut instinct was that just so we can have a way to make it larger we'd like other artists to come along and make it smaller."

Wine, for which the tower was awarded the World Art Prize for its works, is used in other productions.

Some of the designs used by the Empire State Building to showcase its futuristic design were created by The World Art Prize for its works, as well as work by New York's Central Business Improvement Commission, which approved the skyscraper's design with the approval of the city of New York City. All these works were awarded during the World Art Prizes at a ceremony held over the night of the awards.
