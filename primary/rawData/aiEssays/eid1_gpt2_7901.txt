Computers have many effects on people. As the world of computing shrinks, they multiply. It's an increasing number of people who are willing to learn more and to experiment. More people are willing to come to this knowledge, they discover more about it, because they are willing to try what they don't want to, get away from the traditional ways, go to the open computer, do stuff that they didn't want to do before.

If you're a student who is a computer nerd who loves machines and has come to learn more about this world, you should go to the computer science courses. But if you've come to see what you need to do for free, you can see what might apply to your own world â€” and if you have to, you have to go to a place where you can find and do things to make it your own.

So the thing is, I don't want to say the name of the internet. I want to say, we need to do something with computers. We need to do something that doesn't cost so much, that will be more convenient than having a bunch of computers. I want to say, our current system is obsolete and you can go on looking with laptops and your iPod, and look at the Web. But we need to do something different with these things. We need to make more choices around technology. We need to see it for ourselves as a resource, a challenge, a way of life.
