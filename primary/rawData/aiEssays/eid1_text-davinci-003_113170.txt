Dear Editor,

As computers become increasingly embedded in our lives, their effects on people have become more evident. It was not all that long ago when computers did not exist, and even less so when they were widely used. Today, however, many aspects of our lives are shaped and influenced by computers, and this has caused both positive and negative outcomes.

On the one hand, computers have drastically increased our efficiency and access to information. We can now obtain data almost instantaneously with just the swipe of a finger. This has allowed us to make better informed decisions and provides us with the opportunity to make decisions quicker. Furthermore, computers have allowed us to communicate with people from across the globe, something that simply would not have been possible a few short decades ago.

At the same time, though, the use of computers has made us dependent on them. We are used to having all of our questions answered with simple Google searches and are losing our ability to problem-solve on our own. Additionally, the use of computers can lead to feelings of loneliness and isolation when we spend too much time interacting with a computer and not enough time with other people.

In conclusion, it is clear that computers have improved many aspects of our lives, but they can also be detrimental if not used properly. It is important to weigh the pros and cons of computer technology and use it responsibly in order to maximize its benefits. 

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
