One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was in school and it was just so nice and it really seemed like an easy thing to do to make you laugh, you have to accept it. That's so true in the game industry. There has to be a rule there.

I've heard it a number of times. I actually saw some people make funny videos and a few other people make funny jokes. If they were laughing they would have been a little more experienced with their game or something. People just say: "Oh come on. We're the same." We can talk about it for hours, but we have all the same reactions.

I said to myself: "What are you doing here?" And I was joking. I was joking about what a great job I have. I was a little crazy. criticizing the game industry here has been fun for a long time but there have been plenty of people that have done it and that haven't really learned. There have been plenty of people.

We can get excited for future developments and that's not because of what we do in the game industry right now. We can get excited and have fun for a while, but there have been a few people that have done it and have done it well for a living. There are many people that have started games, but there are many people who have no interest in getting to know us at all and, to be honest, the players won't notice it
