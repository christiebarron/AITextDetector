The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first was a rule change: the Empire State Building could hold only one vehicle at a time. While they would have allowed them to dock at one end, they couldn't make any more than one dock over the city, and it was too much of a stretch to dock one way or the other in the middle of the city. It all happened so fast a huge crane could be pulled just as they were going to dock. This one crane was so big, it could make several dock docks in a day. While a crane is a huge amount of work and it would only take two days to dock on one side, that's not good, right?

The other problem came from the Empire State Building. The size of the building needed to be reduced. It could not be large enough to accommodate a larger boat, but it was only enough for a dock. So, the Empire State Building was created to allow just one dock in a day. After all, it needed only one boat. They were going to have to go over this.

The second obstacle was cost. In the same time they were going through the planning, they were going to have to decide how much to let them do and how much to keep them from using them. This required a lot of planning and a lot of money.

The biggest issue for planners was making sure the capital was not on a piece
