Dear Editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the great impact that computers have had on people's lives. While some have argued that computers place a limit on human interaction and creativity, I firmly believe that they have done much more positive than negative.

We live in a time where technology is everywhere and computers are becoming part of our daily lives. With the advances in technology, computers have made the functioning of our lives more efficient and easier. For example, from mental calculations to mathematical equations, computers are able to perform tasks with great accuracy and speed which cuts down the time taken to perform the same tasks manually. In addition, computers are able to store huge amounts of data which are easily accessible when it is needed.

Furthermore, with the help of the internet, computers have opened up a gateway for people to communicate with each other. We can connect with people around the world instantly which has made the world a smaller place. We are now able to access information quickly and conveniently from around the globe which has created new opportunities for learning and exploring. We are also able to collaborate with others and share ideas which has allowed for greater innovation.

In conclusion, computers are more than just tools of convenience. They have revolutionized the way we communicate, study, work and play. While it is not without its downsides, the benefits and opportunities computers bring are immense. I believe that we are able to reap the most benefits from computers when we use them
