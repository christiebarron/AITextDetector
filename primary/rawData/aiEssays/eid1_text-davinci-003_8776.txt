The other day I was out to dinner with my best friend of 20 years. We both stopped to admire a window display in the bustling city street and we started to laugh at the same time. We somehow both recognized the hilarity of the situation the same moment and started to laugh out loud and uncontrollably which drew the attention of many of the pedestrians. 

We couldn't help but keep laughing all the way through our dinner and we kept receiving funny looks from the people around us, but it didn't matter. We were both having so much fun and it felt so good - as if all the pieces of the puzzle finally fit. The longer we laughed, the closer we felt to each other. 

At one point, I found myself unexpectedly tearing up from all the laughter. I took a moment to compose myself and looked over to my friend. I expected her to be surprised by my sudden outburst, but instead she was laughing with me. I was instantly filled with warmth and happiness for our long-time friendship.

It felt like an eternity had passed in that moment and I was so grateful laughter brought us closer together than ever before. I knew no matter what happened, our relationship would remain unshaken regardless of ups and downs - because in the end, laughter will always be here to remind us how funny and precious life can be.
