Recently, I was on a date with my girlfriend at our favorite Mexican restaurant down the road. We had been looking forward to it all week and I hadn't seen her for two days, so we were both excited! As we waited for our food, we chatted and told each other funny stories. We both found it hilarious when I told her about the time I accidentally spilled salsa all over my shirt while trying to dip my tortilla chip into my plate. We both laughed so hard that it made our stomachs hurt!

Our food finally arrived and we settled in to enjoy it. But halfway through, we noticed that the salsa had a particularly spicy kick to it. I started to feel a faint tickle in my throat and, before I knew it, I was laughing hysterically and tears were streaming down my face! My girlfriend couldn't help but join in and soon we were both guffawing and snorting uncontrollably.

It felt great to laugh like that with my girlfriend and it brought us even closer together. Whenever I think back on it, a smile spreads across my face and I'm reminded of the closeness that laughter can bring.
