When the Empire State Building was built in 1930-31, one of its most talked about features was the plan for allowing dirigibles to dock at its peak. Though the idea was met with great enthusiasm at the time, the architects and builders of the structure faced several difficult challenges in allowing airships to dock at the top of the building.

The first obstacle they faced was the regulations surrounding airship docking. Those running the project had to carefully draft plans that abided by the existing air navigation laws, which strictly governed the protocols of how and where airships could safely dock. The New York City zoning board had to be consulted and convinced of the proposal each step of the way. Regulations limited mooring space to a specific area of the building, which posed stability and security issues as the Empire State Building did not possess a flat roof, and airship personnel and objects that used the mast had to be supplied with safe access to the ground, something the design of the building did not offer.

Electrical and mechanical requirements posed further problems for the innovators. The mooring mast had to be powered electrically to keep airships in place, and this was difficult to achieve given the building's height and schedule. Electrical wiring had to run up the entire structure, and the engineers could not test the strength of their cables until the building was almost complete. The mooring mast itself had its own problem; it was fully enclosed, meaning airships had to
