 

Dear Editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. As technology continues to improve each day, we have to be mindful of the effects that using computers can have on our everyday lives.

It is no question that computers are an invaluable asset in our current society. They help eradicate mundane tasks and contribute to various industries in a tremendous way. However, too much of a good thing can be detrimental.

Computers are extremely addicting and oftentimes leave people feeling exhausted and overstimulated when used for too long. Furthermore, its effects can be seen in the physical realm; more and more people who are confined to their desks, and not out participating in physical activities. This, accompanied with the unhealthy food many people consume while connected to a device, could lead to obesity and other health issues. 

Moreover, computers can be incredibly distracting, and can often lead people to lose focus on other important aspects of their lives. Studies have shown that computer use often abates productivity and can lead to a multitude of negative emotions. 

It is important to recognize the effects that computers have on people, both good and bad. We should encourage ourselves and others to limit the amount of time spent behind a device so that we are able to gain the most from our day to day activities.

I urge the readers to join me in balancing our use of computers in order to best enhance our everyday lives.
