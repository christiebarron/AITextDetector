You won't have to go as far if it doesn't go ahead as long as it goes right over the threshold at low speed. Adjusting the threshold for 'exercise' would still allow you to go far but would mean you'd have to take an extra 10,000m to a mile, meaning that if you set the threshold for exercise you may be out there for hours at a time.

In some cases you might even be able to turn up and even drive a kilometre to meet the limit but this will depend heavily on your skill level.
