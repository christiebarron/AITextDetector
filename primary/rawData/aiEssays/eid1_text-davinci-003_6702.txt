Dear Editor,

With the advancement of technology, computers have become a daily life necessity for many individuals and businesses. It is undebatable that computers do have a great impact on peopleâ€™s lives in many different ways. Although some people believe that computers have a negative effect on people, I believe that they have a positive effect.

Computers have made activities much easier and faster, enabling us to complete our tasks quickly and accurately. They have enabled us to utilize our time more efficiently and they have enabled us to easily access information and knowledge that was previously difficult to obtain.

Computers have also helped increase the communication between friends and family members. With the help of social media websites, video and audio chat services, and emails, individuals are able to stay connected with people who are located far away.

Furthermore, computers can be used to help individuals become more creative. With the internet and other powerful tools, individuals can find recipes, craft ideas, music, and much more. This creates opportunities for people to explore their creative sides and to develop new skills.

In conclusion, computers have enabled us to use our time more efficiently and to stay connected with our loved ones, as well as becoming more creative. Therefore, I believe that computers have had a positive effect on people and I would encourage everyone to take advantage of the benefits that computers can offer.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
