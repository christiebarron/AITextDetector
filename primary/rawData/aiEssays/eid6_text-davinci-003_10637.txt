Building the Empire State Building presented several obstacles to the construction of a docking station for dirigibles, or airships, one of the most interesting being the safety concerns associated with the volatile hydrogen gas used to power the ships. The construction of dirigibles had been hampered by several disasters involving the use of hydrogen gas, including the crash of the U.S.S. Akron in 1933 and the Hindenburg disaster in 1937, leading to a heightened concern for the use of this gas. As such, any incidences of dirigible docking would have to be closely monitored and many safety measures would need to be considered. 

In spite of these challenges, the Empire State Building builders were determined to create a docking station. The idea for the building and its airship dock came from real estate developer William Raskob who had, among other interests, a fondness for ships and their engineering. According to the article “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, Raskob was keen to build a dirigible docking station atop the Empire State Building that could facilitate the easy transport of passengers and mail, and he envisioned himself designing and piloting the vessels. 

To make his dream a reality, the first order of business was to ensure the safety of such a facility. A structure was designed to contain and contain hydrogen gas, which would then be transported upwards, via a hose, to the top of the iconic building. The design
