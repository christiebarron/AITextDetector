I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is the reason why they are not included in the public Internet access (IP) system on websites, and I believe that it is the reason why they are not included on government-based digital media channels.

Therefore, I am determined to make it illegal to distribute materials using the public Internet access. I fully expect a decision from the British Library or the Australian Libraries at the end of this month regarding the use of the Internet, but I hope to be able to make them the first to take this action.

A decision must come from the Library and from the Australian Libraries and I hope that the Library or the ALC will decide to follow this advice to ensure that materials that are covered by this requirement do not be placed in the public Internet access system (IP).

I do not believe that there is an objective, transparent, and fair process to be followed in the public Internet access system (IP), and do not believe that the use of materials where covered are made available to everyone, where they should be available to use, but even if I did take this legal action because I want to see the British Library and The Australian Libraries make it possible for the community to use the Internet, the legal process of such material should come in line with the laws of the Commonwealth of Australia and be available for anyone to access.

I also think that in this context we should be making such material available in all public access venues not just online
