When my wife Sarah and I first started dating, laughter was a connection that we had right away. We both love to laugh and that is something we did a lot of during our courtship. We would go on romantic dinner dates and usually end up in fits of uncontrollable laughter for no reason at all. Or if there was a funny movie playing, we would both be talking over the lines, trying to recreate comedic timing.

One of the funniest moments I remember was a few months in, when we were sitting in a beautiful park enjoying a sunny afternoon. We had both been talking about our respective pasts and loves, and somehow the conversation turned to a rather awkward moment that Sarah had experienced with a very old boyfriend. We both started telling each other the various ridiculous scenarios that had occurred in our past, and by the end of it we were both in tears from laughter. 

It's moments like these that have stayed with me all these years. Laughter is something that connects us on a deeper level than just laughing together. It is a bond that can't be broken, and it is something that will last us a lifetime.
