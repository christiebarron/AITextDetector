Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. Here are some of the key points:

Bikes need to be able to be ridden up to 7 miles per hour without falling over, meaning bikes need to be able to be ridden up to 10 miles per hour.

Many of the settings are optional. 'D' is for safe driving, 'W' is for road cycling and 'E' is for use during the day. The 'F' setting is in the 'Highway Mode' setting, and there's a 'G' setting in the 'Road-Bicycle Mode'. The above setting will provide a safe ride up to 7 miles per hour without falling over. The 'J' setting, on the other hand, is not optional and will not be used as it's the maximum amount of speed the driver may desire.

Bikes should wear seat belts whenever possible. This is part of the policy to stop cyclists with injuries that start in the heart. Seat belts are not recommended for racing but are also usually unnecessary for 'road cycling'.

If a cyclist's injury is severe enough to kill them, they may call an ambulance to take them to emergency services. If the cyclist's injury lasts less than 3 minutes, they may need a transport to their local hospital.

Bikes were designed to slow oncoming traffic, but we should do a greater good in slowing cycling.
