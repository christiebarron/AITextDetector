Dear Editor, 

I believe that the effects of computers on people are both beneficial and concerning. On the one hand, computers have allowed us to process information faster, create efficient systems and networks, and even operate processes more effectively in the workplace. They provide a useful platform for work and communication that has strengthened the global economy and allowed for seamless work flows between countries and offices. 

On the other hand, heavy reliance on computers can lead to alienation, sedentary lifestyles, and cyber risks. It is imperative that we monitor our usage of computer technology to ensure that these risks are minimised.

To make sure that we are making the most out of these computer tools, I think it is important that we limit our screen time and pay attention to how computers are affecting our mental and physical health. As computer usage increases, so do potential physical and psychological issues, and it is essential that we are aware of these and can actively control when we access computers technology and how long we use it for, in order to make sure that it is enriching our lives instead of stealing away our time.

I urge your readers to consider how computers are affecting their lives - both positively and negatively - and take steps to make sure that their use of computers is being beneficial to their wellbeing.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
