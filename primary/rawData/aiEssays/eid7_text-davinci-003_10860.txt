I was at the grocery store the other day when I realized I had left my wallet at home. I was so embarrassed, but the cashier was incredibly understanding. She made sure I could take my items now, but asked me to come soon to pay for them. Seeing how patient she was, I said I would be back in an hour. When I returned, I thanked her for being so understanding. She smiled and told me that taking the time to be patient was worth it.
