The Empire State Building was designed as a mooring mast for large dirigibles, such as the Hindenburg, to dock. The obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced to make this a reality were complex and numerous. 

The most daunting of these challenges was the height of the Empire State Building. The building stands 1,250 feet—its soaring spire stretching almost another 200 feet higher. Trying to secure a docking mast at such a height presented an immense engineering undertaking. To bridge the gap between the height of the building and its sturdiness, the builders of the Empire State Building had to construct the world’s first permanent steel-frame. This imposing steel skeleton not only had to support the weight of the dirigible but had to be strong enough to resist any force applied by wind, rain, and snow.

In addition to the structural challenge, there was also a navigation obstacle. Dirigibles, which are large airships, need a great deal of space and height to maneuver safely. The Empire State Building is situated in midtown Manhattan, and the surrounding landmark buildings restricted the dirigible’s ability to dock. To make the landing possible, the builders had to construct a system of tall mooring masts, allowing the airship to approach and descend gracefully. 

The work was particularly dangerous, as the construction workers worked high above the busy streets below. Since there was no room to land a helicopter
