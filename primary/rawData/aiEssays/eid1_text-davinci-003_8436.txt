I recently had an experience where my patience was being tested. I had been scheduled to pick up a client for a doctor’s appointment at 3 p.m. The appointment was for a medical procedure that had been long overdue.

Unfortunately, due to some miscommunication, the appointment time was not made clear, and my clients arrived an hour after the scheduled time. Above all, my clients had difficulties understanding English. 

At first, I was very frustrated that everyone was late as we were already running behind schedule. There was a part of me that was ready to give up. But then I realized how they must feel - scared and confused. After that, I took a deep breath and took a few moments to calm myself down.

I waited patiently for them to arrive, and when they did, I gave them a warm welcome. I spoke to them in a slow and gentle manner, making sure that they fully understood what was going on. I repeated things as many times as was needed until they were fully informed. 

In the end, we arrived late to the appointment, but due to my patience and understanding, we were still able to make it on time. I’m so thankful that I was able to control my emotions and have the strength to remain patient.
