I still remember it like it was yesterday - the moment laughter brought us together.

I was at a party, talking to a few people I vaguely knew, when another girl who I'd never seen before came up and started chatting. We talked about our lives, what we were studying and our mutual friends, and ended up discussing a funny video she'd seen online recently. As I listened, I felt myself being drawn in, and eventually couldn't help but laugh. To my surprise, it wasn't a polite titter either - we were both almost doubled over in fits of laughter.

We talked for hours, and it felt like time flew by - before I knew it, it was time to go home. For the first time all night I could feel the awkward silence settling between us. It felt like the moment was over, like this was something that wouldn't turn into anything else; but despite all this, I just couldn't say goodbye.

Then, she shrugged and grinned and said, "Well, I suppose we could see each other again". And suddenly, we were both laughing again - the same easy, uncontrollable laughter as before. That was almost four years ago, and we've been together ever since. We still laugh together every day, and I'm grateful for that moment that brought us together.
