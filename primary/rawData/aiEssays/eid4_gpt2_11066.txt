The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it gets the audience back to its original ending.

From a book, I've enjoyed a lot of my favorites. I love that some of them are so easy to understand. I like how Winter Hibiscus introduces the world to the reader. There's an almost poetic end to this book when it's a bit over-reliant on a little narrative element from the beginning. I love the world and the characters. It leaves the audience wanting more. It's so funny to read it and feel so invested in its pacing all through the book. It could do with a little more timeâ€¦

The books have already been very well received, and I think they're well deserved. While I think they're both worth checking out, I think they've done a good job of setting the pace.

Thanks for reading and I hope to see you on Monday for part two of Winter Hibiscus on DVD.
