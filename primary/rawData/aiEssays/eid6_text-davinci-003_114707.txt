The Empire State Building was a grand feat of engineering and design when it opened in 1931. It was also the only building at the time to feature a mooring mast for airships. Despite the success of the building in general, the task of allowing dirigibles to dock was by no means an easy one. According to Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted's book, The Mooring Mast, the plan to allow dirigibles to dock posed several difficult challenges.

One of the primary issues was the fact that the Empire State Building stood some 1250 feet tall. This was much taller than the average size of a dirigible, which posed a great risk to the airships. Dirigibles needed to typically fly within the range of 1000 and 1500 feet to dock safely. This meant that the designers and engineers of the Empire State Building had to very carefully plan out the entire docking system if they were to make the process safer for the airships.

Another challenge was the fact that the actual mooring mast itself needed to be extremely robust to stand the gusts of wind that came from the surrounding areas. This was essential, as any gust of wind that was strong enough to move the mast could cause irreparable damage to any airships that would be docked. The engineers also had to account for the weight of the airships themselves when designing the mooring mast. They had to make sure that the mast was not too much for the foundation and
