The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is a rare one. The novel reflects the emotional and personal trauma that has long enveloped the couple, many of whom have fallen into depression or anxiety over their relationship with an alcoholic former girlfriend.

Boyd said: "My husband would be so shocked, he'd just laugh at me because I had such a strong connection, so I can't remember why, but I remember that, it was so beautiful when they went out with one another and I thought, 'No, that's fine. I can move forward.' It was so beautiful living with his wife when the first time I saw her and seeing her is an telling thing.

"He was so shocked, I am very proud to have had that interaction in the first place."
