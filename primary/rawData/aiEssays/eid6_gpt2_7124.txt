The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first was the massive, unstructured dome building on the site of the World Trade Center, which was built over a long period of time. Other proposals were for a "flat" structure and a "dumb" one, but the most serious obstacle to building the Empire State Building had been its large structural and structural deficiencies—the roof was not made of steel, and any structural or structural flaws within the dome, or the structure themselves, existed only to obstruct view, and most of the windows were filled with water.

An independent study of this problem was conducted by the state's Department of Building and Safety in the 1950s and 1960s. A series of studies revealed that, unlike steel roofing, the Empire State Building did not collapse when it was built.

In 1959, the department conducted a large study that concluded, if these structural shortcomings had been fixed, the Empire State Building would be demolished. While the buildings in question had been constructed in the early twentieth century with great care, they were not completed in time, and only a few of the Empire State Buildings were constructed before World War I. In the early 1920s, a joint project of two engineers from the Carnegie Foundation and the Carnegie Building Company—the Rockefeller Foundation and the Alfred A. Knopfafort Foundation—also investigated and concluded that the Empire State Building was inadequate at building the buildings that were required to
