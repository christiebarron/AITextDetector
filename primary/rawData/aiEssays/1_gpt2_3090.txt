Computers have many effects on people. For example, most people, if they have a low-level cognitive function, tend to be less empathic.

In a 2013 study of 60,000 people, researchers at Georgia Institute of Technology found that people tended to be significantly more empathic than those who did not have any major cognition impairments. They hypothesized that the reduced empathy of Basketball fans who are more empathic would lead people to turn off the Internet and leave fewer online sites. A follow-up study of more than 8,000 University of Virginia basketball players found that those who were empathic were more likely to engage in online activity (29.2 percent) and to quit school (15.4 percent), compared with those who were disengaged (4 percent).

However, one caveat to the study is that the researchers were unsure about whether basketball fans were the same types of people who are empathic, and when that might be true, what effect the change in empathy would have on their behavior.

"We're going to have to investigate it further to see," David Cahn, a professor and director of the Center for Cognitive Sciences at Georgia, told The Verge. Cahn thinks if basketball fans had less empathy and fewer sites to use, how could people learn new things from these findings?

It probably doesn't seem like this issue that needs serious attention.
