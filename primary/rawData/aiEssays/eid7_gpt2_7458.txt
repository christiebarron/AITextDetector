An example of a time someone in my life was patient was on an airplane in Mexico and told me how to make a dish (or a soup) from scratch. I worked on it for about a year before it was moved to my home in a suburban community just south of San Marcos, so there's no need to be too rigorous on the details. She's so good at that, you just tell her to "let it sit around for a few days and it'll get done." As she gets bigger, you make a couple of adjustments before she comes around -- maybe as you roll her over on the way home from church, maybe as she has this little baggie full of pasta that still floats around in her hair.

We talk about that in the comments of a recently published conversation I had with my friends over lunch at my church recently. What made you decide you would do this kind of work there?

I just want to live the life that I could. I've been blessed with great success living in Los Angeles, and some things are easier on the outside, as far as being able to take a couple months off work in college or go into a career that is all about being happy and not making this mistake. When you're young your life is about your life. And that's part of the appeal when you grow up -- being able to live a life you'd never thought about but you're so familiar with yourself in terms of relationships and relationships.
