I recently moved to a new city and I had to find a job. After several weeks of searching, I was starting to get frustrated and impatient with the process. I had applied to a lot of jobs, and I felt like nothing was coming of it.

One day, I decided to take a breather. I went to a nearby park and sat on a bench. As I looked around, I noticed that many birds were perched atop of the trees. It was a beautiful sight; I was so distracted, that I forgot about my struggle for a few moments. 

I suddenly remembered that I was on a mission to find a job. Despite the waiting, I made a conscious decision to stay patient. I decided to trust in the process, and to focus on the good things in my life. 

The next day, I got a job offer. I was very excited about the opportunity and grateful for my patience. If I hadnâ€™t been patient and taken the time to enjoy the beauty around me, I may not have been as successful in my job search.
