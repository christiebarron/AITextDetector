I’ll never forget the first time I met my husband. We were both at an old friend’s party, when he came up to me and started chatting. I remember feeling so nervous, but also somehow drawn to him.

We talked about all sorts of things, and after awhile the conversation started to get funnier and funnier. We both had a tendency to laugh uncontrollably at some of the silliest things.

Before long, the whole room had noticed our little chat and seemed to be gathered around us, watching us and laughing along with us. It felt so good to just be myself, and allowing others in to what felt like our own little world. 

Little did I know, that those laughs were bringing us closer and closer together, until I realized I couldn’t imagine laughing with anyone else like I could with him. 

Fast forward nine years and here we are, still laughing at each other’s jokes and enjoying many more joyous moments together. I’m so glad I have someone to laugh and share my life with, and I will always be thankful for that first moment of laughter that brought us together.
