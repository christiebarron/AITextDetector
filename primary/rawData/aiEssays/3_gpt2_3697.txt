Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. The more they cycle and ride to their destination the more difficult it is to stay focused on their surroundings, and the easier it is to let go of the negative thoughts and expectations at a time when they most need it most.

A "good rule", as the name might suggest, is to encourage people to spend less on their bike, work a bit less and more on other things, with a strong focus on their own personal activity â€” like taking the ride. The cycling community should know this.

A good rule should also require those cyclists who come across problems to be involved in that effort.
