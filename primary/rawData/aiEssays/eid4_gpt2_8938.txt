The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because the story is not a very linear or suspenseful story. One of the things that stands out in the overall plot is the way it continues with the "Caveman". We're not necessarily going to know everything about him until "Caveman Days" or "Snowflake Days", but we will know more about him in the "Caveman Trials".

As mentioned earlier, when the story ends in the "Forest" - a place in the forest where the two boys live - it is in search for the Snowflake. The Snowflakes believe that to be the true "Caveman", and if the boys ever find out what happened, Snowflake lives there forever. But if we don't know more, then the story ends in the cave.

I wish Winter Hibiscus was a story that was about everything Snowflake and his world does and what it might mean to all of us. This is absolutely the story about how Snowflake has created a place. He is literally a child - a real living tree in all its forms - who needs to be placed in its place by his own mind and will. The character of Snowflake does NOT believe that all who make up such a place must make themselves up but it does not end with Snowflake being born again in the "Caveman Trials".

But we can all see how Snowflake doesn't accept the existence of Snowflake
