– A brief overview about the origin of the term, who was it, what it meant and why

– A little more about the history of the idea of "hijori", and for how it has been used

– A look at the story of Japan in the 1680s

– An overview of the meaning and structure of each word

– On the origin of Japanese, and why Japan was the biggest nation in Asia, and in some ways the largest in the world.

– An essay on the English language

– A glimpse into the early history of the word, with several very clear illustrations that illustrate the relationship between grammar and language
