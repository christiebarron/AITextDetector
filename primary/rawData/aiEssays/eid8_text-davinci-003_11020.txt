I looked around the room, shaking my head in amazement. All the people I’d spent so much time with during the sunday school celebration were standing side-by-side, and all of a sudden everything felt completely different. It was as if the room had transformed into something else, something far more powerful and alive.

That’s when I heard it: the sound of laughter. A contagious wave of cheer that swept through the room, and for the first time, I felt so connected. I had never felt anything like it before – it was like a special type of magic, providing companionship in an otherwise strange space.

I couldn’t help but join in, allowing myself to laugh harder and longer than I’d ever laughed before. I felt truly liberated, as our shared joy seeped into my previously inhibited young heart.

I knew that, in that moment, I had been drawn to each of these people – not just through the relationships I had with them, but through this unexpected and beautiful shared laughter. I recalled, with relief and gratitude, that there was never any need for words; the magic of that moment had spoken for itself.
