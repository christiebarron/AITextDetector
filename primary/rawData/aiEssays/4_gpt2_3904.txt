The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because there is one conclusion to be reached after that and only one to be found: that we must come to terms with the reality we live with now. We all know that this only makes it possible for our minds to move and our consciousness to be a more complete entity in itself. In this case, this realization of the reality we live with comes about in ways that we never knew were possible. It's as if the only things you can Moroccan-type and the most powerful ones you can learn and that makes it all the more exciting, for the more you become familiar with it, the more you will become more able to make sense of everything.

Jorge M. Garcia, a scholar and a former writer for the Toronto Star, has produced twenty-six books, most of which have now been published in print. He is widely regarded as one of the country's leading authority philosophers and social scientists and his latest book, The New Spirit, takes a critical outlook on the new spiritual reality we are seeing and the profound significance that it brings to our daily life. His collection of essays on the nature of consciousness, "Garcia", is published at the end of July, while "Doubt and Faith" will be available in summer 2018.
