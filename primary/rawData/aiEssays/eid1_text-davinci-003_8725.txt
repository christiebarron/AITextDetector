One summer, my best friend James and I decided to go on a road trip to the beach. We had planned it for weeks, knowing we would have a blast. 

On the way, we kept cracking jokes and making each other laugh. Every time one of us laughed, it felt like a little victory and the car felt even more full of joy. We eventually arrived at the beach and set up our towel and umbrellas, ready to have a beach day. 

We spent the entire day splashing around in the ocean, grabbing ice cream, and playing different beach games. As the sun started to set, we decided to roast marshmallows around a campfire James had set up. 

As soon as the marshmallows went in, they started to expand and blacken almost too quickly. I immediately pulled my stick out, frantically trying to salvage my sweet snack. To my surprise, the marshmallow had become a huge, gooey blob that was dripping off my stick. 

Suddenly, James burst out laughing at the sight, and soon I joined in with him. We both had tears in our eyes from all the laughter, and the shared moment felt so special. Even though my marshmallow had become unrecognizable, it was still one of the most memorable parts of our beach trip. 

That unforgettable day at the beach taught me that laughter really is the shortest distance between two people. For James and me
