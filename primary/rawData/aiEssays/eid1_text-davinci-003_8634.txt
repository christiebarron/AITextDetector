I must have looked pretty ridiculous out there in the middle of a snow storm with nothing but a parka and swim trunks. But I can't deny, nor can I forget, how much fun I had that day.

It all started when my best friend suggested we take a snow day. She said that there was nothing like a cold day outdoors in the middle of winter to lift our spirits.

Not one to turn down a good idea, I accepted her invitation. So, there I was, standing in a snow storm, wearing nothing but my yellow and blue striped trunks. 

My friend could barely contain herself when she saw me and burst out into laughter. I couldn't keep a straight face either and we ended up doubled over with laughter. 

Lighting the spark of joy with our own joy, suddenly the landscape wasn't so grey anymore. We were both so amused that we couldn't help but keep laughing. 

It was like a moment outside of time. We didn't have to worry or think about anything else. We just let ourselves feel the joy that comes with laughter truly and honestly. 

That was almost a decade ago now, but I can still remember that moment and how it made me feel. It was a reminder that no matter what, laughter is always the best medicine.
