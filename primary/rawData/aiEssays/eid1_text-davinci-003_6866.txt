Censorship in libraries has become an increasingly prominent issue in recent years. With more information than ever before available to library patrons, the question of which material should and should not be censored has become increasingly relevant. 

While some censorship is clearly necessary to keep offensive material away from children, censorship of any library material can have a damaging effect on the public. Restricting access to certain materials limits the ability of the library to provide information, education, and entertainment for all library patrons. Allowing the library to be a safe haven for all manners of creative expression leads to increased engagement in the community and helps foster a more tolerant atmosphere. 

Furthermore, censorship in libraries has been historically abused to repress certain political views or religions, and it is vital to maintain an environment that values intellectual freedom and open discourse. Shelving materials that some might deem offensive is not an endorsement of such material, and these materials can remain available to some patrons while offering warning labels or age restrictions.

The idea of censorship implies a collectivized morality that censors certain materials based on somebody's opinion. Libraries must ensure that the freedom of their patrons is respected, and for this reason, books, magazines, movies, and music should not be removed from library shelves simply because some find them offensive. Libraries should preserve the ideas of intellectual freedom and open discourse, and censorship should be used only when absolutely necessary.
