The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first of these was a lack of space for vehicles, which took time to fill. The second was the fact that most vehicles could not dock at this stage, which often resulted in traffic jams and a lack of parking for cargo and loading of cargo. The third obstacle came because of the size of the building. By now you'd probably expected to see lots of people in cars moving around the building, but they were usually the last thing in the sight. And again this was before trucks and jeeps came along and started driving by, which resulted in lots of accidents.

Now, we don't know how many people were killed or injured in the accident, but it's likely more than half a million people were killed on that day and many others as a result of this crash. The next step in getting to this point was to build what's called a "carriageway." This was a line of cars going over a certain distance. A car should always be able to stay right where it is. I think one of the biggest problems with this was that there were too few cars on the line; they were usually driven along very narrow sections of a building. This created quite a mess.

The main obstacles to building carriageways were, first, a lack of the use of cars; second, many people would have trouble going over the line in their cars, as
