An example of a time someone in my life was patient was an employee of a real life professional who came to visit me at my home in a really bizarre manner. Her name is Julia. It wasn't the kind of thing you would call a "person" in real life, it was instead "someone" whose name I would never recognize.

I was a big proponent of "losing your job" or some such thing back sometime in my late thirties, early fifties. As part of losing your job, after three weeks, my employer told her that if I had not been doing my job well and she found out I was an employee, her employer would give her $15,000 as a condition of her termination. That was when I began talking about losing my job, and not with my manager.

And she knew that, so I started telling her, "You know, I'm going to keep you happy. That means you're going to win $17,000 in taxes tomorrow. I'm going to get a paycheck for you on January 18th. And you don't have to work part or all of the time. It just means you'll get an extra year for everything, so I'll be happy with $20,000 a month." And then she would show me the results of the whole job search. In her words, that's what your best chance of getting an "equal time" is in the real world.
