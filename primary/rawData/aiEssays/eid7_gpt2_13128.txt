An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my niece. We were very sad and shocked when she got to the hospital that morning. She was just screaming and crying.

"All of a sudden I was walking, holding her leg up in the air with my left hand, and I heard something close to her saying, 'What are you doing here?'

"My niece looked up and saw my finger was up on her forearm and it was like somebody could hit them.

"And that's when I saw my sister with an arm on her other arm.

"My niece was a very brave family member, not just one person. It was very sad and scary and made her feel very safe."
