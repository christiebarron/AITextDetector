I was stuck in a long line at the grocery store and as it inched forward, I started to become more and more frustrated. I looked around and saw that no one else seemed bothered by the wait. I told myself to be patient and breathed deeply.

I eventually got to the cashier, who was on the phone placing an order. I patiently waited while she finished the call, not wanting to be rude by interrupting her. She apologized for the wait when she hung up and I simply smiled and said it was okay, that I could wait.

The cashier was incredibly efficient as she checked out my items, but the person in front of me had a few problems with her payment. Rather than lose my patience or make a scene I stayed still and kept a positive attitude, waiting until my turn came.

In the end, I was able to pay and leave the store without further incident. Being patient allowed me to keep a good attitude and get out of the store without adding to the chaos.
