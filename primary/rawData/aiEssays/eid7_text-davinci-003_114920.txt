I once had an elderly woman as a customer at the grocery store I worked at. She was very slow moving and it took a good amount of time for her to get all her items to the register. But instead of rushing her or becoming impatient, I took my time and made sure she had assistance getting every item out. I asked her questions about her day and told her jokes. Even though it took an extra 15 minutes, I let her finish her shopping the way she wanted to without any stress. She thanked me for my help and kindness as she walked out with a smile. Sometimes being patient pays off and can make someone elseâ€™s day significantly better.
