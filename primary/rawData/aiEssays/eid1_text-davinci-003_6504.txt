To whom it may concern,

I am writing to share my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Whenever we bring up the topic of computers, the discussion often centers around the amount of screen time we have or how computers have become so small that they fit in our pocket. As a society, however, it is important to think critically about computers and their impact on our lives.

The effects of computers on people can be both positive and negative. The most obvious benefit of having a computer is that it provides an efficient tool to connect us to information faster than we ever could without one. Computers have allowed people to access knowledge and resources quickly and with relative ease. Additionally, computers can save time and money for people who use them to assist with their everyday life.

At the same time, however, there can be a downside to having too much technology. This is because computers can reduce in-person, face-to-face communication and interaction, leading to more isolation and loneliness. Furthermore, too much reliance on computers can lead to a lack of critical thinking skills, as users may rely too heavily on computers to answer questions instead of thinking independently.

It is important to consider both the positives and negatives when looking at how computers affect people. We should recognize that computers are a useful and convenient tool for gaining knowledge and information, but we should also be mindful of how computer usage can influence our relationships and our ability to think independently.
