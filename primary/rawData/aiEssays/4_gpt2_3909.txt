The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because as the author puts it, "One of the reasons this place was named after a man is because he lost his life, he was stabbed at. As my grandfather died, another name came upâ€¦the name of the man who died. When I heard this, I got scared."

The last chapter of My Cousin from the book was a story about this man's life and what might have happened if he'd been able to see the person and knew who did it to him. This was the final chapter of My Cousin about the people that died in war. The title of the book was a simple description of death: "He was killed with a sword, by his mother." For such was the legend, the number of deaths and theacio, the name of the woman who was killed, was given. This book was created over eight years before World War II, when more than 3 million Americans died in the war, making this the first books of its type.
