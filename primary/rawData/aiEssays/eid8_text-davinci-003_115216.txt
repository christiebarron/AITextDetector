I remember the day I met my best friend like it was yesterday. We were placed together in our fourth-grade classroom, and I was nervous about working with a complete stranger. She was quiet and seemed uncomfortable as I spoke, but eventually I noticed her mouth begin to turn up in a small smile. Soon after, we were both in fits of laughter and I knew we were going to become the best of friends.

We still laugh together to this day; whether it's recalling a funny moment from our childhood or giggling through a silly joke that one of us told. We've shared many special moments together, filled with joy and lots of laughter. To me, itâ€™s a reminder that laughter is the shortest distance between two people.
