Building the Empire State Building was a monumental undertaking for the builders at the beginning of the 20th century, but the biggest challenge they faced was the possibility of accommodating dirigibles on the top of the structure. This was no small task, as the idea of a skyscraper docking station for airships was unprecedented worldwide.

The primary obstacles that the builders encountered when trying to construct a docking station for dirigibles came from the weight and size of the airships, as well as their fragile nature. First, the sheer mass of the airships meant that any docking station had to be able to support the weight as well as weather any strong gusts of wind that an airship produces with its presence, especially when aiming to dock. Not to mention, the structure would have to be designed in a manner that could hold the delicate airships without puncturing any of the fragile fabric. 

The shape of the airships themselves also posed another challenge for the builders. It was essential that any docking station for dirigibles be curved in order to form a dock capable of looping around the base of an airship to allow the vessel to moor. Additionally, due to the circumference of the airships and the design of the docking mast, the airships had to be positioned roughly ten feet away in order to dock, a feat which, when attempting to land large airships on a tiny mast, proved difficult.

Furthermore, the altitude of the Empire State
