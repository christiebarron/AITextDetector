The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because the "biggest and most important fact is thisâ€”myself, I'm living my life in my own body... no matter how big and full I am, and not knowing what I am or what I'm doing, I still feel good and strong. I just don't know yet how big and how little I am doing."

I have a point.

That's my own body, anyway.

Which is also why they're wrong here. In fact, they say they're wrong here, and it's true, even in the most conservative of religious minds. When I read the new edition of that book, "God Has No Place in the American Workplace," I think they've totally forgotten to say it. As soon as all the arguments from evangelicals disappear, when all the problems become self-justifying, when all the religious right says they can't even talk about the issues they hate, I'm going to cry, and then they'll just be making up their own moral objections on what to do.

"The idea that someone is more God-centered than any religious or spiritual leader is an absurdity. If any man is more God-centered than a Buddhist monk, it's because the monk doesn't go to great lengths to show off his skills... just because he does not believe that he can create good things for himself, he is not God."
