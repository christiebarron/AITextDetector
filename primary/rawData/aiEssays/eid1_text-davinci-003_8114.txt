The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. The most significant challenge was the lack of an existing system for air travel. At the time, there were no standards when it came to airplanes, and streets and other landmarks were not safe for navigation. Additionally, the Empire State Building was not designed with air travel in mind; it was primarily built as an office building. 

The architects had to come up with an entirely new system for regulating air traffic, as well as constructing a landing pad capable of withstanding the stress of a full-sized airship. Furthermore, they had to find a way to secure the mast of the ship to the building. The proposed solution was to construct a mooring mast which would protrude from the building’s crown. 

This mast had to be strong enough to withstand the force generated from a dirigible docking, and the Empire State Building’s engineers formulated a plan to install a sturdy steel pillar, dropping over three feet below the roof. The mast was required to be a certain diameter and height to accommodate the airships, and to support the strength of the engines. In order to accomplish this, the engineers designed a specific type of concrete and a steel cable system. 

The engineers also had to consider the unanticipated dangers of air travel; should a dirigible crash, the building itself could suffer great damage. To combat this
