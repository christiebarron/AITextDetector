Dear Editor, 

Recently, there has been an ongoing debate about computers and their effects on people. As someone who has personally witnessed the positive impact computers have had on both my education and work life, I am passionate in my belief that computers can be a great asset to the lives of individuals. 

The most obvious benefits of computer technology are that it greatly increases the speed of completing work, allowing us to save time, energy and money. It has also advanced important industries such as medicine, science and communication. With the addition of computers and the internet, we are able to access vast amounts of information and knowledge, allowing us to stay connected with others, and to keep up to date with the latest developments or research in any field. 

However, people should also be aware of the potential risks that computers impose. Computers can be open to viruses and privacy threats, and they can also easily become sources of distraction. We must, therefore, use them responsibly, and take the necessary precautions to protect our sensitive data. 

In conclusion, computer technology can be a great tool in our lives if used wisely. I strongly recommend that people get the most out of this technology while being aware of its potential risks. 

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
