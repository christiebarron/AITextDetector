I used to find it so hard to connect to people around me. I was shy and found it difficult to make friends. But then I was introduced to my best friend Ben through a mutual acquaintance. It was an instant bond that was sealed with laughter.

From the moment we met, we were like two peas in a pod. We could talk about anything and everything, but most of all I loved that he could make me laugh. No matter the situation Ben could crack a joke or pull a funny face and make me light up.

There was one night in particular when I was feeling particularly down and in need of some cheering up. We were walking home together after a movie and Ben started to make a joke about the film we had seen. Before long we were both rolling with laughter. Strangers walking past were surely wondering what exactly was so funny, but for us, it was the perfect medicine.

From that moment on our bond has only grown. Laughter brings us closer together, allowing us to share a connection that nobody else in the world could. So if you ever find yourself wanting to make more meaningful connections with people, donâ€™t forget the power of a good laugh!
