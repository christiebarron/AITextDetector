An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a friend and a coworker who was using a computer to record a live video call. There was an interesting post in which he said that in the middle of a video he could hear the phone ringing out and just the voice is like "Yo we are so close." I never remember this post being in this thread.

Finally the user said "hey we are close we are going to meet in a year". This seemed like a good call.

On Sunday August 24th the thread popped up on the site

A quick Google search turned up about a year and a half ago and then the post got deleted but I can recall no activity. The user I had the conversation with reported at least 11 threads after this one. The post was deleted at this link, the forum thread was still there, and I am not sure for what reason, I am not sure how you could have been removed, but i guess it goes without saying that once you have the post you don't get banned from the site and nothing changes.


I was very sad to learn of the fact that a user had deleted the post, but I am not ready to go to jail or anything, though there were a LOT of messages, posts, comments, etc to let me know:

On my phone the user posted an update and said he did not plan on sharing any videos.

A short google search led to this
