I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a good one and we feel that every library should be able to make all requests or do all sort of things to ensure that only those libraries who are in fact required to accept books are permitted to do the work themselves. We also feel that libraries have a responsibility to ensure that their own customers, both staff members and readers, are not disadvantaged when they read them."

This was part of a letter signed by the group's main sponsors: British Library Foundation, Bookfair, which is in direct response to the decision, and the National Book Society, which was part of the petition issued by Cllr Staley and who later helped sign the letter.

The letter from Bookfair shows that in all contexts of library activity (the main way people come to read books, the ones that contain books), libraries have an important role in creating a 'transforming service' for the community, as described by the petition's signatories.
