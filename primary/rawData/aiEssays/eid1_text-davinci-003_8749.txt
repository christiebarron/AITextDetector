I was out for dinner with my best friend and we were both having a great time. We laughed and joked as the night went on, having fun and enjoying each other's company. 

At one point in the evening, I accidentally dropped my dinner knife on the floor and as I was fumbling around for it, my friend started cracking up. I laughed too, despite feeling a bit embarrassed. We both doubled over with laughter and when the waiter came to check if we were all right, my friend quipped, "We need an extra knife - he keeps dropping them!" 

Our laughter continued and we managed to make it through the rest of the meal, though it was a bit tricky with only one knife each. Even today when I look back at that evening, it makes me laugh whenever I think about it. 

It's moments like these that are so special and make me appreciate the people I have in my life. Laughter is such a powerful force that can bring two people closer; it's one of life's little pleasures that should be enjoyed and embraced.
