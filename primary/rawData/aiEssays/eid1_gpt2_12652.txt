Computers have many effects on people. They create a number of different conditions that they create for various species of animals, human and other. We know a lot about the genetic mechanisms of these genetic diseases and we can be certain of the effects with our current understanding.

But here's the really interesting thing: We don't know what this virus can do without infecting humans with it, and it's a pretty good guess.

"There is currently no evidence to support a link between herpes simplex virus (HSV) and cancer, and this research has generated much speculation about the plausibility of the theory," says Raghunath Chandrasekhar, Ph.D., research scientist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

"I see this research as a potential candidate for the development of a more natural way to fight against viral infections of animals and humans," he says. "In a waydump that virus into our bodies, and we can take control of infection and infection."

That might even be a bit of trouble. That virus has been known to cause cancer for thousands of years. But, because it's so easy to get your hands on and live through an infection, there are also the many other potentially harmful things you can do. The only way to prevent it from spreading into humans is to kill it.

Chandrasekhar and his colleagues at the University of California, San Francisco, had their fingers inserted into
