Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. The route consists of a roundabout with a few gravel patches (about the size of a large football field), with traffic in the vicinity. The only places where cyclists would get to spend most of the day are the streets, and it is interesting to note that there was no significant cycling between the two of them.

There are lots of options for getting around the roundabout. The traffic around the roundabout has reduced since the early 90s. These new traffic signals give cyclists an unobstructed view of the street, and thus make it easier to get into the street and get around. The roundabout features lots of small homes and apartments and is quite well lit as well.

Street width also seems to be an issue. A car travelling at a speed of 25mph is not unusual. People are often seen on the pavement running and moving, although there appears to be little movement here. An issue for cyclists is that the roundabout's small homes are less than ideal for their daily needs

The city has a number of roads that use different routes on a regular basis. The easiest route to get around the roundabout is to choose the local roads.
