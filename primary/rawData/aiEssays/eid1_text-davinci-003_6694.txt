Dear [Editor],

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects that computers have on people.

In many ways, computers have revolutionized the way that people live their lives, making a tremendous amount of information available at the click of a button. Businesses are more efficient, communication is more immediate, and educational opportunities have become increasingly accessible in the wake of technological advancements.

That said, computers can also rob people of their independence. They can take away the joy of discovery and the feeling of accomplishment from completing tasks without relying on an outside source. It is important that we find a balance between using technology as a supplement and allowing it to become a replacement for our personal growth.

Furthermore, data breaches, cybercrimes, and the risk of being targeted by malicious agents all need to be taken into consideration. We must be aware that anything that we can do online can potentially be accessed by strangers with bad intentions. Learning how to protect our data from harm is essential.

In general, I think that computers have the power to enrich our lives in indisputable ways, but we must be mindful of the precautions we must take before venturing into this unknown realm. 

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
