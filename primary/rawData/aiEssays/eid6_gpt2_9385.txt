The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. To accommodate a larger space, they used elevators up to 11 stories tall and provided the vertical support that made dirigibles a more practical alternative to conventional cargo aircraft. Building the new Empire State Building had three elevators on each side of the building. The three elevators were connected by a series of 3-foot-wide cables running through the third floor and a series of two-foot-wide cables running through the fourth floor. In the lower case, the cable went over and out of the way and over the next four floors. On the ground floor, the cables continued through the second and fourth floors and through all of the elevators on the three floors. This approach did not produce a full-service building. Even on the rooftop where the elevators were designed, when the building was completed, only three of the seven towers were capable of using four-to-fifteenth level dirigiblesâ€”meaning no roof or skylight. To compensate, the city allowed the two elevators on the second and fourth floors to be installed in each tower.
