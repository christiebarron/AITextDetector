The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

One obstacle involved moving the aircraft by a ramp from the aircraft carriers to their hangar, or moving the aircraft out to the ground at once with a drag strip. It would be an impractical move and would have a strong potential to undermine safety. Another issue was whether the drag lines would allow the aircraft to move vertically from the hangar to the hangar to prevent it from falling out of the plane or crashing before the aircraft could actually land. shift the aircraft's weight through a hangar to maximize the risk of any crashes. If one side of the aircraft could hit the drag strips in which the hangar is attached, the aircraft would not get out of the hangar. A number of factors may have increased the safety or stability of the aircraft.

There are several factors that could have contributed to the design of the Empire State Building. One of them is the use of a hangar that would not have been used today. The building used to be located beneath the river in New York, but the development of a large, more direct tunnel was completed to help allow further vertical movement and to provide an uninterrupted access point to the river's central channel. Another factor that had influence on the building's design is that it was designed to be able for passenger and crew to operate during flight.

The first tower on the Empire State Building was designed with an upright, closed end to assist in the maintenance of the aircraft and
