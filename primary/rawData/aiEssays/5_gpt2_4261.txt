The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' has been one of growing frustration with a national culture that feels alien to its roots. But even in some parts of the world where people have moved away, there is still a sense of place.

Some have called for it to be made an international film. The film, for example, will be screened in many parts of Europe and America this year, and will be screened across the continent.

Amber Boesch, co-owner of the London cinema chain Walshe said: 'It was exciting to find something that is really not necessarily that relevant now - a movie about a British couple coming back to America having to flee abroad when some of their former friends were in hospital there.'
