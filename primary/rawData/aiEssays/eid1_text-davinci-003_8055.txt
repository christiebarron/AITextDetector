The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles a place to dock. Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s “The Mooring Mast” outlines some of those challenges and highlights the incredible engineering feats that were accomplished to make the dream of a safe place for airships to land a reality.

The first obstacle that presented itself to the builders of the Empire State Building was the height and weight of the mast. It had to be tall enough to accommodate large dirigibles, yet be light enough to be carried by the weight of the building. Despite its towering height, the mooring mast had to be structurally sound enough to withstand the buffeting and shaking from the turbulent winds as the airship maneuvered to dock. This meant that its design and construction had to be carefully engineered to maintain its integrity.

The second obstacle was the technical challenge of constructing a secure link between the airship and the building itself. Although a steel cable came to be the ideal solution, it proved to be a slow, tedious process to run the cable through the entire length of the building. As Lüsted explains, “[t]he cable was then attached to an acorn-shaped movable grip on the building’s roof, allowing it to connect securely to the airships.” Ultimately, it took engineers months to properly rig the mooring mast and the cable that linked it to the
