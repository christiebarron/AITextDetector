The poet is using this line to signify hope and renewal. The image of the snowy geese returning in the spring being paralleled with the resurrection of the hibiscus is powerful. It serves to reinforce hope and the idea that with the eventual spring and the passing of the hard times we are all experiencing, things will begin to improve and a new chance to ‘take the test again’ will be available. This line is speaking to the resilience of nature and the poet’s optimism for the future.
