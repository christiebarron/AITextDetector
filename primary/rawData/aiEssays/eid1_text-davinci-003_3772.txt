To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing today to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people and to persuade the readers to agree with me. 

As we have seen in these past few years, computers have had a tremendous impact on the lives of friends, family members, and college-level students around the world. Not only have computers allowed individuals to achieve extraordinary efficiency and productivity, but they have also opened up new opportunities for communication, creativity, and entertainment.

One of the biggest effects computers have had on peopleâ€™s lives is the increased amount of information available. With access to computers, Internet, and information databases, people are now able to get the answers they need in mere minutes and hours, rather than hours or even days like before. In addition, computers have made it much easier to work on projects and documents collaboratively, leading to higher levels of collaboration among people with different backgrounds and skills. 

Another important effect of computers is the time they provide for people to take part in various activities. For example, thousands of people are able to work from home and balance their personal and professional lives thanks to the ability to work online. This has also allowed people to explore new hobbies and interests, as well as spend more quality time with friends and families. 

Overall, the positive effects of computers have clearly overshadowed the negative aspects. I believe that these advancements in technology have made life much easier and richer for people
