One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I saw the young woman sitting on the stage in a wheelchair and screaming my name. It was a moment which I cannot remember. Perhaps the happiest moment of my life. The moment in which I realised it was funny when I saw the girl and suddenly this horrible feeling of being on the stage changed my life. The laughter was very warm. Afterwards I asked if I could see where she was from and she replied with 'No I am a baby.' I asked what happened and she replied in the words that she looked a little sad and angry. We all thought that this woman was crazy at the time.

I don't know what happened after that but I would love to see it. I would love to see our beloved child. I can't see how we are separated from her because her mother was very happy with me and told me I was a good person.

It's such a pity that some of you still think we are still separated from her. We can do something to support her. I wanted to call the Police and help the baby boy to be okay.

But you need to stay strong and carry on being a good woman with a positive attitude. Remember that you really can't make a big deal of how you are in this world. The person who hurt you most needs to take some time and look at them. Think for a minute about your parents or mother or father. Do what you can.
