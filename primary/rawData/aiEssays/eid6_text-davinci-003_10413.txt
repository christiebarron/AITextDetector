The idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was a revolutionary one that came with a number of obstacles. Built in the 1930s, the Empire State Building was the tallest in the world and a natural site to attract dirigibles. On top of the 200 foot tower, the builders constructed a mooring mast, which would allow the dirigibles to dock safely and easily. However, there were a number of obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome to realize this dream.

The first obstacle facing the builders pertained to the sheer height of the building. Most dirigibles were too large to land at such a height, so the builders had to create special equipment that would anchor the dirigibles safely. The steel scaffolding they created to support the dirigible weighed over 600 tons and had to be attached to the roof of the Empire State Building for the dirigibles to moor safely. The process of attaching the steel scaffolding to the building was a complex and lengthy one, as it took several months to complete.

In addition, the engineers had to carefully evaluate the wind currents around the building to ensure that the dirigibles would remain in a stable position while moored. If the wind reached a certain intensity, the dirigible would sway and, as a result, it could damage the building. The engineers had to create a system that would counteract major gusts to keep the dirigibles and the
