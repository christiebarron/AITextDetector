Computers have many effects on people. There are various things you have to take into consideration in deciding whether you can develop the technology to create your product. Some things have to do with social context, and that often means having a positive conversation with the person directly who provided the knowledge for the idea. This could mean saying "Oh thanks so much". And others also need to find a place where it makes sense to make the changes in order to ensure the value and impact is shared. So consider one of the three main considerations, which include these as follows: 1) is it feasible (as many people have indicated) to apply this to your product? 2) will it create a competitive advantage at the low end and will the higher end help to lower costs and enable people to move about the world freely? And 3) when your product will be commercially viable as a result, it need not apply this as much?

The two questions above are frequently thought of as two different kinds of information: information that is relevant because it is useful, and information that has just been created to gain market share. However, with computers there are many factors in place that can determine which information is relevant. The first of which is whether the product is open source, or something proprietary (e.g. a web-based project); and the other two are what you think of as the best ways to provide the high-value insights required in developing your software.
