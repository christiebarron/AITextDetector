The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist in "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski. By focusing closely on the environment that the cyclist finds himself in, Kurmaski is able to demonstrate the effect of rough terrain and inclement weather on the cyclist. 

For example, when the cyclist takes the "slow and steady" approach, the roughness of the road is brought into full relief. Rain-slick dust covers the rocks, mud mixing in, making every turn and climb more difficult. The cyclist is left feeling beaten down and defeated, which amplifies the emotional tension of the story. This setting also brings out the stubbornness and determination of the cyclist, as he continues pushing through the mud rutted mountain paths.

The setting also affects the cyclist in a physical way. The cyclist is weighed down by a heavy backpack and, more importantly, wears special winter-weather gear that helps him survive the cold temperatures and hailstorms that he encounters over the course of his journey. Every step and breath he takes are felt keenly in the grueling conditions of the mountains, and the heavy layers of his winter garb only add to his physical exhaustion.

Finally, the setting brings out the cyclist's inner courage and strength. Though he petitions his guides for a better way through, in the end it is his own will and resilience that make his journey possible. No matter how difficult the path gets, the cyclist keeps going
