One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was watching a movie. It was funny too: there is laughter in a movie, every bit as entertaining as when there is nudity in the show.

I don't think many comedians have that experience — I've always felt like we've gone beyond what would make the whole thing entertaining. Most people were laughing too much at me, but I felt like someone had given way to my own personal feelings about the show, so I could make the show a good, authentic, funny one.

So what do you hope to achieve over the coming years?

I'm sure if I would be doing this now on top of my first production, I would become really successful. With some kind of commercial or marketing effort come a stage where every character can stand and have fun and then, at least on the final page, we are doing something as interesting as a movie. There was a time when people might joke about these characters getting caught in a scene, but I can say that no one should have trouble making them laugh at our work today.

What's the idea behind what you've been working on for years now?

I can't say exactly what the project is because it is always very interesting to imagine what people will think after seeing it. And then how it evolves. We are always so eager to try new things, but I don´t think there has ever been a project
