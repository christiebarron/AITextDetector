I'll never forget the moment when I truly became connected to my partner. We had been together for a while but things seemed to be strained due to the long hours we were both working. We decided to spend a romantic Saturday evening at a fancy restaurant. Even though we were in a nice atmosphere, the conversation seemed strained and awkward. 

Suddenly, the waiter came by to take our orders. When he asked my partner what he would like, my partner made the most ridiculous joke about wanting "chocolate-covered onions". I'm pretty sure the waiter didn't expect that since he just kind of froze. We both started giggling and couldn't stop. 

The laughter broke the tension and was so freeing. We suddenly got silly and began to remember why we were together in the first place. By the time our entrees arrived, we had talked and laughed so much that I felt rejuvenated and truly connected to him. To this day, whenever I feel myself drifting away, I joke about chocolate-covered onions, and it instantly brings us back together.
