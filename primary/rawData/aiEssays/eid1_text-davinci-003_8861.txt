I remember that day like it was yesterday. I was sitting in my living room with my best friend, clinging onto every word he said as he told me the best jokes he knew. We were both laughing uncontrollably at this point, tears streaming down our faces. We just could not stop. We laughed so hard and for so long that it was impossible to tell who was laughing louder at any given time.

I felt so connected to my friend in that moment, like nothing else in the world mattered. It was just the two of us, laughing away our worries and troubles. Our shared laughter created a bond between us that could never be broken, and I’ll never forget how comfortable we both felt in that moment.

It had been a long time since I'd felt so happy and carefree. It was my friend’s kindheartedness and willingness to make me laugh that made the moment so special. It was a reminder of how important laughter is in any relationship, and I'm thankful for that reminder every day.
