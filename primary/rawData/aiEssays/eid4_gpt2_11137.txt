The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it deals with "a new phenomenon in Europe: an 'anti-Americanism,' that has reached its peak in our national language and even in our cultural life." This "antithetical" "anti-Americanism" is, writes Hibiscus, the "most significant and potentially destructive political movement of our time."

Hibiscus's argument was that the "antithetical" campaign of anti-Semitism and other "anti-Semitism" was already well established in Germany. "And they thought that Hitler would have no interest in a Jewish people: he is the greatest of all Jews, that Hitler never liked, that Hitler was not even interested in his country's greatness. So they thought, Hitler's country was the great problem, so to speak."

However, if those people in Germany were actually "historical enemies" of Jews, that is a far more sinister possibility. To understand what Hibiscus was talking about, it is helpful to go on a tour of the "anti-Jewish" movements of the 1930s. During the 1920s, Nazi party members called on German intellectuals and other "independent writers," political strategists and intellectuals to "fight for the political rights of Jewish writers, which included the Right of the German People to Study German Literature and also the Right of the German Press, and to defend the Jewish-owned and controlled public media through the Freedom of Expression Amendment."
