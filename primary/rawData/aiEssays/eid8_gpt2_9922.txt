One time I experienced laughter in my life was when someone asked me, "What are you thinking about, you idiot?" I didn't know about laughter in my life. I was in a different place so that was nice." A few years later, I started blogging for myself because I had more confidence. The people who work on my blog said it took the pressure off me.

I wanted to be better and get a job that I knew I could make $1,000 and a life worth living. I also thought I was too young for my age and I was not at that level. I don't regret my decision, because I'm still in high school.

But when I read the comments about my interview process — it seems more like a recruitment process where they said they could put a couple of people in and then invite them to interview or give you money so you could have a better life for your money — I could not help but wonder how I could have saved myself over the phone.
