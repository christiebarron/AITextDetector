The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The lack of a "backup" engine to the pilot had had a serious impact on the project. In order to avoid a costly and complex re-hearing, only a pilot would have needed to test the supersonic technology, and the time and money involved were far less. "We were stuck with a short turnaround time of nearly two years," says Bob Richey, director of engineering at the Federal Aviation Administration. "It was not something that we could turn down."

For the next seven years, the FAA and Air Force did work to develop the supersonic pilot and supersonic navigational skills required for a manned space mission. Finally, in 1969, one of the first test vehicles with retractable doors was launched and it was hailed as "the most amazing accomplishment in the history of flight at the time."

A second test mission with a retractable door on a private company, Cessna Cessna 175, was flown by the carrier at the end of 1969. With the first of two models and the third in service at the end of the decade — the Cessna Cessna A4C-2 and the Cessna Cessna C6 — the Cessna Cessna C5 was developed and flown by the carrier at the end of the decade. Both of these airships were launched from Farragut Air
