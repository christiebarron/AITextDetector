Judged against this lack of authority and its possible lack of justification, the FAA made two changes that were more important: renaming the buildings on the same parcel, and requiring that one-third of buildings be dedicated to dirigible construction.

3. Failing to Protect the Environment. The EPA is supposed to be neutral in environmental matters, and most recently, the FAA made a decision that should have made it clear to the companies that they would never use their "public acknowledgment" policy. If they would use it, it would make it easier for the business and government of the State to know what they are doing, and more affordable for them to pay up in taxes to the Federal Government.
