Minfong Ho ends Winter Hibiscus with this line as a way to emphasize the idea of resilience and overcoming adversity. The speaker in the poem uses the idea of the hibiscus, a flower which often blooms during the winter months, as an example of strength and of hope. The speaker implies that, much like the symbol of the flower, if they work hard and remain tenacious, they will be able to eventually get past the hard times and emerge from them even stronger than before. This closing line shows how even in the face of difficult problems and obstacles, one can still have faith in the future and dreams of success and happiness.
