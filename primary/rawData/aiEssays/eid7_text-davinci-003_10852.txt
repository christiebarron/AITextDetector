I remember a time when I had to prove my patience to someone else. It was last summer when I was helping my sister move from her old apartment to a new one. I had offered to lend a hand, thinking it would be fairly simple, but it proved to be incredibly laborious.

On the day of the move, we had to get up very early and had a long list of items to bring along. We begged, borrowed and rented a moving truck and finally set out to make our way towards the new place. We had no idea it was going to be such a long and tiring journey. 

Despite my sister and I being tired, it was our job to get the move done. We drove around for hours in a never-ending search for cardboard boxes, furniture movers and other supplies we needed. I was becoming increasingly frustrated but my sister had faith that there was a purpose to the struggle.

My patience was tested to a great extent but somehow I managed. After what felt like forever, everything was successfully transported to the new apartment. Later, my sister thanked me for being so patient and understanding the entire time. It made me feel good to know that I had put my patience to the test and emerged the victor.
