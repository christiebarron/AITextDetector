The ending of " Winter Hibiscus" by Minfong Ho emphasizes the resilience and determination of the protagonist Anju as she prepares to take the test again. The last sentence is used to illustrate Anjuâ€™s hopefulness for the future, despite the fact that she may have failed the test. It is a reminder that, despite the setbacks, she is determined to keep trying. Additionally, the metaphor of the returning geese and the budding hibiscus implies that there is a natural cycle to life, and that spring will eventually come. Therefore, the ending of the poem serves to paint a picture of hope and renewal, emphasizing Anju's optimism and undying willpower.
