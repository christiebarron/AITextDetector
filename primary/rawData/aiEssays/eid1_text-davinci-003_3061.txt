Dear Editor,

I am sure that many readers are already aware of the fact that computers are becoming increasingly mainstays of our lives. Given their widespread use in practically every aspect of our lives, from playing games and entertainment to shopping to finding jobs, it is essential that we consider the effects that computers have on our lives.

My opinion is that computers have a positive effect on people in many ways. From a purely practical standpoint, computers have enhanced our day to day lives in countless ways. They save us time, they provide access to information not previously possible, and they help us to keep in touch with friends and family far away. Computers have opened a whole new world for learning and exploration. 

On an emotional level, computer games give us an outlet for stress and joy. They can also provide us with a much-needed escape from difficult situations. Even adults can benefit from playing games - it is a way for them to relax while still getting something out of it, like strategy or problem-solving skills.

Given the benefits of computers and their roles in our growth, development, and communication, it is my belief that computers have a hugely positive impact on us. I urge your readers
