I once responded to a club membership ad that was looking for new people to join. I went in expecting a lot out of the experience, but when I arrived I realized the club's membership was far smaller than expected. 

The other members seemed reluctant to accept me, and I was the newest member by far. Nevertheless, I decided to take the initiative and introduce myself to each of them. Though the process took a bit more time than I had first expected, I remained patient and persisted in taking the opportunity to get to know everyone. 

Finally, after a few weeks of showing everyone that I was invested in the club, they began to accept me and even welcomed me with open arms. I was grateful for the outcome and the patience I had to show in order to make it possible. 

In the end, I was able to build lasting relationships with these members and am now a valued and respected part of the club's core group.
