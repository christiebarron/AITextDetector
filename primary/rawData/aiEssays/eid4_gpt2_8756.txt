The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it doesn't give one of its characters the time of day or night. The main character, John, in a moment of weakness (I'm talking in the beginning of a very important book, but this is the first time the book ever tells John what to do next), comes from a time when she has made a long journey to see the world we know. The main characters in this book are her older brother, Jack, who has decided to seek peace on Earth, and the young man (and maybe most of all, her two children): his mother, Helen. When Daniel is young (he's about to start middle school) and she's about to go missing, she's in full control of his life. The book even begins that "time of year" when her mother and Jack's lives stop. By the end of the book Daniel takes over the family. And he's taken the family and his wife and children into the streets and on to the streets in search of a better life. And it works! So this is why Winter Hibiscus can really stand the test of time.

It should come as no surprise when fans of the other book, John, see these characters, as they show. The main character, John, has found love, acceptance and love. For this reason John is on the forefront of her life as she learns to become a loving mother to his mother on both sides. She
