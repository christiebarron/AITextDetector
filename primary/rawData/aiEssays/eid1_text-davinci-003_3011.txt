Dear Editor,

I am writing to state my opinion on the effects computers have on people. As technology in our world continues to evolve, computers have become an essential part of our lives. We use them for work, recreation, education and communication. But in my opinion, the long-term use of computers can have a negative impact on our physical, mental and emotional health.

Physical health can be greatly affected by computer use. Sitting for extended periods of time can lead to posture problems, muscle pain, and even obesity. Most people also experience tiredness after long sessions in front of a computer because the intense focus can be tiring. Psychological impacts of computer use can be similarly damaging to our well-being. Spending excessive time on the computer can lead to isolation, depression and stress. In extreme cases, the addiction to the computer can prevent people from forming meaningful connections with others, leading to low self-esteem and social anxiety.

In conclusion, I believe that computers can have a negative impact on our physical, mental, and emotional health if not used responsibly. We can limit these risks by taking regular breaks from computers, engaging in outdoor activities, and using technology in an appropriate and balanced manner.
