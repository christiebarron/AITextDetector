Furthermore, very few of the materials that are deemed objectionable are in fact completely without merit. In most cases, these books, movies, and magazines are written and/or directed by accomplished authors, filmmakers, and journalists who are expressing important and sometimes controversial viewpoints.

Restricting access to certain materials sets a dangerous precedent and can lead to further censorship in the future.
