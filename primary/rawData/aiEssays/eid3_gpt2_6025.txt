Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

'The best thing we can do is make sure of those important, and important, things where it hurts. It's the same in most crashes where the risk is small,' says Dees.

'The biggest problems in crashes in the first couple of hours are the safety of people. That's very hard for the drivers to understand now because many riders have a big ticket.

'I can see a lot more young drivers and less riders in older cars with some problems with them so I think that's going to be fixed.'

Dees said many riders don't realise they are in the risk area and feel overwhelmed because they need to make more trips in a timely fashion.

He said: 'There are so many places where we need to do more but the worst experience of doing anything is always in traffic where the risk of being crushed or broken is high and the driver would rather die than come down to the road.'


Riders who crash

The study included 11,000 incidents between 15,000 and 34,000 on a weekly basis over four years, analysed by the research firm Ritchey

Buses were included in each category of crash in four studies and found:


1) More riders are taken off their bikes because they are less aware of the risks being a cyclist is taking

2) Less time is spent
