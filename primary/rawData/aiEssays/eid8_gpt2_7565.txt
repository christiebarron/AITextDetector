One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my daughter told me that I was the one who told her mother to kill her son. She looked up my name and said, "Moe?" When I asked that question to her mother the smile in my daughter's face was wide-eyed, a smile that lasted until just before the end of my life when her body began to shake. I was stunned to see my daughter's sister, her brother and me being shocked at being surrounded by the same sort of hatred that made so many other children come here because of their parents' hate. The sad truth is that we all face bigotry as the same. We don't see it that way all the time. It was something I always experienced when listening to my daughter. At times it scared me. Sometimes it scared me too much. Sometimes it scared me at the time. When I heard the same voice in my head as when she was eight years old, crying, "I am going to have to kill her," it almost kept me wondering what other people would think about the same way. The same silence makes me very sad. When a mother says that her feelings do not matter to her son, or that he is wronged when he has a bad experience, it leaves a deep impression on her and can make you think of all the emotions that he has. Some days is a struggle that will probably never be easy for my own mother, but many days am a fight that will last
