I was once standing in line at the grocery store, filled to the brim with my groceries. The line inched forward slowly, and I sighed in frustration as the person in front of me was trying to figure out a coupon issue with the cashier. I was starting to worry I was going to be late for an appointment, and the minutes were ticking away.

I tried my best to keep my patience. I reminded myself that everyone deserves courtesy and kindness and that we all have our unique issues that can cause delays. After a few more minutes, the customer finally finished, and it was my turn. I smiled politely and went about my business.

I felt proud of myself for putting my own frustrations aside and was happy that I'd been able to stay patient and understanding towards the customer. We all make mistakes, and it's important to be aware of our own struggles and those of others.
