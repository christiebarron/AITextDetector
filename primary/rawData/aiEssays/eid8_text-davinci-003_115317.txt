I remember the first time I laughed with my husband like it was yesterday. We were on a camping trip with a few of our friends. After a long day of exploring we were all tired but still had some energy left so we decided to play a game of charades.

I admit, I was a bit apprehensive. I hadn't been charades in a long time and was sure I wouldn't be very good. I was also a bit nervous because my husband was pretty competitive and I was sure he would want to win.

My fears were unfounded, however. We quickly partnered up – it just so happened that we ended up on the same team – and it wasn't long before we were both laughing with our friends. I was impressed with how fast my husband had picked up the game and how creative his guesses were.

What was even more remarkable, though, was how we laughed together. It was the kind of laughter that comes from pure joy. We were both completely at ease with one another – there was no judgement, no competition, just pure joy. By the end of the game, we had barely done any of the clues but we were both exhausted from laughing so hard. 

That moment of laughter has stayed with me ever since. It was the first moment that I truly realized that the love between my husband and I was genuine and sincere and that it was going to bring us a lot of joy.
