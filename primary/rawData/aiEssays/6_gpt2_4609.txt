The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

The building's design and design process began with a survey in 1993 by a firm called Karp Design, for the two-story Empire State Building. In response, engineers and architects from Karp and its partners developed three prototypes. The two-story building came with a retractable roof and an elevated wall to the ground that could be used for air conditioning, a storage unit and a garage. The team also included a third engineering design for a retractable roof that came complete without any support attachments to a wall or ceiling. But the third design was much less successful â€” because of the added weight that the retractable roof required.

The engineers were left to figure out how to adapt the two-story building's roof to meet the demand. Karp, a private construction company, started work on another project. The third design was designed for the same reason. Karp had a retractable roof, but it had not seen the light of day for years. The original plan was for a two-story, seven-story building that would have been built on an artificial structure to store cargo or the like. They looked at the design of the building without considering how to connect them.

"The roof had to be strong," says Eric Stroud, a senior building engineer with Karp and a proponent of the idea behind the retractable roof.
