The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is an attempt to bridge a gap in history between the first generation of Irish immigrants and the recent past. One of its most memorable lines was when he, at a ceremony for those left behind in the Great Storm of 1916, told the nation, 'it will be remembered by the brave Irishmen who fought with the Republic.

'The next day we all go to workScore our own pensions. It's time for us to get real work. And our lives will be made real.

'I feel my country will be made more real. I want Ireland to be made real too.'
