Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

First of all, although the setting means a lot (especially when coupled with the fact that many of us are all cyclists who have taken a different mode of transport). But this is the least of the problems, especially for people who have chosen a different cycle route.

Secondly, a good set of numbers also helps with determining if the new route is a good fit for most people. For example, let's assume a bike-free route to Oxford Road.

Here you will get the following figures:

Total cycling distance in minutes: 1.3, 1.4, or 1.5 miles (or 3.1km/h, depending on the route chosen). A few exceptions include the Eglinton and Oxford Street route, the Old Mill and Willsbury routes and the Woodleft route, the Willsbury route and Gwynedd route and the Gwynedd and Glenelg routes. The Gwynedd and The Woodleft routes include some areas in which there is less than 100mm of pavement.

In comparison we get the following figures:

Total cycling distance in minutes: 2.9, 2.9, 2.8 miles (or 10.9km/h).

Total cycling distance in miles: 1.5, 1.5, or 1.6 miles (or 12.5km/h
