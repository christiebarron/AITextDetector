"As you know today, the ACLU's civil rights lawsuit against Amazon and The Huffington Post over a "pornography law" is currently going on. But the courts do not allow that to happen."

Calls for censorship increased with social media users posting "Free Free Internet to users who want to make sure things aren't censored, because the majority of people don't think their views are correct." The issue was raised by anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela, who was found guilty of anti-federalism in the 1990s and was pardoned in 2013 for his role in what became the International Brotherhood of People's Liberation, then the Movement for the Decolonization of Africa, and the Human Rights of People of Color.

"Today, in a global situation, things like this are no longer acceptable and even more disturbing!" commented one commenter. "This is not for 'the people', I'd like to see the people on Twitter and Reddit get involved and ask their congresspeople to stop these censorship bills, they are just not listening. They do not seem to believe in social justice, but only those people who understand that you can live online and be freeâ€¦ I don't know about you, but I respect you. Because I am sure that I will have more freedom now than I could
