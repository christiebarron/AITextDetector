The Empire State Building was built in New York City in 1931, and the builders had a daring idea â€“ to enable dirigibles to dock at the 102nd roof of the building. For many, the idea of dirigibles docking at the tallest structure in the world was seen as a marvel of modern engineering, but sadly it was never realized. There were several obstacles that the builders faced in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.

The first obstacle was safety. Allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building presented a serious safety risk. There were questions about the strength of the mooring mast, if it could withstand the force created when a large dirigible connected to the structure. Furthermore, allowing dirigibles to alight on so congested a rooftop greatly increased the risk of a collision with a passerby, building or another aircraft. Questions were raised soon after construction began, and safety concerns were a major reason why dirigibles never saw the top of the Empire State Building. 

The second obstacle was cost. To enable dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, a mooring mast had to be built. Not only was the mooring mast itself expensive to construct, but it also required a dedicated team to monitor and maintain it, adding to operational costs. Developers had to weigh the money and resources required against the potential benefits of the project. They decided that the risks were high, the cost
