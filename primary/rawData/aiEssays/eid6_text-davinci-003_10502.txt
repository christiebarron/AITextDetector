The Empire State Building was an incredible feat of engineering designed to be the tallest building in the world. In order to accommodate the innovative new form of transportation, dirigibles, the architects went to great lengths to ensure the building was equipped to safely moor the huge airships. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when allowing dirigibles to dock at the mighty structure.

One of the main obstacles was the design of the tower itself. Because the tower was so tall, the architects had to commit to providing an unimpeded emergency helicopter access point. As a result, the building had to be specifically designed that carefully balanced height and safety. This task was complex and made docking more difficult. 

The length of the mooring mast was another obstacle the builders had to overcome as the lighter-than-air craft needed a 120-meter tall mast. This requirement tested the steel-building skills of the engineers to the max. Not only did the team need to design a mast that could reach 120 meters, but they also had to stay within budget and ensure the mast could contribute to the building's stability during high winds.

The construction of the Empire State Building was also complicated by the sheer size of the dirigibles. Constructing a mooring mast that could accommodate ships that could carry over 10 tons of passengers was a feat in itself. The architects had to account for the tremendous weight of the vessels and efficiently design the moor
