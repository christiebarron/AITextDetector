This was an ambitious idea, as dirigibles had never been seen docking in this manner before. The difficulties began the moment the deck was finished as the location of the building, at the intersection of 34th Street and Fifth Avenue, was in the midst of the city.  

The busy street and the consequent pollution was a big factor which needed to be taken into consideration. This was coupled with the dangers from other structures such as the electric lines and wires that snaked around the building and the adjacent skyscrapers. The daring plan had to have a safe place to moor the large airships without putting the passengers in danger. 

In order to provide an adequate docking space, the Empire State Building had to be modified. The original design of the building had a relatively small spire, which was not going to be enough to handle the size and weight of a dirigible. Therefore, the spire was widened and additional mooring masts were added. The top of the spire was also fitted with a steel cable which the airship could be attached to. 

The mooring mast, which allowed dirigibles to dock securely, presented its own set of challenges. The mooring mast had to be installed at the top of the Empire State Building, and the aerodynamic shape of
