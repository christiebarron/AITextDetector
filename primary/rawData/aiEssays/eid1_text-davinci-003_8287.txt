The Empire State Building was built with the ambitious goal of not only being the tallest building in the world, but to accommodate new transportation technology of the era, namely dirigibles, to be allowed to dock on the building’s top. It was a bold idea, and also presented a great many engineering and logistical obstacles for the builders to overcome in order to achieve its ambitious goal. 

The first major issue was simply structural stability; the building would need to be built strong enough to handle the additional weight from the dirigible and moored mast, while still meeting the practical requirements of the building itself. This was accomplished through the use of a steel frame and reinforced concrete, allowing for the extra stability without sacrificing the structural integrity of the building itself.

The next challenge was the mooring mast itself. The mooring mast needed to meet the height requirement of the dirigibles of the time, roughly 800 feet above sea level, and the builders had to find a way to construct a mast of that height while keeping the building still a record-breaking height of 1,250 feet. They decided to use two masts joining in the middle, allowing the use of a lightweight aluminum construction that would still meet the necessary height requirements.

The last obstacle was finding a way to make a successful attachment of the dirigible to the mooring mast. This was solved with the use of a “grapplinghook” device, essentially two
