One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was 18 years old, which it had never been before, when I could really relate to my own parents who had my mom and dad and their whole family on board as well. I had heard stories of a girl on the fringes who was "really nice". All of this time I wanted to go back and experience the love and joy that you've always so much admired. That's why I wanted to use something I'd learned as inspiration: The courage of those who are brave enough to speak up. That's how you can give back, to those affected by prejudice: to those who have lost your courage.
