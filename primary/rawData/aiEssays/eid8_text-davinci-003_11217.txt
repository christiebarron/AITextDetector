I still remember the first time I met my now husband better than I remember my own phone number. I remember how awkward I felt, how I was worried that nothing I said would be funny, or that he wouldn't find me attractive. 

But slowly, I started to relax into his company and a few awkward jokes later, we were both laughing. It was the moment I knew we'd be together as long as we both wanted. 

We kept laughing our way through our first few dates, our first steps as a couple, and eventually through an entire year of long distance while we both went back to school. Laughter was the thing that kept us connected even when we were so far apart. 

Now, almost five years later, it's still laughter that keeps us bonded, even when life throws us some curves. Of course, it helps that we have so much to laugh about. We make sure to find funny moments even in the most serious of times, and that lightness and joy keeps us connected more than anything. 

The memory of laughter is one I'll treasure forever.
