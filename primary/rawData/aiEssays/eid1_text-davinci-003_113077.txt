Dear Editor,

I am writing to discuss my opinion on the effects computers have on people. I firmly believe computers are having a negative impact that cannot be ignored.

Amidst the issues that come with computers, the most damaging concern is the emergence of screen addiction. Many people, especially young people, are getting addicted to using computers for hours, losing sleep, and ignoring their health. Therefore, it is causing serious mental and physical health issues. Besides that, computers are also increasing the divide between those who understand technology and those who donâ€™t, creating inequality in economic and employment opportunities.

Moreover, computers have weakened interpersonal relations. Social media has replaced face-to-face interaction, making people less social. Heavy computer use also limits creativity and imagination, making people dependent on pre-existing technology and applications.

Despite the convenience computers provide, they are creating an environment more difficult to live in. It is important to find a balance between using computers and engaging in more meaningful activities. I firmly believe this is possible if we all take the right steps towards creating a healthy computer-use environment.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
