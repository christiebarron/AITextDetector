The construction of the Empire State Building marked a major milestone in architectural history. But the building itself held a unique, additional purpose: the docking of dirigibles, or aerostats. The ability to dock dirigibles within a major urban center was a major ambition of the builders of the Empire State Building and a feat that posed significant engineering challenges. 

The most important engineering challenge was the creation of a secure docking apparatus for the pockets of gas-filled airships. This required the development of a mooring mast, an extraordinarily tall and strong structure rising 800 feet above the rooftop of the Empire State Building. The mast became the tallest of its kind in the world, and the challenge of constructing it in the middle of a busy urban center added to the complexity of the task.

The mast was designed by renowned sailors and naval architects George Haven Putnam and John Randel, who conceived of a steel construction with a giant derrick arm at the top. This arm would extend 200 feet from the mast and hold a winch which would grab large cables hung from the airship's gondola. The cables would then be pulled back to secure the airship to the mast.

In addition to the engineering obstacles inherent in constructing a mooring mast of such scale and robustness, the Empire State Building builders also had to overcome great challenges in terms of safety measures and logistics. For instance, the architects had to consider how to ensure that the air
