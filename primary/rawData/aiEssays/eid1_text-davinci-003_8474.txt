I had recently taken on a new job as a sales assistant at a local department store. In my first week, I was feeling overwhelmed and slightly out of my depth. One customer came into the store who was particularly irate. He was shouting and became increasingly frustrated when I was unable to find exactly what he wanted in stock.

Rather than get angry and match the customer's attitude, I chose to remain calm and patient. I could see how frustrated the customer was and I tried to be understanding, assuring him that I would do whatever I could to find a suitable solution. I spent the next hour looking through the stockroom and gaining the help of my colleagues in order to help the customer find what he was looking for.

In the end, my patience and commitment paid off â€“ I was able to find a similar variant of what the customer wanted and I'm sure it was this display of understanding and compassion that made the difference. The customer eventually left the store satisfied and I was relieved to have dealt with the situation in such an effective way.
