The poem ends with this line to show hopefulness and perseverance. By comparing the green and blooming hibiscus the speaker is comparing themselves to the flower. Despite the hard times they have faced with their tests and exams, they know that in the spring things will get better. The speaker has faith that despite the struggles they face now, they will eventually pass this test through hard work and dedication. They are optimistic and have faith in the future, just as the hibiscus will bloom again in the spring.
