Dear Editor,

I am writing to voice my opinion about the effects computers have had on our lives. In my opinion, computers have made our lives easier and more efficient.

Today, computers are everywhere, with over two billion people having access to the internet. This has made communication and gathering information much easier than ever before. We can now search the internet for any information we need, from looking up the meaning of a word to shopping online. Computers have also enabled us to connect with people around the world with emails, social media, and video conferencing, making it easier to collaborate with others. 

Moreover, computers have greatly impacted the business world. Companies can now centralize information, automate processes, and streamline communication in order to increase productivity. Computers have also changed the job market, with many jobs requiring the use of computers and technology.

All in all, computers have had a positive effect on our lives. They have made communication easier, more efficient, and more convenient. I hope this letter encourages readers to share my opinion about the power of computers and the positive effects they have had on our lives.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
