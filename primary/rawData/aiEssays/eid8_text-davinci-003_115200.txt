I remember the day like it was yesterday. It was a beautiful Saturday morning and my best friend and I had decided to take a picnic to the local park. 

The sun was shining, the birds were singing, and we were just enjoying each other's company. All of a sudden, my friend did something so silly and unexpected that I couldn't help but laugh. He was trying to do an imitation of a bird, but he ended up making a sound that was more like a donkey than anything else. 

We looked at each other, and I could feel the laughter bubbling up inside of me. Within seconds, both of us were rolling on the ground and we couldn't stop laughing. We laughed so hard that our stomachs started to hurt. But even the pain couldn't stop us from giggling. 

For the rest of the day, we kept telling each other jokes and trying to top the last one, and every time one of us got the other person to laugh, we felt this connection between us. It was as if we had our own language or something, as if nothing else in the world mattered but this moment of laughter. 

As we finished our picnic and said goodbye, I knew I'd take away with me this special memory of laughter shared between us. Every time my best friend and I get together after that, laughter always follows.
