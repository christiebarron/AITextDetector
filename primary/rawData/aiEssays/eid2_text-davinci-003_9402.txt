Censorship in libraries is an important and highly debated topic in today's society. Libraries are places of learning, and our children should not be exposed to age-inappropriate materials. However, removing certain books, music, movies, and magazines from the shelves based solely on their perceived offensiveness is a form of censorship that should not be allowed. 

Many books, music, movies, and magazines contain material that may be seen as offensive to some people, but their removal denies access to these materials for all library users. Furthermore, censoring library materials can have an unintended consequence of preventing people from expanding their knowledge and understanding of controversial issues. Removing books, music, movies, and magazines without providing the opportunity for debate and dialogue limits our ability to understand perspectives that may differ from our own. 

Rather than removing materials that someone may find offensive, libraries should provide disclaimers or warnings to let people know what content is included in materials. Libraries can also provide resources alongside offensive materials to facilitate thoughtful conversations about them. For example, a library may include a book about racism with reference books on similar subject matter to assist readers in better understanding the context of the book before forming any opinions on it.

Finally, libraries should provide an appeals process for people to express any concerns they have with library materials. This appeals process would allow the public to voice their concerns about library materials in a respectful and productive manner, while still allowing access to those materials for other library
