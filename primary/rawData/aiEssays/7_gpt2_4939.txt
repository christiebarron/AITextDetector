An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when she felt that she could no longer control her emotions," said Shady. "She said that some of her anxiety about the situation had caused her to be withdrawn and felt less confident in her role as a person of power and that she didn't want to keep it there anymore."

In a statement released by the B.C. Association of Mental Health and Addiction Services, the association said it is committed to making sure people with mental health issues and addiction are treated "with compassion, dignity and respect."

"To date the B.C. Association of Mental Health and Addiction Services has provided more than 3,000 resources to persons with mental health issues, including resources for families to connect their suffering with resources to help support them with difficult decisions about their choices, and is actively assisting the B.C. Association of Mental Health and Addiction Services with the investigation into why it has failed to act on this issue and will continue working to make sure individuals with mental health problems and addiction have the resources they need to transition back to a normal life."

A spokesperson for the association's mental health unit confirmed to CBC News Friday the federal government was aware of the problem. The organization has worked with the B.C. government to ensure staff trained on mental health issues meet the highest standards of respect for each resident's rights.
