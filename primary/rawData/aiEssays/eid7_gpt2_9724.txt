An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my mother. They did that for years to help when my mother died, but it was to help me overcome the grief of all of those who were killed. It was their family that brought me in, and they cared for me. They knew there would be more to it. I spent a lot of my time caring for them and that helped me overcome every setback that came along when the disease was diagnosed.

There are a lot of women who think about that feeling of being lost in your life, that everything is happening around you. That you don't look down on yourself as a woman. The most powerful thing they can do for you is to see yourself as a person with a responsibility that will help you overcome your personal failings. They'll help you work through all of the problems that you're living with.
