I was recently in line at the grocery store and there was an elderly gentleman in front of me. He had forgotten his ID and the cashier asked to see it, but he couldn't find it. He started to become visibly flustered and apologized for holding up the line. Instead of growing impatient, I offered to help him search for it. We together looked through his wallet, pockets, and even back in his car. After a few minutes, he eventually found it and thanked me for helping him. I simply smiled and told him that it was no problem. In that moment, I was patient and understanding, and it made a difficult situation much easier to handle.
