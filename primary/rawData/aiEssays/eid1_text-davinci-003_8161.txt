The Empire State Building had a unique ability to accommodate docking dirigibles, and the builders of the building had to overcome several obstacles in order to make it a reality. In "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lusted, several difficulties are explored that served as impediments for the engineers.

One of the major issues was that it was unprecedented to have dirigible docks on a building of such height. In order to solve this problem, the engineers had to figure out the necessary wind stability and appropriate forces to create a stable docking system. Then, to bring their ideas to life, they had to figure out how to place the mast on the top of the building and keep it secure.

To finally open the docking station for dirigibles, the engineers had to construct a platform that was strong enough to support the weight of an incoming airship. Because the sun and wind can wear down the materials of the mast, the engineers also had to take precautions to ensure the platform stayed strong and secure.

Additionally, choosing the proper materials for the platform was key. The platform had to be capable of resisting wind shear and heavy loads, without causing undue strain on the building itself.

In bringing their ideas to life, the engineers also had to focus on creating a precise navigation system. This was essential to ensure the dirigible never missed its mark; and the exact dimensions of the building and subsequent platform had to be taken into consideration for the
