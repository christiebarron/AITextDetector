When I was sixteen, I had the privilege of helping out at a local senior center. I was nervous at first, but quickly grew to love my assignments. One day, in particular, I was assigned to help an elderly woman with her weekly grocery shopping. She was a quiet woman who moved slowly and I could tell she found it hard to keep up with those of us around her age. 

I could tell she was a bit overwhelmed and I was really intimidated by the task. I could feel myself wanting to rush her, but I managed to stay patient and allowed her to move at her own pace. Even though there were plenty of other things I felt like I should be doing, I made sure I had extra patience and stayed by her side.

At the end of our trip, she stopped me and thanked me for my patience and understanding. She said it wasn't an easy task for her physically, but it was especially difficult when faced with younger people who moved faster than she was used to. For me, it was an unforgettable reminder to always stay patient and give people the time and space needed to do what is best for them.
