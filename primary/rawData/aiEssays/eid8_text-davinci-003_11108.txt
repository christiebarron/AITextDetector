I was on a date with my boyfriend for our one year anniversary. We had gone downtown to enjoy a nice dinner, but it had already been a long day and neither of us felt especially like celebrating. We were both feeling a little down, a little tired, and getting ready to call it a night, when something funny happened.

My boyfriend was reaching for the check when his hand suddenly came down onto a large pile of cutlery. As he scrambled to retrieve the utensils, he went to grab the fork, but instead he came up with a ladle! We were both so startled that we couldn't help but burst into laughter.

We kept laughing at the silly little accident until tears ran down our faces. The hard day had melted away in an instant and we ended up having a great night and an even better anniversary. 

Since then, there's something special about moments of laughter in our relationship. They open us up and leave us feeling closer than ever. Every once in awhile, we'll remember that "ladle-gate" incident and break into laughter, and it still feels just as good as it had that first night. Laughter really is the shortest distance between two people!
