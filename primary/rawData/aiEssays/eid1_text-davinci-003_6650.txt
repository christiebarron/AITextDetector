Dear Editor,

The influence of computers on our lives is a very hotly debated topic amongst most people. While some view computers as a huge asset, others believe they are a detriment to our society. While I can appreciate both sides of the argument, my opinion is that computers are an invaluable aid to our lives.

The benefits of computers are numerous. They allow us to work more efficiently and effectively, freeing up time in our schedules for leisure activities. They offer us access to vast libraries of information, allowing us unprecedented access to educational resources. On a personal level, many of us rely on computers for communication with friends and family, and they are our link to the rest of the world.

However, the most important benefit of computers is their ability to create opportunities. They open pathways to new relationships, new businesses, and new ways of working. Even the most seemingly mundane items from our daily lives can be improved or totally changed by computers. For instance, walking into a restaurant without ever interacting with a waiter is now a reality due to the combination of your smart phone and a computerized kiosk.

In conclusion, the use of computers can have a positive effect on our lives. They increase our efficiency and open opportunities that would have otherwise been impossible. I believe that we can continue to benefit from their use, as long as we practice responsible computer use.

Sincerely,
