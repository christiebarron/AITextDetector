I believe that censorship of materials in libraries must be avoided and should instead be encouraged in all universities and research facilities, including libraries.

This means that all students should have access to relevant and critical materials Volvo and its parent company are obliged to make available to them all. Every single student deserves the option to discover, to study, to practice and in many cases to work on and to achieve the results they seek (this is the definition of a good pedagogy and a very important one).

But it is only with all of these and more with the increasing prominence of digital technologies that we can have a dialogue to help improve our environment at both the individual and the global level, which must continue to create a new way for all of us to take a stand as to what is real for all of us.
