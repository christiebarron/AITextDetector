The author, Minfong Ho, is trying to show the cycle of life in the poem and how it is everchanging. The winter hibiscus is a symbol of the author's journey, and the test is likely a symbol of life's tests or obstacles. The poem ends with the author vowing to take the test again in the spring when the snows have melted and the hibiscus buds. The author is acknowledging that obstacles may present themselves again in the future, yet the cycle of life will continue and the hibiscus will eventually bloom in the spring. This brings closure to the poem and encourages the reader to have faith that whatever challenges they face, things will turn out alright in the end.
