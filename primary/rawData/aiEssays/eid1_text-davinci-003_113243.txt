Dear Editor,

As our world becomes increasingly digital, the use of computers has grown exponentially. While computers undoubtedly offer significant advantages — such as increased efficiency and the ability to access a wide range of information — it is also true that they have some unwelcome effects on both users and society.

For instance, computer-based activities can be heavily linked to physical health issues such as carpal tunnel syndrome, headaches, sleep disruption, and back strain. Too much time spent in front of a computer can even be linked to less serious, but still potentially problematic, effects such as a tendency to multitask and a sense of feeling overwhelmed by the sheer volume of data. 

The use of computers can also have psychological effects, such as social isolation and cyberbullying. Both students and adults can take to the internet to perform bullying activities that may not be visible in the real world. Additionally, some users may fall victim to technology addiction, resulting in negative behaviors, including neglect of school and work; lack of real-life socialization; and extreme isolation.

The effects of using computers can prove particularly damaging to young people, who lack the experience and maturity to handle the internet in a responsible way. Excessive use of computers can also have a negative effect on cognitive development, particularly for children. Experts are concerned that extended periods of screen time can limit the child’s imagination and ability to focus.

To protect our children, students, and society in general
