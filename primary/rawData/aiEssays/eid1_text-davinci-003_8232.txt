The building of the Empire State Building in 1931 was a monumental undertaking, and the fact that the building was outfitted with a mooring mast for dirigibles just added to the complexity of the task. From the outset, there were various obstacles to be overcome in order to make docking a success. As Marcia Amidon Lüsted outlines in her work, “The Mooring Mast,” the installation of a mast for dirigibles had never been attempted before, and the engineers had to essentially start from scratch to devise a safe way for a large aircraft to safely tie up near the building.

One of the primary challenges the builders of the Empire State Building faced was strong winds that could cause turbulence and place the dirigible in a perilous situation. To overcome this issue, the engineers designed a combination of winches, cables, and mooring lines. The winches and cables would hold the dirigible steady and would be able to be operated from either the air or the ground. The mooring lines, meanwhile, were three long cables that were strung across the mast like an enormous yoke, allowing the dirigible to attach itself to the building and be held fast despite the wind conditions.

The designers of the mooring mast also had to come up with a way to allow the tethering process to be as quick and easy as possible. This was incredibly important since large aircraft needed to be able to quickly dock and depart
