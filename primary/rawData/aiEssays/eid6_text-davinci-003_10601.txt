At the time of the Great Depression, the builders of the Empire State Building posed a unique challenge: the construction of the tallest man-made structure in the world, the Empire State Building. The iconic and majestic building, standing at 102 stories tall, was designed to be the first of its kind to accommodate dirigibles, also known as airships. Despite the bold ambition of its builders, building the structure tall enough to accommodate the dirigibles was not without its challenges.

The greatest challenge to the builders was that the talls structure posed a risk in accommodating the massive airships due to their weight. Engineers at the time had limited knowledge on how to efficiently build a tall structure that could withstand the weight of the dirigibles. To address this issue, anchoring the dirigibles was seen as the most efficient way to dock them and allow for unloading and loading of passengers and cargo. Builders had to come up with an innovative way to anchor the dirigibles and also to ensure the safety of those on board when doing so.

The solution to this problem was to construct the Empire State Building with a mooring mast atop its rooftop. This mooring mast provided the structure with a point of attachment for the dirigibles to dock and also provided an effective way to secure the airships relative to the direction the wind was blowing. Additionally, the mooring mast allowed for more efficient loading and unloading of passengers and cargo, as
