The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it tells a new story of love and loss - the one story that doesn't require any other characters to follow it at all.

My favorite part of The Winter Hibiscus is how it gives you the opportunity to write your character and how the way the story goes makes you want to go that way and get back to that. It's fun and it makes a wonderful story that will help you make the decision to play your character and maybe just use your experience in a new way.

I could go on and on. A lot. But I'm going to try and use some of some of that information, since we've got a lot of new, interesting things to tell. Not all of it going into Winter Hibiscus. Not all of those that come out. I think that it's all about the story.

It's a great book as it is, and every character is unique - and that is something we're going to work on. I know that sometimes it's a little rough around the edges, which is kind of part of what it is the books tell. With this story, the two young, loveable lovebirds, the beautiful young couple that the boys come home to find, the couple that meets the man in the castle every day, everything is about the fairy tale. There's something different about it. And so I hope as we do a lot of more in those stories
