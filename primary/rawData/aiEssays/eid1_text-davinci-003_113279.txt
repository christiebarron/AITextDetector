To the Editor:

I believe that computers have both positive and negative effects on people. On one hand, increased use of computers has made our lives significantly easier in terms of work and education. With the advent of the Internet, finding information and accessing resources is much simpler and more efficient. Furthermore, modern computers have made it much easier to communicate and collaborate with others.

On the other hand, computers can have a damaging impact on people if used in the wrong way. For example, some people spend too much time on their computer gaming, surfing the Internet, or watching videos, which can lead to decreased productivity. Moreover, spending too much time in front of a computer screen can also lead to physical health problems such as eye strain or neck pain.

Overall, I believe that computers can be used to our advantage if we use them responsibly. If we can find a balance between the productive use of computers and other activities, we can make the most of the technology and reap its benefits while staying safe.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
