Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. While computers have unquestionably revolutionized the way we live and work, there are a few unfortunate consequences that we must be aware of.

Computer use has become so pervasive that people, particularly those of younger generations, are no longer as interested in outdoor activities or physical exercise. As a result, we are increasingly witnessing an increase in health risks and physical inactivity. This in turn leads to a wide range of medical conditions, such as obesity and diabetes.

Moreover, computers have had a detrimental effect on personal relationships, as people are expending ever more time in front of a computer screen. This can lead to both physical and mental health issues--such as isolation, depression, and insomnia--which can have a significant impact on people's lives.

I believe it is essential for us to take steps to rectify the negative side-effects that come with computer use. We must create a balance between our digital and real worlds. For example, we should be encouraging more outdoor activity, as well as moderation when it comes to computer use.

It is my hope that my words may encourage readers to be mindful of
