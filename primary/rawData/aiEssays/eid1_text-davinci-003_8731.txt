I was with my best friend at a party, and we were in the middle of an intense debate about some political issue. We must have been getting a little too heated, because soon the whole room was watching us! As if on cue, one of us burst into laughter. I don't know which one of us it was, but it didn't matter. We both started howling with laughter, and suddenly the tension evaporated. Everyone else at the party started to laugh too, and soon the entire room was filled with merry laughter.

We spent the rest of the evening in great spirits, laughing and making jokes about anything and everything. I'm glad we had that moment of shared laughter â€“ it brought us both a lot closer together, and everyone else at the party couldn't help but smile.  In that moment, laughter was the shortest distance between us all.
