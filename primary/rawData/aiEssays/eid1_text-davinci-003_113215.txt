Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my thoughts on the effects computers have had on people in recent years. It is clear that computers have had a significant impact, but it is important to recognize both the positive and the negative aspects of their presence.

On the one hand, computers have allowed us to accomplish incredible things in a fraction of the time it would have previously taken. The use of computers for the organization, analysis, and storage of large amounts of data is highly efficient and incredibly useful. Additionally, computers have connected us in ways that would have been impossible even just a few years ago. Through social media and other types of online communication, we are better able to connect with family and friends from any corner of the world.

On the other hand, there are some negative aspects that should be mentioned. Prolonged periods of time in front of a screen can lead to physical and mental health issues, including poor vision, neck and back pain, and difficulty sleeping and concentrating. It is increasingly important to prioritize “unplugging” from screens and devoting time to physical activity and social interaction.

In conclusion, while computers have provided us with a wealth of opportunities, it is important to recognize and address the potential pitfalls that come with them. We must remember to build balance and moderation into our lives.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
