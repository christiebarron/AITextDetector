One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was driving down the same road with my parents when a truck broke down and crashed into two men waiting in the back. I had a heart attack where the driver hit my head from the bottom of the car. So, I would laugh out loud. And now, I really enjoy being a normal human being living a normal, peaceful life. And I thought about my own life as someone who can use my laughter, my humor, to keep going up at the goal where I wanted and need to be, so to speak. It always helps to have my humour. My funny moments started with jokes or snarking or something that the driver would have said and used in his or her words or said or did not say, and I found myself with humor always in my mouth, laughing that way when there was something that went along with it. I'm sure my jokes will have even more laughter at some point. And that's all for now. I'll see you guys next month.
