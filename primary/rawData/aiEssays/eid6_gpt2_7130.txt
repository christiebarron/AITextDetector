The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First was their insistence on a ceiling in the front of the upper deck; later, the idea was to cut the front of the structure by six feet. The next major hurdle was in the shape of the upper building's roof. The roof had to be square or rectangular, with no rounded corner at the corners. The top dome had to be a large circular area at the sides. Another obstacle to the construction of dirigibles was the lack of proper clearance in the roof. After a year of research and planning, designers of dirigibles were finally able to decide upon a standard for roofing, in which the height of the roof should be about one-third higher than that of the dome. A dome is the lowest (and last) level of a building.

The first of these innovations was the curved roof. This was constructed at the time when the Empire State Building was being constructed at the National Military Museum, which was known as the "National Military Building," because the roof of the old Empire State Building was triangular (with the "A" at the top). The dome shape had to be square or rectangular, with the top dome of the building about three feet higher than that of the top dome of the building. The second was the curved roof. The curved roof had to be rectangular, with the corners of the roof of the building facing the outside, while vertical roofs were usually
