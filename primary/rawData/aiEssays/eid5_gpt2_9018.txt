The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' makes use of a very different interpretation of the event, and suggests the book was written in the first place.

From home, as described in the book, was a time of tremendous uncertainty, and one which saw the destruction of a nation's most ancient cities. As the book goes on it becomes one of the most harrowing tales in modern writing. This is what makes it difficult for readers to understand its narrative. The lack of the most familiar aspects of the book make it extremely painful for those who want to learn more of historical facts.
