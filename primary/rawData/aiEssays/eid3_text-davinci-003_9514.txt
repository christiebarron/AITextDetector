The setting of Joe Kurmaski’s poem “Rough Road Ahead” heavily affects the cyclist both mentally and physically. The poem is set on a winding mountain road, with steep inclines and overgrown foliage of cactus and mesquite. This road is marked by heat and sweat and provides a feeling of desolation which puts the cyclist in an uncomfortable and hopeless place. 

Mentally, the cyclist has to traverse a climb which is not only physically impossible, but seemingly spiritually impossible as well. This is illustrated through the lines, “But I’ve to ascend from Hell, like a soldier leaving the trenches / Summoning in me every ounce of my own courage.” This implies a great mental struggle and a need to overcome adversity in order to ascend the mountain road. 

Physical challenges are plentiful in the setting of this poem. Since the cyclist is climbing a mountain, the incline and subsequent decline are extremely difficult and require immense effort. The addition of the intense heat and sweat cause the cyclist to lose energy and focus. The cyclist entreating others to “Take my screams” understands the physical toll this climb acts on him. 

The features of this setting quickly affect the cyclist in a physical and mental capacity. Although Kurmaski’s poem does not detail his ultimate triumph or defeat, the challenges he faces give readers an insight into the struggles of endurance. With each line of the poem
