The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because there are so many great ways to interpret it. This book is so well written that I think it will sell for any reasonable amount of money. If you have any kind of problem with the book it says "don't read. Don't write again. Leave your memories behind in the box and try again later." This book doesn't really have that benefit for me. I am sure many have. I'm really glad you bought the book. It's a very useful book and there are so many different ways you can go about your daily life.
