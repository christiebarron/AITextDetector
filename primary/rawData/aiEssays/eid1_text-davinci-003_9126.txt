Dear Editor,

As technology advances, so does our reliance on computers. The rising use of computers in nearly every aspect of life can have both negative and positive effects on people. However, I firmly believe that the benefits outweigh the risks. 

To start, computers are unparalleled learning tools. With the help of the internet, individuals can access a wealth of information to advance their knowledge base. It’s never been easier to take online courses and develop valuable skills. Computers also allow more efficient communication between people around the globe, eliminating the need for physical travel to stay connected. 

Not to mention, computers are incredibly beneficial when it comes to our work lives. Just think about how much easier life would be without email, word processing, or even spreadsheets. Businesses could not operate nearly as efficiently and productively. My family proudly owns a business that relies heavily on computers and it has helped revolutionize our work flow. 

Admittedly, too much reliance on computers can have unwanted side effects like affecting our physical health, which is why it’s important to take regular breaks from computer use. Ultimately, I believe that if computers are used responsibly, the benefits greatly outweigh any potential negative impacts. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this letter. 

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
