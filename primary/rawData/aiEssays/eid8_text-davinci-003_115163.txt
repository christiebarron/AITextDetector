I was on a crowded train, standing with my earphones on. I heard a chuckle to my right and looked over to see a little old man with a twinkle in his eye, and I couldn't help but smile back. We made eye contact and I knew he was looking for some conversation. 

"What's so funny?" I asked.

He took off his hat and ran a hand through his thinning hair before leaning towards me conspiratorially.

"Between you and me, I'm not sure why I'm even taking the train," he said with a huge smile. "I live two blocks away and take this route every day! I just like an excuse to get out and people watch!"

I laughed along with him, and he became visibly delighted. Our conversation picked up from there and before I knew it the train had reached my destination. We said our goodbyes, and he winked at me before I stepped off onto the platform.

I smiled the entire way home, reminded yet again of how meaningful a simple conversation could be. Laughter, it turns out, is truly the shortest distance between two people, and I was grateful for that shared moment.
