I believe that censorship of materials in libraries might be in the realm of "freedom of expression" and that it needs urgent action. I am not proposing that library owners should be forbidden from using the public data that libraries need to keep track of all public data. There are some significant flaws in this approach but I believe that there are a number of things that need to be addressed to make this easier and more effective."

The fact that some libraries, such as the American Library Association, have been using all the available data and making public their own collections is unfortunate. The ACLU, in general, strongly disagrees with this, as they would have nothing to say about libraries having to share all their data.

This is more or less where the debate goes. "Right now, we have some very important tools that can help libraries keep our data safe," Dr. Paley said. "We are very concerned with free press and for the right of each library to use such knowledge of its own records (and indeed of our own data). We are concerned about freedom of expression and the right of libraries to gather and store our data as private personal data."
