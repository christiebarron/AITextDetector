Narciso Rodriguez’s memoir, From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, immerses its readers in a myriad of emotions, creating an engaging narrative of Rodriguez’s life growing up as a child of Cuban immigrants. The memoir uses Rodriguez’s personal memories and experiences to craft an intimate atmosphere for its readers, providing a glimpse into his unique and flourishing world growing up in Paterson, New Jersey, in the 1950s and 60s.

The memoir begins with Rodriguez describing his early memories as a child, emphasizing his attentive mother’s love and care for her children through her unexpected gestures of kindness. Rodriguez shows the strength of the Cuban women in his community, characterizing them as the bedrock of Cuban immigrants during a difficult period of relocation and settlement in the United States. He describes his fondness and respect for these Cuban women who “had built a protective bubble of familiarity and comfort within the chaos of assimilation.”

As the narrative progresses, readers are invited to experience what it is like to grow up a Cuban immigrant in post WWII America. Rodriguez paints vivid depictions of his many formative experiences and captures scenes from all of the major events in his life: first communions, holidays, graduation ceremonies, and even his first job at the local Paterson used car lot. Through his carefully crafted tales, a deeply melancholic, yet inspiring, atmosphere is created.
