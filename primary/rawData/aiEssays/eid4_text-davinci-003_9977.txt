Minfong Ho ends Winter Hibiscus with this question to symbolize that Spring is a time of renewal and hope. The protagonist is reflecting on her experiences throughout the year and how they have impacted her. The remaining questions she has will be answered in the future, and it is only right for her to take the test again in the springtime, the renewal of life. This is also a reminder that regardless of setbacks, there is always the chance to try again in the future. The mention of the geese returning is symbolic of the cyclical nature of life and how one can go through stages of difficulty but be able to replenish their energy and hope in order for them to continue forward.
