Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my opinion on the implications computers have had on people over the past few decades.

It is quite apparent computers have had a tremendous effect on society in regard to the efficiency in both business and homes. Businesses are able to manage their day-to-day operations more efficiently with the help of computers. In addition, they are able to streamline processes that would have otherwise taken a significantly longer amount of time to complete. Computers also offer individuals an easy way to access valuable information, as well as stay connected to one another through the use of social media.

However, there are some negative impacts as a result of computer usage. Many people become too “plugged in” and addicted to the Internet, resulting in them having less time for physical activities such as exercise. Additionally, the use of computers can take away from valuable face-to-face communication between people. This lack of social interaction may cause people to become withdrawn and socially isolated.

In conclusion, while computers have provided us with an abundance of advantages and a higher level of productivity, it is important to not get too reliant on them in the detriment of physical and interpersonal relationships.
