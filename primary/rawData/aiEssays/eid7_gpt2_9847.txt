An example of a time someone in my life was patient was at an age when someone was in her 70s. The person has been a mother of four children with four of them now. We have worked together for many years to overcome a very difficult issue. I think this has changed everything for me as someone who has been a person of good faith but not an atheist. My religious belief is not a secret. I was in the last few years of a long spiritual journey in a religion we weren't aware of and they were my people. I was aware of some personal problems and some personal concerns. They were all real and I was doing good. It was difficult to have all four friends. I had just a meeting with them. They were all so friendly and understanding. Now I'm in their lives in a different way but I can understand so much more. I'm in their lives for all of us and as a mother as well. It's amazing that my faith has changed and that the world still hasn't forgiven me. That's something I've felt for more than a decade and it's something I hope everyone who comes into the world does too.

"I've just started my life as a Christian. I'm not going to do another religious thing until after that. Until something changes. The world didn't ever accept me and so my faith never went that way."
