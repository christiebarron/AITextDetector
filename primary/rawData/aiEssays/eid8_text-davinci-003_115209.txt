I remember the first time I met my now best friend. She was visiting from Guatemala, and we instantly hit it off. We laughed and joked for hours, and it was like we had known each other all our lives. 

The more we got to know each other, the more we realised how much we had in common. We played pranks on each other, shared great stories and had amazing conversations. 

After a while we decided to have a picnic in the park. We were walking around sharing stories and playing games, and all of a sudden I said something that made us both burst into howls of laughter. It was the most bizarre thing, but we just couldn't stop laughing for what felt like forever. 

Every time one of us would even think about that joke we would start laughing again. To this day, whenever we are together, all I have to do is mention that joke and we will start laughing like we did that day. 

It's those moments that make our friendship so special, and I'm so glad that laughter was there to bring us even closer.
