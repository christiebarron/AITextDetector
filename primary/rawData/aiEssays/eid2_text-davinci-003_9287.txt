Censorship in libraries is an important topic for contemporary society. About one hundred years ago, the United States established the freedom of speech clause in our constitution to ensure that our citizens would be able to access a variety of materials without fear of censorship. It is this freedom of thought that has allowed our society to progress and innovate, and it is important that we keep it alive and well. 

Removing books, music, movies, and magazines from shelves based on subject matter is a form of censorship that is regressive and harms our greater society. It suppresses the freedom of expression regardless of how offensive the content may be. Libraries should be an open, safe, and inclusive space of learning and exploration for everyone. Censorship in this setting further entrenches some of our society’s deeper divisions by painting certain materials as forbidden. 

What is also crucial to note is that censorship directly affects our ability to learn and appreciate the world around us. Books, music, movies and magazines provide us with valuable insights about ourselves, our society, and our human experience. One of the best ways to better understand others’ beliefs is through art. Censoring certain materials gives us less insight into multiple points of view, discouraging inclusivity. 

Therefore, libraries should act as a source of education and exploration instead of acting as an institution that allows certain materials to be censored. Readers should be able to explore diverse ideas and topics without fear of censorship
