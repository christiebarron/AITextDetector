The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it is the first book to tackle the root cause of the plague: globalization. These books are all about how globalization has turned over a huge chunk of the world's production to China since the Industrial Revolution. I personally like this book much better than the next three or four, as my daughter is a big girl and I got to hear her story and feel her pain. I love this story more than any of my other books.

We are living in a society where many children are out of control. The problem of obesity has become a thing of the past because of the epidemic that is the Internet. Over the last few years, many thousands of American children grew up in families with very low incomes, and only a few are obese. So, why aren't we raising all Americans on the same level of income or even more so? It is probably due to people living in poverty, many of which are elderly (and they are often single mother) and many of these kids have no access to health care, so they end up on the streets for hours. I think my kids do the best in life. The only way to change that is to start over, but I do think the way we are going to change this country is to change it slowly, or even when it is only a year or two. That would be a great thing to see out of this book, to see how things happen for young children
