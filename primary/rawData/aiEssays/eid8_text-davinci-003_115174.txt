As I sat in the train station, my friend and I prepared to go our separate ways—he to college and me to a part-time job. Before we parted, I had one last request: I asked him to tell me a joke. He quickly obliged, and within seconds, I was in stitches. His joke was so hilariously absurd that I was laughing until I had tears running down my cheeks. 

We both laughed together and for a brief moment, that laughter bridged the physical distance between us. Even though I knew it was temporary, it still helped alleviate the combination of excitement, nervousness, and sadness that I was feeling about having to part ways with my friend. In that moment, nothing mattered more than the connection that we shared and the shared laughter that flowed freely between us. 

Although I can't remember the joke now, I'll never forget the feeling that it gave me—warmth, comfort, and joy. Laughter can truly be a powerful force, and I'm glad that my friend and I were able to share that special moment together.
