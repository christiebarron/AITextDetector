The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, they had to create an actual roof which would extend an inch. Second, the concrete used to build the building was quite thin. The architects, however, designed a building to hold up. So instead of giving up the idea of using aluminum to build its exterior, the engineers took out the thin structure. Since the curved side was easier to get in than the curvature, aluminum was used for this building in addition to aluminum roofs. This added to the strength of these structures. In the end, they turned them into the Empire State Building (Easter Egg) and then the U.S. Capitol Building. They have also constructed several more, each having been built more than one hundred years before the Great Depression. All of which was a major milestone in the transformation of the Empire State Building, an enormous project that helped to create millions of jobs. As you can see in the diagram below, the two towers were constructed to be approximately 11 feet (2 meters) in length -- a feat that they won't achieve when they are completed by the late 1920s. The Empire State Building, like the American Empire State Building on the other side, isn't only designed to withstand a powerful beam of energy, it also has a protective structure -- a glass ceiling, which will protect against the rising waves.
