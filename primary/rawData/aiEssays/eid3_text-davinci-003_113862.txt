In Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead,” the cyclist’s difficulties with the terrain are highlighted and brought to life through the description of the setting. The hilly, rough roads provide the greatest challenge for the cyclist, and these features of the setting significantly impact not only the cyclist’s physical performance, but also his emotional state. 

The cyclist’s grueling journey is clearly hampered by the steep hills and relentless curves. This difficulty is, in part, psychologically exhausting for him. He is mentally disheartened by these obstacles, describing himself as “humbled” and “miniscule” as he fights his way up the steep hill, making no progress. This discouraging response to the hills only further exhausts him, since he must mount the hills that take up so much of his energy and time.

The features of the setting also increase the cyclist’s physical fatigue and pain. He feels the strain in his arms, legs, and lungs as he navigates the steep roads, and the unending curves force him to pay close attention as he bicycles. The strain of this concentration wears him down, as does the physical pain of struggling up and down the innumerable hills. 

The psychological and physical toll taken on the cyclist by the setting outlined in the story is clear: the cyclist is exhausted, both mentally and physically, by the rigors of the mountainous terrain
