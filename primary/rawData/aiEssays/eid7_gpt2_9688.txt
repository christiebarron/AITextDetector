An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my father, I had to run a whole field from his head to his back and he would not stand for a time. It was only when we started talking about his health and why he got sick did he start to make some suggestions. I think what you need to understand is I don't remember a single moment, but it was the first time that I had thought about his health. He didn't think much about it during that time because he knew so much about his illness."

The time he spoke with a therapist, was at the age of 40 when he first noticed his condition.

Samantha Daley, MSc, is currently writing a book about this process for the online Learning Workshops group.

"It's not quite a diagnosis; I think it's just an illness. I've always been the patient and I just have to accept I had this illness and do what needs Spinosan treatment.

"When I talked to a team psychologist recently, they seemed a little frustrated because for some reason, we were not even trying to know the exact diagnosis of this patient. There was no way he would be able to be conscious enough to tell us his body was not functioning properly and there probably were a variety of reasons. That can be hard for some people. You have to try and find a way through it."
