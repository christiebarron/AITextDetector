The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho is meant to provide a resolution and return to the themes of hope and resilience that are present throughout the poem. The speaker is acknowledging the challenges of the winter season, but is looking forward to a time in the future when adverse conditions will not be so overwhelming, and when they will be better prepared to take the test again. The imagery of the hibiscus buds blooming, and the geese coming back, provides a sense of renewal, and reminds us of the promise of the natural world.
