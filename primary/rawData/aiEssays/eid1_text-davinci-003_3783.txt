Dear Editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. It is clear that technology has made many aspects of our lives easier, allowing us to work faster, more efficiently and store more data. It is also true that computers have become an integral part of our society, connecting us to the world around us and providing us with unprecedented access to knowledge. 

However, with the overwhelming amount of time we spend interacting with computers, I believe it is important to be aware of the ways our use of them can be detrimental. Many studies suggest that spending too much time on a computer may have an adverse effect on our physical and mental health, causing fatigue, impairing social skills, and even providing an opening for various cyber threats. 

In my opinion, computers are valuable tools, but it is essential to use them in moderation. We should take regular breaks from our screens, practice good device hygiene, and be mindful of potential distractions and hazards associated with our connected devices. For those living with children, it is especially important to ensure they have adequate access to physical activities and opportunities for healthy interactions with other people.

The potential harms associated with too much exposure to computers should not be understated. I believe that only through responsible use of computers can we ensure that they remain beneficial to all of us.

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
