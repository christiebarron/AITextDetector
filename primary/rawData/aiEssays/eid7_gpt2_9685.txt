An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the time David B. Buss, a young New Yorker, who went to see a doctor for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. He felt good and loved what he was doing. We had both been shot, but that was the first time I heard the bullet wound that he had.


How were some of your other treatments for the disease?


We got it under control after one of my patients died from a shot fired from his gun and I was trying to prevent it from hitting me. In the end, all we had to do was to make a mental emergency. In those three years, though, I saw him on an airplane, taking pictures and a few other things. He told us he was glad we had that wound and that it needed to be surgically repaired. Since the surgery seemed to heal about as well I found a lot of love for that patient. We had seen each other through it with ease.


So how important is your relationship with the patient and if so, what are you doing now? Is that because of what you see in the video or are you merely getting ready for it?


I don't think so. I've been out of the hospital a lot, but you always hear people say, "We're just doing what we can just on our own, not having to deal with that part of life." I do, although I still have a lot of things going
