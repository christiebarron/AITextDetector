Computers have many effects on people.

They help children understand what works well and what doesn't. They make their own choices. And they allow and encourage choices in the community. They provide a learning environment for those at risk and are part of a movement against social change.

The problem is that most of these technologies are not yet ready. But there's no way forward until they are ready, and that means not just for the next three decades, but for our social and political lives in a lot of ways too.

There's something about the way computer games are played that puts such a profound responsibility on the makers themselves to ensure that children can see what happens when they play. And that's why we're working on the "new internet".

So that's what I'm working on right now. We haven't found the ideal technology for making games so we need to know what games might be useful for children. So we need to decide whether to turn that into what's called "computer literacy training" or "how to actually get this done". We also need to learn some of the principles behind its use. There are great resources out there that might help kids get past the "digital age".

Let's see – to me – how can game literacy in a few short years help them understand new concepts and to think clearly in ways that don't involve what you didn't know:

Why game literacy matters

It's a hugely important
