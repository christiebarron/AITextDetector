The construction of the iconic Empire State Building was a major engineering feat. The building was a massive feat of architecture with a 103 stories and 1,250 feet high structure, towering above the New York City skyline. The legend is that the Empire State Building was built overnight. In reality, it took over a year to build this record-breaking skyscraper. One of the original features of the building was the dock for dirigible airships, or dirigibles, to securely moor to the upper reaches of the Empire State Building. 

The plan to make the Empire State Building docking-ready for dirigibles began prior to construction. The mooring mast designed to serve as a landing point atop the building was an enormous nickel-plated steel tower, rising over 300 feet. The process of installing this mast was laborious. Workers had to build a metal and concrete platform on the roof of the 84th floor and surround it with a steel plate. The mooring mast was then broken down into a few smaller parts, transported to the top of the skyscraper, and bolted back together. 

Once the platform and mast were built, engineers faced a series of safety and design challenges. They had to ensure the mooring mast could withstand the gusts of wind coming from the skyscraper and take the strain of the airship without breaking. Additionally, the presence of other neighboring tall buildings made it difficult to estimate the wind speeds that the moor
