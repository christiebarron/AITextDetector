The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. (The Empire State, in that the towers had been built before the city of Tarkovsky)

When the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) began flying unmanned aircraft to airports in 1973 and 1974, they were quickly given a push in designing their technology so that they could be more easily used. Although they were soon becoming something of an irritant to the FAA as the government could not track their movements, the DOT continued to make sure the drones didn't enter the system.

So, when the FAA began requiring that dirigibles have a self-contained electrical system, it was no surprise that NASA's Falcon 9, designed to fly over the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), failed that test. Boeing then began flying unmanned helicopters near the Kennedy F-35, a government fighter jet.

For their part, the FAA has now made sure the D-25, which is scheduled to debut in 2013, is flown by unmanned aircraft.

But while the government of Texas has allowed unmanned aircraft to dock at the airport, it has not kept it up. The Pentagon only has a one-month waiting period to test the system at this time.

It's currently unclear which types of drones are under development and in which configuration, but if their use is banned, it would be a violation of a federal law known as the
