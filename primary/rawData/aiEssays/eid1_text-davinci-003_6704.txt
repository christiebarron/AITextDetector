Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion about computers and the impact they have on people. It is clear that computers have completely transformed our lives, and continue to do so every day.

On the one hand, computers have taken away some of the manual labor we used to be required to do. This allows us to save time and be more efficient. As well, computers have made it easier to communicate with others around the world, providing us with multiple ways to communicate and collaborate on projects.

On the other hand, computers can also be detrimental to our health and wellbeing. Studies have consistently shown that long hours of computer usage can lead to eyestrain, neck pain, and even sleep disturbances. More than that, spending too much time sitting in front of a screen can also lead to mental issues such as depression and anxiety.

In my opinion, computers can be a great boon for productivity and communication, but they must be used responsibly. It is essential that people take breaks from the screen and engage in physical activities. Furthermore, people should try to limit their time on the computer to a healthy amount to ensure that they are not negatively affected by it.

I hope that my opinion has been clear and I ask that you share this message with your readers.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
