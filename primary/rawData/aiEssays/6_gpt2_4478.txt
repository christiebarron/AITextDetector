The airship, which took just a couple of hours, was able to dock and dock its way through the Empire State Building and into the State Building. While the airship and the Air Force airfield were part of the main structure of the building, it was also the most complex element in the construction of the World War One buildings. The Empire State Building had a total of five towers; the building's other three towers were under three floors of the Empire State building, and two were over 3,000 square feet.

One of the biggest problems for construction of the World War One building was the lack of a structure for the twin twin-engine aircraft carriers. Originally planned to be part of the Empire State Building before being converted into the Air Force's Air Combat Control Center, the aircraft carriers were simply
