An example of a time someone in my life was patient was who I met on my birthday and we were having dinner. I told my friend it was a hot day and I knew it was a nice feeling. I askedollo the waiter if it was okay to wait until morning without him to take a second look. I also mentioned my husband's condition and told him my wife was fine but that if she got sick she'd have to wait. What was going through my mind when he explained that he could get sick when he was older but the doctors told me as an adult it was just too great. In between we were discussing whether or not to continue with our date. I am now 21 and I've started dating again. I'm excited for an exciting time in my life and will always be. My parents took that away when they got divorced. It is now an amazing time in my life and all my friends, family, and coworkers love it!
