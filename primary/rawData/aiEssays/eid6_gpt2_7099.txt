The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One obstacle was that the crane was too sensitive to the vibration of the motor shaft caused by the vibration of the motor drive. Another obstacle was that the mechanical parts of the machine were less prone to vibration.

In the process of designing an engine, builders had to design a power converter and engine, and they also had to figure out how to deal with the fact that the speed that the engine produces is very fast, even with a small amount of torque from the engine. It was then that designers tried to minimize the loss of power by providing higher exhaust, better fuel supply, and the engine and power converter were connected more readily to each other, making it possible for them to be very similar. In the end, that meant different parts of the machine were connected to each other by a large and complicated connection, because of mechanical parts being extremely low in length while being able to drive the machine up to a higher power output (typically 500 hp) and then deliver it to the machine at a much lower power.

All at once, it is important to remember, building engines, having them go up against some more than one speed is not good, the machine goes faster in its own right, or is a bit too slow, or it is a bit too slow to work and the engine starts out too fast, or it is a bit too slow to run and a little too slow to power
