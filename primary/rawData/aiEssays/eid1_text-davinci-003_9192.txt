Dear Editor,

As technology continues to advance, many people are relying on computers more and more each day. While this technology has certainly made life easier, it has also brought about a few negative changes in how people interact with each other and in how they work.

First, computers have changed the way people interact with each other. Social media, for example, has opened up new ways to communicate, but it has also led to people spending a lot of time on their computers instead of interacting with each other in person. This may lead to social isolation and cause people to become even more distant from one another.

Second, computers have changed the way people work. People are able to accomplish more in less time, but this has created an expectation that people are always available and expected to respond quickly to emails, texts, and other forms of communication. This can lead to increased stress levels, and ultimately, decreased productivity.

Therefore, I believe that, while computers offer numerous benefits, they can also have some negative effects on people if they are not used responsibly. I encourage everyone to consider the potential effects computers can have on their lives and take the necessary measures to ensure they are using this technology in the most beneficial way.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
