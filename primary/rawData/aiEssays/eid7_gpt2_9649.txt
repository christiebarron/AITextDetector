An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a patient of mine for 4 weeks in 2005, which he didn't quite understand, and he was being moved to a better spot, to see his mother. He felt he was in a better place and could feel the change. Then he saw the doctor he knew, and he gave it his all. He was diagnosed with a degenerative disease (ADS) and put on IVS to make sure it wasn't affecting his life. Unfortunately this medication was a nightmare that he had to face for a million years. If he needed therapy for his ADS diagnosis, it should have been for treatment for his symptoms of a disease, rather than for his ADS.

To date, I'm not 100% certain I've ever experienced what I had and don't, or will ever experience what I have. For my part, I am confident that I will do what I feel is right for some. When I try to come to terms with this, my mind won't return to being the same as when it was first conceived, if even a fraction to the degree it should is that I cannot come to terms with it. This is no exception. But there is something missing. Not the mental healing I had hoped for but the mental illness that had once taken hold of me as well as my brother. At least, that was the experience that was coming through my face.

With no help at all for years afterward
