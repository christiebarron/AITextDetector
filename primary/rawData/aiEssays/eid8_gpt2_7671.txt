One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I watched a man masturbate. He looked over my shoulder and smiled, and I smiled too.

The idea of this guy masturbating in front of a mirror comes as a surprise to me. While I haven't really found anything to express his feelings, I've noticed something a bit different. I'm quite proud of him for that moment.

Why we don't have any porn or sex in the past.

Because it's not about sex nor sex (that's what is actually the goal).

I just want it to be. I'd be totally fine if porn was not about sex or sex (I don't mean that it's a bad thing). I would not recommend porn and sex in the future. While it has its own advantages, it still lacks a lot of positive qualities.

It will probably seem like a waste of time to say, "I want to watch porn." So many people think that porn is a waste because it's difficult to watch porn and it's hard to get that right. It's because many porn stars (and more than once) watch porn and are very into it.
