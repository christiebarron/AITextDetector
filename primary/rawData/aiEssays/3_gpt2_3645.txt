Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. The one I mentioned is that on certain sections (such as the outer corner and the inner bend for some cyclists) the riding can feel flat during prolonged touring. Similarly, 'Golfers Out' in 'Greater Brighton' can feel flat during long rides in most conditions, although in some cases a 'truck' is involved.

I believe that the "Rough Road Ahead" setting applies to a large part of the UK, with some drivers looking into switching from the setting 'Good roads' to the cycling 'Rough Road ahead' setting. The driving behaviour is much 'the same' as for most bike trips from the 'Good roads' setting. But this could take some time. So if the driving of a car is too much and you want to switch to the 'Good roads' setting, it might be wise to just not use the 'Rough Road Ahead' setting.

In the following sections of the paper I am assuming that you have a wide range of bikes in which to cycle, depending on your situation. If you're not
