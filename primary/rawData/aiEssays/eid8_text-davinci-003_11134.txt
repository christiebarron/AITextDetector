I remember it like it was yesterday. 

I had just finished my first day at work and was feeling a bit overwhelmed. I was in a new job, a new city, and surrounded by all these new faces. I had no idea how to make friends or connect with my new coworkers. 

I remember it was the end of the day and a few of us were sitting around the office talking. Everyone was talking about the ups and downs of the day and swapping stories. Suddenly, one of the guys said something that made everyone burst out laughing. 

I was the only one not laughing. I was so confused and started to feel really out of place in the room. I must have had a funny expression on my face because the guy who made the joke stopped suddenly and said, "Hey, don't worry! We all just need to laugh about something silly. Come on, laugh with us. It's fun!"

It took a minute for me to realize it was okay to laugh, but I eventually joined in. Everyone got their laughter out and then the conversation continued, but this time I felt included. It made me realize that laughter is an essential connecting factor between people. It can reduce stress, create a feeling of unity, and just cheer everyone up. 

That one moment of laughter with my new co-workers established a connection that I remember to this day.
