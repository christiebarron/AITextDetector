Dear Editor, 

It is clear that computers have become an essential part of our lives. Many people now rely on them for work and entertainment, as well as communication. However, I would argue that the effects computers have on people can be both positive and negative.

On the positive side, computers make it possible for us to become more productive and efficient. They allow us to store and organize vast amounts of information quickly, and distribute it electronically. This makes it easier to collaborate with others and access information whenever necessary. Furthermore, computers also provide a welcome distraction from our real-world stressors as they offer a virtual escape. 

On the other hand, an excess of computer use can have lasting, harmful consequences. Too much screen time can lead to anxiety, depression, and physical health problems. It can create a sedentary lifestyle, which increases the risk of obesity and diabetes. Furthermore, it can cause computer addiction and other psychological disorders. 

Overall, computers provide great opportunities but should be used in moderation. We must balance the time we spend on computers and enjoy our real-world activities. Please be aware of the potential risks computers can entail and think twice before you spend too much time online.
