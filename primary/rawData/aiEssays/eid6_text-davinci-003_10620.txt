When the Empire State Building was built in 1931 in New York City, New York, it became the tallest building in the world and was considered a masterpiece of futuristic engineering and architecture. As such, one of the features the designers had in mind for the building was that it could serve as a mooring mast for dirigibles, or airships, which were large hot-air balloons filled with the gas hydrogen and powered by propellers. This concept was revolutionary at the time and, if successful, it would provide an entirely new form of transportation to the citizens of New York City. Unfortunately, the path to integration of the mooring mast was filled with obstacles which presented a difficult challenge for the designers to overcome. 

The designers and engineers of the Empire State Building first needed to properly design and construct the mooring mast in order to be able to support the heavy weight of the airships as they were landing and docking. The mast had to be outfitted with reinforced steel cables, strengthened rivets, and huge mooring hooks. As Marcia Amidon Lüsted writes in ‘The Mooring Mast’, "the airships we were expecting were over twice as long and 3-4 times heavier than commercial airliners of today". This made the task of building a mooring mast capable of supporting the airships much more difficult. On top of that, the mast also had to be built in such a way that it could safely
