I remember a few years ago I was graduating from college and was nervously waiting to see if I had passed all my exams. I had worked so hard and put in many long hours of studying and revising, so I was eager to know the results. As the weeks passed I grew more and more anxious about getting the results. 

However, despite feeling incredibly impatient, I knew that I had to remain patient. I tried to keep my mind busy and distracted, but as the days went on I found my anxiety growing more and more. 

But eventually, the day I had been waiting for arrived. I nervously opened my email and my heart leapt as I saw the words ‘You have passed all your exams’ appear on the screen. I was over the moon but even so, I was pleased at how patient I had been in the lead up to the results.
