I remember when I went out to lunch with my best friend last week - we hadn't seen each other in months. We had been spending far too much time apart lately, and so we went out for a bite to eat. 

We couldn't help but catch up about the most ridiculous things - like the time I almost got hit by a bus. I know it's not particularly funny, but by the time I got to the end of the story we were both in tears because we were laughing so hard. That sort of thing always happens when we get together - her laughter is like a contagious uproar her and it always sets the tone the moment we meet up. 

After we calmed down from that fit, we decided to move on to happier tidbits. We talked about current events - the pandemic, the upcoming election - and we both shared funny stories about the things we had been through since the last time we'd seen each other. 

The more we laughed, the more stories we told - and the day flew by. We didn't want to leave each other at all, so we decided that the least we could do would be to stop for ice cream on the way home. And of course, the laughter followed us! 

We left with full stomachs, huge smiles, and the promise to get together soon - and I'm genuinely grateful for the time we spend together. That shared laughter makes the bond between us unbreak
