I was recently in line at the grocery store when I noticed that the person in front of me had as many items as the store's policy allowed without having to separate some of them into a second transaction. The cashier informed the customer that he needed to either remove some items or open a second line. 

Rather than getting angry like I expected, the customer simply said "oh okay, no worries" and began going through his bags to remove some of the items. He apologized to the cashier for the inconvenience, and the cashier thanked him for being so understanding. 

I was thoroughly impressed with his politeness. He didn't raise his voice or act irritated, despite the fact that he was in a hurry and had expected a faster checkout. His patience and equanimity made the wait in line a lot less stressful for me.
