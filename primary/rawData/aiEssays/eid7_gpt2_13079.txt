An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a girl I married during the war. And she was married then and she started taking steroids as a way of taking some painkillers. She used to say that she went from being a warrior to a woman who did drugs and never got sick. The doctor said, 'Wait a minute, aren't this my wife? Did she get so sick and then start taking those drugs that I went from this point in life to this point in life again?' She said, 'Yes, but my husband and I never got sick. And we never got even a little pain and yet we all keep using those things. I don't use drugs until I'm sick.'

"A day later, she started making those drugs again."

And then it got even more horrifying.

"She started getting high again and was coming back. She knew she was not going to get this drug. It was still on her blood. She could not even get high again. She said, 'This is what it does to me, what it feels like when I'm sick. My body feels like it's running late at night, like it's going to end and all the little things that go along with it. I can't feel well. They can't tell me where it is. It can't tell me where it's going to go. Can't remember how long it's lasted and can't remember where it has gone."
