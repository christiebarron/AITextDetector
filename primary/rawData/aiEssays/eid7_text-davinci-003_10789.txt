I recall a time when I was waiting in line at the grocery store and the line was moving very slowly. It was extremely frustrating, and I had to be somewhere soon. I felt like I wanted to get angry and complain to the person in front of me or the cashier about how slow it was going. 

In that moment, I told myself to remain patient. I took a few deep breaths and looked around the store. I tried to occupy my mind with other thoughts and stay calm. Eventually, the line started to move a bit faster and I was able to get through it without getting frustrated. 

I'm proud of myself for maintaining my composure and staying patient. It was a difficult moment, but in the end, I was glad I was able to handle it without creating a fuss.
