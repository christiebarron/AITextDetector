Dear Editor,

In today’s world, the effects of computers and the Internet can be seen everywhere. It’s a part of our everyday lives and has had vast impacts on how we do our jobs, communicate, and even those who are less tech-savvy among us, who rely on them for access to information.

While the positives may be seen in many of the advances technology has made, what can be less clear is the potential for negative impact. We already know that too much time spent in front of a computer or engaging in online activities can lead to physical ailments, including insomnia, vision issues, carpal tunnel syndrome, and more. But there are less-obvious effects of computer use, too, as studies have shown that spending hours in front of a computer can lead to stress, depression, and even loneliness.

We need to understand and acknowledge these realities and adjust our behavior accordingly. Technology can be an incredibly useful tool, but like anything, it should be enjoyed in moderation and with mindful attention given to its potential effects. It’s up to all of us to be aware of our own physical and mental wellbeing and to be mindful of how our behavior might be impacted
