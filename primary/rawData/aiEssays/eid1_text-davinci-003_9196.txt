Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my opinion on the effects that computers have on people. I believe that computers have had a large, positive impact on people.

First, computers have made our lives more convenient. We can easily access information, entertainment, and services online with just a few clicks. This makes our lives easier in that we have access to the resources we need whenever we need them. Computers have also made communication easier. We can easily message, connect, and collaborate with others from around the world.

Second, computers have made working from home more feasible. This has allowed people to work from anywhere, at any time, and with greater flexibility. This is particularly beneficial for those with disabilities or those who are unable to work in a traditional office setting. Thanks to the internet, those with health issues can still remain productive and do their jobs remotely.

Third, computers have made it easier for businesses to become successful. Businesses can establish themselves online to reap the benefits of the global market almost instantly. Thatâ€™s why online businesses are quickly becoming the most successful businesses today.

Finally, computers have made research more accessible. Today, most people have access to more information than ever before. This makes us more knowledgeable about a variety of topics than we would be otherwise.

In conclusion, I believe that computers have had a significant and positive effect on people. We have access to more resources and more information than ever before
