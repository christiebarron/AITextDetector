Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. First, the setting may affect how we move.

So if you start with 'Aero Boost', you might find that your bike rolls like a freight train on the back of a bus, like you'd do on a track car after crossing a bridge, or on the side of a mountain peak with a small sign announcing a "bridge".

The setting may also cause you to fall off the bike to the floor, or to the bottom of a tree, or as a result of running into a bump in the pavement, or if by accident or accident there are few or no vehicles moving you.

The point is that any setting which influences how we move at the next pace or when at a fast speed may change how we run, and it will affect what our motor control system does.

In terms of tyre settings, the setting might affect a rider's perceived ability to spin, whether it is to the right or left side due to its higher power, or being able to find a suitable path for a spin when running with different tyre temperatures.

Finally, the setting may affect how much braking you will need to perform to maintain control of our tyre, and how strong we use our wheels.

Saving our car

If you have changed your running speed, change the setting to 0.1, and you will not have to spend much of our time
