The narrator of Winter Hibiscus, Minfong Ho, chose to end the narrative with this sentence because the phrase gives a sense of renewal to the story. The narrator is reflecting on a difficult decision she made to leave her homeland in order to pursue a college education in the United States. The statement at the conclusion gives hope and serves as a reminder that life will continue in her homeland despite her journey and that she will eventually take the test she was forced to postpone due to her relocation.
