To the Editor, 

As someone who has been living in the computer age for decades, I have seen the incredible effects of computers on people. Nowadays, computers are at the heart of almost every aspect of our lives, from educational and business applications to communication and recreation.

I firmly believe that computer technology has proven itself to be a major source of convenience and quality in people's lives. With relevant software, a computer user can perform almost virtually any task with great speed and accuracy. Plus, computers offer countless amounts of information that would take days, if not weeks, to gather by other means. 

Although computers have given us immense productivity, they have also had a negative effect. For instance, many of us are so reliant on computers that we can no longer perform certain tasks without them. And some fear that our growing reliance on computers could soon lead to a world where we are always online and can no longer enjoy genuine face-to-face social experiences. 

While computers might have some minor downsides, such as eyestrain due to the continuous use of computer screens, on the whole, I believe that the benefits of computers far outweigh the drawbacks. Computers are an indispensable part of our lives, connecting us to the outside world and making life much easier and more efficient.

I hope this letter has convinced your readers to recognize the positive impact computers have had on our lives.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
