Computers have many effects on people. One thing to remember is that human interaction changes a whole range of things so when they're interacting with each other. One of the biggest changes is probably how they interact with each other. So we're still really into that connection – they're still so much more human than we think. That's probably one of the key points from the research [of the year 2014] is that we're thinking outside the box. People need to understand that we're connected; that we can interact with each other. As soon as you learn how to use technology, your interactions change. That's where you start to understand that connection between man and machine (in-situ interaction). And so that interaction can be more organic and richer because machines are being built with these technology and their algorithms rather than just being a collection of information.

Q: This has been pretty important to us – from the end of the day, do you see the evolution of machines taking over as part of human nature?

There is no way to be sure yet. We're just beginning to understand how that will evolve. If it remains an open question, weickle things get more out of each other. The more that the public places limits, the less we have control over how the machines do things. We Auntie Pie tells us that the more information you have, the more control we have over all of this. At the end of the day, this is really about how
