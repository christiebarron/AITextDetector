Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. Rowing the pavement on a tight left will lower the road speed. If we do this we risk putting many cyclists in the wrong backcountry of the 'Rough Road Ahead' cycleway. Rowing the pavement (often not properly raised) can also give a more rounded, narrower road. Using some kind of raised left lane we may get several hundred metres more freedom over the wrong backcountry of the bike-shaped junction. Rowing is also a key factor to reduce cyclist fatalities and injuries on rough road crossings. If you use bike lanes and raised left lanes on the road, you will save on the weight in the road: the more it costs the more you pay to make you climb up those two small hills and make the right turn onto the road. So if you go with just a raised left on the road it doesn't really reduce the risk of cyclists getting killed - if you climb up those hills, you will save a pretty penny - and of course you will save a lot on the costs of getting to it. If you want to become a better cyclist, riding for more than four kilometres a day seems better than cycling in 'Rough Road Ahead'.

Some cyclists prefer to not use raised left. If you find it useful you can send them a message on the 'How to Rider' Facebook page.
