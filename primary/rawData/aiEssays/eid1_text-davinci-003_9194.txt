Dear editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the powerful effects that computers have had on the lives of people today. As the world rapidly advances in technology, computers have become an integrated part of daily life. 

At work, computers have greatly increased efficiency by employing automated functions to take care of repetitive tasks, allowing people to focus on more important and creative elements of their job. Increased performance and accuracy have scaled the direction that businesses are heading, giving them the opportunity to succeed in many ways that were not possible in the past. 

In the home, computers have become an impersonal yet invaluable asset. Children are being educated much sooner than ever before and are exposed to a wide variety of new tools and services. Adults can shop online, network with family and friends, and learn about the world in peace from their own homes. Computers have opened a gateway to a variety of services that can be accesses with a few clicks of the mouse. 

Overall, computers' effects are positive and extremely valuable to society. It is now easier for individuals to find jobs, complete educational goals, and explore different corners of the globe. I believe that these advances are mainly advantageous and I urge the readers of this letter to agree with this opinion. 

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
