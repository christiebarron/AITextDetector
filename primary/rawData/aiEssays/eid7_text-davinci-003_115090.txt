I recently had an experience with patience that I won't soon forget.

I was shopping for clothes at the mall with my wife and daughter when all of the sudden, my daughter streaked away from us down the aisle. Even though she had only just learned to walk, she was surprisingly agile. We started calling after her but she couldn't hear us, and she began to cry from all the unknown faces and bustling noise around her.

Given the situation, I was absolutely frantic. My wife and I were running in opposite directions in an effort to catch her, and all of the sudden I was alone in my pursuit. Everyone around us was simply standing and staring â€“ no one was willing to lend a helping hand.

That's when I melted. I took a deep breath and asked the people around me if they had seen my daughter, carefully controlling my tone so it remained friendly instead of panicked. Miraculously, a kind soul answered that she had seen my daughter and pointed me her direction.

I slowly made my way towards my daughter, calming her down with our familiar voices before I scooped her up in my arms. The onlookers who had just been staring suddenly came to life, congratulating me on my patience and understanding of the situation. I was relieved to have my daughter back, very thankful that I had been able to remain calm and patient.
