The Empire State Building was the tallest building in the world when it was completed in 1931, and the idea of dirigibles docking there seemed like something straight out of a science fiction story. But thanks to a balanced combination of daring and dream-chasing, this seemingly impossible feat was accomplished. The story of how it was done is one of hard work and creative solutions, with numerous obstacles having to be overcome along the way.

The most obvious challenge facing builders of the Empire State Building was the building's height. At 1,250 feet, the building was well within the operational limits of the then-largest rigid airships, but engineers had to factor in the complexity of connecting the Empire State Building with the ship. For example, buildings of this height had to be modified to be structurally sound and the mooring mast could not be too highâ€”it had to allow the dirigibles to reach the ship and dock and travel safely.

In order to create the mooring mast, immense steel cables were suspended from the roof of the Empire State Building. The cables were designed to extend to the stern of the ship, which would rest on top of the mast, and provide a secure docking point for the ship. However, even with the use of these special steel cables, the ship and building had to be aligned precisely to ensure a safe and secure connection. 

The engineers also had to construct an interior air-lock to protect the building from
