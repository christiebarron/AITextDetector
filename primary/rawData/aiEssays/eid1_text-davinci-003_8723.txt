I recently reconnected with my old college roommate over coffee. It had been 6 years since we'd seen each other, and the conversation was a bit awkward. We caught up on the past few years, like our new jobs and our families, but it all felt a bit too serious.

Just when I thought the conversation had run its course, we both started talking about a wild night we once had in college. We were both laughing uncontrollably as we reminisced about it, and it was so freeing. Suddenly, a wave of nostalgia took over, and it felt like no time had passed at all. We dove head first into more stories and shared more laughs until we both had tears streaming down our faces.

It was refreshing to find the connection again between us, and it all hinged on that one moment of laughter. I'm now looking forward to finding more moments of laughter with my old friend and cherishing our relationship.
