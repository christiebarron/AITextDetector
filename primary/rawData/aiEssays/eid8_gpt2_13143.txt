One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I asked you as a child about how you saw your face in the world. Then one day a little girl told you that you see my face when you are a child. Then just that one day I saw it. So I decided to try and make it. And I did. And now I know who you are. I know you love me and love me forever. You know how happy I am. You are the biggest smile in the world and I'm thrilled you are making this happen for me. Just do it in the next week.

Thank you Mr. Carson. Good luck to you and the world.
