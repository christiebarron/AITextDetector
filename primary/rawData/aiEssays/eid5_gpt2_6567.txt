The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' has turned to anger.

In the book, she says she was confronted by a series of incidents on her private or private property. When she was being taken to hospital she allegedly broke out in tears following the fact that she had been hit three times in the head and that a nurse had ordered the man to take him back to her house.

Mrs Wilson, who died in January 2011, said: 'I thought I had caught a lot of crap and I thought I would never have to live. So I thought I was going to give up on that or that people would stop telling the truth about me.'

She added: 'I don't know if I'll ever come out with this, but something in that story is not Bashaw's fault. This would never have happened to his friends, to what he did, not how he did it and then to my friends and family.

'He knew these things and I knew. This story is so much about how he let down his family. I want people to hear something. We need to take action. I want people to hear what we have gone through.'
