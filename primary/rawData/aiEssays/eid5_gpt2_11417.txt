The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' has been so emotional that members of the congregation decided, "It might be useful to go and share your thoughts".

The author decided to leave with a little extra cheer after the incident, when she read about how she was approached by three people and being told that the priest would only know her age when they asked him to sign a confidentiality agreement which included her surname.

But she said she found her reaction "uncomfortably humiliating".

"The thought that people do not understand me before and after all, I had to go make a decision based on myself that would send a message of disapproval about my situation. "For me, the only time I felt I had a genuine way out was when I had gone to a church church and watched people pray together. "That's the only time I experienced a real impact," she said.

The priest made some remarks such of his own, claiming he was "very happy to see" the young woman who was so shocked but who was "fine with anything".

The couple had recently been in love together for over a year and she was also not happy with the fact the priest had to leave with a pre-emptive measure when they called the police.

She is sure that in order to get his attention, the priest would only see her "in her own way".
