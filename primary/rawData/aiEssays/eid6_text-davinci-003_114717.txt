The builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome a number of obstacles in order to make docking dirigibles possible. Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s article “The Mooring Mast” reveals the magnitude of the challenges they faced.

First, the Empire State Building was already nearly complete when the idea of accommodating dirigibles was hatched. This means that modifications needed to be made after the building’s frame was already up. Engineers had to fashion a suitable docking configuration to fit along the exterior of the building in Manhattan. Connecting an exterior platform of the building to the developing mooring mast became the main concern, and finally, a suitable solution was found. In addition, engineers had to figure out how to stabilise the enormous mast—and sturdiness was key of course since the mooring mast would be taking on the pressure from the airship while attached.

Second, the winds at the height of the Empire State Building had to be taken into consideration as they could potentially be strong enough to affect the airships adversely. To combat this, engineers designed the upper perimeter of the mooring mast so that it tapered inward, giving dirigibles more of a chance to avoid the wind when moored.

Finally, the weather around the Empire State Building presented its own set of challenges for designers. The freezing temperatures in the winter and potential snowstorms meant that the mooring mast would quickly freeze up
