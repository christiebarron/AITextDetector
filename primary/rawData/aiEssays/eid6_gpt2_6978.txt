The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first was cost, a major barrier which prevented them going with an unmodified, self-repairable and generally more technologically advanced "trunk plane." The second was technological, the most severe (or, to put it more accurately, the smallest) and most inconvenient, when used to mount a mounted vehicle in an apartment, or drive a passenger train to a destination.

On the eve of the 2009 Tampa Bay Lightning's first playoff game, the public was informed that a number of people wanted to have a replica of the building built out of real parts -- and the building was a great success. It's not likely that the builders would have been able to provide much in the way of publicity, or the public would have turned aside any pleas for assistance. (Funny thing is: The Lightning would eventually be able to put out a press statement in favor of the building, as did one of the writers from the Star Wars franchise. But no one said anything about it until after the news broke. A fan who had hoped that one of the buildings would be reused would not be invited to the game, even though it would have helped the team financially and would have become even more popular,
