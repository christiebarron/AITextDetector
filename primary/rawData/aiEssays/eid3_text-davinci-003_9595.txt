In Joe Kurmaski’s poem ‘Rough Road Ahead,’ the cyclist faces a winding and difficult path as he approaches a crossroads. The features of the setting as depicted in the poem have a major influence on the cyclist’s experience. 

The poem begins with a line that alludes to the cyclist feeling lost and alone: “He struck out on the lonely road.” The isolation of the cyclist is mirrored in the lonely and winding road that he is traveling. This serves to highlight the sense of vulnerability and disorientation – he isn’t sure what he will encounter on the road, and is struggling to meet the unknown challenges which lie ahead. 

The poem further emphasizes the difficulty of the road by describing its condition: “Uneven, rutted, rough and torn.” These words create a vivid image of a rough and tough terrain. This is heightening the pressure for the cyclist, as his journey is getting increasingly difficult. The road is providing a physical challenge which is pushing him to his limits. 

The setting of the poem is creating a sense of uneasiness for the cyclist. As he approaches the crossroads he is confronted with the fear of the unknown. The long and winding road can symbolize life, and the crossroads serve to represent turning points and difficult decisions.
