The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because of its emotional, psychological and spiritual core. Winter Hibiscus goes beyond the main character's character growth to include the main themes of a much larger complex political and social struggle, the development of different ideologies and the importance of the social system to the survival and reclamation of a nation's future. The novels can not only be enjoyed as engaging in such reading, but they are equally appropriate for those who enjoy short and long reading about war and a number of other topics.
