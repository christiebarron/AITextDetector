The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' was that the police had a tough time dealing with the rise of a radical new form of feminism; they saw it as a threat not only to the power of feminist thought and expression but to the independence of women's identities.

Militia and political class can work here; they have to work with women to defend their identities from the growing political pressures for power and for the security of their social spaces by supporting women.

When it comes to the rise in the number of women being killed per year by police that have been in their 20s or 50s - when all is said and done - they continue to struggle (and they are in the process of doing the most damage since the 1990s), but we can't change how that happened.

But there is no lack of evidence it was happening in the same way in the 20-somethings around the country, where there is a growing interest in a shift in cultural attitudes about female sexuality, with particular relevance to the police, which may affect people with their sexuality in general.

And this is to emphasise also, given that we have seen more and more women murder police than at any time since 1989 and the vast increase in rape and other violent assaults during that period - a question that is relevant for a recent surge in the number of women murdered in the UK. What is new are the responses to 'Stop Women and Killings' protests
