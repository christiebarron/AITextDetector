When I first started dating my fiance, I was really nervous. He was a great guy but I couldn't tell if he was really interested in me or not. On our fourth date I started to feel a bit more confident in our relationship, but I still wasn't sure if he could really accept me.

We went out to a nice dinner and I started to open up to him. That's when I noticed him trying to suppress a smile on his face. I asked him what was funny and he pointed to my shirt. I had got dressed in a rush before coming to meet him and I had somehow put the shirt on inside out. We both couldn't help but burst into laughter.

That was the moment I realized how comfortable we were with each other. Even if I had made such a silly mistake, we were still able to laugh and joke about it. I could tell from that moment on that we had a strong connection, and that we were both happy to be in each other's company.

Since then, laughter has become an essential part of our relationship. It has filled our moments together with joy and reminds us of the strong bond that we share.
