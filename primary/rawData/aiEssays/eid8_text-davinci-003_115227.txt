I recently reconnected with an old friend of mine after many years. I hadn't seen him since high school but, despite the time apart, it felt as though no time had passed at all. From the start, we were laughing and joking away like we had never been apart. 

It was one of those conversations that seemed to last forever. No matter what we talked about, we always ended back up laughing about something else. 

We reminisced about our school days, talking about all the silly things we got ourselves into. We had a fine time debating who instigated the wildest adventures and prank wars. 

After reminiscing for a while, we decided to take a break and go grab a bite to eat. As we were walking, I began to tell him a funny story about something that had happened to me recently. His laughter was infectious, and soon we both were in stitches by the time I finished. 

For the rest of the meal, we neither ate nor talked too much, instead just reveling in the moment and sharing occasional bursts of laughter. 

We eventually said good-bye and as I watched him walk away, I felt grateful for the bonding power of laughter. Who knew such a small thing would bridge such a large gap of time.
