The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' was inspired by its own history, and he describes that experience as "a very strong spiritual experience." There is at stake the belief that the story of his life, his father's, and the journey of his brothers and sisters – how he overcame the odds through courage, resilience, determination, and perseverance – are all vital elements in making his life a better one. This, for all his flaws, is Westbrook's "last big hit."

While he didn't lose his family, he suffered through a profound loss that left him so profoundly hurt by himself. It was a loss he felt a lot more acutely that year. He learned from his father: "That's how you die." And it was also the first time he felt he was alone for too long. He had learned not only from his mistakes, but how to heal them. His relationship with his father began to be forged and enriched. This is how he will continue to live.

There is no doubt that Westbrook feels as a pioneer of his field the same way he felt when he was playing for the Atlanta Hawks. He is a true, visionary, and inspirational leader – an individual who took his personal history into his own hands, which he did so eloquently, and made so inspiring. He is a true, visionary leader who made real things happen for us, which will be the lasting legacy of his family who will forever be linked to the Atlanta Dream
