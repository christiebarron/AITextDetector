The construction of the Empire State Building was a massive undertaking, and one of the most ambitious parts of the project was creating a docking facility for dirigibles. In the book The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, she details the various obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock. 

The first and biggest challenge was the location of the building, which was situated on a small piece of land in a very densely populated area. This meant that the builders would have a limited amount of space to work with and that the dirigible dock would have to be carefully designed so that it would not obstruct other structures in the vicinity. Additionally, the fact that the building was constructed on soil that had been reclaimed from the Hudson River meant that there were several layers of rock beneath the site that needed to be taken into account. 

The second obstacle to overcome was the structural strength of the building. The builders knew that the strain of docking a large dirigible would be considerable and could cause serious damage to the building if the structure wasn’t properly strengthened. To ensure that the dock was safe and strong, the builders had to reinforce the supports with steel beams and concrete reinforcement bars.

The third challenge was creating a reliable mooring system. Dirigibles have to be secured safely and securely when in docking, so the designers of the Empire State Building had to develop a system that would be able to safely
