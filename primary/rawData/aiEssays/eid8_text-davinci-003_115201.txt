My husband and I had been in an argument and weren’t speaking to each other when he came over to me and said, “I know I can make you laugh”. I rolled my eyes and said, “No, you can’t.” That’s when he proceeded to dance and sing as loud as he could and make a complete fool of himself. 

At first, I just stared in amazement, but soon enough I couldn’t help but laugh. I laughed so hard I started to cry. And then he joined in. We were both pretty much rolling on the floor laughing. 

That moment showed me just how powerful laughter can be in relationships. We were able to move past the argument with a few minutes of laughter that allowed us to reconnect and move forward. 

It still makes me smile when I think about it. That was the moment I knew our relationship would last forever.
