The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it was written by Arthur MacQuarrie in 1969. This was the year when the first "classic" book of the time was released and the book began its evolution when Macquarrie called it "just the best thing yet". So, what happened following that is completely a mystery. Now, I am not saying this book was about the life and death of Sir Edward Leigh, the hero, but that I think it is about some of the weird events occurring during the '68. If there is one book you would hate to have read for the duration of a decade and a half (this is a book that was only available to readers in 1967), that's that. So, why does this book need to exist in this world, this world? I don't want you to judge it by the fact that it's about that man who became a great writer for the first time and who went out to write that book. Yes he went to learn literature and all those things. And although this is, sadly, the last half of the last century, there has never been more talk about him as one of the best writers of the time, but I doubt it will ever be. The next time somebody tries to compare his works to that of The Lord of the Rings, I guarantee it'll be 'The Boy Who Lived in Scotland Is Legend'.
