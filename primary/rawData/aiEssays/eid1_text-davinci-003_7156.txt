In Joe Kurmaski's short story "Rough Road Ahead," the setting plays a large role in the cyclist's experience. The cyclist's journey takes place in an urban environment, full of obstacles he must contend with. The chaotic landscape of the city includes speeding cars, rough and potentially hazardous roads, and the ever-present noise.

The cyclist is constantly on the lookout for signs of danger: hazardous potholes, broken glass, and other road hazards. His awareness of his environment is heightened, and he must make quick decisions regarding what paths he takes. His cycling skills must be sharpened in order to handle the rigors of the rough road ahead.

The cyclist's surroundings also create mental and emotional challenges. The sound of the city, combined with the feeling of moving too quickly, the honking cars, and the bleak, concrete landscape can all be overwhelming for the cyclist. These elements can create a sense of anxiety and isolation, as he must constantly be aware of his environment in order to stay safe.

Overall, the setting of Kurmaski's story is crucial in creating the atmosphere and unique experience of the cyclist's journey. The challenging urban environment only adds to the tension and difficulty of the cyclist's predicament. The cyclist must constantly be aware of his surroundings and develop the skills and resilience to manage the obstacles he faces. The mental and emotional challenges created by the setting are equally as important as the physical ones.
