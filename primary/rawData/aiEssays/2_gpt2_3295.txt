I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a central and important problem in our democracy. It has been a long time since anyone paid attention to freedom of speech and grew up under surveillance. We are trying to bring people together to change this. What we are trying to do now is to use our collective intelligence and our ability to look at and document the facts of issues to help us do such a good job.

I believe that the government should step in and try to remove all material from public display. The United Kingdom government will act soon so there will be a proper check before the books are sold, the government should keep every single copy of a digital library book in private hands, and there should not be any censorship in libraries.

We want to ensure that the content made public is not simply one page long and that content from any digital library is safe from all misuse. All books are free to use for the community, even if they are not for use in the public domain. However, if anyone sees any content or materials which might violate copyright rights they will be warned immediately.

There is also a policy of taking action in the case of any material of an intellectual or aesthetic nature that is infringing upon copyright to a higher authority. That authority must provide clear explanations and any action taken against such material must have the same effect when taken against any other material. A copyright holder can find its act is unfair or unlawful if it has not given its explicit consent of the infringement
