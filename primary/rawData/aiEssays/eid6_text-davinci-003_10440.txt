The Empire State Building was constructed between 1929-1931, and with its impressive height and grand design, was set to become one of the most recognizable buildings in the world. From its early conception, the idea of installing a mooring mast on the roof of the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock had become popular. But despite the romanticised notion of airships docking to deliver passengers from all over the world, the builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles to make this dream a reality. 

One of the biggest challenge that the Empire State Building faced was the fact that they were dealing with a relatively new technology. Dirigibles are aircraft that can be powered by engines and steered by crews in cabins. These were large and unwieldy vessels that were much heavier than traditional planes. This posed a challenge from a construction perspective, because the building needed to be strong enough to sustain the added weight of the airships, and an effective mooring mast had to be constructed. This required considerable attention to detail, and expertise in designing a structure that could handle the added stress and strain of the airships. 

Another challenge the Empire State Building builders faced was making sure the mooring mast was high enough to accommodate dirigibles of varying sizes. This was because different dirigibles had different heights, with some airships measuring up to 1000 feet in length and of varying weight; all of which had to be taken into account
