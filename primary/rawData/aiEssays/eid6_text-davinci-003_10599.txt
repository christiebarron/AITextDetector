The Empire State Building was constructed with the intention of accommodating the new arrival of airships—dirigibles—whose debut was ushering in a new era of transportation. But for the engineers of the Empire State Building, accommodating the beasts was no easy feat. In Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s The Mooring Mast, she details the numerous hurdles that had to be overcome to make the building a suitable landing spot for dirigibles. 

The chief difficulty was engineering the mast. As the anchor point of the dirigible, the mast not only needed to be secure, but also able to bend slightly with the wind and accommodate the shift in weight brought on by passengers disembarking and unloading cargo. To achieve this, the mast had to be made with great care and craftsmanship. It was designed with three large steel mooring cables and a fourth, smaller cable that could actually detach the mast from the building. Wind tunnel tests, along with additional cables added later, ensured that the Empire State Building was ready for dirigibles.

But even with a sturdy mast, the Empire State Building still posed a number of other dangers. Its location in the heart of Manhattan was as busy as any metro area, and the base of the building couldn’t fit the size of the airships, making disembarking difficult. The danger increased with the high winds, which created unbearable turbulence over the city and posed a risk of dragging the larger dirig
