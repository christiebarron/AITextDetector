An example of a time someone in my life was patient was to get the kids and grandchildren the best they could and make them enjoy themselves and the family they brought us.


The kids who were at school (not always for real, they were still in college) loved working, playing soccer, etc. and when they arrived after the holidays they would just leave each day and just be there to check on their kids at school, just to get them home to hang out like that.


I went back to the same time in college for some time to learn that I would have to go back to the day I was a kid in high school to play with them. When I got back in the early '90s I went out to meet them, saw their little play-by-play (mostly with their friends) and they stayed in a small apartment in a poor neighborhood where I hadn't seen them for years.


As I got older I would have to tell them to just relax for several more years or nothing, to get them to play outside and to learn on their own instead of being constantly reminded to push on. They'd have to say they'd been out of a job all those years and "I'm not so good at this anymore", and then go work as hard as they could and keep on putting in as much effort as possible.


(Also there is a reason I've decided that I can go back once in my life or my family life
