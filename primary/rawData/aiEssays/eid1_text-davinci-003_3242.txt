To The Editor:

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects of computers on people. It is my belief that computers have both positive and negative effects that depend upon how they are used.

On the positive side, computers are incredible sources of information. They can be used to access educational material, teach new skills or even to research topics of personal interest. Computers make it easier to connect with people from around the world, enabling us to find new friends, build meaningful relationships, and even form professional networks.

On the other hand, computers can have a negative impact. Studies have documented the physical ailments caused by long hours of computer use. There is also the potential for distraction from real-world tasks and the lack of interaction with people that can lead to loneliness.

In conclusion, computers can offer us tremendous benefit when used in moderation. This includes using them for learning, networking, and connecting with others. However, excessive use can lead to physical problems and disconnection from the real world. Therefore, it is essential to find the right balance between using computers and getting necessary human interaction.

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
