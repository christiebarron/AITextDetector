In recent years, the widespread debate about whether or not libraries should censor materials has been all the rage. On one hand, some believe that libraries should devote their shelves to respectable and classic literature and other resources, while on the other, some feel that libraries should provide more openness to those that share different opinions. Despite this, the main feeling among the public is that censorship in libraries shouldn’t be enforced.

Censorship in libraries can be dangerous to society as it limits the public’s access to information. By prohibiting certain books, movies, music, and magazines, libraries become a form of “censorship machine” where opinions are silenced and restricted. This can lead to a dangerous lack of knowledge and insight when it comes to important issues within our society.

Furthermore, censorship in libraries also has the potential to be contradictory to the library’s aim of providing knowledge and learning. If libraries censor materials, it allows less access to other forms of learning and knowledge. Instead of allowing people to form their own opinions, decisions are being made for them based on how others interpret offensive material. In addition, censorship of materials can lead to an incomplete picture of history, resulting in the distortion of knowledge and the disfiguration of timelines important to cultural and religious aspects.

Finally, to believe that books, movies, music, and magazines have to be removed from the library’s shelves because they might be deemed offensive is simply too subjective
