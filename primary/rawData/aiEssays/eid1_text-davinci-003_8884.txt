I was out to dinner with my best friend, Alice, when the waiter brought us our salads. As soon as he left, Alice picked up one of the radishes, plonked it into her mouth and started chewing it while rolling her eyes. 

I could barely contain my laughter as she said, "Ugh, why did I do that?" 

She started laughing too, and even the waiter turned around to see what was going on. 

The two of us were laughing so hard, tears started streaming down our faces. Everyone in the restaurant was staring at us and the waiter looked completely bewildered. It was one of those moments that you could feel in your gut, laughter radiating throughout the entire restaurant.

I thought to myself, this is why we're such good friends. No matter how we joke around, we always find a way to laugh together. And in the end, that's what a relationship is built on - the shared moments of laughter.
