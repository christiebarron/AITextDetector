Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. With the same amount of detail you see below is the 'right' way to go when riding rough roads. But with a little knowledge you can make a very fine-tuned cycle.

As with riding around rough roads, when a cyclist is hit the road is closed off to other vehicles and people. This means the cyclist can't make any new stops in the area they hit. And if a driver has been caught the cyclist is left behind.

The same applies to traffic stops. You need a camera to observe traffic at the road. It will allow you to see the cyclists running and trying to go ahead and getting into traffic. But it won't keep you from trying to control traffic. On a typical rough road, the rider can only make a few stop stops at a time to make a right turn into the next block.

Even if you do that you're still going to lose sight of the other drivers. However, even before you stop, you will have a good view at a slow and steep incline. You will be allowed to walk, read, and drink if you have a special helmet.

With the use of 'Rough Road Ahead', you could make a better use of your cycling experience without having to spend months cycling alone. If you are planning a major adventure in Europe, this will help further your education and your health.
