I was with my family, headed to a holiday party for my Grandma's 90th birthday. We were running a bit late, so my Dad suggested we speed up–it was at this point that I let out an involuntary sound of surprise, something between a gasp and a laugh. I hadn't meant to be so loud–I realized quickly that I had just laughed at my Dad, and was embarrassed.

But apparently my worry was for nothing, because my Dad started to laugh too. Soon my parents, my siblings, and I were all in a fit of laughter simply because of how unexpected it had been for me to react that way. 

We finally made it to the party, and we each shared the story of what had happened during the drive over. Before we even got to the end of the story, everybody was in tears, laughing. 

We left the party with smiles on our faces, knowing that it hadn't been just a normal family drive down–it had been a moment of joy that we would always remember. It wasn't the only time laughter had connected us, but it was certainly one of the best.
