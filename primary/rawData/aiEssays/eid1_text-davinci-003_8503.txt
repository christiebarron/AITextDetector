I recently had to relive a stressful situation I had encountered a few years ago. I had been helping a friend move, when the moving truck ended up breaking down part way. The driver had no idea how to fix it, and we were stuck at the side of the road miles away from our destination. 

At first, I was very frustrated and impatient, but I realized this was not going to get us anywhere. After taking a few deep breaths, I decided the best course of action was to remain calm and patient and take the time to figure out what to do next. 

After a few phone calls, we were able to get a tow truck out to help us and the moving truck was eventually able to be fixed. It took almost an entire day longer than we had anticipated, but I was proud of myself for having the patience to remain calm and seek out the best solution to the problem.
