Rough Road Ahead: A Summary

Rough Road Ahead lets us capture the way people are travelling to or from work by making use of the most current available data. It also helps you to look up what your riding experience is in real-time, for example, using the RACI data instead of just the last two metres or the first one in a day or time. We also use a similar technique to that developed by the Cycling Council to help you to make good judgement as to where you are going in a specific area or your preferred routes and route combinations as you go over the speed limits.

While the RACI dataset is unique among bike routes used by cyclists (not just the average cyclist), we use some of the best data for all. We take advantage of their use in this setting to show that while there are different routes, we have all used one.

In addition to this, RULES are a valuable tool to see what your commute time and day of the week is and which people are most likely to use
