When my husband and I first started dating, a big part of the reason why we got along so well was because we both had a great sense of humor. We would constantly laugh at the funny things that happened between us. People around us often thought we were already a couple because of how much we laughed together. 

One time, we got to a restaurant and the hostess offered us a seat without looking up from her paper. We both had a good laugh at her obliviousness. Later on, as we were checking out, the same hostess came over and thanked us for the extra tip we left her. She even mentioned that she enjoyed spending time with us two happy people. 

That moment felt really special between us. It showed me that we could make laughter a big part of our relationship. It also taught me that even little moments of laughter could bring us closer together.  We both looked at each other and smiled, and I knew right then and there that my husband was someone very special to me.
