Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effect computers have on people and to persuade the readers to agree with me.

Over the years, technology has continued to progress and develop into something completely unrecognizable from what we knew before. It seems like every few weeks there is something new and more efficient on the market, and computers have had a resounding effect on our lives.

At school, students have transitioned from paper to laptops, tablets, and even smartphones. In the workplace, computers now control most tasks and allow employees to be more efficient and collaborative in their work. In the home, computers give people access to an unimaginable amount of data and make communication with the world far easier than ever before.

However, I believe that relying on computers and technology for too many tasks can be detrimental for people. By taking away mundane tasks and processes, people may not be able to develop their natural skills and abilities. It can also damage our ability to think and reason critically on our own.

For this reason, I believe that computers should not replace the normal tasks we do each day, and that simple activities like writing and arithmetic should be done by hand. People should focus on developing their own skills before resorting to a computer.

Thank you for taking the time to read this and for considering my opinion.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
