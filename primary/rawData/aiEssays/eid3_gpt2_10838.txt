Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. It offers a great way to make your journey feel different and take it to a whole new level.

From the basic 'easy to use' map that looks straight ahead, through to a very detailed set of road markings and more, the setting can also help bring you home a bit of a sense of safety and confidence.

Taking full advantage of this setting is to take a look at the roads and villages that are currently being managed by the British Cycling organisation. It's a useful way to explore the cycling world and you can save up money to spend in your town, or even in a special 'city' to get up and running at the speed of your heart rate monitor, but there are loads more things to do if you're willing to take a few more hours on this. Don't be like me and try to find those streets, don't think you have enough time. You're not only saving us money but also potentially saving the world the next time you're there (at least if you're the driver of your bicycle).
