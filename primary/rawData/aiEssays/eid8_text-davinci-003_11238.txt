I had the most embarrassed laugh of my life when visiting my relatives a few months ago. I had been so excited to go visit and see them again after so long apart. During our time together we all went outside to play an active game, a game that involved a lot of running on a grassy slope. 

I was trying to sprint as fast as I could, taking a few steps up the incline. Then, all of a sudden, my foot slipped, and I tumbled hilariously down the hill, face first, to the base. I expected my relatives to burst out laughing at my silly stunt, and while they did, the best part was seeing myself make them laugh. 

We all just stood there unable to stop laughing. That moment was probably one of the best memories we all shared. We laughed until our stomachs ached and our cheeks were bright pink. Not only was it a fun and funny experience but also a reminder of how closely we are united to one another through laughter.
