Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion about the effects of computers in our lives and why we should take this issue seriously. With the rapid development of technology, computers have become an essential part of our life, and they have had a tremendous impact on our society.

The influence of computers starts from the young. With the advancement of computer technology, computers have been widely used in education. Children can explore the world with the help of the internet by gathering knowledge. With the help of educational software, children can even learn subjects on their own. Computers help develop various skills including problem solving and analytical reasoning in children.

But too much of reliance on computers can also have a negative effect. It limits the creativity of children as they spend most of their time faced in front of the computer, limiting their exposure to the physical world. Without proper guidance, they may get addicted to computer games or indulge in surfing inappropriate content on the internet. Hence, parents should supervise their children and keep them away from such unproductive activities.

Therefore, in conclusion, computers are beneficial if used in the right manner. They can help us to learn new things, develop skills and keep up with the current technology.
