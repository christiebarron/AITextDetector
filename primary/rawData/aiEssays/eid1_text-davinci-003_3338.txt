Dear Editor:

The effects computers have on people are immense, and it is time that we discussed just what those effects can be. Though computers have undoubtedly been a blessing in many aspects of life, particularly in terms of communication and access to information, they have also had a rather negative effect on people.

The time we spend in front of our computers is often excessive, leading to both physical and mental health problems. Studies have linked the extensive use of technology with difficulty in socializing, insomnia, neck or back pain, and a decrease in academic performance. In addition, there is also an increase in cyberbullying and online harassment, leading to anxiety and depression.

I feel that it is necessary for the public to be made aware of the potential harms that come with such technology and its compulsive usage. This could be done through health and education programs in schools, workshops, and even in the media.

It is important for us to consider the effects of computers on ourselves and our children, and to encourage sensible usage. We can still aid technological development and progress, but with care for our well-being.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
