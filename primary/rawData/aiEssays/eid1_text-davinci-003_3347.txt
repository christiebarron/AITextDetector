Dear Editor,

I am writing to voice my opinion on the effects computers have on people. In my experience, computers are a double-edged sword that can be both helpful and dangerous.

On the one hand, computers can provide great benefits for individuals. It has become easier to search for information online, save time with automations, virtually access distant resources, collaborate with people around the world, and create value with programming and other digital skills.

On the other hand, too much time spent using computers can affect our physical, mental, and social wellbeing. It can induce neck and wrist strain, headaches, cause eyestrain, and lead to a sedentary lifestyle. It can also cause anxiety and depression, as well as make it more difficult to differentiate between virtual relationships and real-world social relationships.

I strongly believe that computers can present great opportunities and create value when used in moderation. We should strive to take advantage of the good while mitigating the bad. This is not an easy task but itâ€™s possible if we are aware of these issues and take a proactive approach to using technology responsibly.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

[Your Name
