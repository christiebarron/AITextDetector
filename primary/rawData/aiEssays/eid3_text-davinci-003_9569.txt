Rough Road Ahead by Joe Kurmaski tells the story of a cyclist who goes through a series of difficult journeys. The cyclist, John, faces winding roads, stray animals, rough weather, and lack of sleep – all while cycling through a seemingly endless landscape.

The features of the setting deeply affect John’s experience on the road. The winding roads make it difficult for John to keep a steady and efficient pace. The terrain of the roads, from dirt and gravel to mud and asphalt, also makes cycling more difficult – especially when the mud is so deep that John has to get off his bike and push it. The stray animals that appear on the road create an extra obstacle for John, and the lack of any civilization along his ride leaves John feeling isolated and alone.

The wild and unpredictable nature of the environment also affects John greatly. He faces powerful storms and harsh temperatures, and has to be constantly on alert for any dangers on the road. This constant vigilance, both physical and mental, takes its toll on John, as exhaustion from the fatigue of cycling and fear of what might come next draws near.

John’s journey is a difficult one, and the features of the setting make it even tougher. The winding roads, stray animals, harsh weather and lack of civilization contribute to John’s increasing weariness and ever-growing sense of fear. This makes John’s story even more harrowing, as he presses on through the dangers
