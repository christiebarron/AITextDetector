I remember quite well the first time I ever truly laughed with someone. I had just moved to town and didn't know anyone in the area when I decided to attend the local high school.

My first day was filled with anxiousness and fear as I settled into my new environment. I was walking down the hallway when I met a girl named Amy. She had an easy going personality and a genuine smile. After a few minutes of conversation, I felt like I had known her my whole life. 

Before I knew it, we were both laughing. Amy had the perfect sense of humor and it was so contagious that I couldn't help but laugh too. After that moment, we became really close friends.

To this day, I credit that first moment of laughter as the moment that brought us closer together and really cemented our friendship. We often lean on each other for a good laugh, and it serves as a reminder of our bond that will last forever.
