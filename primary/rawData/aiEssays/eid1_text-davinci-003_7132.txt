The race takes place on a winding road with steep hills, and the terrain is hazardous with potholes and ruts. The cyclist must maneuver difficult terrain while simultaneously trying to maintain his speed, and this combination of speed and terrain makes the race incredibly dangerous.

For example, the bicycle rider must deal with extreme changes in slope. He must negotiate tight corners, switchbacks, and other treacherous obstacles. Some of these obstacles have the potential to slow or even stop all momentum, meaning the cyclist has to possess enough strength and agility to navigate them quickly in order to remain competitive. Not only that, but the dense woods are full of critters that can cause an unsuspecting racer to veer off the path, potentially causing an accident.

The rider must also be completely focused on the task at hand in order to protect themselves from the oncoming vehicles. As the road is winding and narrow, there is little room for mistakes made at the hands of another driver. The cyclist must remain vigilant and alert in order to safely weave between cars, as well as to avoid debris or runoff that could cause a crash.
