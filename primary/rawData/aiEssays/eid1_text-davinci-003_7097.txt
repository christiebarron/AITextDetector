Dear Editor:

In today’s ever-evolving world, libraries across the country face a difficult issue regarding censorship of certain materials from their shelves. Many feel that books, music, movies, and magazines that are considered offensive should be removed from library shelves. I wholeheartedly disagree with this practice.

That’s not to say that I think any and every material should be completely unrestricted in libraries. Research has demonstrated countless times that some materials are not suitable for certain age groups, so if a library wishes to restrict those materials, I absolutely understand that decision. On the other hand, a library should not have the power to make uniform censorship decisions across a wide, diverse population.

First and foremost, censoring materials from library shelves has a powerful effect on readers and viewers young and old. It sends a message that certain points of view, topics, and lifestyles are inappropriate or even dangerous, simply because of the beliefs of a select group. Especially with books, this censorship can limit an individual’s access to ideas and opinions that may contradict their existing beliefs. We cannot let our preconceived notions inhibit our personal growth by oppressing us from exploring new ideas.

What’s more, books, magazines, and movies contain far more than their explicit text and images; they contain messages, morals, and lessons that can be found by careful observation and study, as well as provide a way to explore unfamiliar worlds, cultures, and beliefs
