Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, is a moving, intimate glimpse into the life of a designer. Through Rodriguez’s vivid and often harrowing depictions of his upbringing as a Cuban refugee in the Bronx, his journey to becoming an acclaimed fashion designer, and his eventual homesickness, the memoir evokes a multitude of emotional experiences. 

Beginning with an exploration of his experiences in Cuba, Rodriguez tells of his mother's brave efforts to protect her family from a “dark and disheartening” poverty despite her limited resources. Through his moving and detailed description of her strength in the face of adversity, a mood of admiration and respect is created. Rodriguez’s words, “with a playwright’s finesse, she spun a bizarre and brilliant stage set” which allowed him and his siblings to remain safe, imbues a strong sense of amazement and deep empathy towards his mother’s bravery. Meanwhile, Rodriguez’s remembrance of his father’s musical talents, often played “for small coins tossed into his soles by passersby”, highlights the power of art and creates a sense of longing and appreciation for happier times, despite the difficult present.

By recounting his venture from the Bronx to the glamorous world of fashion, Rodriguez captures the creative and liberating act of self-invention and weaves a sense of fascination and wonder as he writes of
