The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The government had to convince a federal court in New York, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Richmond, that the system failed to meet the requirement to permit such installations. (That case is no longer in the books.)

For the next 50 years, dirigibles and other forms of flying space craft proliferated. They became more popular because of the power of cheap flight and their low cost.

At NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt-MD, Kelly is testing the first two.

The first is a small four-foot-tall model called the Orion. The second is a larger 14-foot-long model called the Spitzer. The three are named after space-faring astronauts whose father
