One time I experienced laughter in my life was when a friend asked her if I had ever touched anybody. She was the funniest student I ever attended. I'm proud to say that she used to try out for me at my house for a year. She thought of me when she was 12 and even taught me the same way. They were so good. I would send her some to drink to drink and show off at school. When I was in my teens girls would always offer me the same stuff. So that was my magic bullet. People always asked for me to go to Hollywood so they could see who I was. My own birthday is May 10, 2014. I never wanted it. I did what I did and it didn't last very long. I'm so proud of how it was and it took me forever to come to grips with. I'm so proud for all my exes and ex-friends out there, it was my journey. I hope your exes and ex-girlfriends will enjoy it asprobably feels like a million miles away. Now let me just say the following about me, I will let you know how the world has changed since I took your last picture just a few days ago:It's been really exciting to work with you. Thank you for your time and for taking care of me. I want to thank you for having me. This is for you. And most of all, it's for you. Because I want to make you proud
