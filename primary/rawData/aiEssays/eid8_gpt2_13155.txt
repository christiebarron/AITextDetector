One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I looked at Jesus Christ. I felt sad. I knew Jesus. But it was strange because, like every other smile, my face looked black. It was not at all like people I knew, it was a little light-shiny. It was like when I said it was because I think I'm getting high sometimes and I remember I went to church but I still don't remember if I was ever in church or not. That's when someone told me I didn't have to say anything because I was just feeling sorry for this woman who happened to be my little sister. She said after one week I realized I didn't even know what I was feeling.

I was so grateful to God that I had that voice. That's how I felt and how he took me and allowed me to express it.
