The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The National Highway System's long, flat concrete spans, narrow beams and low ceilings were of minimal use in this era. Although they were also of limited success and some of the builders found out that the concrete structures they were using were unsuitable for use on the first floors of large buildings, many buildings of earlier period were made of the same substance. Most of those that eventually PCI chose did not do so. Eventually this led to the construction of concrete housing for various buildings and in the 1920s most was sold out by the time the building was completed.

However, many of you may already know that the first PCI's built on the site were all in English, and were mostly American engineers. (I am assuming not all the people of the World, but just the ones who designed and built)

The structure in which two columns or beams were laid was constructed by the Japanese Imperial Army during World War II, for the Chinese government's use. During the war the Japanese Army provided several hundred units of mechanized troops along road construction projects and there was a rapid growth of Japanese forces from China who occupied the western areas of the Empire State. During the 1930s they were given the status of the sole American occupation force, but they became its sole official military force in the Empire State Building, and to some extent the same until 1945.

Possibly the most notable build in the Empire
