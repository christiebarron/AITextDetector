One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was 14 years old. It came on so much, it made my skin curl up. It was just, just something I knew there was about me.

We go through periods of self-pity or a lack of any kind of motivation or empathy and then that just becomes more. It just takes a while to sort through when that happens, and I don't want that to happen to anyone. The most important thing to me for me, just as much, is that my happiness comes to me through my actions. Every day is like that. Every day is a reminder that I can do this on my own. I have to be myself and if I don't have this, we've all been there. I'm trying to be better, better than that and I'm really trying to be a good character in that aspect of my life that I always felt like I was.
