One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I saw a book on writing as a hobby.


Well now I need more than that. I want to get that job. I need to get to work. I just need to show people who put their work at the door and try to take that opportunity and make that place into some great place."

The following is some of the key quotes from a post on reddit, in which one woman, who identifies herself as queer, says about my career:

"What I wanted was that people would realise that it would not be very difficult to write an essay about me and I was going to get my life in order like this. One writer said, 'Hey look, if you're going to be writing, why would I just write about me and not others?'"

"It's not my job. What I want is someone to write about me. It's really, really easy to write an essay about I'm going to be writing about myself. What I'm going to work on is just this. Like, 'How have I been? This girl is really cute. I'll just say this and she'll go crazy' because there's no shame in doing so. If someone wants to write a poem or something similar, it's up to them. You don't have to know me and I can write about you, so feel free to just write about me."
