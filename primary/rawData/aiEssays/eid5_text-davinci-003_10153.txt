As Narciso takes his readers through his two homes – Old Havana and pre-gentrification New York City – he evokes a deep sense of belonging to a place, an experience, and a culture that has been lost forever. 

Narciso’s emotive language paints a beautiful portrait of his homes, describing the stories, advice, and memories that fill them. From his grandmother’s home in Old Havana, Narciso looks back on the days of childhood when his grandmother made pastries and sat around the kitchen table telling stories. In his New York City apartment, Narciso evokes the energy of the city, the communities of people coming together in the streets, and the special moments he and his family have shared there. 

Narciso’s immersive writing transports readers to both of his homes at the same time, creating a feeling of both fondness and nostalgia.
