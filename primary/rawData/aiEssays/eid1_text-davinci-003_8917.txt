Dear Editor,

As our world continues to become more and more reliant on technology, it is important to consider the long-term effects of computers on people. From the way we communicate to the way we create and store information—computers have changed the world.

It is undeniable that computers simplify our lives, allowing us to be productive and organized. Accessories, like the internet, give us access to a wealth of knowledge and resources. But what are the consequences on people’s mental and physical health?

Studies have shown that computers can cause eye strain and neck pain, especially when used over long periods of time. Additionally, computers can lead to addiction and poor social interaction.

Our culture has become so saturated with technology that it is difficult to escape it. It is important to also consider ways to be healthy with our technology use. That may mean limiting online exposure or taking frequent breaks from the screen.

The effects computers have on people’s health are real and should be taken seriously. Being conscious of the time we spend on our computers, and taking preventative measures are wise decisions. 

We can all gain much from the convenience of computers, just be sure to re-energize with healthy activities away from the screen.

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
