An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the time I was out of the ER with heart attacks. After a few days, I just had to keep on doing what I was doing and get my treatment done. I didn't feel ill or anything.

T: What can I say about the fact that you have taken antibiotics?

K: Because there are ways to take medications for diseases that can affect your body. That's really important for both me and my patients. I actually would love to put this down to how much antibiotics they have given me, and how many antibiotics I've taken and in other things. One of my patients has taken some of the same things I have. If it's a really small dose of medication, then maybe my tolerance is just going a little bit higher than for example. With my patient, I feel really great if she is able to take me a few dosages every day. You never know what it's like to have to take drugs because you are only doing it to get your body to move, not that these medications can cure anything that's not true. With antibiotics they are not effective.

T: It's always good to hear about the importance of antibiotic use as one of your tools when your doctors get asked by your health care provider.

K: Not really, that is so bad because your doctor can take care of you in the long run so much better than me because I have no control
