The Empire State Building was a marvel of modern engineering when it was completed in 1931. It was designed not only to be the tallest building in the world, but also to accommodate the latest in transportation technology â€“ airships, also known as Dirigibles. While plans for a potential airship mooring mast existed, the obstacles which had to be overcome in making those plans a reality were significant.

The first factor to consider was structural integrity. Airships are huge, slow-moving constructs which require a large area of open space and solid support. The Empire State Building was built with the intent of accommodating an airship mooring mast, but physical limits imposed by the profile of the building and the amount of weight the structure could carry had to be taken into account. This resulted in a mast design which could sustain the weight of the dirigibles while allowing them to moor safely.

Another significant obstacle was to make sure the mooring mast design was sound to guarantee safe landings. This required careful engineering in order for the mast to be sturdy enough to hold the weight and size of the airships while providing enough stability for the operation to take place. In addition, the design had to be able to resist the dynamic loads created by the wind, thus creating a requirement for extensive testing and modifications before the operation could be deemed safe.

Finally, mechanical fixtures had to be installed to allow the airships to safely attach to the mast and be securely
