In Joe Kurmaski’s story, “Rough Road Ahead”, the features of the setting significantly influence the cyclist’s performance. The setting of the story is on a gravel road and the weather is inclement, adding an additional layer of difficulty to the journey. This type of road surface is difficult to ride on since it’s so irregular and easily shifted with the wind or other environmental factors. Moreover, the cyclist has to be wary of loose sand, pebbles, and other debris that can either cause them to slip or lose balance. The weather also adds a further challenge to the cyclist; rain and wind can quickly reduce the cyclist’s visibility and tire traction which can cause the cyclist to slip and fall.

The road conditions also prevent the cyclist from reaching their maximum speed due to the risk of crash-inducing surfaces and obstacles. Moreover, the dark and wet environment can be intimidating and daunting for the cyclist, creating a mental hindrance that will only further impede their performance.

Overall, the setting affects the cyclist in both physical and mental ways, making it difficult for the cyclist to reach their destination within their desired time-frame. Despite the unfavourable terrain and weather, the cyclist must stay mentally focused and be particularly aware of their surroundings to avoid a crash and reach their destination safely. In essence, the features of the setting play a critical role in the cyclist’s journey, posing serious challenges that
