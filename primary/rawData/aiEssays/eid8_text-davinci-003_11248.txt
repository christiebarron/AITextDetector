It was a hot summer day when I met him for the first time. We had been casually talking for awhile, but there had been an underlying tension between us. We were both trying to make a good impression, each hoping the other would like us.

Then somehow, out of nowhere, we started laughing. We couldn't remember what had even sparked it in the first place. But I remember that moment like it was yesterday. We laughed and laughed until our sides hurt. It felt like all of a sudden, the room was filled with warmth and light. 

That moment of laughter changed everything. In that moment, any tension that had been there melted away and we became friends. We were able to become more comfortable around each other and laugh at more jokes. It made all of our conversations so much easier.

From then on, joy lingered between us whenever we were together. Making each other laugh became one of our favorite activities, and even when our conversations drifted towards more serious topics, our friendship was rooted in the laughter we first shared together.
