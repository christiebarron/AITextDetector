When I think of times I was patient, two distinct memories come to mind - once when I was helping my friend move, and again when I was dealing with a difficult coworker. 

When I was helping my friend move, I had promised to be there for him by 9am, but he was running late and didn't get there until 12pm. Despite my busy morning and the fact that I had already had to reschedule many other activities, I remained patient and understanding when my friend finally arrived. I knew it was important for him to get his move done that day, so I remained calm and put my plans on hold to make sure he had the help he needed. 

In my job, I've had to work with a colleague who is frequently late to meetings, misses deadlines, and never follows through on their promises. Despite this, I have remained patient and understanding. I try to politely remind them of deadlines and give them extra help when needed. I know it can be hard to build a good working relationship with someone who is difficult to work with, but I have remained patient and kept the lines of communication open. 

In both of these situations, I have had to practice patience and understanding. Even when the situation wasn't ideal or when I was feeling frustrated, I have remained patient and found ways to work through my difficulties.
