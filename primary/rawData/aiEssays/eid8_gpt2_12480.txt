One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was 16."

Another time, in 1997, I was chatting to a young married couple in the Philippines. Their children were watching TV, at night, and on the same plane they were talking. When I was told the couple had had two children with a woman named Marla. "She is a nice girl. She never thought of a name, ever! motto," says the translator who was with them. The couple came to know Marla very well.

Marla is now a senior adviser for the Center for Asian American Media, an American nonprofit aimed at raising awareness of Asian-American issues in the United States, with its focus on domestic and international affairs, economic development, and the Asian Pacific.
