 

The Empire State Building was one of the first skyscrapers to introduce the concept of “mooring masts” or the docks for dirigibles. When the idea was proposed to build the world’s tallest building, the vision of dirigibles being able to dock became a reality. The Empire State Building held the record for tallest building for over forty years after its completion, so the idea to have dirigibles dock there caught the attention of many. Despite the ability of having this spectacle, there were a few obstacles that halted the plan. 

The first obstacle was the materials and construction of the mooring mast. According to the book, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, “due to the building materials and methods used to construct the Empire State Building in 1931...[it] could not support the mooring mast which was intended to tower higher than the roof”. This obstacle made it difficult to install the mast which was crucial for the dirigibles to dock. 

The second obstacle was the lack of space. Though, the Empire State Building was the tallest building in the world, the width of it was insufficient for docking purposes. The building created obstacles for large dirigibles to maneuver within the air space as the space was very tight. 

The third obstacle was the weight of the airships. Dirigibles rely heavily on air pressure to keep them afloat
