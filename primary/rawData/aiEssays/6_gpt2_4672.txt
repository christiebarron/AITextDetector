The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The design of the building became the impetus for a major redesign, culminating with the famous 1884 conversion of a building into an Empire State Building, now known as the National Convention Center. The new building incorporates a large interior that, according to some historians, would have been unsuitable for cargo hauling. The building was to be torn down in 1894, but a small company managed to salvage the original structure. However, the building became a landmark in the history of the construction of New York City. A few years later, there was another historic project to be done, by an ambitious architect named Benjamin Minsky. His ideas are still used today by many architecture programs in the United States. He designed five monumental steel and wooden columns on the first floor. The walls of the buildings looked very much like the windows of the famous Colonial Era buildings that adored the city, and they were designed so that future visitors could be sure the building would be well made so they could be sure the building would attract the full attention of city planners. For a much longer time, the building appeared as an abandoned building with a huge, glass-like window. However, this was not the case for many years and in a few of the early years, a variety of design details, such as the design of the building's exterior, were incorporated in subsequent improvements. This architectural change was mostly ignored in the years that followed
