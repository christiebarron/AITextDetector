The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' feels almost cartoonish – it explores how you're an outsider looking for a way for yourself to be. 'The world of the 'good girl,' when you're a young woman growing up, is a way of seeing you as this 'easy girl' who lives their own fantasy and wants to be different. At times, such as when she's fighting back the negative feelings and feelings of loneliness from her new boyfriend, and not even wanting to accept being a woman's boyfriend when her sexuality is at stake.'

But that's how the world of 'From Home is' ends – you have no control over what happens next. You're given all the things that you need and you have to survive so it's up to you to act. You had to be there for the people in your room, on the streets of London, to meet you, take you in for a chat.

'To be able to come to terms with how that world is being changed by this novel is beautiful to me,' says Paul. 'I really couldn't be more excited to be part of it – this one is a first time for me, if you know what I mean.'
