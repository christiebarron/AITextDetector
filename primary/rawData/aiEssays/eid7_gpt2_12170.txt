An example of a time someone in my life was patient was in one of those cases. After a patient came in and showed that I was her child, I knew she went to the doctor and the only doctor I knew was another woman who worked with patients.

"As you know, at the time the doctor had made her the child and she asked her doctor just the same thing, 'Did he see your son?'

"But she didn't go to that doctor. She went to the child advocate. There is not a hospital because she doesn't have any child. She also went to the child service because she had been in hospital for a long period and the child nurse said, 'Go to my office, I'll talk to the children'," he said.
