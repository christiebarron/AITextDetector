The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because "A few years ago we wrote a story about children and adults doing the best that could possibly be done by the children." It's an ambitious, sometimes harrowing, tale of courage, determination, and perseverance that doesn't need an overly broad vocabulary. No. 19 is a real treat. While his own career had, to be certain, been derailed by bad luck and a loss to work, the book's plot doesn't sound like "a very high-stakes, cross-country road trip." In fact, the main characters have made it across the country, from Iowa to New Hampshire and up to New York. All the while, there's always the possibility that one of the novel's many characters may be left out of the picture.


A great read if you're curious or just looking for a quick refresher, but it's a shame that Winter Hibiscus is all over the place in the online market when it comes to the book. The author has taken the time to write the plot and characters for us to learn the details about them and how each story will feel. The book also serves as a perfect companion book for some kids, as it presents an adult experience that will appeal to a younger audience. Winter Hibiscus also has the book's most entertaining, informative, and thoughtful story, which is why it is one of the only books I will ever listen to the kind of book that is worth
