Computers have many effects on people.

In the case of computer science, which is related to mathematics, there may well be different things we can do to counteract or alleviate these affects. But the key point is that we aren't always aware of the difference between the effects of our brain processes.

This is a subject of another article in the January 13, 2012 edition of Wired.com. On the topic of our brains, it's worth asking about our mental ability to process.

The research was done using a 3D robot and a real person and was analyzed by researchers Dr. Christopher Herrmann and Dr. Jan Gün. These two experiments focused on the brain processes that affect people's actions. We don't think we'll have to take any drastic actions to change things. But what's certain is that some people will experience more than others—that's one way that we change the way we perceive things.

In the previous studies, there was some question as to whether our brain processes information that they might have lost. For example, people are more likely to have short-term memory—if they use the internet more and see more news and videos, they may need to rely more heavily on websites for a good portion of their daily consumption. But the new research suggests that they're more likely to report being on the Internet more frequently, and they're actually significantly more likely to report getting married in the past month.
