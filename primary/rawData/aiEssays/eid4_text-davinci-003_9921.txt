The narrator of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho hopes that the metaphor of the Winter Hibiscus will give her the strength to take an important test again. She has been struggling to do well on the test, and her struggles are similar to the struggles of the hibiscus plant which she encountered during the winter. By ending the poem with this line, the narrator is vowing to herself that she will have a renewed determination to take the test again when the snows melt and the plant is budding. This serves as a reminder to the narrator that she must remain resilient and persevere, no matter how hard the challenge may seem.
