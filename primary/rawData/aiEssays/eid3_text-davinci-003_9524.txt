The features of the setting in "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski play a large part in how the cyclist is affected. Firstly, the rural setting provides a sense of unease as the cyclist is alone on an unfamiliar road and does not know what to expect. The weather aggravates the sense of danger, as at one point it begins to rain heavily. The darkness and fog further obscure the cyclist's visibility, making it difficult for them to distinguish different types of terrain. In addition, the pavement is rocky and full of potholes, creating an additional sense of danger and difficulty that the cyclist has to overcome. The cyclist is surrounded by trees, creating a sense of mystery and desolation, and ominously, squirrels scurry across the road, adding to the cyclist's sense of unease. All of these features create an atmosphere of precariousness and vulnerability, which in turn affects the cyclist's emotions and makes the journey more difficult. Furthermore, the cyclist is struggling to make progress, suggesting that these unfavorable conditions are making pedaling a challenge. In spite of these challenges, however, the cyclist musters strength and determination to reach their destination, making it clear that they, through perseverance and dedication, have been able to overcome the various obstacles they have faced.
