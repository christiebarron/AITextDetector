The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. There had to be a way to keep the cars upright and safe, but a few were just too large and too tall to be able to hang onto a roof rack.

That may as well have been a very long time ago. With the need for the Empire State Building to keep things upright, the engineers had to keep the car upright and make the building safe from possible collisions.

The Empire State Building is about 17 feet long with a single glass roof system that uses a rotary suspension system to keep the cars in the building. One of the biggest improvements was a new glass flooring to further deflect any potentially damaging air, which also held the roof up to the side of the building as much as possible. This has helped reduce the hazards involved with large cargo planes and has also put the building into a more environmentally friendly category.

As for the interior itself, it was all about design, with the design coming from engineers from all over the world. The Empire State Building, like everything it was, was built in China where a lot of the architectural principles were very simplepsychotic.
