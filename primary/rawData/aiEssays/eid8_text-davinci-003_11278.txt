I recently went on a first date with a girl I had met online. We had both been anxious and excited about how the date would go, so when we finally sat down to eat, the conversation was slightly awkward. We both tried to ease the tension, talking about our similar taste in music and the books we had read recently. 

Then, about halfway through the meal, something funny happened. My date is a bit of a clumsy person, and she had been nervously fidgeting with her hair throughout the meal. All of a sudden, one of her bobby pins came flying off and stuck itself on the top of her head! We both burst out laughing, and from then on the date felt much less awkward. We laughed about all sorts of things throughout the night, and I'm glad to have met someone who can laugh along with me. 

Laughter is definitely one of the best ways to make a first impression. It's amazing how quickly two strangers can feel like old friends once they have found something to laugh about!
