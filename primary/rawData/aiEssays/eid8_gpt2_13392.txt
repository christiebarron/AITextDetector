One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was in high school, I felt that I needed more laughter from my classmates so I started giving it in my class speech. As I was growing up, my teacher had taught me in class about laughing. After hearing a friend mention an act which she loved, I started to think that it was just because I liked the act as a girl. I became a fan of the act, even though it was only half the story. Now I am trying to teach myself laughter by doing my own thing.

My other friend was very creative and had been in love with many things besides laughter. One day, she taught herself what she could and started teaching herself comedy. She started to laugh when my friend mentioned that it's also funny when she is talking to someone and it's not just something that comes from laughing, it's actually a physical fact and she starts doing it and I started to laugh. At my university, I had many friends that were both high in laughter and were actually really good at it. Some were friends of mine which really impressed me to see them laugh out of boredom. One year, I got married and now I have a husband and two kids. I am having the same laugh for every night in bed.

So extremes can form and even extremes can move, and that's funny and I wish I could be the best at the very simple one. So, how do you keep this laugh going?
