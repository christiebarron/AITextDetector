The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Each time an elevator was launched and an elevator is shut down at a given point, it would pull back or collapse. That was one of the problems, because any elevators would be inoperative and eventually the buildings would collapse. Because even then, the only way to clear the debris from a building without a final explosion would be to start a ground-breaking crane.

To find out, we installed a crane in Downtown Denver near the main entrance to the Empire State Building; it was located in the same building as the Empire State Building at 10th and W. Central streets. We pulled into the building and walked up to it. The crane was mounted inside the entrance to the building. The crane was very heavy around the clock and was only 6 feet tall and was 10 feet long. It carried an estimated load of 2.8 tons and it was made of three sheets of concrete steel or 4-ft by 9-ft thick cement.

The crane was designed for two purposes - it was to reduce the friction between the upper and lower walls and provide a sense of security. The top half of the crane was approximately 13 ft by 6 ft. This added 10 ft to the volume the crane could carry, making it one of the heaviest structures in the Empire State Building. It also provided an unobstructed view of the building as a whole, and to provide an unobstructed view of the
