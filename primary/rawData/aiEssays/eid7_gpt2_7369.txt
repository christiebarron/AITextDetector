An example of a time someone in my life was patient was that when I had my baby the baby was on her side. She was being treated so bad but she was being cared for and I knew I wasn't going to let her die.


But after that period of time there weren't enough women around. So now it's like: What am I going to do about it?


Now I'm doing this sort of work to help other people in my life. I just feel that maybe I should get married at the end of the day.


What I have learned in my life is that there's no way you can just move forward without moving on. I mean, if I were to marry and have kids, I am not going to be able to say 'I love you but I have to make a decision to live with your death, I have to say OK but I'm not trying to change any of that in my head.'


I feel like I can be an advocate to the community and I'm doing it right. And it's interesting how much he loves me and how thankful he is that I believe in him and that I believe in myself, something he has always wanted to be a part of all the time.


The point of this is that he always wanted to be the best person that we can be. When I go to school I'll go to a community college. When I go to see somebody I've never seen before or
