The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' by The Rolling Stones frontman James Brown and played out during the course of the documentary, is to see how he feels after a life full of depression.

And his family say he is feeling worse.

'We are like family,' he told the Guardian in an interview the day before he died. 'It happens in a real way and when you are dead you never really have time to think about it, but when you wake up, no matter what it is you come to expect.

'It is hard just living life the way you do. You think about it your whole life. When you wake, think about your time in that universe.

'There are stories of that and of the people who have gone through the same, where this was kind of a black and white thing but I have never seen it. It just makes me so worried.'

'From Home' also examines the struggle a mother who worked as a sex worker to leave school - the family hopes to give the filmmakers a little glimpse of another life he left behind.
