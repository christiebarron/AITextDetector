The features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski's 'Rough Road Ahead' greatly affect the cyclist in a number of ways.

The first, and most obvious, is the terrain. The rider is faced with a rough road full of potholes, which makes travelling difficult. The rocks and gravel add to this difficulty, forcing the rider to take extra caution in order to avoid any dangerous situations. The heat of the day contributes to the discomfort of the rider, making for a formidable challenge of physical endurance.

The time of day has a tremendous impact on the cyclist's mindset. With the darkness setting in, the rider is left with a sense of uncertainty and fear. The nighttime elements, such as the unknown wildlife and eerie sounds, build an intimidating atmosphere. This provides an additional obstacle for the cyclist.

The environment provides a further sense of pressure, as the cyclist knows that if anything should go wrong, it makes for a much more difficult situation. The rider is alone in his journey, facing an unknown territory. This increases the sense of isolation and danger, again adding to the rider's stress.

Overall, the features of the setting contribute to the overall atmosphere of the story, greatly impacting the rider. The rough terrain, the darkness, and the overall environment create a formidable challenge for the cyclist, making for a dangerous and weary journey.
