Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my opinion on the effects computers have on people. As technology becomes more and more advanced, computers are becoming increasingly integrated into our lives. It is no surprise then that many people view these changes as either a blessing or a curse.

For starters, computers have revolutionized our ability to communicate, making it easier to stay in touch with family and friends, no matter where they are located. Furthermore, computers have improved and revolutionized many industries, making it easier to work from the home and also to get better jobs.

However, one of the biggest negative impacts computers have had on people is in the form of distraction. People have become too focused on their screens, losing touch with face-to-face interactions and losing touch with their own physical and mental health. Furthermore, it is a known fact that screens can negatively affect our sleep by altering the melatonin levels in our body.

In conclusion, it is important to weigh both the positive and negative impacts that computers have on people and to take necessary precautions in order to mitigate any negative effects.

Sincerely, 
[Name]
