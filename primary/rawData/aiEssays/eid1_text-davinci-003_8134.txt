The construction of the Empire State Building was a major engineering feat for its time, but an even bolder ambition was the dream of allowing dirigible airships to dock in the building's tower. This is the story of the obstacles that the builders had to overcome in order to make this dream a reality. 

The first obstacle that the architects of the Empire State Building had to tackle was the structural challenge of accommodating a dirigible in the structure. The tower was over 1400 feet tall and although the original plans called for a mooring mast at the top, the superstructure could not support the weight of an airship. To provide the necessary structure a steel mast was designed which extended more than 150 feet above the top of the building. To prevent the airship from sinking into the mast, a series of water tanks and pipes were built in the base of the mast to provide counterweights and also to act as vibrational dampers to cushion the airships when docking.

Another obstacle the builders faced was how to safely and securely connect the dirigibles to the mast. After much experimentation the builders decided on a system of four nested masts, allowing the airships to dock without directly touching the building's structure below. The top mast contained a stainless steel loop cable which unlocked from the mast as the airship descended, allowing a hook to be securely attached to the mast. 

The safety of those who were traveling in the airships was another major concern
