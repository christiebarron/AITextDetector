I was out grocery shopping and the line was incredibly long with only a few cashiers open. Looking around I saw a lot of people huffing and puffing, tapping their foot and looking unhappy. I knew it must have been incredibly frustrating to some people who were in a rush so I decided that I would take the opportunity to practice patience.

I started by taking a few deep breaths, and shifted my focus away from the long line and instead tried to take in the sights and sounds around me. I reminded myself that the people working the registers were doing the best they could and weâ€™d all be through eventually.

When it was finally my turn at the register I greeted the woman who was checking me out with a friendly hello and asked how her day was going. We ended up having a nice chat and I learned that she was a single mom and was working two jobs to make ends meet. The interaction lightened the mood for everyone else in line and within 20 minutes we were all finished. 

In that moment I could tell that the practice of patience had made a positive impact on everyone around me. I was glad that I was able to stay calm and understanding in a situation that could have turned chaotic.
