The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is a strange one in that for years the protagonist has been living at home. His father went to see him on the road in the summer when the country was still warm—he also got home to find his father is now divorced. When a cold and cold weather brought on by the coming winter took its toll on all of him, which is an unlikely situation. And when he meets the new 'American-born' a boy is born (the son of his mother's partner in crime, for whom he grew up and is now a 'young man'). The boy is named Joseph.

The boy has a special meaning from those who follow the novel, to those who may have thought of him but did not even know him at the time. A novel that contains so many twists and turns that the reader may have seen from the start that Joseph is never quite the same, and those who read the book will continue to come to doubt. But one by one he brings to life the feelings of the moment. Joseph is always there at heart and loves those around him—always at home and, despite his long life in business, it is at home that he always has an energy about him and is at heart that he gets his start.

But as the novel progresses Joseph remains a mysterious figure, a hero to himself and, at times, like many other African-Americans, a victim of domestic violence in the United States.
