Libraries are places of learning and knowledge, and censorship has no place in them. It is widely accepted that libraries should act as a resource for information and education; one that is free and accessible for all. It is therefore vital that all forms of information are available to the public. 

Censorship in libraries restricts access to certain materials, because someone has deemed them inappropriate or offensive. This is a violation of a person’s right to free speech and a violation of individual choice. In a library setting, people should be able to make decisions about their own reading material and access to different opinions. This includes material with different political, social or religious views that somebody may find offensive. 

Removing materials from the shelves because someone finds them inappropriate, or believes that they promote a certain point of view is not a proper solution. Libraries should instead provide information and education on different topics, in order to more effectively broaden someone’s understanding of a subject and ensure that they can make an informed decision.

Censorship in libraries is therefore a violation of our right to freedom of expression and thought. Rather than removing materials that may be deemed offensive, it is important to provide access to information and a range of perspectives on a given topic. After all, knowledge is power, and censorship restricts an individual’s ability to access a wide range of information, views, and ideas.
