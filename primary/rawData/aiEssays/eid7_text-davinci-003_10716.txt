I remember years ago when I was trying to convince my younger brother to try something new. He was very resistant and kept saying no. My patience was tested because I wanted to ensure he was comfortable. I took a deep breath and allowed myself to reason with him. I mirrored back to him what I was hearing, in order to make sure he was processing my words. I explained the situation in terms I knew he could understand and I did my best to put aside my own frustrations. I eventually got him to give it a try. Seeing how much he enjoyed it was a reminder of the importance of patience!
