The memoir From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, by Narciso Rodriguez, is a work that truly captures the essence of nostalgia and the richness of a culture's shared values. It is a powerful piece of storytelling that narrates the story of a family coming of age throughout multiple generations. The memoir is unique in the fact that it is able to portray and bring to life all of the different generations of the family through the words and musings of Narciso's father, mother, and grandparents.

The mood within the memoir is one of profound reverence and admiration, a sort of solemnity that speaks of the respect held by Narciso and his family for their culture and their past. There is a sense of warmth and love that is connected to all of the memories narrated throughout, even when discussing the difficulties encountered on this journey. There is a light-heartedness in the approach to hardships, a jovial outlook on the moments of joy. The tone is one of a loving embrace, a remembrance of the past that is celebratory and tender, rather than regretful and wistful. 

There is also in this memoir a sense of discovery reminiscent of a sentimental journey. Narciso's longing for his heritage, and a connection to those that have come before him, is evident in each page of the book. His deep appreciation for the values and traditions of his family is also clear, and is highlighted particularly when speaking of his mother's resilience and wisdom
