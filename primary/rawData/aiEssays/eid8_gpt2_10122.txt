One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was playing a game of "Halloween with some cute little girl." You know, in other people's hearts, there will always be those big scary kids with the little guy syndrome, the ones who really believe they are safe, and that a person's right to be happy is absolute. Then there are the ones who think they should be in a position of respect or moral superiority or anything like that. And there are those who think that you can't really be in that position because they are evil to do this to me. And in the world, what's really worrying me about people in the world today is, for everybody who has ever been out of the closet, who has ever been seen in the world, it's probably one of the least desirable behaviors in the world. And because that's what everyone has always thought because they've always thought that everybody loved you, that anyone could be good, that they could not be bad. I actually don't know why it had to be like that.

I remember, I think, it was for people, they would say, "Hey, I'm your kind of man. Well, you know what, I know you don't just have to say good things about me, but that I am not bad or anything like that. Yeah!" But in society, that was not true. And even when the people were like, "Well, that's not good at all!
