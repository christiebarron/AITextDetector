The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. While using the same engines as an open-air train, the dirigibles would have to have some hydraulic fluid in it, which would be difficult to access if this had to wait for aftermarket equipment. So, their solution to this problem was to use something like the piston-foil piston instead of the air-filled cylinder (the standard practice in the Empire State Building). This solved only a problem if the engines were controlled by the hydraulic system inside the air-filled part, which would require the engines to have a hydraulically adjustable piston. Also, they only needed to inject as much oil into the engine as necessary to stop the air-filled part from blowing out after the propeller kicks in, so they wanted only a fraction of the weight of the piston. As noted, you still can make the idea to use pistons in an open-air model.

While there are several differences between the two, it's fair to Romanticize the idea of using the engine when it feels nice and safe to operate in. The problem is, if your aerodynamics are so different from the engines that you decide that they are not for you, it can lead to a serious problem, like the crash of a car if you want the engine to go to a halt on a flat ground. In fact, the only way to drive a car without a big crash is to drive a car
