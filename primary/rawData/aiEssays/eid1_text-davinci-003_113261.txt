Dear Editor,

Over the past several decades, computers have evolved from a tool used primarily by corporations and large businesses to a tool used by almost everyone, including children. Although computers can be an incredibly powerful tool for productivity and innovation, I believe their utilization should be carefully monitored.

The convenience of technology has led to people spending more and more time in front of screens, especially types of screens that have a detrimental effect on our health, such as cell phones and TVs. In turn, this has resulted in increased rates of obesity, poor posture, insomnia, and a decrease in physical activity. In addition, I fear that technology may be contributing to a decreasing attention span and an inability to focus for extended periods of time in people of all ages.

Of course, computers play a large role in our educational system, as well as many of our careers. As such, I think the key to using technology in a healthy way lies in striking a balance between utilizing technology for important work and play, but also taking time away from screens and participating in activities that promote physical and mental health.

By placing limits on the use of technology, we can limit its short-term and long-term harmful effects. I believe that if we make it a priority to encourage individuals to adopt healthy habits for using technology, the positive effects of computers can be truly appreciated.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
