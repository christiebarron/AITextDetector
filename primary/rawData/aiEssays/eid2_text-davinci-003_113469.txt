Recently, there has been a great deal of debate regarding censorship in libraries. In particular, many are questioning whether certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from available shelves if they are found to be offensive. While it can be argued that all forms of censorship should not be tolerated and parental discretion should be trusted, there is a definite need for censorship in libraries.

A library’s primary purpose is to provide its patrons with access to knowledge. Therefore, it behooves libraries to provide only materials that are not only informative but also socially acceptable. Library patrons are varied and include children; therefore, libraries should not provide materials that could be negative influences on young minds. Furthermore, libraries should provide materials that both respect and reflect the values and mores of their community.

Censorship of certain materials does not necessarily mean that those materials are not available, only that they are accessible based upon qualifications, such as proper identification or age. This is an effective way to keep libraries from becoming dens of iniquity and ensures that the materials that are made available are suited to the appropriate age or maturity level of the patron.

In short, censorship must be considered as a viable means of keeping library patrons safe and ensuring that the appropriate materials, as deemed by the library or community, are readily available. It is a means of curating the library’s materials in a way that is beneficial to those who patronize it
