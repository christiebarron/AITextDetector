Censorship in libraries is a contentious issue, and one that deserves to be discussed openly and honestly. The right to access materials of any kind is a hallmark of democracy, and libraries should remain open forums for both knowledge and entertainment.

However, there should be limits on what libraries allow patrons to access with regard to materials deemed offensive. While libraries should never mandate that any type of book, CD, DVD, or magazine be removed from their shelves due to its content, they should take proactive steps to establish guidelines for acceptable material. Libraries should never be forced by public opinion or government bodies to ban a book or type of media from their collections, but they should ensure that patrons are aware of its presence and that it is only accessible to those of a certain age. 

In addition to setting appropriate parameters for content, libraries should strive to provide patrons with ample information about the material they are perusing. Libraries should prioritize material that is current and incorporates later research, and encourages patrons to reach out to library staff for recommendations.   

Ultimately, libraries should do their best to maintain their position as the cornerstone of democracy, providing an open forum for the exchange of ideas free from censorship. While it is important for libraries to set limits on what materials are deemed acceptable, it is also important for libraries to make sure these limits are never so strict as to stifle creativity or intellectual curiosity.
