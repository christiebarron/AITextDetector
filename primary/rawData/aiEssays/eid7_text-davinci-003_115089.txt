I remember one time when I was riding the bus on my way to work. The bus was filled to capacity and people were standing up and sitting in the aisles. Since I walk with a cane and could not stand up, I remained seated. 

I was sitting next to a young man who seemed to be in a hurry, rocking back and forth and sighing impatiently. I could tell he was getting irritated and frustrated, so I simply tried to be still and keep to myself. After a few stops, a group of elderly passengers boarded, along with a woman in a wheelchair.

I stood up and offered my seat to the elderly woman, who gladly accepted it. The young man got up as well and with a wave of his hand politely offered his seat to the passenger in the wheelchair. Though I'm sure he was still rushing off to work, he was patient enough to recognize that others were in need of the seat. I thought it was such a kind gesture. 

I stayed standing, balancing my cane with one hand and a handle above the window with the other, until I got off at my stop. That young man was a perfect example of patience in the face of difficulty. He was so kind and understanding, even when he was likely running late.
