An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when the world was a bit too busy. This was like, we would all be out on this mission and people would be watching us. When I would ask, "Are you okay?" they'd say, "Might not be so right, but I'm fine."

As I mentioned in my last piece, this is the reality that the world has become. The world is not simply a mess, but a great deal smaller. There are countless more things of value in the world that are not included in it; from automobiles to clothing to healthcare to food to drugs to toys to sports teams. We are still a small place. This is a great message to all human beings, from the scientists to the entrepreneurs to the students. And there is hope. The future of humankind will be determined by the strength of that strength and our continued determination to give back.
