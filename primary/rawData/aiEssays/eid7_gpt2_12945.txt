An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a lady who was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. They were taking drugs to alleviate her symptoms. All around me was her brain. They told me to take it and try to talk. She told me I wasn't a good listener. It was frightening because they said you can't even listen if you put a drink in. She knew I could help, the doctor told me to stop. She kept saying that I wasn't sure I wanted to be depressed. So I said, I'm sorry. He kept going and coming back with a different plan. I'm not going back. I'll see someone soon. I'm not sure what she saw. Then he came back that evening and asked if I was sober. I couldn't drink. He wanted me to take that drug. I couldn't take the drug. He called me and he said she didn't know if I was in treatment. How dare she. She said, I don't know. She told me he gave me the drug because he thought I was a criminal. He wanted her to think I was trying to steal. She didn't understand how he'd treat people like that. So I asked her why she didn't think I was a bad listener. I asked her if she wasn't telling me. She said people think bad people are very hard to see. I was convinced she wasn't talking to me. I told her if she knew he was a bad listener
