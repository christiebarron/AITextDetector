Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

To summarize these considerations:

• A bike is on its way from the top of the road to the bottom

• You must be careful for people making a stop in front of you

• You should stand and maintain speed and keep your arms crossed

• Your arms should be wide enough to move your legs

• When getting out of the crosswalk, you should lean to the left or right of the cyclist

There are a number of reasons for this, including:

• It makes for better eye contact which can be useful during manoeuvres

• It can leave the cyclist exposed to danger

• If you move your arms outside the bike you can lose the advantage of being able to walk in the opposite direction.

However, if you move your arms outside the bike to get out of the road you will be able to help make the crosswalk more safe for cyclists and pedestrians.

As you work at it, you can see you can still do a good job taking up space.

You also may need a more aggressive approach.

A few words from the author:

This is just a small, small study, so it's not hard to understand if it applies to anyone. In addition, it may have significant implications for cycling in general.
