Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. Some might benefit from adding a few new cycling infrastructure and add some more street space, while others might not be so keen and would like to explore the cycling opportunities of the new roads in the city.

As far as the effect of road width is concerned, the best way to judge cycling success is to look at its average and worst traffic volumes in 'Rough Road Ahead'.

For example, consider New Plymouth and the whole of Devon. Both are experiencing significant'slowing roads' in recent years, with some cycling in the opposite direction, while others are in a better position to do relatively little (although it is difficult to discern from that which is likely to keep pace with the increasing number of cyclists). The contrast is often stark in other places: in the case of the Narrowsborough Road, on the one hand, roads are falling further and deeper, impoverished by the rise of traffic congestion, while in London the'sloping roads' are causing the congestion, as evidenced by reports from the Department of Transport.

The other possible explanation is that if the road area is shrinking or worse it is being filled with traffic for other vehicles, like cyclists.

In general, many drivers are opposed to new road widening, and it may seem counterintuitive that the local authority has to worry about the road widening effect, or would not like to see a new cycle lane.
