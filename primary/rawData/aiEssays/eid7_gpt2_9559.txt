An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a patient on the hospice floor of New Orleans. She was a patient whose death had cost much, much less than she would have gotten if she'd left her family. We were patient in that one instance. When we were there I was a patient, but this patient's life had been ruined by a hospital accident (a tragic accident and one of the most unfortunate things in all of life). She became sick and died just a few weeks later in the hospital and then went over to the hospice. I don't know what my experience was like on that occasion. I had done some rehab so I could get better. That's what I wanted out of my rehab, so I got a nice good rehab counselor here at the hospital and that sort of helped me, too.

So in hindsight we can say I did an amazing job for my family. I was able to help them with their family, and I still am. I'm really proud of my staff. I feel I've done more with the staff and with patients, and I get this sense by now "wow" of how far she has come so far. The patient-staff relations in the hospital and with the staff have brought about a lot of benefits for patients, and for myself and for my family. The people who work there are the same people now.

I am lucky to have been with my family and to have known them. There
