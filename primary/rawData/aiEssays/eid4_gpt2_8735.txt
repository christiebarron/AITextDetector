The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it takes the narrative to a whole new level. That means the characters and the world.

What you're describing is the whole, new dynamic of life in a world that no-one ever knows or knows not about. That's one of the challenges of writing a biography of one of your biggest characters in the world, a famous actor who has spent the last 20 years leading a campaign for a Democratic presidential nomination, a beloved family, a great teacher. He has lost his family and career. Now, on his last night in the White House, he meets a young boy called Charlie.

That is what this was like back then at my time of writing Summer Hibiscus. And it's kind of what it was back then. Charlie's the father of a beautiful son and father of a sister. He came from an American family and he just wanted to make sure he had all the things he needed to earn his livelihood and earn some implicitly. And it did. I think everyone at the school was very passionate about being able to help out Charlie. So they made a big deal out of it but not to the same extent as they did when they were making that pitch.

I'm not sure that's true anymore.

I'm not able to go back to that conversation because I have to keep working. Right now, those are all the stories I write every day.

I really appreciate
