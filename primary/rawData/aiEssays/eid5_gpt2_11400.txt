The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is something I would have liked in our lifetime to see in our children. We love books and life is a wonderful place to grow up. Some of their stories have been good, but it's great to see so much positive things happening that make us happy.

She started work on her next book, a nonfiction story about the family that we all know and I know many of you will also love.

As she looks back, I do hope people will read yours as much as she has.

Her memoir 'From Home is available in English and the New Yorker.'
