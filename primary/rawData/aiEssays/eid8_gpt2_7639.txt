One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I used to laugh about all the time the whole time. I had my little son who is now 19 years old. We were running errands when the whole town looked at the car driven right by us. One of the men threw a couple of stones into the car and told us not to cry. It was a slap to the face. The police asked us if we were joking so we said that we were doing it. Then the policeman said: "We were just being aggressive." At that time I was trying to hide my anger when he threatened to put me in jail and I called a friend who explained to me that was true. The woman says we are trying to talk about the girl on video. Now I'm sitting at 12 and a half hours. I was like 'Oh my God, look at this!' I said, "Yes, but I don't like it at all. I'm from the countryside so I'm not like people from the countryside where we cry.'" But the girl said: "The policeman said: 'I didn't see the girl in the video but no, I saw your face.' I said: 'Yes." It felt like an apology even to myself because when I saw this girl who was talking to me on stage she was not talking about me at all."

My parents told me and another person that a taxi will be here now. They were all happy to see the girl as well
