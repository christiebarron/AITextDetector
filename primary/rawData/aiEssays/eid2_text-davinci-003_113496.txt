The issue of censorship within library walls is an important one. As keepers of knowledge and sources of information, libraries have always been a bastion of free-thought and open discussion. It’s therefore crucial that we protect this right by refraining from removing materials from library shelves if they are deemed to contain offensive content.

By introducing censorship into libraries, especially when it comes to books, music, movies, and magazines, we risk reducing the range of content available. This limits our access to information from a wide range of perspectives, and could make it hard for library users to gain a well-rounded understanding of any given issue, particularly those which are more contentious.

Rather than considering censorship in libraries, it’s important to look for ways to combat prejudice and bigotry within our society. Removing offensive books from the shelves puts a Band-Aid on a much deeper problem. Libraries should provide a safe, accepting environment where everybody is welcome. When users encounter materials related to topics such as racism, sexism, and other forms of discrimination, librarians should be on-hand to provide guidance and support.

This is not to say that librarians should not have final say regarding which materials are available to library users. But instead of exercising blanket censorship they should be actively engaged in thoughtfully reviewing each piece of material and making an informed decision on its appropriateness.

Ultimately, libraries should remain a source of free information and unrestricted knowledge
