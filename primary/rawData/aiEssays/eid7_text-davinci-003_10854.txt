I was at the store one day, and I had been waiting in line for what felt like hours. It was taking forever, and I was starting to get frustrated and impatient. I was just about to give up on the line when the woman in front of me had a problem with her purchase; the cashier had to stop everything and run to the back to double-check the item.

I was ready to lose it. I took a deep breath and I reminded myself to be patient. I told myself that it was more important for this woman to get what she needed than for me to get out of the store quickly. So even though I was getting impatient, I didn't let it show. I smiled and kept my cool as the cashier went off to check the item.

The woman eventually got what she needed and the line started moving again. When it was my turn at the counter, the cashier thanked me for my patience. I was glad I had been patient. It felt good to help out someone else and to be patient even in the most frustrating of situations.
