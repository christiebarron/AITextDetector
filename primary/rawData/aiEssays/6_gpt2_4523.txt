The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first was the construction of a system called the "battleneck," in which airplanes could only go to and from one location. According to a new study cited by TIME, the battleneck allowed dirigibles to operate only from its "layers of control" — in fact, most people could just place their hands on the buttons and it worked. To prevent this, the Pentagon opened its battleneck after the Pentagon built a hangar for the World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C.

Of course, the battleneck was also a major obstacle for the first commercial airline flying airplanes through the space. The first plane to fly through this battleneck (called JPL-1), headed toward the moon, was the Space Shuttle Endeavour—an ambitious attempt by commercial airlines to do the same thing, and to prove that commercial flight would never get the same kind of public support as manned missions. But while the Commercial Airplanes Act of 1966 gave commercial space travelers the ability to safely fly over the moon for free, JPL-1 wasn't yet built.

If JPL-1 hadn't existed, JPL-2 would have been built over a mountain and would have launched into the outer reaches of the Moon. Since JPL-2 was in orbit not in one of
