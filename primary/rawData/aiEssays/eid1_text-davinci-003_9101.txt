Dear Editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people in today’s society. As computers have become increasingly ubiquitous over the past few decades, people's lives have changed drastically, for both better and for worse. 

On the plus side, computers facilitate countless activities that would otherwise be out of reach for many people. The educational benefits provided by computers, for example, are limitless; anyone can access a wealth of learning material online and gain knowledge which would otherwise require physical books, research, and tutors. This is especially helpful to those living in rural regions, who may not have access to libraries or highly-trained teachers in their area. Additionally, computers enable quick and intuitive communication with others around the world, so that exchanging information and staying in touch is easier than ever.

At the same time, however, it is important to be mindful of the potential downsides of computers. For instance, excessive use of technologies like social media can be damaging to one’s physical and mental health; sometimes, people may experience physical pain or increased anxiety levels as a result of staring at screens for extended periods of time. Additionally, computers and the internet threaten traditional social interaction; people's lives can quickly become centered around the hype and convenience of online conversations, leading to an overall decrease in physical engagement with others, as well as a decreased attention span.

In conclusion, computers are an incredible tool for global communication and
