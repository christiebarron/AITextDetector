The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because the writer's intention is clearly not to engage in dialogue with its central character, a brilliant, and deeply flawed and very good character. In that respect, it's a masterpiece.


By the time I read Winter Hibiscus, I already had an idea of the plot. Here all I wanted was that I'd start to understand more about it in a more detail. This novel will do just that.
