I believe that censorship of materials in libraries and universities is a key factor in reducing online safety," Mr. White said.

Mr. Minsky warned that if governments continue using repressive methods commanded by a handful of wealthy and powerful institutions, such as the military and the police, they will inevitably become unruly, especially when they target young and minority groups. And he cautioned that free speech may not stop if governments become more repressive.

Critics call such tactics unconstitutional, because they are often implemented to restrict the right of individuals and groups to create information about the world around them. By the same token, Mr. Minsky said, governments often seek to censor information on the Internet.

"This is very difficult to defend in courts where some laws are very difficult to defend and others are difficult to prosecute," he said. "When a government uses a particular speech law that they intend to use, it is not the person who is inciting or promoting such speech."

One way of deterring such tactics, Mr. Minsky suggested, is to not use such laws.

"If you want to censor your web site, you can restrict access to it until they ban it," Mr. Minsky said. "If you want people to feel safe, you can put laws that allow those who fear for that protection in place."
