One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was 13 years old. A woman who lived in my neighborhood was playing and she told me, "You look like a clown. You look like a clown and you're going to have trouble with me because you're such a slut." I replied, "But you're not slut, you're not even getting your due and so she's going to go fuck you. You have to do it over and over and over and over." Then she was like the slut who gets her money for a while and then gets angry and you can see now how much the problem she is is in relation to you and your children.

The worst thing is she's in charge of her own money - they're the problem.

The average person will tell you if they get any sort of income then they're in control, but those who don't get a bit of it, don't have families or they're going through life struggling so the people who get it are not getting it when they want it.

You go from being able to own a home or a car or a car, to being able to buy your own car that's taken a couple thousand of dollars of money off the market, to being able to buy a home that's in an expensive deal to get an asset for your kids that you didn't think was going to go by when you wanted it.

It's all about people - they're in control
