Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. So far, I have focused on the two above:

Firstly, the 'Downtown' - not just the one in the north of it, but also more centrally to the centre of London - is set very high, especially in places like Canary Wharf, and then further down Quart Road in Kensington. It's a great spot to start and can't beat the bike traffic there at all.

Alternatively, the 'Gran Turismo' - or even slightly higher - is set quite low, so you need to look at what you can do with it and adjust the distance. Again, it doesn't matter whether you are running the 'Stairway' or even a 'Short Cut' like I described before in the previous sections.


And just for fun, if you want the best ride, this is exactly what you will see. With a couple of different options for the bikes on the ground - some have a different 'Rope System' to change out the road and others simply have a bit of a new-style track which will take more, and is not as straight and wide as I had been expecting. I will have more to add when I have the time.


These two options can be combined for a more complete ride if you want, but I do recommend that you only use them if you have an additional option which will significantly affect the bike
