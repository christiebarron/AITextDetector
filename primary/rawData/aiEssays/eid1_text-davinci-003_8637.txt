I was with my best friend, who I had known since elementary school, walking down the street laughing over some hilarious thing that had happened that day. We had a knack for making each other laugh, so we were doubled over walking down the street. Suddenly, a woman walking in the opposite direction stopped and smiled at us.

"What's so funny?" she asked us.

We giggled and tried to explain, but the more we tried, the harder we laughed. My friend and I eventually managed to tell her the story between fits of laughter, and the woman was soon laughing right along with us. Despite being strangers, we all shared a really wonderful moment, bonding over our mutual amusement. 

Just as quickly as it had come, the moment was over, and the woman waved goodbye with a warm smile on her face. It was then that I realized how much laughter can bring two people together, no matter the circumstances.  It was a moment I will never forget.
