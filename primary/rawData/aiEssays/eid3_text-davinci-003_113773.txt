In Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead," the features of the setting create an environment of peril and danger for the cyclist. For starters, the road is very hilly, winding, and difficult to traverse. This creates a physical barrier for the cyclist, as he is constantly dodging rocks and other obstacles on the road, which requires him to be on high alert and constantly adjusting the bike's speed and direction.

The weather also plays a role in the cyclist's challenge. In the story, the weather is foggy and raining, hindering visibility and making the roads even slicker. This makes the rider's skill and agility even more necessary to navigate the road's turns and corners. 

The cyclist is also navigating the road in a time of war and in a place where there is little to no help. The cyclist's vulnerability is heightened by the fact that he is all alone without anyone he can turn to in case of a breakdown. This raises the stakes throughout the story and adds to the cyclist's sense of danger.

The setting in "Rough Road Ahead" challenges the cyclist but also helps him understand the importance of being prepared for any situation. The idea of surviving a journey through an environment of such danger speaks to the resilience of human spirit and the determination of the cyclist. Despite the obstacles, the cyclist remains determined and ultimately succeeds in his journey.
