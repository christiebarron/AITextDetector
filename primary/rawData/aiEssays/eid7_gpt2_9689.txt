An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my grandmother. I found her at work, and after we were both home for some time, she was walking with the other person to my grandmother's house. My grandmother told me that her sister, who was working at the time, saw what had happened. She called her sister and said 'Mommy, was anyone hurt?' My grandma came over to see me, and told me the same thing. So I called his niece, and she said 'Mommy, it's not the family and you don Kahn. The police can't find you. Have your paperwork.' I called the police. They say we didn't talk to anyone. They say there were times when they came over at her house, went to the window to see if anyone was there. They said 'No' or something like that. The doctor, who worked there, said there was a black man in a dark jacket that was there. I didn't know who the black guy was. There was no black man there. The doctor said you shouldn't have told428 in that part.So the police were at your house on the last night who were there, and said 'you should call the police', who didn't seem like they were on guard, but called everyone. My aunt, dad, brother, sisters, auntie. They told us they would check in with whoever had left a message on the door, and that it was gone. So
