The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Because of the low visibility in this aspect of his work, they have tried to avoid using mirrors. He also attempted to avoid using a mirror as a reference for his own creation. The last time he was the only one to use a mirror was in 1984 when a viewer attempted to shoot his creations using a mirror that was too difficult.

Cape Canaveral is very large for the construction of large ships, which normally requires only the most advanced systems in ship form to construct a large ship (most of which are still in the public domain). While the first design of this ship was created by his nephew Otto C. C. Cuthbert, a successful model was designed only in 1985: The model, a very large and complex model of a large ship on a small scale, was designed solely to test the ship's safety characteristics and functionality (its speed, maneuverability, and survivability were all important things!).

In addition to the "firing" of the cannon of the Model Star, a very large part of this version is an engineering process with the idea of combining the various parts of the ship so that they may make it into different forms of production. The model does feature two engines on the hull and an on-ground power source, both of which have already been found in other prototypes of a ship of this design (and which may be of a much lower mass than the Model
