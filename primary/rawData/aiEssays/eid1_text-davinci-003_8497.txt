I recently had a situation at work where my boss asked me to complete a project but didn't provide very clear instructions. It was frustrating because I wanted to do the best job possible but wasn't sure what he wanted. However, rather than getting angry or complaining I decided to take a patient approach.

I asked my boss to clarify exactly what he wanted me to do and then I made sure I read and re-read his instructions. Once I had a better understanding of what he wanted, I took my time and methodically worked through the project step-by-step. I didn't rush or take shortcuts and I took the time to double-check my work and make sure it met all the requirements.

I was rewarded for my patience. My boss was very pleased with my work and the project ended up being a success. By taking the time to be patient and understand what was needed, the situation ended up working out for everyone involved.
