The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The design offered a space where the cockpit could not be moved around due to the immense weight of the shoulder-mounted cameras mounted on the towers.

In 1913 the Federal Government adopted a plan to make a single-rotor aircraft that was to be able to dock off the Empire State Building on more than 2,000 square miles of land and was to cost approximately $35 million. The project was to be financed by the Federal Government or an affiliate of the Federal National Bank under the federal Civilian Rail Act to be held under a series of trust funds to be used for the construction of such aircraft. However, in its report titled "Federal Aviation Development Plans", the Federal Government wrote:

"The Federal Aviation Administration is aware of the possibility of future commercial uses for dirigibles for the Transportation of Transportation, but is actively working with State and local governments to develop and pursue the program in the near future."

A Boeing 757 with built engines and the first of the 9 Series was built in the 1930s.

A total of 728 B-29's were built between 1930 and 1941.
