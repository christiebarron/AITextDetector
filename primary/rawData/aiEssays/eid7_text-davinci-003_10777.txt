I was recently in line at the grocery store when the person in front of me had a huge list of items and was trying to pay with a check. The cashier was not familiar with it and the customer was becoming increasingly frustrated. Despite the situation, I remained patient and understanding. I could tell by the look on the customer's face that they were feeling overwhelmed, so I simply smiled and kept my cool.

The cashier continued to struggle to process the check but I didn't say anything. After what felt like eternity, the transaction finally went through and the customer quickly gathered their items and walked away.

I was happy to have helped the customer keep their cool during this tricky situation. Instead of getting frustrated or yelling at the cashier, I just kept my patience and allowed the situation to work itself out.
