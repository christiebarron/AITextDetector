I was in line at the bank recently, and the person in front of me began to get frustrated. It seemed that her transaction was taking longer than the others. She was tapping her foot, sighing loudly, and mumbling to herself. Whenever the teller asked her a question, she answered in short frustrated tones.

Once it was finally her turn, the teller apologized and kindly asked her to bear with him as he carefully revised her application. Instead of getting even more short-tempered, the woman caught herself and apologized for her mood. 

She then told the teller that it was alright, and that she could take her time as there was no rush. I was amazed by her sudden change in attitude; she had gone from being visibly frustrated to patient and understanding. It showed me that, when faced with a difficult situation, remaining patient and polite can go a long way.
