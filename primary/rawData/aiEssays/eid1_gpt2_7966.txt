Computers have many effects on people. They increase the size of their brains in response to external stimulation, especially during the early stages of cognitive processes such as memory retrieval and social interaction. One of the most common effects of computers on people is social manipulation, since it changes how people view the world. According to neuroscientist Daphne Ponskine, this can be found both with and without computers. She explains how computers can alter the way many different human social systems function. "We are always looking for mechanisms that can change the ways that individuals feel about their environment. What do I see in computers – such as the ability to make decisions based on intuition – that can, when I am interacting with others? Such changes are subtle and are far from expected. It is a fact that social networks or social robots become more and more influential over the course of the moment."

One of the most notable of these effects is the social ability of humans. The more information people send into a computer, the more likely they will share it with other humans. This might even be a good thing for our planet as well – this knowledge might influence how other members of our species respond to others, creating different social conditions for new species. According to Dr Ponskine and other neuroscientists, this sort of learning might have been possible even more than the usual methods such as GPS or drones, which are based on previous studies such as previous work from Dr Seuss who has explored the
