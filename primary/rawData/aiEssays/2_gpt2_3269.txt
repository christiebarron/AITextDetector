I believe that censorship of materials in libraries in order to facilitate the development of technology is, ultimately, counterproductive. There is an understanding that the best way to prevent or address censorship is to make it impossible for library users to find and discover materials for their content.

Here is how the Library of Congress (LAC) defines censorship on Wikipedia.

Wikipedia is the world's leading encyclopedia and has over 1.85 billion unique visitors. Wikipedia was created in 1871 by a group of Wikipedia editors who gathered together and reviewed dozens of articles about the world. More than Style Guides came out in the late twentieth century and they were used primarily to promote information. The LAC definition of what constitutes a "matter of fact" is set by the United States Congress.

How is a Wikipedia "matter of fact?" It is defined as: "Anything which, within the scope of a work or work's official classification, is in any way harmful, malicious, illegal, misleading, libelous or disruptive, offensive, defamatory or libelous." An article must have an explicit description of its subject, including how it is to be used or how it should be used. Also, it must be listed, such as "pandering, bad faith or falsehood, political opinion, or otherwise. If a work or work is 'pandering, bad faith or falsehood' and its description has any connection to its subject, any content must be listed on the article's page."
