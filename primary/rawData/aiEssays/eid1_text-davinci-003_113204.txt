Dear [Editor], 

I am writing to express my opinion of the effects computers have had on people and to attempt to persuade the readers to agree with me.

Today’s computers offer both positive and negative influences on people’s lives. The positive effects that computers bring are hard to deny. For instance, the availability of online resources has greatly expanded our ability to learn about virtually any subject imaginable. Additionally, computers have provided us with convenient ways to communicate. We can easily communicate with people from all over the world quickly and effortlessly.

However, the negative effects the computer has on people are often overlooked. Computers often cause people to become less physically active, which can lead to an increase in obesity. They also have encouraged people to become more isolated from one another, as people are now able to get their social needs met through online interactions.

Ultimately, while there are certainly some positives to the effect computers have had on people, overall they have been more damaging than helpful. I urge readers to consider both the positives and negatives of computers before making any decisions about them.  

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
