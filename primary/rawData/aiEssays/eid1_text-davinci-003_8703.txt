I remember when I first met my neighbor, Joe. We had recently moved into our new house and I had spotted Joe working on his front lawn. I waved hello and he cheerfully waved back.

The next day I decided to approach him to introduce myself, however I was too nervous to make the first move. As I reached the gate I put my hands behind my back and began to fiddle with my shirt as I stumbled on my words. 

Suddenly Joe started laughing. I had to laugh too, and before I knew it we were both laughing hysterically at our awkwardness. We were strangers and yet I felt like I'd known him for years.  

After that day, Joe and I became close friends. Whenever we chatted, we always enjoyed a good hearty laugh at least once. Our laughter was the bridge between us, and the bond it created was strong and unbreakable. 

Through laughter, Joe and I became more than just acquaintances. We were like brothers who shared a deep and meaningful connection.
