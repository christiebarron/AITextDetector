The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho provides a larger message through its imagery of growth, hope, and perseverance. The narrator of the story is reflecting on an important decision they have to make: to take a difficult test. While the narrator may be anxious about the test, they realize after seeing the hibiscus bush outside in the snow that they should not be afraid to take risks, because even small buds of life, like the hibiscus, can continue to grow despite setbacks. The narrator believes that by symbolically waiting for the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return, they will once again be reminded of the persistence and strength of life. They also hope that when they take the test, the hibiscus will be in full bloom as a positive reminder of not giving up.
