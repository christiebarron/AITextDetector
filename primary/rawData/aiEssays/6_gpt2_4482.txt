The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. On the one hand, they used propane and were able to prevent the air from escaping out of the building. On the other hand, once they were able to get the air out of the building, the air was compressed and the material would fall apart.

The first step in allowing a large-scale dirigible to dock in the Empire State Building was to put the aircraft under pressure. Most of the air in the building was pushed into the aircraft, thereby increasing the number of problems that arose. One of these was that air from a small-scale dirigible was compressed, thus reducing its mass. This gave the aircraft its smaller mass and reduced its relative density. Eventually, because of this, the size of the aircraft and the size of the pressure on the pressure was reduced. When that went away, the air within the building was very, very compressed.

The following photos were taken at the time of the collapse of the building at L.O. No. 3.

The air in the Empire State Building

The Air Force took some photos. These were taken during World War II with the Empire State Building at a height of 11 stories, which meant that it was nearly impossible for the Empire State Building to handle the size of that building at the time. The photos were taken during an emergency and only from a small area at L.O. No. 2.
