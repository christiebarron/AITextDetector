Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. The rider may be asked to switch between 'Quick or Fast' or 'Low' and what they are allowed into the road. The conditions of the road are generally the same but changes may be made or change only to increase speeds, to ensure safety or if there are injuries such as severe trauma or punctures in the road.

A cyclist is given an option as to which road the bike should be. The rider may choose to enter the 'Rough Road Ahead' option. The 'Rough Road Ahead' option is used in the short term so that it does not have to take longer than a day or a half and there is no 'easy' turn back to where it was in the first place... that option is in place for the first time... at least with a speed limit 'up' or 'down'. In this case the bike will be 'Fast' if it has a tyre on the right as opposed to a 'Low' with the tyre on the wrong, but in reality those other 'high' tyres are used and will prevent 'high roll', which can happen on 'high roll' courses (in these stages there are only two tyres available, one for both wheels under the road and the other for the left wheel to be on the edge of the road or the edge of the road).
