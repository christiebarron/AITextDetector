An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my husband being ill after being laid flat during a work trip. The next day he complained of pneumonia and I called the ambulance to see if he was OK. I called him back and was told he would be OK. I asked if he didn't think I was really sick just to get him out of bed just so he could get out. He said never. I said why I didn't think I was ill I really wanted to help someone and wanted to get him out of bed so there might be something I could help but I didn't think he was sick. When he came out I was trying to play catch-up on doing my job but I kept saying I wouldn't do it and he told me I was not a fool but that I'd just go get him out of bed and then he'd leave. Just so I understood what he was doing when he came back and told me to keep this up he was just being silly.


I remember at the hospital as the paramedics came to check on my husband he told me he was going to run for cover and the paramedics said he had a pulse.

I was in a state of exhaustion and needed to be there for him to get down to the hospital. The paramedics were not there and I thought I was dead.

I was able to take him over to his room but the carer didn't know what to do. I thought I would lose
