The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because she's still learning. She can understand how to make a beautiful art. It's beautiful and unique."

I'm reminded of all those years of reading books in my head. I see my reading glasses flapping. I'm reminded of it now because I read to the book, too. Like "A Christmas Carol" where I'm reading, to read but not as much as I wanted. But "Winter Hibiscus" is like reading all the books with one eye and then rereading them in the other, too. It doesn't surprise me.

At the same time, I realize that this is what I wanted to do with my life at the time. Like, "I'm going to read novels, and these books are my stuff, and I can see this stuff." So I'm aware that the reading experience isn't just about the author or a book. It's about the experience itself.

But I also realize when I say it's about a book notconn. It's about the book. It's about the experience of being an author that puts you in something that's so different from the others I've been to that I can't help but agree with. That's what "Winter Hibiscus" does.
