The memoir From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez captures the struggles of a first-generation American in search of his identity. Rodriguez was born in Newark, New Jersey to Cuban immigrant parents, and the memoir weaves together stories of his youth in the United States with tales of his extended family in Cuba. The memoir creates a mood of nostalgia, loss, and longing, reflected in the many photos throughout the book.

Throughout the memoir, Rodriguez reflects on his Cuban heritage, lamenting the difficulties of growing up as a second-generation immigrant. He writes often of the emotional turmoil that he endured upon moving to the U.S. and of his struggles to embrace his identity as an American-born Cuban. He recounts the feeling of being an outsider in both countries, noting the feeling of having "no real sense of home". This sentiment is particularly strong in his description of his first trip to Cuba, where he was confronted with the harsh realities of living under a communist regime. 

The sentiment of nostalgia for his Cuban roots and loss of connection to his homeland is a recurring theme in the memoir. Rodriguez reflects on the many ways in which Cuban culture has shaped his life, from the music he loves to the food he eats. These memories serve to remind him of his Cuban ancestors and of the cultural traditions that have become part of who he is.
