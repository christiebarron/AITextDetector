Dear Editor, 

Iâ€™m writing to you to express my opinion regarding the effects computers have on people. In my opinion, the use of computers has become an integral part of our lives. We rely on them for almost every aspect of our life, from communication, to learning, to finding a job. Despite this, there are still those who believe that computers can be harmful.

I disagree with this notion. Computers provide many benefits to our lives. They enable us to easily access and analyze information, which can help us make more informed decisions. They also provide us with opportunities to interact with people from all over the world. Moreover, computers make learning easier and more efficient, as they offer resources that can be used to enhance our knowledge. Moreover, computers have become increasingly important in the job market. Whether one is looking for a job or is already employed, computers can help find additional opportunities and make working life more efficient.

Therefore, I believe that we should not be afraid of the effects computers have on us. Instead, we should embrace the potential of these tools. With the help of computers, we have unprecedented access to a wide range of resources that can help us succeed in our daily life.

I hope I have been able to persuade you to agree with me and that everyone will benefit from using computers. 

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
