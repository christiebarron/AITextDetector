The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first obstacle was a lack of space, which was the primary reason the dome could not accommodate 100 people. This was only solved with the idea that the Empire State Building could only be used with 500 people. Also, the dome was smaller and had a raised ceiling on its interior that could be angled to prevent guests from falling through. While the Empire State Building featured the most common elements, there were some special items available, such as the large blue "Breath of the Earth," which gave the interior two lights.

The second obstacle, was the lack of seating. In order to accommodate 200 people, the Empire State Building needed to be taller, meaning a different space for each person. This required the addition of two "barricades." The upper tiers of the new domes required the use of two additional bars. In the old Empire State Building, the "Barricades" provided seating on either side of the domes. The barrons were located in the upper tier like in the elevator above the main stage; once the barrons were installed to the main stage, they could be dropped horizontally, giving each person an optimal seat. In the present Empire State Building, the barrons were installed at two elevations in the upper tier. In order to accommodate 200 people, the barrons needed to be taller, meaning they had to be in the center.
