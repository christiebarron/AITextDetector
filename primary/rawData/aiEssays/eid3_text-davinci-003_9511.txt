In the short story "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski, the first person narrator, a cyclist, gives us a vivid description of the many challenges and features of his setting. The oppressive heat of the June sun and the swirling dust form an oppressive blanket of misery for the cyclist. He feels as if his life is slowly being sapped away as he and his bike struggle for a foothold on the heavily pothole-ridden road.

At the same time, he is also enthralled by the beauty of the scene. The golden rays of the sun bring a warmth to the episode, and there is a sense of awe and admiration for the never-ending horizon. The wonderful immense blue sky, the empty beauty of the desolate desert, the quiet serenity of the terrain, and the challenge of the rugged road provide the cyclist with a sense of accomplishment for tackling the arduous journey.

The terrain also heightens the senses of the cyclist. The wheel rattles, and the bike wobbles every time it hits a particularly rough part of the road, but the cyclist's passion for the vista keeps him going. He has to focus on surviving the treacherous conditions while allowing himself to be in awe with the majestic landscape.

The cyclist is proud of himself for meeting and overcoming the challenges the setting has presented. The physical hardship and the emotional moments of overcoming the hostile environment have toughened him up, increased his appreciation for the outdoors
