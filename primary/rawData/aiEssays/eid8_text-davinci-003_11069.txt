I was visiting my family in my hometown. My cousins and I had always been very close, growing up like siblings, so it was always a fun time with us together. We decided to rent a house near the beach one summer and spend a few weeks there. 

On the first night, we all prepared a big feast and the energy was lively. We were in the middle of telling a funny story when suddenly my cousin Jack started cracking up. He couldn't stop laughing and soon the rest of us caught onto it and started laughing along with him. 

We had no idea what had set him off, he just kept going, laughing uncontrollably. We all just sat around the table forming a laughing chain, all the way around. 

Finally Jack managed to calm down just enough to tell us what had started itâ€”he had made a silly face that no one had seen and the look on our faces had triggered uncontrollable laughter.

It was such an innocent and silly moment, but sometimes that's the best kind. We all continued our conversation, filled with more laughter, of course, and enjoyed a wonderful night together. From that night onward, whenever one of us had a feeling of being down, we'd just look at each other and start laughing, reminding us of that special moment.
