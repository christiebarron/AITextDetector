One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I discovered an old friend who knew a lot more about the language than I did. He told me, "The best way to be happy is by writing poetry. Do it to me and I can be happy. I'm not writing, I'm writing to you." (He could have sworn he saw a bright spark in me when he wrote it, but instead wrote for me because his imagination just ran wild. I was inspired by him as much. He taught me that writing is life. So I'm going to get my hands on the best story I have ever read and find another way.urryout)
