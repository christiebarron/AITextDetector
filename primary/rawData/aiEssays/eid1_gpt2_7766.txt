Well I bet that would happen if people worked more efficiently or less slowly using their machines. On a technical level, however, most of these ideas Colour and other related technologies don't have as much impact on human behaviour as we might expect. As we all know that computers are pretty much the only computer. We get the same human behaviour (especially how to get things done efficiently) that they do for humans with various other computers. You just don't get much more work done using them. We don't get much done using them and our time spent getting things done in their world often ends up spent on making things for machines.
