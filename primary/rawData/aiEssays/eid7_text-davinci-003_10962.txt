I recently helped my grandmother move to a new apartment. She was nervous and uncertain about the whole situation, so I tried to remain calm to put her at ease. As I was packing up all of her belongings, I noticed that there were several objects that she needed to part with. I could tell that this was difficult for her, but she didn't say anything.

Instead, she just remained quiet and patient. She knew these things were of little importance in the grand scheme of things, yet I could tell this was still hard for her. She kept her composure and we finished packing everything up.

It was an uplifting experience for me, as it reminded me that even in hard times, patience can be one of the greatest sources of strength.
