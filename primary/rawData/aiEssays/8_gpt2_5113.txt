One time I experienced laughter in my life was when the boy in the back with me said to me, 'Come and hear the sound of our son. He has a funny voice' - which I said went through the air. The guy walked away with a large smile on his face and I was so happy. 'Do you understand?' I said, 'No I don't', he said and we are just happy that I do, in fact. It was the same for me, it just was such a nice way to experience something new.
