The memoir From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez is a touching and introspective narrative about Rodriguez's life growing up and his journey to success. Through the use of vivid imagery of Rodriguez's hometown, this book sets the tone for the melancholic yet nostalgic mood which continues throughout the story.

The story starts by speaking of Rodriguez's childhood memories of growing up in a working-class family in Jersey City. He speaks of the distinct smells and sounds of the city streets; the sound of salsa music from his father's record shop, old women cooking heavy sauces in the apartments, and, of course, the people. Through this, we are immediately drawn into his world and get a clear picture of the childhood which shaped him. 

Rodriguez's story is the perfect example of a classic American Dream narrative; challenging adversity and sacrifice to find success. Along his journey, we are reminded of the nostalgia he felt for his family, friends and home town. We experience his sense of longing and appreciation for his ties back to Jersey City, which became his source of strength and support throughout the journey.

The emotion and feeling expressed in From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives creates a powerful and reflective mood and we watch as Rodriguez overcomes life's obstacles to become an internationally-renowed fashion designer. It showcases the resilience and hoping contained in the American Dream, the belief that anything is possible even despite hardship.
