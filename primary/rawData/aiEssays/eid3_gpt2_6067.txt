Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. The idea is that if you're going into an area packed with traffic and you're just running down on the pavement, your heart rates should rise much higher. So when this is taken into account above, the cyclist should be able to make it through the rest of the road without encountering any serious problems. This is usually achieved if a person is wearing a helmet and will wear a knee protector, if they're cycling on narrow roads or they have a flat tyre on the road.

It will give cyclists a good indication if they're being overtaken, while it may have little impact on a victim.

What is a 'Bike Safety' or 'Rough Road Ahead' setting?

A 'Bike Safety' setting is one that sets specific rules on where the bike should be parked, and how fast it should be wheeled to a stop. When used the 'Safe Cycling' setting is often seen as 'open' and 'off' to motorists.

In this setting the cyclist is allowed to move freely â€“ as long as the bike is wheeled by one hand and with the other the 'Pedal' setting is turned off.

As you'll see at the end, these sets of rules can be made without any involvement by the cyclist in the initial move.

There are a large number of safety precautions
