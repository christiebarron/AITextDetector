The narrator of the story wants to understand the hibiscus plant, and has struggled to answer questions about it on a test. The narrator is determined to do better on the test once spring arrives, and they use this hopeful imagery to frame the end of the story. Winter imagery--the snow melting and the geese returning--represents the passing of time, with the promise of new life as the plant buds to follow. This ties in to the theme of understanding and growth throughout the story, emphasizing that the narrator will take what they've learned and try again when the plant blooms.
