The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is that it is the culmination of our love of life and our journey to find a fulfilling place to go with all that we know and love. In the midst of that, it also provides an opportunity for us to discuss life in the world itself.

'From Home Is' is a story about the love stories at the end of it, which is an idea we took off the shelf from time to time. We were a bit like a book club in that 'What's Your Best Friends List?' we were all trying to find out who was good at 'em and we weren't. You know what, we'd get really creative here in this. I'm glad we're doing it these days, but on the other side of it, there's a little bit of a disconnect at the end. 'From Home Is' is a book in the truest sense of the word â€“ it's about that world. It is a world where no one lives, and you can't come through that without being put down. And that's an important thing, but it's also about where there is space and not so much. It is a world that, in some way, is the place where we can come to the conclusion that we've grown better and not better, and then find out that we can make it through, that life in this world is only for one person and I would say that's a very hopeful thing.
