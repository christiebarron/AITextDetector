I remember back to a few years ago when I went on a family vacation to Mexico. We had driven all day and were exhausted when we finally arrived to our resort. While standing in line to check-in, a woman ahead of us cut us off and tried to push her way in front of us.

My parents were furious and wanted to have the woman kicked out of the line. I could sense how tense the situation was, so I asked my parents to be patient. I knew that getting angry wouldn't help our situation, so I tried to remain as calm as possible and asked the woman to step aside.

To my surprise, she agreed and stepped aside to let us go first. Although we weren't happy about the situation, we stayed patient and were able to check-in without any further issues. This experience taught me that patience is always the best policy.
