It's just I'd rather not have any of this bullshit done to me. I'm not gonna take it. I'm not gonna make a deal because I'm drunk," she said.

So that's how she started her search for a new job; she found a job. Now it seems like what she ended up having is an entire career and all these jobs that are basically, "I want to do this all the time. This is gonna become my life" and it's been an interesting career since then, I suppose.
