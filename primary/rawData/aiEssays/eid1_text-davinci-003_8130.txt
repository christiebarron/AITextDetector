The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One of the most difficult obstacles was the limited area available to work with. The Empire State Building was the tallest building of its time, and the dirigible docks would need to be built on the roof of the building. This meant that the engineers had to find a way to mount a series of mooring towers and masts onto the top of the building without compromising its structural integrity. 

The mooring mast was also a challenge to design and construct. The mast needed to be robust enough to be able to withstand the strong winds of a dirigible's descent while also light enough for the dirigible to remain buoyant enough to be able to dock successfully. The engineers had to build the mast in a unique design, because of the way it funneled the air up to the top of the building and down to the mooring platforms. In addition to the design challenges, the mooring towers and masts also needed to be able to withstand the corrosive effects of the exhaust fumes that the dirigibles emitted.

Another challenge was the rotating winds that the dirigibles would be subject to when descending. These strong and unpredictable winds had to be taken into account when designing and constructing the mooring towers and masts so that the dirigibles were able to dock safely.

Finally, the builders of the Empire State Building had to
