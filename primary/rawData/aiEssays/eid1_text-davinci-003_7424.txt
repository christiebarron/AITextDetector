The ending of the poem suggests that the speaker is looking ahead with hope to the future, and that even though things might be difficult right now, the situation can always improve. The idea of the hibiscus budding when spring arrives serves as a metaphor for the speaker's belief that they can start anew and recapture lost opportunities. The phrase “take that test again” could also indicate that the speaker is determined to revisit an area of their life in which they did not succeed, and that they are motivated to achieve a better outcome. They recognize the beauty of a new season, and how it can bring about a feeling of renewal and hope. The image of the geese returning reminds the speaker that good things come and go, and that with the season's changes, it is possible to come out a better person.
