Computers have many effects on people.

A recent example of this is the time we had at least one of our patients on medication after going on a long weekend to see the doctors. He woke up with a headache that was very bad but still didn't require any rest.

Why are you taking this medication in the first place?

We don't know how much it impacts people and what that might look like. That said, we do know the benefit of regular day-to-day habits and that the risk for serious cardiovascular disease is quite low.

What about being an individual?

We know that our bodies are not designed more for physical activity than anything else. One thing we recognize though is that if we choose to have a lot of sex, we have bigger and harder muscles than would be expected for a normal adult.

Our bodies need a lot of stimulation and stimulation that we're never allowed to have without the extra stimulation. But we also get tired, and we need to recover.

Can we take this medication long-term?

No. It's part of the plan for your medical condition.
