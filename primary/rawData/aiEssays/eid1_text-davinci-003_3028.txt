To the Editor,

As technology continues to reshape the world we live in, its impact can't be understated. Of all of the conveniences that technology, particularly computers, have provided us with, the most marked effects tend to be felt in our personal lives.

On one hand, computers have changed the way we interact and communicate with each other, making it easier for people to keep in touch and learn new things. We can search online for answers to nearly any question and connect with a vast array of people and cultures through social media.

On the other hand, computers can be a double-edged sword, especially for younger generations. Incessant surfing, online gaming and compulsive social media use can lead to an unhealthy dependency on these platforms, resulting in attention problems, sleep deprivation, significantly decreased physical activity, and even depression.

At the same time, technological advances are also making it easier for people to recognize these issues, and develop tools and resources that can cultivate technological literacy and encourage responsible use.

Technology, and more specifically computers, certainly have their advantages, but it's important that we recognize the potential for negative consequences, especially with younger generations, and take steps to mitigate them
