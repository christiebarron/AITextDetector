I was visiting my elderly aunt recently and noticed she was having some difficulty getting out of her chair. She said she needed help, but not too much as she wanted to be independent and do as much as she could for herself. I could tell she was feeling frustrated, so I said to her, "Take your time, there's no rush. I'm here to help you if you need it."

I could see how hard my aunt was trying to get out of her chair, so I just stayed quiet and let her work it out at her own pace. After a few moments she was able to get up and thanked me for being patient. I could tell she was relieved that I didn't rush her or try to take over, and instead just gave her the time and space she needed to figure it out. It was a small gesture that meant a lot to her.
