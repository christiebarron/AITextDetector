The public library is a cornerstone of democracy, providing citizens with access to knowledge and the freedom to choose what materials they will use to further develop themselves. Censorship of libraries is a deceptive way of limiting this freedom, and should be opposed as a violation of the First Amendment.

Censorship in libraries is an insidious act because it often appears well-intentioned. It may be intended to protect young readers from content deemed too harsh, or to preserve the library’s values and standards. However, such a justification ignores the fact that the First Amendment protects all Americans from censorship, regardless of age or opinion. Placing any kind of limit on a library’s selection of materials is a dangerous move that sets a dangerous precedent for limiting all kinds of free speech.

Moreover, censorship does not take into account the vast human capacity for critical thinking. Libraries exist in part to provide readers with the opportunity to engage with thoughtful, well-rounded perspectives on the world. By limiting a reader’s access to books, music, movies, and magazines, libraries sow the seeds of intellectual stagnancy and illogic. Instead of censoring ideas and materials which one group deems unfit, we should trust readers to make their own judgement calls about what information is appropriate based on their own values and viewpoints.

In conclusion, censorship in libraries is a violation of the liberty that lies at the heart of the American right to free speech, and should not be tolerated
