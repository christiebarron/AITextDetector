The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because we get to learn so much about winter, and as we learn more about how each day affects us, we move closer to that which will befall us as we get older. The book starts with an interesting twist on this subject and it is what we are doing in this game we do have, with Winter Hibiscus: in order to save one's family and friends it is imperative to play that which is best for you to keep. In games like this as a writer, we're almost always going to feel that it's a good idea to not play the game at all.

What do you think of the upcoming sequel, Summer Hibiscus as it's the last good winter game ever written!
