Computers have many effects on people. They affect whether others are happy. The best predictor of happiness was in a survey of 3,000 people. People who were unemployed were asked if they were happy with their jobs. People who were very lonely were less happy after a few weeks and were much less likely to report happy life back in their home area. As time goes on, people who are happy, but unhappy, can only expect to get richer and get married, have children, or retire sooner than people who are unhappy. Some people will end up working longer than they did as part-time jobs, but that doesn't mean that all your miserable old life doesn't pay offâ€”there are many reasons people might want to quit or take time off that you cannot afford.

Of course, people will have other economic problems. But it will also be possible that we will come to accept that the work of caring and serving others is just as important as caring and supporting other people to achieve economic justice and social justice and greater social health as much as caring and serving others.

We will find that we all have an interest in helping other people as they do and not looking to make those financial sacrifices that ultimately would make their lives poorer. But we will also learn that we also have a right to do all of that, so long as we don't feel as though we deserve to be judged on economic or social terms, but by the people we work with and the people we love
