Dear Editor, 

With the rapid growth of technology in recent years, computers have become a part of everyday life for many people. In fact, they are so commonplace that their powerful effects on people often go unnoticed. The use of computers has both positive and negative consequences, but in my opinion, on the whole, computers have had a fundamentally positive effect on people.

Firstly, the increased use of computers has created new opportunities for work and business, allowing people to become more self-reliant and productive. Secondly, computers have made communication much more efficient, meaning people are more in touch than ever and can easily stay connected with family and friends, no matter where they live. Additionally, computers are an essential part of education, providing students with access to an immense amount of resources and information. They have opened up doors of opportunities that would otherwise have been inaccessible. 

Last but not least, computers have changed the way people receive and share information. With the advent of the internet, people now have access to millions of sources of both knowledge and entertainment, allowing them to develop a deeper understanding of the world. They are also better equipped to inform and empower themselves with the truth.

In conclusion, while there are some negative aspects associated with computers, we must recognize their immense advantages as well. Computers have had a profoundly positive effect on individuals, and this trend will continue to grow as technology advances.


Sincerely, 
[Your name]
