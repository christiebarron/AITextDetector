To the Editor:

As technology advances, computers are rapidly becoming commonplace in today's society. I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people.

It is true that computers can be very useful tools, helping us to connect with loved ones via email or video calls, keeping us informed via news websites and social media, and performing tedious tasks quickly and accurately. However, computers can also have a negative impact on our lives, particularly when they are used for prolonged periods of time.

With long periods of computer use, it is very easy to become distracted and, consequently, become less productive. People may also experience physical problems such as neck and back pain caused by prolonged use of the computer. On the psychological side, people can become overly dependent on computers. This has been dubbed “techno-stress”, a condition resulting in inevitable mental health issues.

We need to be aware of the fact that computers can bring us many advantages, but it is important to balance these benefits with their potential risks and drawbacks. Limiting computer use to a few hours a day and taking regular breaks can help to reduce the risks and ensure that the benefits of computers are fully enjoyed.
