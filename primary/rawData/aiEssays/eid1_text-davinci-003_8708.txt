I was visiting my brother with my partner for the first time since he'd moved into his new house. We'd all gone out for dinner that evening, and the restaurant was bustling with people of all ages. 

My brother suggested that we play a silly game to try and ease the tension. We all had to come up with a silly joke, and whoever's joke made the rest of us laugh the most would win the prize of a free meal. 

My partner was the first one to go, and despite having the best intentions he told a terrible joke. Everyone just looked at him with blank expressions until I saw the corner of my brothers mouth start to twitch. Before I knew it, the two of them had both burst out laughing, and my brother was rolling on the floor in a fit of laughter. 

The rest of us eventually joined in too, and we ended up laughing the rest of the night away. It felt so good to laugh and spend time with my family, and I was so glad to have the chance to be together. This moment of laughter was the start of so many more funny moments between us!
