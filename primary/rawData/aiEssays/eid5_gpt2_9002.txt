The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is even more profound than those of any previous chapter, and it's been accompanied by, you may recall, very real scenes that set his life on the line: the first time he went door to door in front of the security guard's car during a storm in 2009, and the first time he spent much of one day in front of a TV in the middle of nowhere.

'From Home is' gives the book, in its current form, its own set of events that are quite unique, as it attempts to recreate a completely different relationship between these people, especially their own self-hatred – from their earliest days in the US – and their attempts to escape.

This is perhaps more important than reading a book containing only some of the most gruesome moments. It's a book that may not have come from a place of joy: from the day you walk through a crowded street in the dark, to the night you'd rather not get there, to the place that you'd rather not go – the place where so many of us will now be. This book is about your soul's attempt to reclaim itself: in the end we must find it wherever we have been before – without, indeed, letting things go.

It may look a bit ridiculous at first, but in the world of horror, this is exactly what it feels like.
