One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I asked if the same man called me a little bitch. He said that if I went to the gym I would lose my whole body. I told him he had no idea but that if he does he could take me to another gym to show me how to compete and have a happy time. He asked me if I remember being upset and telling abusive things like that. To this I answered that I would never say it and told him it was just a part of himself. I started to worry that this could be the reason why people still consider me a normal guy.
