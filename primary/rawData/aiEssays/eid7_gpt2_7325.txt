An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my friend John and he was a very active and creative artist for many years.

JOHN: You are very creative, very creative.

JANEL P: You were a big influence a long time ago. Are there any people who have influenced you lately?

JOHN: I think the thing about being involved in a project, you have to have some ideas behind them. If you're not using your imagination, if you're having to draw and make picturesâ€¦that's when the real creative spark hits that I was looking for.

(laughter)

JOHN: John and I got together during a dream tour where I was really excited to spend time with other artists. We are now very lucky to get to do a lot of stuff together. Sometimes we are really like the Beatles - it's very exciting because all the people who work with us think of us as the greatest members of what's been created and what's going on, and people are genuinely in awe of who we are. Those were the days when we could be together, but now that we're on our turn for New Year's Eve, there are great things about having time with all these very creative people.

JANEL: Well, we're hoping to revisit the same event - and just to celebrate it, we're actually playing some songs on the phone tonight with Mark Harris, a band that's been doing show concerts
