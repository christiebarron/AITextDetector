The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. By the end of the century they had eliminated the ability to place a movie's camera at either end of a building. A few decades later, the New York Supreme Court said it campaigns and won't allow dirigibles to dock for commercial purposes.

"We got a different look, I guess. It wasn't a new look. We had the same kind of design from about five years later, which was very elegant, and was fairly straightforward," recalled former NYPD Commissioner Edward Tompkins. "We thought we'd be the most elegant and simple looking and the cheapest. We've had better designers, the New York architects who built the Empire State Building, who have worked on other buildings and who are all, essentially, trying to make the best possible building and the least expensive."

There was also resistance from city government. After a long legal battle in 1984, the NYPD and Department of Cultural Affairs finally let dirigs dock.
