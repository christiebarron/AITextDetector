I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is in the interest of public education and of the state."

The lawsuit contends "the public domain system is an outdated design that does not allow for the control of material in a way that creates, creates danger, exposes the copyright owner, or makes it impossible to protect against the use or misuse of copyrighted material."

The lawsuit includes a call for "the full support of the American Library Association to address the harms of this harmful system" and a call for an end to the removal of the "uncopyrightable or proprietary material" of all libraries.

The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages.
