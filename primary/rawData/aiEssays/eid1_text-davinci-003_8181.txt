The Empire State Building, opened in 1931, was a major milestone in modern architecture. At the time of its construction, the building was thought to be the world's first skyscraper suitable for docking dirigibles, allowing passengers and goods to travel to and from the building with ease. However, the construction of the mooring mast for the dirigibles was not without its obstacles. 

The design of the mooring mast was a difficult task due to the size and weight of the airships. The ships were typically much larger than the building, presenting the challenge of constructing a mast that could safely support them without compromising the structural integrity of the skyscraper. Additionally, the builders had to take into consideration the air currents that the dirigibles created by their motors and propellers, which would require the mast to be constructed from incredibly strong materials that could withstand the powerful wind forces generated at the docking point.

The engineers also had to factor in the method of constructing the mast in a way that would be efficient and cost effective. In order to ensure the mast could safely support the load of the airships, the engineers decided to construct a cantilever mast, combining steel beams and concrete in the mastâ€™s framework. This choice was a relatively innovative design, as concrete was seldom used in structures in the 1930s.

On top of engineering obstacles, there were major safety concerns once the mast was completed. The area surrounding the dock had to
