One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was a kid. I would go outside and watch people play. "I would see children's movies but I never said, 'No I shouldn't do that or I shouldn't do that.' "

Singer Mike Leigh has taken a "very different stand" about the issue of same-sex marriage.

Lamb's new album, which features her own words and voice, is called Burden, not Burden No More.

Singer Leigh's message to a younger generation: Don't be afraid to say what's right.

Burden is coming out as the title track to Burden No More, coming out in November.

"There is no denying our love for each other," says Leigh's message to her new fans. "This album is meant to be a celebration of love, friendship and acceptance. We are still in the early stages, but it doesn't stop there. We're just really, really excited. Everybody is in the process of trying to come together. I wanted to make sure this would help everyone out."

Burden is out September 20 via Merge, and the album will be on hand for the first time at The JW's on Friday, Sept. 28 in London. See you there in '14!
