The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In the 1830s, a new system of hydraulic controls with hydraulic locks allowed cars to slip down narrow spaces to allow escape from large mechanical obstacles. However, in the 1960s, the New York State Building Authority was introduced to make it more difficult to obtain a permit for such a design-permit application.

The construction of the Empire State Building requires manual control and can be quite difficult to obtain as the floor is so high and the structure requires a higher degree of precision than a traditional staircase. Despite the increased complexity of that process, it is possible to develop various systems for using the building. There are three main applications of automated elevators and elevators, with the most recent being the use of automated elevators in the 1970s.

Automation

In the 1970s, the design for the new USGS-designed National Building Code was adopted. To accommodate all types of engineering required for building a skyscraper, the Code required building managers to have access to and be in possession of an elevator capable of being launched without special equipment on it. The elevators were capable of carrying all necessary equipment with them. However, in the mid-1980s, other elevator manufacturers began to provide access to elevator equipment to help with building performance. The elevators were available to the first commercial companies in the late 1990s at a cost of $20 million
