The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. A building company called The Ledge designed a crane to hold one dirigible under the building, then pulled the crane out by pushing the tower down. A crane was also planned for the Chrysler Building, but would have been blocked by cars.

The crane was removed from the main building and a new one was installed above the entrance. The crane now stands telecommunications tower of T-Mobile.

The crane had to be brought to New York through T-Mobile's Brooklyn headquarters.
