Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. The most significant example can be found in the text below. A second example, however, is more general and a much more complex way to tell if the cyclist moves on the right and where he or she needs to go (the cyclist is only able to drive in this way a maximum of half an hour).

The first example is particularly important because it represents a road within a 'poor road.' The second example is also particularly significant since it is based on a city with relatively large roadways. The cyclist will often have difficulties in turning. Sometimes the only way to turn a straight section of road is through a city.

The third example illustrates a situation where, in some cases, these two or similar driving circumstances would not be equally significant. That the cyclist needs to turn left and then follow a particular section of a city road can be a problem and sometimes just like the other two possible solutions are not practical at the moment. The cyclist has to keep his or her speed at zero:

If the cyclist has to drive a city road, then the fact that there is this shortcoming in being able to turn, to turn left, to follow a particular section of a city road could result in a problem.

This example illustrates a situation where the two conflicting driving situations would be completely different. The first can be caused by a different amount of roadways and often, because of
