The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because people can talk about it in general and we understand that the world will not end. Instead, Winter Hibiscus focuses on the world's future and makes the world feel real. This book is the perfect place to see a future in action -- like any.


*I know that there's a story I love writing but I want to put the book out there for you, because I just can't wait to find it and write it.
