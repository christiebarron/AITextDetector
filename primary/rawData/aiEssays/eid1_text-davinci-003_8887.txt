I vividly remember the day my fianc√© proposed to me. We had gone for a walk in the park, ready to spend a romantic day together, but it turns out he had an even bigger surprise in store. As we went to take a seat by the pond, he turned to me and asked, "Will you marry me?" I felt my head spin, not out of shock, but out of delight and joy. All I could do was nod as tears streamed down my face.

In that moment, I had expected us to embrace and kiss, but instead we burst into uncontrollable fits of laughter. I soon realised how ridiculous the situation was; here we were, in the middle of a park, tears running down my face from both happiness and laughter at the same time. It was as if the sheer joy of the moment had become too much for us to contain. We sat there for hours, laughing and talking and basking in the happiness of it all.

The laughter that day didn't just act as a connection between us; it was a celebration of our relationship. It showed us how far we had come, and it let us express our love for one another in a unique, albeit unconventional, way. Despite the undeniable joy I felt that day, what I cherish most is how it brought us even closer together. The memory of our laughter still brings a smile to my face all these years later.
