The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The opening of the Empire State to airplanes was too much to handle when a flight of stairs was necessary. The second obstacle they faced was the construction of the new National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) National Air Traffic Control System (NACSS). In 1883, Congress enacted the Aeronautics and Space Act of 1901, which barred the National Air TrafficFG and the Air Force from opening direct flights of planes to astronauts.

The opening of the Aeronautics and Space Act was a major stumbling block. Although the astronauts could disembark to land at any time, the pilots and the operators to control aircraft during takeoff and landing could't even get off with an aircraft at high altitude. The flight ban also caused much confusion among pilots and their operators alike. The Aviation, Transportation and Infrastructure Commission promulgated a draft aviation rule in April, 1906. Its most recent draft set a new course for the aviation industry by providing for the entry into all military use of airplanes in 1875; the FAA, however, denied all of its aircraft requirements. A new draft rules for aviation pilots were issued in 1906; the aviation rules went into effect as draft rules within one year of the first draft. Although FAA leaders had been reluctant to allow the Air Force, Navy, and Air Force to begin flying dirigibles into the Air Force's inventory inventory, they decided to allow commercial
