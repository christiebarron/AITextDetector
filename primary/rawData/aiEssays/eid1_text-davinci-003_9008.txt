Dear Editor, 

I would like to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Computers have become an integral part of our daily lives, and it is essential to consider their effects. 

On the one hand, computers have greatly impacted our society, contributing to our increased productivity and improving our quality of life. We may now access information and carry out tasks much faster than before. Computer technology has also allowed us to collaborate and communicate with others, regardless of their geographical location. 

On the other hand, computers can also have a negative effect on people. The speed and availability of technology has caused us to become increasingly dependent on computers. As a result, many of us lack the skills and knowledge required to accomplish basic tasks without the help of a computer. Additionally, excessive computer use can lead to physical injuries, such as carpal tunnel syndrome and eye strain. Finally, computers can be a source of distraction and procrastination, and the quality of work may suffer as a consequence. 

In conclusion, it is important to weigh the costs and benefits of computer use and ensure that the benefits outweigh the costs. We must educate ourselves on the proper use of computers and take the necessary precautions to limit potential harm. 

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
