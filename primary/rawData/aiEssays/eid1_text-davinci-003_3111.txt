Dear Editor,

As a person deeply involved in the development and adoption of technology, I feel it's important to discuss the impact computers are having on our society. While technology has undoubtedly made many of our jobs, tasks, and lives easier, it's also worth examining the potential drawbacks.

First, computer use has been linked to a decrease in the amount of physical activity people get, leading to health problems such as obesity. Additionally, computer use has been linked to problems like eyestrain, Repetitive Stress Injury (RSI), and carpal tunnel syndrome, all of which can cause significant pain, especially in the long term.

Some have also voiced concerns about the effect of computers on our mental well-being. For example, some worry that spending too much time in front of a computer can lead to an addiction to video games, leading to a decrease in attention span, impulsiveness, and poor decision making in other areas of life.

Finally, computers are often cited as having a negative impact on family values and interpersonal relationships. With the proliferation of the internet, people are increasingly interacting with digital content more than with each other, leading to an erosion of the values of interpersonal communication.
