So I think there's a real need for better understanding of how social networks differ. We want to study ways that networks work and how it can serve more as a tool rather than a form of information exchange.

And even with those three things in mind, I agree with one skeptic who just had us all speak: "It's pretty straightforward, but it isn't intuitive. You can't say it's obvious. For one thing, there can be a lot of differences between the types of networks that we can explore."

That's where these two different ways of thinking comes from, though!
