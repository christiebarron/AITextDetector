One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was working at the University of Arizona as a professor of chemistry at the University of Calgary. What started out as an innocent question turned into one of discovery. It seemed that something was up; someone was talking about a possible thing, and if it didn't work just leave it on the table, then at least it didn't have to be the perfect answer.

So it's not the whole answer; it's just that it's not something we should look forward to. If that's true to you, then why would you think I am the only one who doesn't have one already. How can you have a conversation with someone who is so smart, like you, a mathematician, a scientist, a scientist who is not only talented but highly accomplished in all fields.

You are my muse for talking to you, and it's not because I know that you have the answers you seek. In fact, it's because you are so close. You have such a deep respect for the intellect that I would be so shocked if you could just go a little bit far and say "I don't know why you have to do this â€“ don't you understand that there is something important that I care about," but that they are only interested in seeing what's in it. You are my muse for hearing things from someone who has nothing to offer.

And maybe that's because you can.
