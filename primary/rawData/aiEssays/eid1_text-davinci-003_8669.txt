I had just gotten off work and was feeling a little overwhelmed by everything so I decided to walk around for a bit to clear my head. As I was walking, I heard the unmistakable sound of a laugh that was so contagious I couldn’t help but smile. I followed this sound and eventually found its source.

I was drawn to the front porch of a small house where two elderly ladies were sitting and cackling away. I couldn’t help my curiosity, so I walked up to the porch to say hello. I caught their attention and introduced myself, still feeling a bit awkward.

To my surprise, they welcomed me with enthusiasm and asked me to sit down and join them. We talked about life, our families, school and so much more. One of the ladies even shared some of her recipes with me! Somewhere in the middle of our conversation, something one of us said made the other start laughing. It was contagious, and within a few moments, we were all laughing so hard we were in tears.

I had some of the best conversations of my life on that porch that day. We talked for hours until the sun had set and I had to go. We left with lots of jokes, funny stories, and most importantly, a lasting bond. As I said goodbye to them and walked off, I felt incredibly happy. Laughter is truly the best way to connect two people.
