But to be a healthy person, most people don't eat a lot during the day and when they become ill or tired, they become lethargic and can become very cold.

In a study conducted in 1998 Dr. Wiebe showed that taking a stimulant or mood enhancer during the day was associated with a reduction in heart attacks, strokes, and blood pressure. This was due to the fact that a person has a greater number of positive moods at regular hours.
