In Joe Kurmaski’s ‘Rough Road Ahead’, the cyclist is faced with a variety of challenges due to the settings he finds himself in. The setting of the story is a dilapidated roadway, surrounded by a small forest, and further hindered by a lack of light. The darkness of the environment provides cover for the cyclist as he embarks on his journey—a safety of sorts for the cyclist against the potential dangers he may face.

The terrain of the road also plays a factor in the cyclist’s progress, as it is rough and winding - “twists and turns” - and consists mostly of gravel and rubble. This results in a slower, much more difficult pacing for the cyclist, who is forced to throw care to the wind as he propels through the winding pathways.
