Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people today. As technology advances, so does the human reliance on computers, leading to far-reaching consequences in our daily lives. 

Computers have become invaluable as a tool for productivity and innovation. We are able to accomplish complex tasks more quickly and easily thanks to their capabilities. We have achieved the ability to communicate with one another over vast distances by making use of various software applications. However, this also opens the possibility of digital addiction and a general lack of physical activity. 

On the one hand, computers offer a variety of benefits to individuals. They can increase their efficiency and efficacy when completing tasks, and they can also provide an outlet for creativity and self-expression. At the same time, computers can have a detrimental effect on a personâ€™s self-image and social abilities. Studies have shown that reliance on computers can lead to a reduction in physical activity and an increase in sedentary activities. Additionally, many people become socially isolated due to their increased dependence on computers and technology.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that we should strive to find a balance between the advantages of technology and the potential risks posed
