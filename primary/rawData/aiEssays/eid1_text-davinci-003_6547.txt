Dear Editor,

As technology advances, the presence of computers in todayâ€™s world can no longer be denied. Many people, myself included, are beginning to question the effects that computers have on us, both as individuals and as societies. After long contemplation of the matter, I offer my opinion that computers are both beneficial and detrimental to people.

Despite the convenience of computerization, some are concerned about its effects. Excessive computer use can harm vision; strain muscles; make it difficult to concentrate; and lead to social and emotional problems. These side effects are considerable and warrant serious attention. 

On the other hand, computers can also improve our lives. They allow us to be more productive, as we can now accomplish tasks faster and more efficiently than ever before. Computers can also lead to new jobs. A whole industry has cropped up to create and maintain computer software and hardware, and this has opened up many opportunities for skilled and unskilled labor. 

In conclusion, I believe that computers can be both positive and negative. But by proper observation and regulation, I am sure that we can maximize the beneficial effects of computerization while minimizing its potential pitfalls. 

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
