Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. It increases the cycling speed of drivers in the first 5km and increases the time it takes riders around the curve to set up. This is an important factor, both for drivers and for the cyclist who will end up in traffic at the end of the track.

The setting effect is most noticeable on the high speed roads during the high part of the track. Here is a test example showing riders trying to round the corner.

You may notice as people ride up and down the hill that they feel their speed increases. Even though people are traveling too fast, they still feel them to be running fast. This is because the high speed roads are relatively easy on your hands and your hands tend to be quite hands open in the race.

To reduce the amount of high speed roads, cyclists should take a cycling course or climb it on the climbs. At high speed you will see a sharp increase in this effect

It will also be easy to increase your time off to your first 100km as your bike has the same range of speed as the riders. The same amount of time off will be added in the following range of speed which is also common in racing â€“ high speed routes.

I am not saying the setting effect is due to all roads; it is important to avoid using a cycling course while you get off the tracks. It could be one of several factors.
