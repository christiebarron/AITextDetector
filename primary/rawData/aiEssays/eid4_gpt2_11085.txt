The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it opens a window into the story of John, the son of a wealthy businessman from the village of Habsburg. The tale of love and death, where John discovers how life is a sham and his ultimate struggle with a disease which can kill his body. John and his fiance, a new-born princess Nina, spend almost the winter holidays together in the mountains. John and his old love sister, a young girl called Lucy, soon found themselves thrust into the care of a handsome, blonde craplord named Habsburg, who was looking for a bride to match the "true spirit of the king."
