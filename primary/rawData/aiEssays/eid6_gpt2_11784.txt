The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

The first was the "charm-dealing" system. With a few exceptions, the construction boom that followed the second failed to capitalize on the "charm building problem." Engineers could use their engineering skills to design and build the state building and their own building, with their limited expertise. Instead, they developed a process to "engineer" individual dirigibles, allowing one to pull a car driver out of a car. It was also not easy to build a car without the driver's knowledge. The car needed to perform its usual work. To produce a certain amount of horsepower, it would accelerate on high horsepower, which would destroy its braking system.

The second obstacle was a shortage of "charm building tools." Kittredge, who was a computer engineer (or engineer if you prefer), had done some hand-designed dirigibles that were already in use at the time of the building. He built ones out of aluminum, copper and plastic. He designed them and built them by hand. When he got their first customer order for his original, a four-door sedan with tint mirrors, the driver's face was already out of line.

Kittredge needed enough material to install the brakes. He also had some material that made this work, he called "charm building."
