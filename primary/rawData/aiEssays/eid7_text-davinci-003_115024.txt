 

My friend and I were on vacation in Mexico for a week. We arrived in the city early in the morning and, after a long drive, we finally reached our hotel. It was around 9:00 am and the check-in time wasn't until 2 o'clock in the afternoon. We had to wait there almost five hours. 

I was feeling anxious and a bit frustrated. I wanted to get to our room and start exploring the city. But my friend was so calm. She suggested we grab some food at the nearby cafe and then sit outside the hotel, enjoying the warm weather. 

I reluctantly agreed and we sat on the steps of the hotel, enjoying the bright sunlight and the pleasant morning breeze. We began to chat and my friend told me stories of her past travels and the different experiences she'd had.

Finally, the clock struck two and we were able to check in to our room. I was relieved, but I was also very impressed that my friend had remained patient throughout the situation. I had never expected to be able to spend five hours simply conversing and relaxing in the way we had done. It was a really nice experience and it taught me the value of being patient in tough situations.
