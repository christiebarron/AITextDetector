I had just met my now ex-boyfriend at a party not too long ago. Neither of us knew anyone there so it felt strangely intimate. We started talking and I didn't realize at the time how much I was already attracted to him.

We talked about all sorts of things, from music to our upbringing. Suddenly, he started talking about his childhood and how he was always getting into trouble. 

He said something funny about his mischievous behavior and the next thing I knew, we were both laughing uncontrollably. The look of complete joy and connection on his face made me realize that I really liked him.

From that point on, we were inseparable. Whenever we were together, laughter was always a big part of our relationship. Whatever stresses may come our way, we always managed to get each other laughing. That laughter was, and still is, one of the things I miss most about our time together.
