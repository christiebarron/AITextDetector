The author is using the imagery of the hibiscus flower to represent the protagonist's journey in life. The protagonist is preparing to take an important test and will return in the spring, just as the winter hibiscus will then be blooming. The author is using this metaphor to signify the freshness of the protagonist's next chapter in life after the test and their preparedness to take it. This ending emphasizes the idea that if the winter hibiscus can come back stronger after being seemingly dormant then the protagonist can also triumph over the test and move into their next phase with renewed vigor.
