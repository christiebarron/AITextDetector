The memoir “From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives” by Narciso Rodriguez is a truly inspirational and heart-warming read. Rodriguez paints a vivid portrait of his life experiences from his childhood in New Jersey to his high-stakes career in the fashion world. Throughout the memoir, the mood he creates is primarily one of warmth and awe.

Rodriguez describes his childhood with a sense of joy and nostalgia, emphasizing the special bonds he built with his teachers and peers. This creates a sense of appreciation and nostalgia within the reader as we reflect on the important role family and community can play in a person’s life.  As the story progresses, we become immersed in the hustle and bustle of the fashion industry, a place Rodriguez clearly looks back on with fondness. He speaks of the intense feelings of joy that comes with achieving success; the feeling of fulfilment and achievement when a design sparks a reaction from the crowd. He even muses on the moments of peace and relaxation in the midst of the busyness, the unexpected moments of serenity shared between strangers. 

The memoir’s main theme of home is also reflected in the emotion conveyed throughout the text. Throughout the memoir, Rodriguez reminds us of the importance of home, both literally and as an abstract concept. By emphasizing each of the unique relationships he formed with important figures to him, he conveys the message that true happiness ultimately comes from building meaningful connections with people
