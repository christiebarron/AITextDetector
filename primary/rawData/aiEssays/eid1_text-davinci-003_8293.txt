The idea of having dirigibles dock at the iconic Empire State Building was initially met with enthusiasm from the buildingâ€™s engineers, the public, and the media. However, many obstacles had to be overcome before it could become a reality.

The first issue was one of safety. Although the lobby of the building was designed to accommodate large crowds, the dirigible mooring mast itself posed a problem. The structural engineers determined that the mast had to have a base capable of withstanding over 50 tons of force from the dirigible. It had to be built from steel and be securely anchored into the bedrock of Manhattan. The engineers also had to be mindful of the prevailing winds at the time and make sure the mast was not placed in a location where it could interfere with the structural integrity of the building.

A second obstacle was accommodating the large number of passengers who would be arriving on the dirigibles. There needed to be an easy way to transport them from the roof of the Empire State Building to the lobby. The engineers came up with the idea of a two-story elevator that could fit up to 60 passengers at a time. This meant a large elevator had to be built and attached to the mooring mast, while the original elevators inside the building were modified to accept the extra passengers.

Finally, all the moving parts of the mooring system had to be properly maintained and kept in working order. The mast had lights and gauges
