As the Empire State Building was constructed in New York City in the 1930s, the designers had a relatively unique vision in mind. Along with the 102-story office and entertainment building, they had plans to include a mooring mast to which passengers of airships, commonly known as dirigibles, could dock. 

To achieve the ambitious goal of building the world's first aerial port, the architects and engineers needed to consider land and building clearance, energy requirements, and the possibility of adverse weather. Furthermore, they had to make sure that the mooring mast could support the weight of an airship. The material used to construct the mooring mast was an extra-strength steel cable, superior to the steel commonly used at that time. The cable, along with two 25-foot tall moorak cones at the top, was designed to provide the extra stability required for the mast to remain upright and to provide a firm base for airships.

The design was successful, but there were still additional obstacles that the Empire State Building team had to overcome. For example, ensuring that winds were properly accounted for was a major challenge due to the lightweight nature of dirigibles. This meant that the team had to create a system of grooved plates that would allow the wind to move around the mast without creating too much turbulence. Additionally, they had to consider the visibility of airships at night, designing a special lighting system to illuminate them.
