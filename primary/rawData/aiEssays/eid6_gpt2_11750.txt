The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The Empire State Building has the tallest building in the United States combined with the tallest skyscrapers (with the tallest building in England and China). They also face obstacles that prevent them from constructing other skyscrapers — including the United States Capitol, which was built by the Federal Government but has been plagued with problems with asbestos and other pollutants at one point. However, the builders are able to withstand the construction of the National Capitol.

Why the Empire State Building didn't catch fire

"Why did they choose to have the dome of the Empire State Building built on the upper deck? It wasn't really their intent to, we're not going to say they didn't like it, but there is also a large difference: it's the first building that the US did that's had significant decline over the years. It also doesn't have much historical significance, the National Archives is where all the materials were being stored, but that's also what the United States does during times of economic decline, you have buildings like the National Archives, which have enormous public space, but I'd say the building itself is something most of the rest of us would never be able to do."

The dome was built in 1907 to allow dirigibles to dock. It
