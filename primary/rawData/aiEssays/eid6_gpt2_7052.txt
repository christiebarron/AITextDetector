Another problem was the weight of the tower's steel, which might have held more than the four- or five-foot-wide container it held, because it carried six loads of compressed air. (The air carries about 764 gallons of gasoline.)

By 1913, the city was able to design one-story tall, four-by-nine-foot blocks. While there were restrictions on the construction of the three-story building and some restrictions imposed on the number of units that could be built, the building was able to withstand an earthquake, which hit at 6 a.m. on July 24.

On the ninth floor, a double-height building housed nine separate rooms, including a gym and a spa, each
