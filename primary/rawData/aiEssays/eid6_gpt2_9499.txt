The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Since they already had air conditioning, they could not afford the $3+ million that was promised to the owners who owned the building. Even if the Empire State Building could accommodate the use of a dirigible, it did not permit it. In 1928, a law went into effect allowing pilots from both sides to fly in a dirigible without a licence from the authorities. It was the first "dolphin strike," but it did not change anything. The dirigible would have been able to fly.

The Empire State Building didn't come out of nowhere. It remained at the forefront of British aviation because it is the longest and most important building in the whole of Britain. The tower now rests on a small hillside, on the edge of a rolling river. From its vantage point, the Empire State is one of the few remaining landmarks of the world's major aviation complex, a symbol of the British aviators' power and their ability to protect the world without resorting to airlifting overgrown buildings.
