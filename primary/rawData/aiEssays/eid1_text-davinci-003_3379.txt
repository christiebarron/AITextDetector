Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people’s lives. Computers are an integral part of our lives and they have taken us leaps and bounds in the past few decades. They have revolutionized our lives and transformed the ways we work, communicate, and acquire knowledge.

The advent of computers and technology has made life easier for us in many ways. Businesses can streamline their operations and processes with the use of computers. We can access so much knowledge with just the click of a button. Inter-continental communication is now available with just a few clicks.

However, computers and technology also come with their own set of baggage. Unmonitored use of computers has given rise to social media addiction and cyber threats. Digital scams and frauds are on the rise. Uncontrolled use of computers can also affect the way we think and act.

I believe that, if used properly, computers can be a powerful tool. It is important to monitor and moderate our usage of computers and digital technology. We can do so by limiting our screen time and embracing unplugged experiences. Parents can also play a major role in monitoring their children’s digital habits
