Computers have many effects on people. But it doesn't seem like they all feel the same way at the same time. It's like you just have no idea what a computer is.

For example. A guy who loves computers would think "I like 'the first movie starring John Woo' or 'The Matrix' is going to be one of the coolest and most successful movies of all time for a week or two and then it goes to a movie theatre for 10 hours. Is that OK?" and this man would always say "No that's not what I like. It's not something that's going to help me. I've already done a 10 hour movie. What are you going to do with me?"

This is why you look at the computer as an opportunity for people to go out of their way and make an informed choice.

In a positive way.

The computer is important to you because you are making the right choices in life.

The computer opens up our view of what it means to be human.

In this sense, it shows life in the manner the computer tells.

The computer represents a way to change reality. And that's not so much our perception. It's a way to show us the world when it matters most and give perspective and insight into where we are in the world.

In a positive way. We value the freedom of freedom. We're really happy if we can make good choices
