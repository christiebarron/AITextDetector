Hanna told the paper that her life was becoming more difficult as she saw an increased need in others for independence, the only means to help it.

His mother also mentioned that he must be careful not to give up on his work DOB. He had taken up writing and teaching in his new job, with the promise of a job that would provide a better education and an easier job for him as well - and the fact that he was now working in IT would mean much more for him, making the experience more difficult.

"And then it was quite sad that in the middle of all that suffering was becoming a nightmare," he said.

"And the world is becoming less and less clear about it... and we just feel like everything is completely gone. We are all dying, all he could do to help was put our lives together.

"He was trying very hard to make it, he is trying harder now... and it still sucks, as it always does. He is at a point now where he has to come right back into it for him. It was just all a blur."
