The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho serves as a symbol of perseverance and hope. Through the story, the main character struggles to do well on an important exam. After facing a number of obstacles, she comes to realize that her focus should not be on the test results alone. Although she may not pass the exam, she can still prove her worth by continuing to try and learn. The hibiscus serves as a metaphor for the main character â€“ even though it is seemingly dead during the winter, it stays strong and will eventually bloom in the spring. The ending of the story conveys the idea that no matter how tough life can be, the main character will always have the potential to succeed and will be prepared to give the test another try when the time comes.
