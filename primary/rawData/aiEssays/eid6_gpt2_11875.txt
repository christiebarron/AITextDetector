The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

They were also faced with a dilemma: Can they use the dirigibles for a certain amount of time without risking losing control or power? The original plan was to include these dirigibles in the new building, but a few engineers started noticing a limitation. An engineer had proposed to replace the entire building with "The Legend of Zelda: The Two Towers," and if they'd wanted to run a little longer this wouldn't have worked out well so they needed further modification. The developers of Wind Waker wanted to keep that concept alive, and while the dirigibles are good enough they are the only thing keeping it moving. What they did not realize was that the designers wanted a little more power than the old building's 3D projection systems could accommodate. They actually considered bringing in the tower's own motion sensor, which would also be a smart device.

The two sides agreed that this wouldn't be the case, but in this case the wind would break even, so the makers decided to make this new skyscraper bigger by adding more columns (which are just one block wide, since the Empire State Building was built on one side). Also, the building would now have a larger front parking area, and therefore less people to ride the train. The designers also decided that to accommodate 2-in-1 rides, and to make sure that the front would take up as many space as
