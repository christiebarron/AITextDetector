Over the years, censorship in libraries has become a growing problem, and there is much debate over whether certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, should be removed from the shelves if they are found to be offensive. The majority of people tend to side with censorship, believing it is necessary to protect society from potentially “harmful” material. However, censorship in libraries is an issue that needs to be addressed more seriously. It is important to remember that the purpose of a library is to provide information and resources to the public, without discrimination or prejudice.

The primary reason why censorship in libraries should not be allowed is that it is an outright violation of the basic right to free speech. If a library is permitted to censor certain materials, then the principles of free speech will be disregarded, and the public’s right to express themselves and share their ideas openly will be impeded. Furthermore, there should be no restrictions on a person’s access to information and resources, especially when it comes to educational resources. Restricting access to certain materials in a library goes against the definition of a library: a place that is open to all and serves the purpose of providing access to educational information and resources.

Secondly, censorship in libraries sets a dangerous precedent. If libraries are allowed to censor certain material, then it will open the door to other forms of censorship. It gives libraries a sense of power, and this power could potentially be abused
