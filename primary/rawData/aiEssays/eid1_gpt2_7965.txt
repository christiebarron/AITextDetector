Computers have many effects on people. They change the way they communicate with each other. They help us get the most from free software. They create new things. They provide the new functionality. It all depends on the level of collaboration you have and what a computer provides.

There's no question about that. In some respects, there is more value in that context. But you also have to make a distinction between things you do. On the one hand, you have information that you like to do. But there's also a level of complexity that comes with that. Even the most complex things that you do, they're likely to be costly.

So, we're not really going to say, if a machine is going to come up with an algorithm that would be good, if it's going to be as good as the human brain would come up with, as an optimization, as a better language, that that is the human-generated AI system. If that's what comes up, we're not really looking for problems. We're just looking for a way that a human could get the algorithm that is at least as good as our brain. The algorithm is a human, and that's what humans are better at.

So I'm not really going to define what's better or worse. I'm going to say what I think is a better or worse decision for an AI system for example, the ability to be more accurate when it comes to human speech.
