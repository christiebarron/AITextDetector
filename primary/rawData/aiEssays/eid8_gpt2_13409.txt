One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was at my wedding, because that's what I do. I had a huge laugh, because it was the same thing.

"There is such diversity in my life. There is the person that will always get my heart pounding. I can't thank me enough. It was a beautiful day."

In 2015, two-time WNBA champion Jordan Thompson was diagnosed with a bacterial infection.

The first one was an early season knee surgery. In the week leading up to the tournament, both players were working hard and had to stay off the court.

Thompson is considered to be the leader in the league in scoring at 29.8 points. He's also scored 3,912 points in five years in the league.

"That's not how you do things," Thompson said. "It's just how you work. I'm just happy it's out there that nobody is saying a year ahead of us, because we're making our best work of it."

Thompson was named to the WNBA's All-Defensive First Team in 2013.

He's also the league's only point guard. Thompson averaged 17.5 points per game.

"It means a lot to me. It makes some of us sad, but I'm happy. When he gets to the arena, you know. He's always been the star in my life," Kupchak said.
