An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my mother, who often gave me great gifts of wisdom, comfort, and care. My mother's son was born in the early 1970s, and her son is very well over 70.

What she taught was that life is short and that most of all, people experience it through suffering and sorrow. In my experience, love is the single greatest gift any human being can give, and what she teaches is that love is the gift of life.

I have many relationships which I love so greatly through their beautiful souls. I never have the idea that I have to give up all of that to one person in order to see another happy, happy, fulfilled and successful. Because people who are living life through pain and suffering all feel their pain, my heart starts to grow in my chest and my breath becomes sweet, clear, and quiet as my eyes become clear and loving. But this is not the way life ends - it starts somewhere else and it doesn't end with me and my children. But the way life begins â€“ the life of love - is a very different story.

People say "it's all about having your life in order" but in reality, most of our lives are always about enjoying life, enjoying our lives, enjoying ourselves. This is life where I'm loving myself, enjoying myself and going where my heart is going, where my mind is going, where my body is going, etc.
