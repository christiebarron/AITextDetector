When it comes to censorship in libraries, there are passionate advocates on both sides of the debate. Some believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves if they are perceived to be offensive. However, I strongly believe that libraries should reserve the right to choose which materials to include on their shelves and should not be held responsible for the content of the materials they provide.

First and foremost, libraries are a source of information and entertainment for their patrons, and restricting certain materials would impede on the rights of individuals to access information and experience diverse cultures and ideas. Libraries shouldn’t be expected to serve as the parents of the public, deciding what is appropriate for patrons to read, listen to, and view, and what isn’t. Furthermore, censorship could lead to an erasure of works by traditionally marginalized groups that could be seen as offensive, such as works by LGBTQ+ and BIPOC authors, thereby denying access to these communities’ unique perspectives and stories. 

Additionally, when libraries censor materials, they inherently support the viewpoint of those who feel the material is offensive. Libraries should not take a stance, instead serving as a neutral provider of information to their patrons, and allowing individuals to find the materials that best suit their interests. Giving individuals the opportunity to critically engage with media is key in facilitating an educated society. Furthermore, allowing for open access to materials is essential in order to uphold freedom of speech
