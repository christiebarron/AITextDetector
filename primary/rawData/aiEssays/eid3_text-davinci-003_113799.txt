In “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, the features of the setting impact the cyclist’s experience and challenge. The first feature is the road. The cyclist is riding his bike on a rough, uneven road that prevents him from biking as smoothly and quickly as possible. It’s full of holes and potholes, loose gravel, and steep inclines, all of which can throw the cyclist off balance, tire him out more quickly, and force him to use more energy. The second feature is the terrain. The cyclist is riding through a remote, mountain region, where the scenery and flora around him can be breathtaking. However, this region is also very steep and rugged, with large stretches of desert, so the cyclist has to be prepared and be aware of his surroundings so that he doesn’t get hurt. This means that steeper inclines and descents are even more challenging. In addition to the terrain, the cyclist also has to contend with the heat and wind. The hot sun can cause dehydration and fatigue, while wind can prevent him from making good time or even threatening to blow him over, so he has to be prepared to take the necessary precautions. All of these factors combine to not only make it a difficult ride for the cyclist but also an opportunity to test himself and push his boundaries.
