Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. A new bike park has sprung up at the main entrance to the town, so visitors can enjoy more comfortable accommodation and better looking shops and restaurants.

A new cycling-friendly town centre is planned in the surrounding area. A new station has opened and a new bike park is expected shortly, as well as new stores to encourage more cyclists. All of this is likely to attract more businesses like bike shops.

There has also been a boost in bike commuting during the early hours of the morning. In March, a special bike rental car was sold at the city's cycling and pedestrian hub in Kalki.

There is also increased activity for cyclists around the UK â€“ and from the UK to other countries.
