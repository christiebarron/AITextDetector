The Empire State Building was truly ambitious endeavor that had the goal of dominating the Manhattan skyline. The building was also intended to be a transportation hub, with plans to allow dirigibles to dock at the 86th floor observation deck. Despite the rampant enthusiasm surrounding the Empire State Building, achieving the dream of accommodating dirigibles publically deemed a threat to public safety. In “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the obstacles faced in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building are explored.

The first obstacle to allowing dirigibles to dock was security. By the 1930s, dirigibles had already embraced technology to combat their infamously slow pace, making them worryingly susceptible to hijacking. Contemporaries were worried that if the Empire State Building's docking area was easily discovered, it may become a high-risk target for hijacking attempts. Lengthy security clearance processes would be required for anyone seeking to use the elevator, stairs, or observation deck.

The second obstacle was the fact that the Empire State Building was not originally designed with dirigibles in mind. The architects had created the building without taking into account the characteristics of a mooring mast that would be necessary to accommodate a latex airship. There was no room for a tall mast or hangar, and the infrastructure would not be able to support a large section of aircraft.
