I remember the day my son learned to ride his bike. It was a special moment for me as a parent, because I had been patiently helping him learn. After months of effort, he finally made progress and was slowly starting to pick up the basics.

We had been practicing in our garden for weeks on end, and I was determined to make this something he could achieve. I was patient with him, not pushing him too hard or expecting him to get it immediately. I encouraged him while also giving him the time and space to pick it up at his own pace.

My patience and encouragement paid off when he finally got the hang of it. I remember his face as he rode down the street with me trailing him, feeling proud and excited that he had achieved it. It wasn't easy but it felt like a big milestone. That was the day I was glad I chose to be patient.
