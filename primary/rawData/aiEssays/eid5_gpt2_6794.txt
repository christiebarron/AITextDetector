The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' by writer Jonathan M. Miller suggests the movie might soon have a similar effect on young girls.

"The 'Sneering Angel,' " according to Miller, will "totally disrupt the notion that I was a slob in a strip club," he said. "I couldn't get into the same club. Why would you go through?" What do the children of the movie want with the film? The answer: there are too many ofmatched "Sneering Angels," they told Miller. "We feel like we haven't met any girl."

Miller added that while the director is already preparing for "Baby," there's definitely a big demand for "We're the Real Boys."

"When I first talked to [my friend Tom's mom] when he was in high school, we'd be sitting on the toilet doing that," Miller told me over the phone to confirm our initial conversation. "He was really interested in us. At first I was hoping to be involved but then really we started getting off on the same story."

But in the two decades since the movie began, Miller says his relationship has not changed, which is why "From Home is" has such high reviews. And when kids do get serious about school, it's not just the high school boys or the people in the movie.

"From Home doesn't try to be cute," he said.
