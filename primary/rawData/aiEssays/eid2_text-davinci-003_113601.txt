Recently in the news, there has been a lot of debate surrounding the topic of censorship in libraries. The debate surrounds whether or not certain materials, such as books, music, movies and magazines, should be removed from library shelves if they are judged to be offensive.

My opinion on this matter is quite clear: No, certain materials should not be removed from library shelves because of their offensive content. Censorship in libraries is a bad idea that should be prohibited. 

The first reason why censorship in libraries should not be allowed is because it infringes upon our right to access information. Many library patrons rely on libraries to access the latest works of literature and media so that they can form their own opinions. Removing materials from shelves simply because they are deemed offensive curtails access to these works and forces people to miss out on stories, ideas, or viewpoints that might otherwise be too expensive to access or not easily available.

Moreover, censorship in libraries also allows for certain works to be unfairly targeted and quashed. It can open the door to bias decisions when it comes to which works are deemed offensive and which ones aren't. A lack of objectivity often leads to which materials are ultimately censored, and creates arbitrary obstacles for certain writers, musicians, filmmakers, and other artist's work to be appreciated by those who are seeking it. 

Furthermore, allowing censorship of library materials could lead to other problems, such as an increase in censorship of other materials,
