The ending of the poem reflects a powerful message of resilience and hope, showing that no matter what the hardships, one can always try again. The symbolism in the poem reflects this idea with the hibiscus being a metaphor for the individual. The individual may have gone through a difficult period, as is reflected by the winter, yet when spring returns, and the snows melt, so too will the individual's difficulties. The poem ends with the idea that the individual will try again and make a new attempt of the test, perhaps this time with the support of the warmth of spring. This reflects the idea of how one can always start again, no matter how challenging their circumstances may have been.
