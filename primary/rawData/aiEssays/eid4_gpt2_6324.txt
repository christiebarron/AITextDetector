The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because of the fact that it shows us how well-versed we are in the past and how that can affect how we get through life.

I think, for the first time in a long time, you have to consider the past and think about how it affects us today, in light of today's climate.

In most aspectsaternity, being considered in this book, are difficult. When you look at how many years it would have been in your twenties to have been pregnant, it is a very hard thing.

In other words, I am not trying to say how difficult it would have been, or how difficult a world might have been, or how easy it would have been to have been married, or to have had a child, or whether it would have been possible to have children, but I am sure it would have involved going through a lot of changes like your life would have seemed. It is definitely a hard thing, and it might have been a very, very different life. There are things you learn now when you look back and you look at where your life was in the past and you see how it was with you â€” and it was much more difficult. We were not able to do all those things in time; we were not able to take care of a lot of things and have children, but I felt it would have been much easier to have a life together after all that.
