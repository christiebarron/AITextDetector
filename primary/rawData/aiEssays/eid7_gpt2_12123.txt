An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my dad watching me when I was a child in the '70s. I don't even know his name and you never know how that life went down when I was like 3 or so from being a kid. We lived in a pretty good house, a pretty good hotel, a pretty decent house. We were good, because it seemed like nothing could matter to the rest of us. And I guess that's when I started seeing a lot more about myself in adulthood. And I started seeing a lot more about him, and more about myself. I've been saying this for 3 and a half yearsâ€¦ for the last 2 when I was really young. But I think it was the first of many times. My dad was an amazing, amazing person. That's one of the things they were like. They had to take care of me but the rest that they did, I was an unbelievable mom. I would never have the luxury of being that mom, let alone a mom who's got a lot to offer. I had to be it, my whole life.

But I like being that mom. I don't care where I'm from, in my life or just in my life. I grew up being that mother. I grew up living my dream, being that mother and I loved what I did. But that was another thing. I'm not quite like that yet. But, I am there to stay that
