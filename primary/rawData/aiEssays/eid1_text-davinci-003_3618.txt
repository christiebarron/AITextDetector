To the Editor, 

We are currently living in a world completely transformed by technology. Computers have revolutionized the way we communicate, learn and work, and have undoubtedly had a significant impact on our society.

However, computers come at a costâ€”they can have serious negative effects on our lives. Excessive computer use can lead to health problems like carpal tunnel syndrome, increased stress levels, and even depression due to virtual social isolation. Furthermore, the easy access to social networking, digital games, and streaming services can lead people to become addicted to a virtual reality, making it more difficult for them to interact with people in real life.

That is why it is important for us to find a balance. We should recognize the improvements this technology has brought to our everyday lives, as well as its potential dangers. I strongly recommend parents enforce limits on computer usage for their children and that young people proactively limit their own screen time to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

I urge you, readers, to consider the potential consequences of computers in our lives, as well as its advantages, and to use this technology responsibly.

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
