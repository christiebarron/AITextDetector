Since its founding in 1931, the Empire State Building has been an iconic part of New York City's skyline, as well as a symbol of the strength and ingenuity of the American spirit. As the world’s tallest building at the time, it was the perfect landmark for airships, or dirigibles, to dock. 

In order to accommodate the lighter-than-air transportation of dirigibles, a mooring mast was installed at the building's top in the early 1930s. This was a daring move, considering the obstacles to building and managing such a complicated mast. Architects and engineers were tasked with developing the architecture for the mooring mast and ensuring a safe docking process.

The sheer height of the mooring mast proved to be a major challenge. The mast stood 400 feet above the Empire State Building and was designed with a large, y-shaped truss for stability and strength. The mast had to be anchored to the building and connected to the dirigible by an 80-foot cable - a process which required a certain level of precision. Furthermore, workers had to endure the extreme working conditions of the 103-floor building while they constructed the mast.

The weight of a dirigible, combined with New York City’s gusty weather, posed significant risks for the mooring mast, as high winds could easily endanger any dirigible that attempted to dock. Consequently, further engineering was required to fortify the mast
