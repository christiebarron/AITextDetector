I remember the day when my best friend came over to my house. We had been friends since high school and hadn't seen each other in years. When I opened the door, she gave me a huge hug and we both started giggling.

It felt so good to be reunited. We exchanged stories about our lives both the good and the bad. We laughed so hard that tears rolled down both our faces. Even though we were laughing so hard, it felt so comforting to share those moments with her. 

The day went on and we continued to talk and laugh until it was time for her to depart. Right before she left, we both looked at each other and just started laughing again. We exchanged one more hug, and parted ways.

I smiled for days on end, thinking back to the day filled with laughter. There truly is nothing like it; it was the best feeling in the world.
