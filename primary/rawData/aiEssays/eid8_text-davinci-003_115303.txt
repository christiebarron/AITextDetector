I was taking a walk with my best friend the other day. We had decided to take a break from studying and go for a walk to clear our heads. We hadn’t gotten very far when our conversation started to drift into topics we often joke around about. It started with a casual comment about one of our favorite memes, which both of us found hilarious. We both busted out in raucous laughter, and the feeling of joy seemed to fill the air around us. 

It continued, topic by topic, as we had each other in stitches. We almost had to hold each other up as we laughed so hard, and we could barely breathe. We certainly attracted some odd looks from some of the people walking around us, but we were too pleased by our own hilarity to notice the bemused strangers. 

Eventually, we managed to compose ourselves and continued on our stroll. Though the conversation had changed topics, the laughter still lingered. This is the thing about laughter between two people; it’s an energy that sticks around long after the moment’s dissipated. There might not be laughs anymore, but the warm, pleasant feeling of being connected to someone through laughter never disappears.
