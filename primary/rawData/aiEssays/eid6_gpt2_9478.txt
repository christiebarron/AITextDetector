The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They had little access to space, so they designed a system of high pressure chambers. "As the aircraft began to drop down on Earth, the designers decided to take a little less energy and leave the building in its original state, using fuel as well as liquid oxygen," says Lueffmann. These engineers found that by creating the required pressure of air through a combination of liquid and liquid hydrogen, they could maintain a steady pressure on the aircraft â€“ and that this "breathing" could sustain the whole flight for a short period to permit the pilot to react quickly to mechanical problems.

This combination of fluid and air could, eventually, allow the engineers to fly safely to the airfields at Mach 3, about 13,000 mph. "A large amount of the helium at Mach 3 means that your oxygen level is at the max, whereas on Earth, that can be at a minimum of 25 percent, about 1/3 that of a typical jet engine flying at Mach 3 (the highest altitude you'll see in flight)," recalls Lueffmann.

The engineers wanted not only to prevent these problems, but also to protect the airfield from harmful winds. To make sure the aircraft would fly safe, the designers tried to preserve the stability of the aircraft before it began to lose the control of the aircraft. "By using the best possible airspeed for the landing, they maintained safety
