In the poem “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, the setting is an important component for understanding the struggles of the cyclist. The physical landscape of the road is described as filled with potholes, rocks, and other obstacles that impede the cyclist’s progress, making the ride uncomfortable and difficult. The landscape serves as an apt metaphor for the cyclist’s inner struggles and challenges. The physical difficulty of navigating the rough road symbolizes the figurative difficulties the cyclist is trying to overcome. The poem also describes the environment of the road as barren and desolate, emphasizing how alone and isolated the cyclist is in facing her struggles.

The setting of the poem not only serves as a metaphor, but also has a direct impact on how the cyclist approaches her journey. The obstacles on the road force her to keep her head down and focus on the road in order to stay safe. This mirrors her mental attitude and forces her to focus on the present moment instead of overthinking her situation. The unwelcome challenges of the rough road also teach her perseverance as she must keep pushing forward no matter how difficult the terrain gets. The harsh environment also strengthens her resolve, as she is determined to overcome the obstacles and eventually see the end of the road.
