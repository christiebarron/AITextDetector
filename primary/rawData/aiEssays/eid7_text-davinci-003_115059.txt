I had recently started a new job and was feeling overwhelmed and a bit nervous. I was given lots of tasks that were completely new to me and it felt like I wasn't making any progress. One of my coworkers, Sarah, saw how overwhelmed I was getting and she decided to help me out. She could have just chosen to do the work herself, but instead she spent her lunch break patiently teaching me and taking the time to walk me through each process. She answered all of my questions and showed me how to figure out answers on my own. Her patience and understanding made a world of difference and helped me to make real progress. I will always be grateful for Sarah's patience, guidance, and understanding.
