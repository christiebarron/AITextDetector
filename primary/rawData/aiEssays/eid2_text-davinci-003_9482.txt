While I understand that certain materials, especially those promoting violence or advocating for hate, must be removed from library collections, I believe that the practice of censorship must be enforced very cautiously and judiciously. 

First and foremost, I urge libraries to remember the power that they have as public institutions, and to approach any decision to censor materials with a sense of responsibility. Libraries are, in many ways, the heart of a community; they should be kept open and inviting for everyone and should offer a safe space free from any potential forms of discrimination.

However, any material should only be removed when it is being used to directly encourage violent or hateful behaviour. If the material is being used to bring forth an important conversation or spark a debate, then its presence should be valued and embraced. 

Moreover, censorship should be conducted openly and remain open to public dialogue. The library should provide a public forum in which individuals can voice their opinions and provide feedback to the library on which materials should be censored. Such a dialogue ensures the library remains an open and level playing field, in which all members of the community can engage in discussions surrounding the merits of any material in
