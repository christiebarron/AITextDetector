I still remember the moment when I first really laughed with another person. I was a freshman in college, living on my own for the first time. I'd gone to a dinner party with some classmates, many of whom I'd never met before. Being the shy, introverted person I was, I kept to myself doing my best to blend in with the wall.

That is until the conversation turned to funny memories from our respective childhoods. Everyone there was already animated and engaged and I was starting to feel relaxed enough to join in on one of the conversations. After a few minutes of back and forth, I eventually revealed a particularly embarrassing moment from my fifth grade year, which ended with this giant orb shaped slide and me jumping off giving it a hug. 

The group erupted with laughter, at first in disbelief but gradually turning to more appreciative, boisterous laughter. As everyone erupted in laughter, I found myself joining in and realized that laughing along with them made me feel even better than just being the recipient of the laughter. Suddenly I felt much more a part of the group and welcomed.

The moment lasted for a few minutes but still stands out in my mind almost a decade later. It was the moment I realized that laughter was a bridge between people and that it could make us feel connected in a way that few other things can.
