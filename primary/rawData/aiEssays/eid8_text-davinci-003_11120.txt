I had been friends with Greg for a few years, but we had never gotten along particularly well. He was always joking around and trying to make people laugh, while I was much more of an introvert, content to observe the world at a distance. I was intrigued by Greg's witty nature, but I stayed at arm's length most of the time. 

One day we took a work trip together, and I had to admit it was far less tense and uncomfortable than I had thought it was going to be. We chatted about our co-workers and our jobs, and even laughed a few times. 

Things got really interesting after the sun went down, though. We found ourselves in the middle of an enormous field with nothing to do, and Greg started cracking jokes about the situation. Before I knew it, I was laughing so hard I was almost crying. 

That was when I realized that I had been missing out on an important part of our friendship. Even though I was (and am) still more reserved than Greg, I was able to laugh and enjoy his presence. That night, we got to know one another better than ever before, and I gained a newfound appreciation for the bond of friendship that laughter can bring.
