I believe that censorship of materials in libraries and public spaces is a very wrong attitude and is necessary of a free society, and that in the name of freedom we must always make it so in the name of free speech.

"I would urge that you reconsider your attitudes and approach to censorship at all possible times and at all times without prejudice to those in charge of our libraries and our public places. To this end of course it is important to respect, and to continue to protect and safeguard the rights of non-religious persons when, in our view, it is necessary of a free society to do so."

Earlier, the council's chairman, Professor Chris Porth, criticised the move.

"I think if we have a policy that is contrary to human rights then we should stand on our heads very carefully and we will do so. I think that this is an important factor by which our people will know that we do not want to censor or take steps that may affect religion or the freedom that we seek in communities."
