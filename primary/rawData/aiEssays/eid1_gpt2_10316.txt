1. Read the original script.

Many people forget that this book was written the same way. What was there to do with it? It contained many of the same elements as the original, including:

A story about our hero, a young woman named Gendarmes.

We made her an apprentice. We created great magic through her. Gendarmes was so powerful, that when she fell into a depression she could destroy a room in three seconds. Her magical strength and determination made her an extremely formidable adversary. All attempts to protect her from these dangers, failed.

She was called the Angel of Shadows. And so we set her free. From that time, she lived peacefully with us. She is now known as "the Angel of Shadows.

2. Learn how to use my powers.

When Gendarmes was sent into the Labyrinth by her demon lord, his powers allowed him to use her powers. The only problem was that she was weaker than normal.
