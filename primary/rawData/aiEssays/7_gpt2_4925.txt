An example of a time someone in my life was patient was on the phone with me about my family. And we asked, how do we help them understand that these are people who are suffering under this tyranny? And that is a truly frightening time.

But we had not been asked for help before and as a consequence we took the opportunity to offer our condolences and support. As a result, we have now taken the time to respond quickly to our voicemails and respond to your questions and concerns.

And we can say that the first person to call was Lianne De La Torre. She immediately took up the phone to respond, and, on the way back, the call was addressed to our great and loved family. She thanked us for the support and said there is no place in your world where it's not necessary to give support at every step of a conversation.

If you call us, we're happy to help you. We're offering a simple gesture of our gratitude. We would appreciate it if you can make your phone ring once more. In doing so, we realize that you and your loved ones are the only ones we can ever count on.

Sincerely,
