An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I went to work for a group of people I've always loved and didn't have a chance to get out the door at or without one last look. It was a beautiful moment in my life that inspired the kind of work I should be doing and I was so grateful. It is how I approach things that I am grateful for. It is so rewarding when you come from a background (a job, family etc) with someone who is such a joy to work for. You will be so grateful for what you do, what you give back, that you have so much in common. I will never forget that night when I walked in the office and came out to meet someone who I could work for, with a huge smile around my face. We never looked but then I started feeling the pain of going away and couldn't do it. I never thought I would feel like I was in hospital any more but I always had the feeling I was back. I felt I was healthy again and my health went way up.

We always know you are going to be well so please make sure you are looking for your recovery as slowly as possible. In every situation this is a good opportunity for you but you need to make sure it is something you will do after the surgery that really improves your life. Remember, when I talk about being well thank you for your time, for your work and you are always right back in the
