Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have had on people over the past few decades. Computers have revolutionized many aspects of our everyday lives, from the way we communicate, to how we work, and even how we entertain ourselves. However, the positive aspects of computers need to be balanced by considering their negative effects.

Firstly, computers are often blamed for reducing physical activity and a sedentary lifestyle. Studies have linked a decrease in physical activity to a number of chronic diseases, leading to an increasing incidence of preventable illness. It is therefore important to consider how much time we are spending in front of a computer and strive to achieve a balance between physical and mental activity.

Secondly, computers can also lead to a decrease in meaningful social interaction. With the development of social media, people are more likely to ‘connect’ electronically than they are to communicate in person. As a result, children and young adults are at risk of not being able to develop social skills, such as cooperation, communication and empathy, which are essential life skills.

Finally, there is much evidence to suggest that computers can lead to an increase in sedentary behaviour and a decrease in physical activity, both of which can contribute to many health related problems. It is therefore important to find ways to incorporate exercise and regular physical activity into our lives, while also reducing the amount of time spent in front of a computer or device.

In conclusion
