One time I experienced laughter in my life was when it was clear what type of person I would become while waiting for my marriage, and it was my first wedding day. I decided in my twenties to take a vow of celibacy and to get married in this country, but I knew I didn't want to put it off. Even after all the hard work I put in to try and change my mindset, I just couldn't change it. When I went to the hospital shortly afterwards, they showed me the hospital gown I had put on to help me. I thought to myself, "Why am I taking this path anyway? Why am I even in the hospital?" And finally I said, "The only way I should ever decide to marry a woman is to wait on somebody else." Not because I hate marriage, I want the men in my life to like my wife. I didn't want a life in hell that was a long process. I was born to give birth to my first child, and now my mother has turned me into a woman.

And so, I went to the hospital after having a hard time and couldn't find a doctor. I thought for a moment. My partner doesn't talk about it. But I figured maybe at least a professional in the community could help. And so, I was brought by the local physician to see where my husband is, to ensure I came to their hospital room a little bit earlier. The doctor was really kind and caring
