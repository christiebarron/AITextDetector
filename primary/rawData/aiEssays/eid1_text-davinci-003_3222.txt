Dear Editor:

Computers have had a tremendous impact on science, medicine, education and almost every facet of modern life. However, I believe certain drawbacks accompany this technology. With so much focus on digital media, people have started to follow a trend of less physical interaction.

The majority of us spend countless hours on our social media accounts catching up on the latest news and gossip, discussing problems, and updating our own lives. While this level of connection can be beneficial at times, it has bred a type of loneliness that people of the past never experienced. Deprived of meaningful interactions and communication, people find themselves emotionally disconnected from each other and isolated from society.

Moreover, increased screens time has had a serious and detrimental effect on children and young adults. I recently read that the average child spends seven and a half hours a day viewing digital media. Studies have concluded that it can have a negative effect on physical health, emotional stability, sleep, and learning.

We live in a world where technology is an integral part of our lives. While computers have advantages and offer huge potential for creativity and knowledge, it should not be a substitute for physical, real-life relationships. We must start to recognize the boundary between
