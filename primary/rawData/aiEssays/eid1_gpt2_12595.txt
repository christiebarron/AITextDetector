Computers have many effects on people. Your cognitive ability develops for two or more weeks after exposure to a chemical exposure. The process gets slow, but doesn't last long. You might still have questions about whether your memory and cognitive ability were affected and will need some sort of correction. It's also possible to think of a biological cause rather than a psychological impact on your physical health (such as genetic or environmental factors that make someone more prone to physical illness).

The health effects of exposure to toxic chemicals can vary from individual to individual.

Chemicals that contain traces of chemicals that are very dangerous to humans include arsenic, chromium, lead and lead arsenate as well as sodium carbonate, bisphenol A (bisphenyl esters), bisphenol-4-butanediol (bisphenol-4-butanol) and molybdenum bis(chloroform) and sodium stearate (stearic ammonia). The compounds have a strong effect on your bodily tissues and can affect certain genes within your body and your immune systems.

In the past it was common for people with respiratory or liver disease (in which their immune and intestinal systems shut down at an early stage or when their body is exposed to a toxic substance), to develop respiratory problems, which can last for hours depending on what stage your symptoms are from and may even have the side effects of alcohol and other chemicals as well.
