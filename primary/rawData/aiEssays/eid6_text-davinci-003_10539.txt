The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the building. In 1932, when the chief engineer of the Empire State Building, William Lamb, proposed a mooring mast on top of the building to allow dirigibles to dock, the entire plan seemed like a pipe dream.

The first obstacle was the fact that the mast itself was ambitious. It would have to be 400 feet tall and be situated between two chimneys located just above the 86th floor. The engineers were tasked with making sure that the mast was light and strong enough to hold the weight of the airship. In addition, the engineers had to make sure that the mast could withstand high winds without swaying. 

The second obstacle was the high cost of actually building the mast. The cost of the project was relatively high, as the steel used was very costly. Additionally, the engineers had to be sure that the steel could withstand the high winds, which added even more expense. Lamb and his team eventually found a way to build the mast, using lighter and cheaper materials, but the overall cost for the project was still significantly higher than they originally planned for. 

The final obstacle was environmental safety. The engineers had to consider the safety of the passengers and crew on the dirigible if it were to dock on the top of the Empire State Building. To ensure a safe landing, they would have to consider the variable width of the air
