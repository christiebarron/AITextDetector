One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was trying to get a sense of some sort of power. I never even heard my voice," he said.

The man told the New Jersey Times: "They took my phone â€” I'm not gonna call that man. But he gave me my ID, he handed it to me and said, 'Get this guy to come over.' I was like, 'I don't want you all arrested.'"

"I felt like a joke," he added.

He said the woman's testimony was "kind of terrifying" to him, but that he was "very proud of" her story.

The state does not appear to be involved in the prosecution of the case.
