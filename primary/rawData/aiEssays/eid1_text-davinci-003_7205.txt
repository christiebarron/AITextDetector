The features of the setting in "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski have a significant impact on the cyclist. The gloomy backdrop of the forested road creates a sense of dread for the cyclist as he begins his ride. The dark trees and lack of sunlight provide a sense of isolation and despair that the cyclist struggles with as he pedals through the unfamiliar terrain.

The setting is also described in a way that accentuates the physical demands of the ride. The "narrow, winding" paths effectively portray the challenges the cyclist faces and the need to balance speed and caution. The hills, gravel, and wind that he encounters along the way only add to the difficulty. The cyclist has to struggle against these elements in order to reach the end.

The sparse details in the setting also showcase the cyclist's determination to finish the ride. No one else is there for him and he has to rely on himself to push through and persevere. The desolation of the setting serves to emphasise the difficulty of the task at hand and the strength of the cyclist's character in the face of adversity.

Overall, the features of the setting in "Rough Road Ahead" have a strong impact on the cyclist. The difficulties of the terrain and the lack of outside supports push the cyclist to his limits, forcing him to dig deep and summon strength he never knew he had. The gloomy atmosphere of the setting also symbolically serves to illustrate the grueling nature of the cyclist
