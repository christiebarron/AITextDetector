As technology continues to advance and become increasingly prevalent in our society, its impact upon our lives is incontestable. Computers, in particular, have had a significant effect on us physically, mentally, and emotionally. As a result, it is important that we recognize the impact that computers have on our daily lives.

From a physical standpoint, computers have been linked to impacting our posture, vision, and joint conditions. Sitting in front of a computer for extended periods of time can lead to increased strain on the neck, shoulders, and wrists. This stress on our bodies can not only lead to physical pain, but can also become a long-term health issue in some instances.

Mentally, computers can also have a profound impact. Increased computer usage has been associated with decreased focus and attention spans. This can make it difficult for people to read, write, and take in information in a comprehensive way. In addition, we are spending more time looking at computer screens and absorbing digital information, which is in stark contrast to the way that our minds have evolved for millions of years, and so, it should come as no surprise that our cognition and mental abilities may be affected.
