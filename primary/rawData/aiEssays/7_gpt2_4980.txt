An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the time when I was asked to give me a second chance in the media, or a second chance for some real news. And she would call me, and she could get to know my family and my friends, and it was like, I was never here. I'd go to bed at 5 a.m., we would be driving, and I'd just stare at her picture on my computer screen. And you think, the moment I get a phone call from an actor, I can say, "Thanks, that's who I am," I can say, "Come on, you have to learn to be successful now." When I went to Stanford, I met a guy who'd been doing public broadcasting for more than 25 years and was in his mid-20s, so he was talking about how he wanted me to do, on "The Biggest News Day of our Century," and he asked me, "What makes you go into the news like that?" I wasn't doing it to help them and I wouldn't think about it, so I asked him to take an interview, and he just took up an interview.

"So, was there something special you had to do, or was there something that just kept coming up in your head, something that really just pushed you to work so hard because you weren't working for the networks that you were supposed to do?"
