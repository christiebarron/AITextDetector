The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because at last the world stops. A year earlier, in December 1387 when one of the original members of the Church assembled to discuss a meeting about the state of the churches, a fire began in a large, abandoned church in the northern suburb of London. The city, the Church of England, was declared the only Christian community in North America. After a few months of searching and planning, and having spent many years building up an extensive site of churches that are now known as the Town House Church, the church was called off as planned. This is where the following picture, taken a half century later, comes in.


One of the earliest known examples of a "fire" was taken just after Christmas in 1597. On Dec. 9 this year a church in the town of Oxfordshire was destroyed by a fire, that of which had become so terrible that the parish priest, Sir Francis M. Bligh, was sent to Boston to investigate. He determined that an incendiaries and a fire had been burned down, and found that "the whole town was burned to the ground for the sake of Christ's blood."

I can easily see the significance of that. Perhaps when I write about the first churches I think this one day of the London fire.
