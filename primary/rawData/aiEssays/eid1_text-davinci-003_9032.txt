Dear Editor,

It's no secret that computers have drastically reshaped our lives in many ways. They've changed the way we work, how we spend our leisure time, and even how we communicate. But what few people realize is the effect that computers have on people.

Many people see computers as a harmless tool, but the reality is that they can have serious psychological effects. Studies have found that exposure to computer screens and technology can cause an increase in stress, anxiety, and depression. This is especially true for people who use them for hours at a time each day. Computers can also affect our physical health, leading to increased fatigue, sleep disruption, and joint pain.

Furthermore, increased reliance on technology can lead to social isolation. The ability to communicate using computers, video calls, and text messages can be a great help, but it can also lead to people feeling disconnected from the people they're interacting with. Relationships can suffer as a result.

This isn't to say that computers should be avoided altogether. Just like with anything, moderation is key. Computers have brought great advances to our lives and should be considered an invaluable resource when used responsibly. However, it is important to remember to take regular breaks from the screens and take some time for real-life social interaction, exercise, and relaxation.

In conclusion, computers can be a great asset when used in moderation and with caution. We should all be mindful of the potential effects
