Computers have many effects on people. The first, or the longest-lasting, causes people to take medications based on "their unique needs or physical condition." Patients can use medications to reduce their risk before they take them to prevent their disease.

But for a variety of reasons, the benefits of medications vary widely in people's lives. Some drugs like Vicodin, a very effective anti-tumor drug, are more commonly recommended for long-term weight loss and to relieve symptoms of depression and anxiety. And some drugs like the antipsychotics citalopram and paroxetine, for people with schizophrenia, have had fewer side effects than other medications, despite their proven positive effects on the bodies of older patients in the treatment.

There is the fear that patients with mental illness may develop these drug-induced behaviors, just as older patients with cognitive decline have, and some experts have suggested that these behaviors go away under certain circumstances. But this study, however, suggested that if people had long-term and very effective preventive treatments that worked on every symptom of their mental illness, they might simply not get depression in the short term. So while we'd expect to see fewer people go on to use addictive and prescription drugs, the fact is there are many potential health benefits for a combination of medications.
