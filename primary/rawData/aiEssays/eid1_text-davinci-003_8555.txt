I didn't even know it at the time, but the time I spent as a volunteer in Africa was easily one of the most educational experiences I've ever had. 

It was difficult - really difficult. There were long waits, difficult conversations, projects that went nowhere, and expectations that weren't clear. Like most new experiences, it was definitely a trial by fire.

But to handle it all, I had to be patient. Really patient. Not just with others, but with myself as well. I had to keep my cool when plans changed at the last minute, or when things went completely haywire. At times it felt like an insurmountable challenge, but I kept plugging away, kept trying to be understanding and tolerant.

I remember one time in particular where everyone was hung up on a project and it felt like nothing was working. We had a whole plan set up and nothing was budging. But fear not, I kept my cool and rallied everyone together. We just decided to take a break, talk it out, and come up with something else.

And that's exactly what we did. We ended up replanning the whole thing in a much smarter way, and the project turned out to be a huge success.

I'm really grateful for that experience. It taught me the power of being patient, and how it can open up new doors.
