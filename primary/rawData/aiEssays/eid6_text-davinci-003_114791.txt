The building of the Empire State Building was an immense engineering feat that faced many obstacles and hardships. One of the most baffling problems encountered during the construction of the building was how to allow dirigibles to dock on the pinnacle of the building. This challenge was made even more difficult as there had never been an attempt to dock an airship on a building like this before.

This had become a major concern because the dirigible was seen as the next wave of transportation – a way for people to travel faster than over land or water. So in an effort to draw attention to the building, the developers wanted to show that their building was capable of hosting the future of transportation.

The first obstacle to overcome was the wind. The docking structure for the dirigible had to be designed so that it was strong enough to resist high winds and keep the airship in a stationary position. This was made even more difficult by the fact that the higher elevations on the building and the fact that the structure needed to be created without using an exterior pipe or braces that would hold the ship in place. 

Another key issue was the structure of the building itself. The building was made from steel and concrete which meant that the potential for corrosion was a serious concern. The solution was to use corrosion-resistant alloy materials for the mast and anchors that could be submerged into the building’s frame and fastened securely.
