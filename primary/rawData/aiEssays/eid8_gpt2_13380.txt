One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I used to get "the worst" of someone.

The truth is that I don't think that laughter is something to be feared. I think laughter is something to be embraced. We all have something to laugh at. I find that laughter is both wonderful and powerful. In my own day, having laughter is a matter of personal choice when my time and money come up short—and in my own life, that is one of the last things we can do.

When we laugh and joke, it is often with laughter in general—I do. We laugh out loud on our lunch break or in a bar, but we do it in a whole different way. If anyone jokes too much, we won't get through it.

It just goes to show that when we don't laugh, one of the best things we can do is to use laughter as a means to overcome our loneliness and stress. It's part of what makes us tick. And there is something so wonderfully healthy about doing so, so happy.
