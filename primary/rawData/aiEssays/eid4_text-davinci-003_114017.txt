 

Min-fong Ho ends Winter Hibiscus with "When they come back in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again?" to demonstrate the character's hope and perseverance. Through this imagery of renewal, Ho conveys a message that although the character may initially fail, the ability to try again in the future presents a sense of perseverance and resilience. This ties in with the overarching theme of the poem to keep trying, even in times of adversity. The ending of the poem emphasizes the character's determination to keep going despite her initial failure to pass the test, showing her optimism and faith in the chance of success in the future.
