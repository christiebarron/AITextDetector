The Empire State Building was the tallest structure in the world for nearly forty years, and was designed with a most unique feature at the time; the ability to dock dirigibles or large airships. While the concept of allowing a lighter-than-air craft to dock at the tower was a remarkable engineering feat, it was far from easy to accomplish. In “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the hurdles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building, and inherent difficulties of tethering airships to the mast, are explored in great detail. 

When the idea was proposed, the first and greatest obstacle was the structure of the building itself; the foundations were laid without the intention of constructing such an ambitious feature into the Design. After the construction staff determined it was feasible to incorporate a mooring mast at the very top of the Empire State Building, the next challenge was the actual engineering of the project. Not only did it require significant structural modifications to the upper-most floors but the developers were also tasked with creating a mast strong enough to support a large airship without compromising the integrity of the building, as well as suspending it over the edge of the building without any support from the ground.  

In order to make the project a reality, the engineers had to develop and implement a mooring system that would securely tether an airship to the mast while allowing it to move with the wind in any direction.
