The Empire State Building was perhaps the most daring skyscraper to be engineered during the early twentieth century. When it was opened in 1931, its 1,454 foot structure was the tallest in the world. As an iconic symbol of New York City, it drew developers and architects from around the world to witness its engineering wonder.

One of the most remarkable features of the Empire State Building was its capacity to allow dirigibles to dock atop the building. This was made possible through its unique mooring mast, designed particularly for lighter-than-air airships. Despite its potential, the idea of a dirigible docking at the Empire State Building was far from fruition, as the planning and building of the mooring mast presented many challenges to the builders.

Firstly, the mooring mast had to be designed and built with the utmost precision. Unlike other structures, the mooring mast had to be able to withstand winds of a significantly greater magnitude than the force the buildings could have borne. The attachment points for the airships had to be incredibly strong and secure in order to withstand the tremendous forces of the dirigibles. 

Furthermore, the mast had to be tall enough so that the dirigibles could safely maneuver around it while docking. As a result, the mooring mast had to be higher than the 102nd floor of the Empire State Building. This meant that the group in charge of engineering the mooring mast had to consider engineering
