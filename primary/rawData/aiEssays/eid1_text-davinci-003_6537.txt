Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects of computers on people. Computers have become an integral part of everyday life for countless people. While computers can be extremely helpful in many ways, they have the potential to cause negative effects in peopleâ€™s lives. 

First and foremost, computers can cause physical health issues. Too much sitting in a chair, staring at a computer screen can lead to poor posture, eyestrain, and fatigue. They can also cause stress from information overload and deadlines. The advent of social media allows users to obsess over the lives of others, comparing themselves and leading to feelings of insecurity, depression, and anxiety. 

On a more positive note, computers can be very beneficial when used sparingly and with great caution. They can open up a world of information and knowledge. Additionally, they can help improve productivity at work by streamlining tedious tasks and quickening the communication process. Furthermore, they can also help people better manage their time and connect to a global network.

All in all, it is important to approach computer usage with caution since it can be both beneficial and damaging. Hopefully, this letter has shown that computers require great care and consideration when used, and I believe readers should be aware of the potential risks and rewards. 

Sincerely,

[Name]
