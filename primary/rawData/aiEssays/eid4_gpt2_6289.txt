The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it is a great story of our own! And there are several things I enjoy. The opening moments are very nice and you would be hard pressed to guess what the most fascinating action sequence is going to be. There is a really good line about 'the moment we hear the noise' and it's almost funny because we would be surprised if nothing happened there that wasn't Formerly the same time and place.

I would say that the action sequences I love are the ones to keep you awake at night because you would have wanted to keep your head high in the morning. You would have had to be thinking, 'Hey, all I'm doing now is dreaming.' So, no, I think the book is very beautiful – it is, although somewhat clunky. It is a much broader theme, it is interesting, but it is also highly descriptive, as you know. One thing that really stuck with me most during this whole experience was my first novel, The Shadow, came at this book and was a real delight. I felt all of these words in mine but I have always felt this way about what I know in other works. Like, I would have loved this book to come and tell you. The realisation that I had such a big time from reading this book is something else – I have to ask, now, how many books did you read, in other words, how many of each are in your life
