Censorship in libraries has long been a point of contention in the world of academia, and it is important that we continue to question the wisdom and necessity of censoring materials we deem offensive. I believe that libraries should maintain a commitment to free expression and material choice, and that censorship of any kind should be subject to a strict set of guidelines.

One of the most obvious arguments against censorship is the dangerous precedent of censorship it sets. It is in a library's best interest to foster a diverse and inclusive space, one that allows patrons of all ages and backgrounds to find something to believe in. It is concerning that libraries could be seen as gatekeepers of knowledge, deciding for their patrons what can be read and what cannot. 

Further, censorship can appear arbitrary and without consistency. If books, for example, are deemed too offensive for circulation, who makes that determination and what guidelines are used? Without codified standards for censoring materials, libraries could find themselves in the tricky situation of being too lenient or too conservative in their censorship policies. This may lead to patrons feeling cheated or excluded in their access to information and knowledge.

Finally, I do not doubt that controversial materials exist, and on occasion, can cause offense. However, libraries should focus on educating their patrons on such materials. Instead of removing offensive materials, libraries can open a dialogue with their patrons, better informing them on the contents of the material and why it may be deemed offensive. This approach
