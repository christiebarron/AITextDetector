The narrator in the poem is looking for hope and resilience in the face of a difficult situation. By ending with the expectation of spring and the metaphor of the hibiscus (remembering the narrator's grandmothers and the resilience of the hibiscus), the narrator is reinforcing the idea that challenges can be faced and even overcome with resilience, perseverance, and hope.
