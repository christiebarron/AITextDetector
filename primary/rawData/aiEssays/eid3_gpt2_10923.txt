Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. Some cyclists are more concerned about safety with the setting of their tires than with the number of bikes being ridden in a day on the stretch of road at Tynemouth St. They know that in most situations the bike will only need a short distance on the road to cross it. A single trip can leave some cyclists feeling a bit more stressed than the next ride would.

"What we are doing, I think, is setting up a framework for an analysis of the impact that is being done to reduce the number of rides on a road in some form. These include the number of bikes that will ride one per day on any given stretch of road in your day, the number of miles we expect cyclists to get from crossing a road with a particular wheel on it during an event or by bike."

The objective is to estimate a standard number of bicycles to cover most of any given stretch of road. As they approach this point, the authors look for ways to improve the experience on the road in addition to reducing overall vehicle usage.

"What we are doing is putting out a short survey on riders (at least one of whom would be an active cyclist on the road); that is, trying to set a range of numbers for how much their bicycle will need to travel from the start to the finish, and where to cross each crossroad and which route to use for those numbers. We
