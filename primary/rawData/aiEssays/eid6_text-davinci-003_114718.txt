The Empire State Building was an ambitious architectural achievement in 1931. Not only did it hold records for its height, it was designed to allow dirigibles to dock, an impressive feat. Unfortunately, this endeavor was faced with many obstacles. 

The building's design was an ambitious task in itself. The top of the building had to be built with a 300-foot long mooring mast, solid enough to withstand strong winds and big enough to internally contain an elevator that could take passengers up and down to the mooring deck. In addition, the building had to be built with a hatch through which a dirigible could pass into the building. This meant that engineers had to design the building with a wide but not too wide opening.

The construction of the mooring mast faced other practical issues. Despite numerous unsuccessful attempts and much wasted energy, finally engineers found a solution that worked. They decided to drill deep enough into the ground that they could use steel ties to connect the mooring mast to the bedrock. This allowed them to bolt cast-iron valve rings into the mooring mast at various heights, which would allow the dirigible's mooring ropes to be looped through and secured onto them.

Despite all the hard work involved in the physical construction of the mooring mast, dirigibles never docked at the Empire State Building. The idea that passengers could conveniently step onto an elevator to travel down to street level and beyond
