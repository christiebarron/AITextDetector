I remember one night when my best friend and I were up late whispering about all the secrets we shared. We were delighted that we had found a way to really connect in such a comfortable and liberating way. Suddenly, I noticed a funny smirk on her face, and before I knew it we were both doubled over with laughter. It was one of those deep, uncontrollable fits that wash over you in the most delightful and unexpected way.

We just couldn't stop! Our little secret had been so bubbly and charged with energy that it had created a kind of invisible electricity in the air. Laughing together like that opened us up to the kind of communication that words can't reach and I'll never forget how feeling so connected to my best friend felt that night.

We were exhausted and relieved when we finished our fit of laughter. As we settled back into our beds we just looked at each other with complete understanding and everything was okay. We were, and still are, closer than ever.
