Censorship is an agonizingly controversial topic, especially in libraries. While some people argue that certain materials – such as books, music, movies, and magazines – should be removed from libraries if they are found to be offensive, I strongly disagree. 

Libraries should not censor any material, regardless of a personal judgment regarding its content. The collection of materials in the library is for the education and enjoyment of the public, and it should not be limited due to the informal beliefs of library staff. If a material contains material which someone may find offensive, they are always free to simply not read or watch it if they do not want to. We must reject any effort to prevent others from expressing their ideas, even if we find those ideas shocking or immoral. 

Furthermore, censorship in libraries is often applied too widely, resulting in suppression of materials which could otherwise be helpful or of educational significance. For instance, books which contain information on certain "shocking" topics – such as racism, religion, and politics – could be misconstrued as offensive and end up being banned from libraries. This deprives people of access to important facts and opinions which could potentially spark meaningful discussions and help individuals broaden their horizons. 

Finally, censorship of materials in libraries raises the concern of government interference. Once censorship policies are set in place, the government has the power to exercise control over which books are allowed on library shelves and can potentially manipulate the public by denying access
