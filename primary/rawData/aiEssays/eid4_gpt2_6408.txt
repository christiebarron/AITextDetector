The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it explores the long-abandoned relationship between the two, its relationship with the other, the world of the human in which they were born, which they are now part of. Because it begins with the long-abandoned relationship between Hibiscus and the world (and to their eventual fate), Winter Hibiscus is one of the reasons she writes a book about it. A reader may say that "When a life is short and your hopes and dreams and aspirations run out you're pretty much stuck forever on that one person that will have to start over again. That's when you'll find your own life, that's when you realize that it's easier to find what works for you, that you'll have a life of your own, or whatever you wish for. It's kind of about how to move forward again." Because so many children are taught that life doesn't have to end. The reason she wrote Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is because there's always a hope for what can happen for everyone, even these very people who are never even born. It was my hope, my hope, that she would tell the stories of a series of children who have turned their lives around and now become heroes like them.

The story of Winter Hibiscus, the world's most famous snowflake, begins when she is just six years old when an evil family is trying to steal all of Snow White
