Computers have many effects on people. By providing a virtual memory facility for your computers to store information about your work, you can reduce this number and reduce the time it takes to compute your data. If you can find yourself storing data in a computerized storage technology that can be easily switched off and switched back on, then the time difference between copying data to and from your computer, and making the required changes to the memory, is negligible.

So, what's the problem with having virtual machines, or your own PCs, sitting around?

The answer is that you do not need to make any such changes to your system, just as not having any virtual-dedicated PCs would make your PCs obsolete. And even if you did find your virtual machines, many of them would be obsolete to this day. But a virtual machine would mean you would need either to create and read your data in a virtual storage device that wasn't a physical object from within your computer, or use a third-party storage device outside of your computer where you would need to copy data to and from your computer on your own, not from your computer's memory or anywhere within your computer. With your virtual devices, as you may know, Meccano and Brown see an advantage in having them in a different form to your physical device. They see the difference between knowing when to read data from a new file, and using a third party storage device, and when and to use it on your physical computer
