Dear Editor:

I write to express my opinion on the effects computers have had on people in recent years.

Today, it is hard to imagine our lives without computers, since they are used in almost every industry and area. We rely on computers for research, entertainment, and communication. However, while computer use has brought many advantages to our lives, it also poses several risks.

For instance, prolonged computer use can have a detrimental effect on our physical health. Prolonged use of the computer can lead to strain and pain in our eyes and hands. Also, there is often a lack of physical activity due to the nature of computer use, leading to an increase in weight and a decrease in mental and physical energy.

On the mental side, computer use may encourage people to become dependent on digital devices, instead of relying on their own analyzing and problem-solving skills. Furthermore, it may also isolate people, as they may end up spending more time in front of their computer than socializing with others. 

Despite these risks, properly regulated computer use can still bring many advantages to life. To take advantage of the merits of technology without allowing it to overshadow our wellbeing, we must practice computer use responsibly. We must see to it that we keep technology balanced with activities that require physical and emotional energy, such as sports and outdoor activities, family and friend contact, and other hobbies.

I encourage readers to consider the risks associated with computer
