The builders of the Empire State Building faced a unique set of obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The idea of a tall mooring mast atop a skyscraper was thought to be an impossible engineering feat and presented a major challenge to the builders. However, the risks posed by an unstable airship docking to the side of a skyscraper in an incredibly windy city made this a necessary solution to the problem of airship travel.

The Empire State Building presented an almost perfect structure for allowing dirigibles to dock. At 1,250 feet tall, the building provided a rigid vertical mast that could securely hold the weight of a large airship while still providing enough portability to be easily maneuvered away in times of high wind and turbulent weather.

However, in order for the mooring mast to be a viable solution to the problem of airship docking, the architects of the Empire State Building had to design to accommodate a unique set of conditions. Wind presented a major issue, as gusts of forty miles per hour or greater could easily topple or cause severe damage to a large dirigible. This meant that the mooring mast had to be designed to safely withstand the wind, and it had to be tall enough to provide the necessary amount of drag on the airship to keep it in place.

In addition, the Empire State Building had to be built with special steel-reinforced cables to attach the airship to the top of the
