The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. As a result, there were no direct-to-consumer (DTV) docking platforms to connect the spacecraft to the ground, though a docking module could hold a satellite, allowing it to pass over Earth. Even so, it is difficult to imagine having many DTVs over the entire span of a spacecraft's lifespan.

In 1967, the Soviets deployed a system called the A-class manned space station. Each compartment's spacecraft would be made of two sections, each one carrying a payload of up to 20,000 metric tons of food and fuel each. On the inside, the spacecraft would hold 100 people in either orbit or in orbit around a target planet orbiting some 10,000 light-years away. On the top of each compartment are a dozen docking ports, each of which could hold three people. The A-class station's docking station would also be capable of using satellites as communications headsets to transmit data through. But, even on the inside, both the crew and the station were not on a mission to orbit, let alone orbit. Rather, both would have to make an unassisted docking pass for the spacecraft to dock. In some configurations, this allowed a crewmember to orbit but fail, which had the greatest disadvantage of all: the station would have to close down to provide an antenna for the docking station's spacecraft to operate at its full power. The crew's spacecraft would also
