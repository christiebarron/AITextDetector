I used to work in a hotel as a receptionist and often greeted guests arriving late at night or in the early hours of the morning. One night I greeted a guest who was quite clearly having a very bad day. He was aggressive and demanding, and was frustrated that we didnâ€™t have a room for him right away. 

I took a deep breath and stayed calm. I then worked quickly to find him a room, and even offered him a free night stay as an apology for the delay. It took some effort but eventually he was satisfied and went to his room. 

Even though he had been rude to me and was very difficult to deal with, I had managed to stay patient and reasoned with him. I was proud of myself for staying so composed and patient during the situation.
