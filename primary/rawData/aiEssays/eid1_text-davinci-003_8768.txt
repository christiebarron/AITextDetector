I still remember that moment like it was yesterday. It was my very first date with the love of my life. We were sitting in a restaurant, just talking and laughing over dinner. 

All of a sudden, we both began to burst out laughing uncontrollably at something seemingly silly and insignificant. It felt like we were the only two people in the entire world who were aware of the moment that we were in. Our laughter went on for what felt like hours, and the people around us simply looked on with confusion. We couldn’t have cared less, though.

That moment was so special to me, because it was in that moment that I knew that we would be together forever. It was like laughter was all it took to break down all of the barriers that had been keeping us apart. 

I am so grateful for laugh-filled moments like these that have helped to bring us close, and to enjoy not only each other's company, but our life together. They remind us that even in life’s craziest moments, we can still find something to laugh about and enjoy.
