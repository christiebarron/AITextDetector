I believe that censorship of materials in libraries violates the free-speech rights of the free people," he said.

There has been speculation surrounding the scope of the debate, according to the Washington Post. According to the website, the Post noted that "The ACLU's privacy strategy could ultimately put an end to online protests."

"The United States, including universities and police departments, is particularly concerned about online censorship of books," the Post said.

The protests were scheduled to take place on Saturday, but there is disagreement about whether to hold the demonstrations. The government has the power to ban or halt the demonstrations, the Post says. The White House has said that the protests would likely go on if the White House had the power and the threat of violence were not enough to stop the demonstrations. That may be in the case if the protests did move beyond New Year's Day. Also on the agenda are rallies against the new president in a city near the epicenter of the protests.
