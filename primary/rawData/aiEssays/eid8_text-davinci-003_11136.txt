I remember it like it was yesterday -- the moment was so magical that the memory of it has stayed with me ever since.

I was at a party, surrounded by my closest friends and having a great time. We were all laughing and joking around when I told a joke that I thought was actually pretty funny - I was sure no one would laugh.

The joke went on and on and then all of a sudden, the room erupted in laughter. I couldn't believe it - I was so shocked and delighted to have what I thought was a terrible joke bring so much joy and laughter to everyone in the room.

The laughter was infectious, and it felt like it went on forever. Everyone was hugging and smiling, and I felt so happy and connected to my friends in that moment. I can tell you that the laughter that night was like music - sweet, beautiful music.

Since that night I've learned that laughter really is the perfect medicine for the soul. Not only does it bring people together and strengthen relationships, but it also keeps us feeling young and alive. So next time you feel down or disconnected from someone, share a joke and use laughter to break the ice and bring everyone a bit closer together.
