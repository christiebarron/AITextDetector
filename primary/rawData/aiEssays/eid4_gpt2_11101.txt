The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it has taken us too far with this project," writes Nott. "Instead we need to step back to look at things we already know and understand."

The book begins with the opening of the book, and Nott tells fans that he is the author of the following, which also include two new sections about the Great Migration. (Note: This is a first from the book.) At the beginning of the first chapter, the Great Migration is taken over by people from Europe who have migrated west-and-indeed this may all be the case with the second chapter.

The book also describes how this migration will be used to create what we know of the Great Migration: it is not purely about the Great Migration but about many different "Greats" and some that we do not know about.
