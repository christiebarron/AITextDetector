The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' was so strong that it drew attention to how difficult it had become.

"It was a dark day when my mother told me, 'You'll never get divorced if you live this way!' And I went to my therapist a few days later and said she was not exaggerating. I was scared it might be some kind of physical or mental disorder or whatever, so I put Durant up with her depression and said 'Fuck off.'"

The depression had taken its toll on Durant.

Now, after years of living in the spotlight and having his wife live with him in the back room and having his children live with him on a third-floor balcony -- she had been living off the streets for more than 20 years -- Durant was able to regain some control over his mood.

"It is about the most extreme thing," he says. " Boh! It makes me crazy about it. It makes me feel horrible to be sitting there, I don't know."
