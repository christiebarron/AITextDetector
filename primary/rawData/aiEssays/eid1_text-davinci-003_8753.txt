I had been friends with my neighbor, Alex, for a few years. He was the only person I could truly rely on and trust with anything. One day, we decided to go bike riding around town together. We made small talk as we pedaled around, sharing life stories and catching up on each other's lives. 

Along the way, we stopped at a small park, and noticed a group of children playing tag. Alex and I watched the children's game with interest and a bit of nostalgia. Suddenly, one of the children chose to chase Alex, believing him to be "it." Alex waved his hands in surrender, but this only caused the kid to giggle harder and shouts of "Run, Alex, run!", echoing from the other kids. 

Alex and I looked at each other, unsure how to respond. Finally, we burst out laughing. It felt so liberating to just lightheartedly enjoy our friendship and the silly moment. We laughed until tears were streaming down our cheeks. 

The moment had brought us closer together than ever before. In that moment, our friendship was sealed by laughter, and I was grateful for it. Since then, laughter has remained our key to a strong relationship.
