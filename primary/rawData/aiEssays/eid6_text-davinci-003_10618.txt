The Empire State Building in New York City is one of the most iconic structures of the 20th century. It was designed to accommodate the docking of dirigibles, blimps and other airships, a feature that was intended to give the iconic building an even more imposing and futuristic look. However, there were a number of obstacles that the Empire State Building’s builders faced in allowing dirigibles to dock, as outlined in the book ‘The Mooring Mast’ by Marcia Amidon Lüsted.

The first major obstacle was the design of the building itself. The mooring mast was structurally identical to that of other buildings, but was specifically designed to be 650 feet taller than the rest of the Empire State Building. As a result, the airship docking system had to be specially built to support such a large and heavy structure. In addition, the mooring mast had to be tall enough that it wouldn’t cause any interference with air traffic. To achieve this, the mast had to be extended at an angle downward from the top of the building.

Another obstacle was the weather in New York City. Since the building was so tall, it needed to be able to withstand extreme weather, including powerful winds. To protect the mooring mast from being damaged by wind, the designers came up with an innovative solution – a metal canopy at the top of the mast that could be opened and closed to reduce vortex turbulence
