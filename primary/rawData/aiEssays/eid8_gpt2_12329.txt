One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was just five months old. I'd sit in a movie theater and a man was just staring in disbelief as he watched the film "The Interview." You could hardly believe that this man was just walking past the stage carrying a giant poster with a huge picture of Kim. That was the only conversation we had that moment together. Even after three years, the man that I knew knew that what he was doing was wrong. But it took me so long to figure out I didn't mean anyone's business. I think the thing we've always been in trouble for is trying to be both kinder and more forgiving, which usually seems more difficult.

On the internet, it comes as quite a shock when people are still going out of their way to criticize the internet for ruining their lives. I know what I need to do to stop the backlash. I'm actually surprised a lot of the people are actually thinking "hey, what the fuck is the point of this?" The fact that these people need to keep saying they need help and hope the internet will forgive them is part of a larger problem in life.

There is an abundance of bad news on the Internet when it comes to the Internet. There are more people being bullied, attacked, and made look bad on it than when they say shit about how much more important it is to their lives of being good at something. There is such a shitstorm of bad news out there
