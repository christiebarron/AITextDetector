The physical challenge is felt as the cyclist is "jostled," and must "clutch" onto the rough ground while "groaning." In the face of extreme difficulty, the cyclist keeps "persisting." The adverse weather conditions make the journey even harder, as the cyclist has to battle the "torrent of rain," as well as the thick mud of a "morass."
