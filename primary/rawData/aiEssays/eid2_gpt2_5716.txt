I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a serious problem, particularly with respect to speech, music, and the arts," he said. "With respect to the internet, it's very significant to think about how it affects the freedom of speech.

"In an age of online censorship, we feel strongly that it should not be surprising the censorship of material will be restricted by a government that might not actually like what is being communicated. We hope the government that uses the internet to promote government is responsible, not simply complicit in censoring certain types of content. I would hope they would do something about restrictions, but without taking into consideration possible harms from such a censorship."

Speaking this week, the Government's national security adviser, Gavin Williamson, said the UK should respect human rights, but did not need to accept changes to human rights laws.

"In all respects, people have a right to privacy; indeed, the UK has a moral right to respect that," he said. "But we should not change our approach, because that will always cause problems. The government should also respect the right to respect.

"I think the government had the best of intentions in terms of respecting human rights, but that is not enough, and we are not going to let this happen."
