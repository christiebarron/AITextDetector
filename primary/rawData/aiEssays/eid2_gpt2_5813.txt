I believe that censorship of materials in libraries or museums is a violation of constitutional rights," wrote a federal judge in a June ruling. "We strongly disagree. But we nonetheless hold that the Department of Education, with the assistance of the Bureau of Archives and Records, has the authority and the jurisdiction to regulate and restrict the dissemination of news, and that the right to the freedom of expression, of the press, and the protection of an individual's right to privacy under the Fourteenth Amendment is not at present infringed upon."

The case is Olson v. Board of Education, No. 9-2562. (U.S. District Court, D.C., on writ of certiorari, June 15).
