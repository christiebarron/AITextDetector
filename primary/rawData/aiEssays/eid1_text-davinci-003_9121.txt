Dear Editor,

Our digital age has brought about massive changes in our world – changes that include the omnipresence of computers. We can all agree, computers have drastically improved our lives, however, it is important to discuss their potential effects on people.

I have personally witnessed people’s lives transformed both negatively and positively due to computers. On the one hand, the widespread use of computers has meant that everybody has access to a wealth of information, which can be leveraged for any purpose, from work to play. This has allowed us to be productive and innovative in ways we never thought possible before. On the other hand, numerous studies have highlighted the ill-effects associated with technological addiction and overuse of computers; people have become physically inactive and more prone to mental health issues due to extended hours spent in front of a computer screen.

It is thus paramount that we ensure balanced use of computers so that the great benefits they have brought into our lives don’t come at the cost of our physical and mental health. We need to embrace a lifestyle that incorporates healthy usage of computers, one that involves taking regular breaks from screens, getting good quality sleep, and engaging in physical activity. This is important for both adults as well as children, as too much time spent in front of computers can have serious long-term effects. By practicing responsible computer usage in our daily lives, we can all enjoy the great convenience and power of computers while limiting negative results.
