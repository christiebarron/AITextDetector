The setting has a huge influence on the cyclist in Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead.” The cycling environment of narrow roads with no shoulder, blind hills and curves, tight turns, and windy conditions all provide challenges for the cyclist. The narrow, winding roads make it difficult for the cyclist to maintain a consistent speed and require skillful maneuvering. The lack of an adequate shoulder means the cyclist must be careful not to sacrifice their safety in order to keep a steady pace. The unpredictable curves and hills can make progress a challenge. Strong winds make it difficult for the cyclist to maintain balance and momentum. All of these environmental features are obstacles the cyclist must face as they attempt to reach their destination.

The cyclist in the story must strategize and find ways to tackle the various roadblocks. The cyclist knows that they must have patience and practice caution while cycling, as failing to do so will compromise their safety. The cyclist gives themselves extra time to reach their destination, compensating for the rough road conditions. The cyclist must also develop a sense of balance and agility to avoid obstacles and progress with caution. The cyclist’s confidence challenges them to overcome the obstacles of the setting, and their efforts ultimately bring about success. 

Throughout Joe Kurmaski's “Rough Road Ahead”, the cyclist is presented with an array of difficulties. The setting’s various features test the cyclist’s abilities and grit,
