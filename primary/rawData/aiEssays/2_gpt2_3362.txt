I believe that censorship of materials in libraries will result in more and more people getting harassed for their ideas," says Martin K. Schaller, director of the Public Domain Alliance for the Future of Library Security. "The more people get harassed for what they say, the more likely they are to get banned, but for what they say, the more likely they are to suffer censorship, and I think people that have read books on the Internet are being harassed a lot worse than those that don't read books on the Internet."

In recent years, the Internet has helped increase the number of people who find libraries easy to access. Last year alone, libraries received $40.8 billion for libraries. By 2020, it will cost them $1.46 billion, according to the Center on Money in Governance at Carnegie Mellon University.
