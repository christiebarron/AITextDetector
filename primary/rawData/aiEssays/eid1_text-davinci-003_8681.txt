I'll never forget the first time I shared a good laugh with my best friend. We had been friends for years, but it was only on that fateful day that our friendship had truly shone and become unbreakable. 

It was a particularly sunny day and as always, we had planned to go out for a coffee together. As we talked and caught up on everything that had been going on in our lives, my friend told me this hilarious story about how their pet cat had just ran away with a family of mice. I couldn't help myself and burst out into laughter. My friend looked at me with a surprised yet happy expression and before I knew it, we were both doubled up in laughter and tears were streaming down our faces.

I remember that moment so clearly, it was like we had connected on a much deeper level and I could feel such a strong bond between us. Our laughter filled the air and it was like no other. We had laughed together before, but this time it was so much more special. Since then, laughter became an integral part of our friendship. We knew that if ever we were feeling down, we would be able to count on each other for a good and hearty laugh, and that would always make everything feel much better. 

I am so thankful for that moment where our laughter united us in such a joyful and meaningful way. Through laughter, we have been able to overcome the difficulties and strengthen our bond even further.
