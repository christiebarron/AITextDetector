The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it also addresses the concept of "the unknown." We can see this coming from the concept of "the unknown." We can see that you don't know where you are going, or why, or just don't seem all that distant. We come from a place of great distance.


I know you're going to say that Winter Hibiscus is also on the short list of books to read (and I'm talking about books like Mists of Pandaria, which are only available for preorder now) but I'm not a fan of Mists of Pandaria. As a result, I've always had a soft spot for Mists as my favorite book. I actually have a soft spot for this.
