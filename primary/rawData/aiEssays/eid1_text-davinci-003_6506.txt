Dear Editor, 

As technology progresses, computers have become a part of our everyday lives. From gaming to work, they have certainly had an impact on our society in countless ways. While some may argue that computers are entirely beneficial and beneficial, I believe they should be used in moderation.

Undoubtedly, computers have the potential to improve productivity and allow us to learn more and faster. But, as with all great things, there can be negative side effects. Computer addiction is a real issue in our society today. People may find themselves spending too much time on their devices, playing video games or just browsing the internet. This can lead to feelings of isolation, self-doubt and depression among other issues.

Moreover, increased screen time has been linked to difficulty in problem-solving and lack of critical thought. As computers come to rely more on algorithms, people can find themselves questioning their own judgment. Even in work, our reliance on computers can allow us to miss not only important details, but the general bigger picture. 

I believe that computers should be used as an aid, not a main source of knowledge. We should foster our own individual creativity, while still being open to the advantages that computers can bring. Our use of technology should be kept in balance, not overtaking our lives.

I hope that this opinion has opened your eyes to the issues surrounding computer use.

Sincerely,
[Name]
