I remember the way we laughed together like it was only yesterday. I remember how my partner got me with the knock knock jokes, each one funnier than the last. That's why I was so surprised when he took a somber expression one day and asked if we could talk. 

We sat down at the kitchen table and there was a silence. I was nervous, thinking I had done something wrong, but as soon as I looked into the face of my partner, his serious expression melted away. We both laughed at our foolishness and the tension that had been lingering in the air dissipated.

I asked him what was up and the story that followed was that day was so important to him but he hadn’t been able to tell me. So, after a moment of hesitation, he told me that he had recently been diagnosed with cancer.

I was shocked and couldn’t speak. Tears clouded my vision. I looked at him again and he had the most comforting smile. He asked, “Couldn’t you laugh with me for just a moment?”

It was then that I realised I had to do something to break the tension, so I laughed. At first, it was forced, but as I looked into my partner’s face I started to really smile. We laughed through our tears and through that laughter, in that moment, I connected with him more strongly than ever before.
