Dear Editor,

I believe computers have incredibly positive effects on people and society. With each passing year, computers become more affordable, making them available to even more users.

The most significant effects of computers are the ways in which they have reshaped how people communicate and collaborate. Itâ€™s now common to be connected to family, friends, and business associates from all over the world. Working together on projects used to mean hours of planning, travel, and expense; now it can be done effortlessly from anywhere.

Computers have also increased access to information and knowledge. Everything from academic research to video streaming is now available at the touch of a button. The internet has changed the way people research, shop, and socialize.

Computers can also save lives. Modern medical technology and treatments rely heavily on computers. This technology has helped to make treatments more accurate and effective, leading to improved patient outcomes. Computers have also revolutionized the way emergency services operate, helping to improve public safety.

Overall, computers have been a major benefit for society. They have revolutionized how people communicate, learn, shop, and receive medical care. For our society to move forward, it is essential that everyone has access to the benefits of computer technology.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
