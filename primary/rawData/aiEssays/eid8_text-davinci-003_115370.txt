I was scrolling through Instagram a couple days ago, when I spotted my best friend in an old photo. I couldn’t believe it had been almost five years since we last hung out—we’d both been so busy and life had taken us in different directions. I immediately Facetimed her, and when we were finally able to chat, we both erupted in a fit of laughter.

I couldn’t believe how comfortable it felt, like no time had passed at all. We joked and laughed until we’d each forgotten the reason we’d started Facetiming in the first place. We continued reminiscing about old stories and shared inside jokes, each time laughing a little bit harder than before.

Laughter had always been a part of our friendship. It was what drove us together and what kept us connected through life’s ups and downs. No matter what happens next, no matter how much our lives change, I’ll always treasure the moments we shared that day, and the understanding that our laughter is a bond that will never break.
