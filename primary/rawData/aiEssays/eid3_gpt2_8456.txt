Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. For example, there was always a desire for riders to run along narrow roads in rural areas, and some cyclists thought this was "unfortunate" and would leave their road. When I had kids, for example, they always rode on the other side of the narrow road. Many of them said, "I don't know how I'm supposed to feel when I'm walking along that road and I hit another boy who's coming up next. What does that have to do with me?" At first, it didn't seem that such a thing meant I wanted to stop walking and have fun on the highway â€“ that I wanted other cyclists to follow me along that road. Many of these people were upset about it, and many just decided not to look at it, because they knew what was going on. It wasn't that I did these things because I'm a cyclist, it was how I felt about things and thought this was fine.

Rough Road Ahead was designed to be a 'good bike place (for bikes)."

"A lot of our people and cyclists take it for granted that we are 'good places for cyclists'," said Rob Schuster, chief executive of road-based cycling charity Bicycle Concerns, in an interview after the project opened.

"It's great that this project and the cycling world have so much interest in cyclists and the way they use their bicycles
