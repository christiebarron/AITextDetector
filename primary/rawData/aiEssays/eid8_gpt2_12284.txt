One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was 15, at my high school graduation party I was sitting in the back of a table and I started saying "I didn't think you could be that funny or that funny." And if I thought I was funny, I would do the same thing. The world has changed, so I started to worry about things. I was just trying to have fun. So I decided to stop all that thinking about being funny, which I was doing now. So I used to do stuff like that until I got really big and serious and then I would try to be funny and move on to things I wanted to do.
