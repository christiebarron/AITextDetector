I remember a time when I was very young - probably around six or seven years old - and I was visiting my grandma. She had this very old, temperamental TV that didn't seem to want to cooperate. Whenever I turned it on, it would take forever to load and the channels just weren't coming in right.

My grandma, who was in her early eighties at the time, was watching from the rocking chair in her living room. Although I could tell she was frustrated, she never said a word. She didn't yell or throw her hands up in exasperation - she just waited patiently for the TV to catch itself. 

But I was getting more and more frustrated by the second. I asked her why she didn't just get a new TV or call someone to come fix it, but she just said something along the lines of "Good things come to those who wait." 

So, I waited and sure enough, after what seemed like forever, the TV fixed itself. I thought to myself that had it not been for my grandma's patience, I probably would have resorted to giving up and finding something else to do.

Her patience taught me so much that day and it's a lesson I still remember to this day. Patience truly is a virtue and often times it's the only thing standing between us and our goals.
