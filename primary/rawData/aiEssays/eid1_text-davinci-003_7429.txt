The narrator of Minfong Ho's Winter Hibiscus is a young girl named Ling, who is struggling with her math class. The story ends with Ling reflecting on the winter hibiscus outside of her window, which represents her own perseverance and determination to succeed. Through it, she finds hope and motivation to retake the math test after the winter. The passage provides an uplifting metaphor, showing that despite her mistakes, Ling still has the opportunity to try again and succeed. The imagery of spring, snow melting, and geese returning reflects the changing of the seasons, and by extension the potential for new beginnings. The cycle of growth and renewal is a reminder that failure is not permanent and is also an inspiring example for other readers.
