An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my grandfather, Sr. He was married to a physician whom I really love and who never stopped complaining about him ever since his death a few years back.


He was so nice. He spoke so nicely of how his patients are always in control. My son loves his grandfather. He has a dog named "Kitten." So he has good, long-distance relationships with people. And so does every single person in that long distance relationship with him. It was a very unique opportunity for them. I just can't believe he had two people with him, so wonderful.


So he has this amazing respect for these people. He is such a great role model. There are just so many people that I like, so many people that I don't know anybody that he is really close to. He is so caring. So this is something I can't even imagine. He loves the patients. He treats them well. And when he does complain about something he doesn't like, he likes to talk about, and there are always those people that I wish he could have seen the problem with, who I was never aware of.


So it is really very inspiring. I can just tell you that it is not just a man and woman's relationship in their lives that you know about. It is a relationship between our families and our communities. It is a relationship between us as a family, our communities and our cities
