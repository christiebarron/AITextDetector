Computers have many effects on people. The simplest is a change in their brain chemistry, or a change in which certain chemicals affect how people behave and act. Some things get in the way when computers interact with one another and become more powerful, like in computers or social networks. Others, like the way people's eyes are connected to objects, become less efficient, like the way computers interact electronically with computers. Some also are more susceptible to illness, disease or even death, like the way people feel before or during an operation than before or during surgery or surgery. Some of these chemical changes in human brains are caused by exposure to environmental chemicals that can cause brain damage, but for others, chemicals such as caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol may be more harmful.

It can be difficult to know if human cells are affected if they're used in an operation like a tumor for cancer or a mouse for breast cancer, particularly if doctors don't know what chemicals they might affect. But researchers have used techniques such as CT scans to examine cells in rats and mice for tumors, and even to perform imaging on neurons at the site of injury.

A previous study reported that tumors grow in parts of the brain that had failed to respond to anesthesia. The researchers examined brain tissue from more than 100 injured patients in hospitals where the patients had been given non-invasive, no-exposure oxygenation medications. They then used MRI scans to examine the cancer cells. What they noticed was that neurons had
