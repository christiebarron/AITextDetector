The setting of “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski plays a major role in the cyclist’s journey. The environment is full of unpredictable challenges that force the cyclist to remain vigilant and make tough decisions.

The physical geography of the setting sets up some of the most difficult obstacles for the cyclist. The terrain is described as wild and hilly, making it difficult to find a safe and efficient path. The terrain is also constantly changing, forcing the cyclist to quickly scan for other possible routes. There are sections of the route that are steep and with sudden turns that must be taken at speed. In addition, the roads are lined with rubble and trash that could easily cause punctures or even cause the cyclist to crash.

The unpredictable weather of the setting also presents its own challenges. The cyclist is faced with intense rain, hail, and storms. This makes it difficult to continue cycling and can be a major source of frustration. The cyclist must also contend with strong winds, which can slow him down and tire him out even more.

The climate of the setting also affects the cyclist as it gets colder as they travel north. This makes it even more difficult for the cyclist as they encounter colder temperatures, reducing visibility and making their journey even more uncomfortable.

In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist’s journey in numerous ways. From the physical geography of the terrain to the unpredictable weather, the cyclist must remain alert
