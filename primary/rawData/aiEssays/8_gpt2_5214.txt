One time I experienced laughter in my life was when the men and women of a college town called Kansas City invited me to their barber shop in the evening where, wearing black shirts and shorts, they painted their faces so red that they almost looked like the cartoon characters in My Little Pony, when they are wearing scarlet shirts and matching pants. It was a beautiful occasion, for me at least.
