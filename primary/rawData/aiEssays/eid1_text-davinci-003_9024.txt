Dear Editor, 

As the world continues to rapidly evolve with the introduction and proliferation of technology, computer usage has become an ever-more integral part of people’s daily lives. Just the same, many are still questioning the exact effects computers have had on humanity, and more specifically, on individuals. After giving this much thought, I believe that computers have had a overwhelmingly positive impact on people. 

The primary positive effect of our widespread adoption of computers has been an increased ability to access information. With just the click of a few buttons, a nearly infinite amount of knowledge and data is accessible, allowing people to take greater control of their own lives and make confident, informed decisions. From finding jobs to researching educational topics, computers offer people an endless wealth of resources.

Not only has the use of computers enabled people to have access to unimaginable amounts of information, but it has also allowed them to feel more connected to each other than ever before. Through platforms like email, texting, and social media, people can stay in contact with each other from virtually anywhere in the world. Furthermore, they can take part in discussions and debate opinions with great speed and flexibility.

All in all, I feel that computers have been profoundly beneficial to individuals around the world and believe that the use of computers should continue to be embraced. With the advantages that computers offer, it’s undeniable that they will remain an integral part of our society for years to come.
