One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I heard someone say, "Oh dear, I forgot a good joke." I'm so glad I didn't lose me so easily.

But even when you can't remember all your favorite moments, you make them remember you. Like when you hear someone laugh or a song that made you cry, for example, or the way someone talks about your mother for some reason, or how you remember, maybe it makes you cry. The things that drive you into love and the things that keep you stuck in between, you have every reason to do every single one.

But you should never forget them.

Because they will make you stand up.

No matter what your friends say about you. They will make you strong.

No matter why they talk to you about love. No matter how much they hate you because they think you are beautiful or beautiful to them. But that is because these things make you realize you are loved, not what you imagine yourself to be.

Love is the key to happiness. It isn't just love. It is the combination of the two. It's love you cannot have without it.

In fact, it's the opposite. It's love you cannot have without love.

Love is the key to love. It is the only way to bring happiness.

All love starts and ends in love.

Love is an amazing gift from God.
