Dear Editor:

The rapid advances in technology over the last few decades have made it easier for people to access the internet and use computers in everyday life. I believe that the effects of computers on people, both positive and negative, should be taken seriously.

On one hand, computers offer many benefits. From improved communication and access to information, to increased productivity and efficiency, itâ€™s clear that computers can offer us a lot of advantages. However, with increased access to computers, a number of new challenges have arisen that we must also consider.

For example, using computers can become addictive and lead to a sedentary lifestyle. It can also cause us to become less social, as people often prefer to spend more time on their computer than with other people. In addition, computers can lead to a range of health issues, such as obesity, carpal tunnel syndrome, and vision problems.

These issues illustrate why we should be cautious when it comes to our use of computers. We should strive to be mindful of how much time we spend on our computers and make sure to take breaks and get enough exercise. Furthermore, we should make a point to occasionally unplug from our devices and spend time with family and
