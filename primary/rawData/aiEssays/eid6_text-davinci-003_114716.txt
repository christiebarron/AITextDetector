The Empire State Building is one of the world's most iconic structures. Its massive height and ambitious construction made it an ideal location for airship docking. However, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

The technical challenges of developing the proper infrastructure and facilities to enable a ship to dock safely and securely were immense. The first challenge was designing a mast that was tall enough. At the time of the Empire State Building's construction, there was no existing structure that could safely withstanding the stresses of an airship's mooring, but the architects of the building sought to design one themselves. They erected an eighty-foot-tall mast atop the building, strong enough to attach cables and safety lines to an airship's hull. However, the mast needed to be rigid and sturdy, able to withstand the gusts of wind generated by the airships. After several drafts and modifications, the designers finally settled on a pair of A-frame brackets which provided enough stability and strength for the mast.

The next obstacle was the sensitivity of airships' fuel systems. The volatile combination of hydrogen and oxygen could present a major fire hazard if any sparks managed to get inside. In order to prevent this, the architects implemented a stringent safety protocol. They installed a series of steel seals at the base of the mast, sealing off the airship from the building's fuel systems and electrical connections until it had successfully docked. For further
