The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They included a problem with the crane, and, in the 1930s, they built a large "receiver" for these items in order to enable them to dock without having to dig through the concrete. The idea behind these was in conjunction with the fact that certain buildings had built large, concrete bunkers with their own internal, open space.

In the 1940s and 1950s, builders in Chicago and other cities started to see ways around this problem to let their own private businesses rent space for their own work. The big question on the block was whether to allow people to use their own spaces directly in the building. Today, the big-box store/retail/rental services, the rental car companies are a major reason for this.

The next big problem is that people don't rent space to make their own space. They often own something on the streets. This is true for almost everything in the building (except the windows of the rooms). Even in the new skyscrapers, people have to take the chance to use private spaces in other places. This kind of problem is now known, as "double occupancy" buildings. In many instances, in those high-rise developments, people are forced to use private spaces to rent space for other people's use. The other problem is in the public service, where the rent-to-own problem is solved to one extent
