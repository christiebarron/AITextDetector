Minfong Ho ends Winter Hibiscus with this line in order to show that her protagonist is looking for hope and renewal. The process of melting snow and returning geese is a metaphor for the return of hope and possibility. It suggests that no matter how hard the winter is, new life will always emerge, and that despite failure, the opportunity for success will always present itself in the spring. By ending with this line, Ho is conveying the message that no matter how dark things may seem, it's possible to rebuild and start fresh.
