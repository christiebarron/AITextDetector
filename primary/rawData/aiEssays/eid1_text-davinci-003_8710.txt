I remember one of my favorite moments with my best friend. We were walking in the park one summer day when, out of nowhere, she said, "You know what we should do? We should make an ice cream trail!" She had this huge grin on her face, and I couldn't help but laugh. I didn't know what she meant, but I was up for anything. Before I knew it, we were off running around the park buying different flavors of ice cream, setting them on the path and licking as we went. 

By the time we got to the end, there were all sorts of different flavors and colors all over the path. We were laughing so hard we couldn't even stand up. People walking by probably thought we had lost our minds but that didn't stop us. We kept laughing and licking all the way until we reached the end.

It was one of the most memorable times I spent with my friend and it's been years since, but I still smile whenever I remember that silly ice cream trail. Laughter is the magic ingredient in any relationship and that day it certainly felt like it.
