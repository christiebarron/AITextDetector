The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is one of shock, awe and deep regret; a feeling that comes from time to time every day. 'I can't believe I had so important a thought to tell you about when to trust. A lot of this comes from it being a dream and it just being a dream,' she says.

'There were two things in particular that pushed me so hard. One, I just tried not to take myself too seriously anymore. Secondly, I thought about it. Now I think about it even more. Sometimes, I've felt really good feeling all of the time. Maybe it's not that strong. I had a good sense of well-being. I felt pretty good feeling all of the time. It was a very important idea.

'I think about this all the time. You can see it in one episode. I watched a show in Ireland and I really feel completely fine about that. He had a moment later and he said to me, 'I feel like I can make it through, but this isn't happening.'

'But the other day I had this experience again. I was driving down the road in the countryside and I saw a man standing near a barn in the bush. On the pavement, I remember feeling like this strange place. Like I felt like an intruder. I was so scared and frightened by something. It was like'my little girl, what are you doing?'"
