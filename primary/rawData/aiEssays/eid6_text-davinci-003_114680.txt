The Empire State Building was developed in the early twentieth century with a unique vision – to make this iconic building a “landmark of progress”, and include an air service facility that would allow dirigibles to dock. However, the builders faced obstacles that impeded this ambition. 

The first obstacle was the fierce gusting winds that surrounded the area. Dirigibles of the time, such as the Graf Zeppelin, were not built for strong wind conditions, and docking a giant airship was a daunting task. As the writer Marcia Amidon Lüsted puts it, “The wind was a wild master to the captains of the air, and its shooing them had to be taken into consideration.” The flying crews, although enthusiastic, were not confident in being able to come in to land safely if the wind was strong.

The second obstacle was finding a solution that would allow the dirigibles to dock without causing harm to the ships or the crew. The initial idea was a "mooring mast", which would consist of a steel mast with an A-frame net. The airship would dock to the net, allowing the crew to transfer passengers and cargo with a crane. However, the net proved to be dangerous as the ships often crashed against the sides and top of the net, risking major damage to the airships. Marcia Amidon Lüsted states, “When a hard-to-
