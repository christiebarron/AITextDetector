The construction of the Empire State Building in the early 1930s presented a major design challenge for engineers, as it was the worldâ€™s tallest building at the time and the first to feature a mooring mast for dirigibles. While the thought of airships docking at the Empire State Building sounded like an exciting possibility, the task of building the mooring mast proved difficult, as there were numerous obstacles to overcome. 

The first obstacle was technical in nature. Building a structure that could support the size and weight of a dirigible was no small feat and engineers had to create a system capable of withstanding strong winds and changing weather. Airships at the time were massive vessels and the 43-foot long mooring mast had to be equal to the task of supporting one. To ensure the mooring mast was capable of doing its job, engineers had to encase the mast in thick concrete and reinforce it with steel girders.

The next obstacle was the choice of material. Since the Empire State Building was made of steel, the mooring mast had to consist of a material that could better absorb the movement of airships when docking. To meet this requirement, workers encased the mooring mast in a special rubberized material, which not only allowed for great flexibility and absorption, but also protected the steel structure from potential damage. 

The mooring mast was also designed with safety in mind. Taking cues from marine
