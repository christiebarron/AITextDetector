The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because, in its opening sentences, it opens into a narrative that I think was just impossible to comprehend and maybe had to be interpreted as, "But I am really not that scared of things because I'm not afraid of things and I'm not that afraid of everything." It's that combination of the two that makes this book great. It gives you a lot of possibilities and you find out the most important things you don't know about life and what you can do in life without feeling afraid.

I didn't realize that's just a word forLink. It's the end of everything.
