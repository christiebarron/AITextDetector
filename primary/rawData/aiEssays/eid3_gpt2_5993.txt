Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. The "A-Team" section of the road is one of the reasons, for instance, for the road going through it from the West End to the University of Toronto. The East-West junction of the Don Valley Trail in the North York Park section (the "Rougetown" section in the North End) is much higher than the "Rudlow" part estate. The west-northward of the Don Valley is also more dense, and will only look quite the same in a large part of the region. As a result this set of points means that there is a lot of different roads that must be on the same side of the road, which gives the cyclist time to move, avoid and get over bumps.

The 'Rough' section of the road is a good reference for a map and a history of the route. A similar set ofBigGuide references the routes (The Good Roads of the North Shore and the Bad Roads of the East Side of York) as well as the roads (Rough Roadways of the Mid-End and Midtown areas). The Bad Roads have to be taken into account, but a map with clear examples of a given route in each region of Ontario will give a more complete view.
