I recently had a difficult moment in a grocery store when an older woman in front of me took a long time to count out the exact amount of change she needed to pay for her order. I could feel my frustration starting to bubble up, as the line was growing longer and longer behind me. But before I could react, someone else stepped up.

The man behind me tapped me on the shoulder and said, “I've been in your shoes before. I know how hard it is to be patient, so I'll take care of this for you.” He smiled at me, picked up the woman's change and handed it to the cashier.

The woman thanked him profusely, and I was taken aback by his kind offering. I thanked him too, and he just shrugged and said, “That's just how it goes.”

I felt overwhelmed by his kindness, and it reminded me of the importance of being patient when faced with a difficult situation. It was a valuable lesson, and a great reminder to take a deep breath and remember to be kind to others.
