I was with my friend the other night and we had a really great time. We had been out for dinner and were just laughing and talking until late into the night. We had only known each other for a few months but we already had this amazing connection - whenever one of us made a joke or a funny comment, the other would double over in laughter. 

At one point we started to talk about our more embarrassing moments and I don't know why but I just started to laugh uncontrollably. I was laughing so hard I had tears streaking down my face and I couldn't even breathe. All of a sudden my friend started doing this really outrageous impression of me and I nearly fell off of my chair I was laughing so hard. It took us about 10 minutes to finally calm down and get back to our conversation. 

Afterwards, I was just completely in awe of the connection between us, the pure joy that I felt from that moment will probably stick with me forever. We were two strangers who had just connected through laughter and it felt so special. I realized then that laughter really is the shortest distance between two people and I am so grateful to my friend for allowing that moment to happen.
