Dear Editor,

In today's increasingly technology-driven world, computers have become an everyday part of life. From checking emails to streaming movies, the average person today is more likely to interact with a computer or some type of technology than they are with other people. But what effect do these machines have on people?

The effects of computers on modern humans are both good and bad. On the one hand, computers allow us to accomplish tasks more quickly and efficiently. Computer programs are faster and less prone to error than most manual methods, and they can be extremely powerful aids in both personal and professional endeavors.

On the other hand, too much screen time can have negative effects on our physical and mental health. Prolonged exposure to computers can cause dry eyes, neck and back pain, and even mental health issues such as depression and anxiety. There have also been reports of computer addiction, which can interfere with social interaction and the ability to focus.

In conclusion, computers of today should be used in moderation. In order to get the most benefit from these machines, they should be used for productive activities such as researching information and completing work projects. Taking regular breaks to stretch and walk around can also help minimize the physical and mental effects of too much computer use.
