In Joe Kurmaski's poem “Rough Road Ahead,” the setting plays a significant role in creating the atmosphere of the journey. The scenery of the poem is described as being one of “rugged rocks” and “dangerous curves.” This creates an element of danger and anxiety in the poem. It also implies a level of difficulty and challenge in the cyclist’s journey. The cyclist is forced to confront these risks and uncertainties while pushing forward.

The oppressive heat of the sun also contributes to the overall atmosphere of the poem. The sun’s intensity works to further reflect the difficult and stressful nature of the cyclist’s journey. It also adds an air of urgency, as the cyclist is racing against the heat of the sun. The “deserted” state of the road further heightens the feelings of isolation and intensity. There’s an overwhelming sense of loneliness as the cyclist pushes forward.

Overall, the poem’s setting creates a desolate and dangerous landscape. The cyclist must confront the physical and emotional hardships consequent to such a setting. They must tap into their personal strength and resilience to overcome the odds, an effort that’s further reflected in the unique nature of the poem’s setting and atmosphere.
