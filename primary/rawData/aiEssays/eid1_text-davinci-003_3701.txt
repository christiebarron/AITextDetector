To the editor:

Recently, computers have become an integral part of our daily lives. From checking emails and social media to working from home, they are ubiquitous. But is the influence of computers positive or negative? 

I believe that, overall, computers have had an overwhelmingly positive effect on people. They have driven a revolution in how we learn, collaborate, and work. Computers can be used to facilitate research, communication, and entertainment in ways that did not exist before. 

Moreover, advances in computing technology have enabled us to access information quickly, easily, and safely. Furthermore, computers have enabled us to stay connected to friends, family, and colleagues, regardless of their physical location. 

In addition, computer technology has enabled us to automate routine and mundane tasks, freeing us to focus our energies on more meaningful and interesting activities. 

Finally, computers have ushered in an era of digital literacy. Computers have enabled people to stay connected with the latest developments and prepare themselves better for the future. 

In conclusion, the effects of computers on people have been positive. They have enabled us to be more informed, productive, and connected, while more effectively managing our resources. I urge all readers to consider the countless positive impacts computers have had on our lives and encourage everyone to take advantage of the innumerable benefits they offer. 

Sincerely,
