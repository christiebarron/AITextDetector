The speaker is strongly suggesting that despite the obstacles involved in taking a difficult test, they will be prepared and determined to succeed come "the spring" when the snow melts and the geese return. The hauntingly beautiful visual imagery in the closing lines of the poem emphasizes the strength and resilience of the human spirit, and serves as a tribute to those who have courageously faced down seemingly insurmountable difficulties and emerged triumphant.
