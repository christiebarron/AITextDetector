An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was writing about the news that my daughter passed away in December. Some years later (the year before my PhD), I was having a talk on how I had worked hard to keep my daughter alive, through all the struggles of motherhood.

At the end of our talk, her mother went mad and I realized my whole world was a nightmare. And I tried to understand what it was like to live in an environment where things were all the same in her and then see her die a thousand thousand years later or something. That was an excruciating experience. (I tried to figure out what I was gonna call it in case the experience would make even less sense to me.)

My question then came to life. How do we handle all of this? Why should we allow our children to live so they can be happy and healthy and beautiful children like this? I'd like to have all the answers.
