I remember the first time I really connected with my now husband. We had begun to get to know each other and talk about the little things that interested us. As I was talking, he began to laugh. It was a hearty and genuine laughter that rose in his chest and escaped with a roar. I couldn't help but join in and as we laughed, I felt a warmth rising up in the pit of my stomach and felt a connection between us. We had just moved in together and I was nervous. But as we shared stories and got to know each other's humor, I felt more and more at ease. That laughter felt like a special language, a way for us to really understand each other.

Our shared sense of humor has been a mainstay of our relationship ever since. We can always rely on each other to make the other one laugh with just the right joke or comment. Even when life gets tough and we are facing difficult times, we can still lighten the mood with a joke. Laughter has truly been our saving grace. We've gone through a lot together, and our relationship is stronger for it.

Whenever I think of how deep our connection is, I always look back to that first time we laughed together. That laughter marked the start of something special, and has stayed with us for a long time now.
