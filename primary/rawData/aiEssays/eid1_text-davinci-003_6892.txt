Throughout the years, the debate of censorship in libraries has been ongoing and controversial. Censorship can come in the form of restricting access to certain books, magazines, music, and/or movies. While some people are in support of censoring potentially offensive materials, others are opposed. I strongly believe that censoring materials in libraries is wrong, and these materials should not be removed from the shelves. 

One of the main reasons to oppose censorship in libraries is that it limits the freedom of expression. Every reader is entitled to the right to seek out information and knowledge. They have the right to form their own opinion of texts without it being interfered by censorship. For instance, books like Animal Farm and Huckleberry Finn contain controversial themes that can be seen by some as offensive. To remove these books from the shelves would limit our ability to access important works of literature and challenge us to think critically. 

Furthermore, removing potentially offensive materials may do more harm than good. There are topics in our world that can be classified as “taboo”, but it does not mean that they should be completely ignored. For example, reading about difficult topics such as racism and bigotry can be used for educational purposes and to help fight against these forms of hatred. As such, readers should be able to access materials on these topics in order to foster a better understanding.

Ultimately, I believe that the library is a place for people to seek out knowledge, no matter
