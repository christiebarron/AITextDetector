The building of the Empire State Building was an impressive feat. Its architects had to consider many different factors when designing the building, one of which was creating a place for dirigibles, or airships, to dock. However, this task posed immense challenges for the builders, as the technology of dirigibles was still relatively new and untested. In her article “The Mooring Mast,” Marcia Amidon Lüsted examines the obstacles faced by the builders of the iconic building as they attempted to construct a mooring mast.

The first issue they had to contend with was the size and shape of the building. The Empire State Building was massive, and its location in a densely populated area meant that it could not be easily modified. This posed an obvious problem when trying to construct a mast, as the building did not have enough space for anything that was particularly large or complex. Furthermore, the area surrounding the building had strict zoning laws which prohibited the builders from adding any additional structures.

The second difficulty was the technological limitations of dirigibles at the time. As Lüsted explains, the mast would have to be designed to support the large and heavy airships, but many of the existing mooring systems that had been tried in the past were not up to the task. The Empire State Building was the largest building in the world at the time, and any mast that was constructed would have to be able to support its weight along with
