Censorship in libraries is a topic that stirs a great deal of controversy. While some argue that libraries should act as unencumbered spaces, upholding the First Amendment by protecting the freedom of expression, others argue that libraries should only provide material that upholds the values of a community and are appropriate for their patrons. 

It is important to remember that although libraries are bound to abide by the principles of freedom of speech under the law, they are still institutions that serve the public. Libraries should, therefore, have the right to determine what materials are deemed acceptable to be present in the community and free of offensive content. 

The truth is, public libraries bear the responsibility of bringing quality literature and materials to their patrons, making it their duty to champion the First Amendment and include material that allows patrons to investigate and contemplate a variety of topics. At the same time, libraries must be able to remove or restrict banned items to protect patrons, especially children, from offensive material when it is found to exist. 

Ultimately, libraries should not interpret the First Amendment as the only gateway to provide unrestricted access. Instead, libraries ought to protect their patrons by exercising some degree of control when it comes to materials that are judged to have crossed the line of decency. In doing so, libraries will ensure that their patrons are safe from every potential harm of exposure to offensive material that can be found in their shelves.
