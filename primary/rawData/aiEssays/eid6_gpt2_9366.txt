The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

The first was a federal law passed by Congress that required manufacturers to provide a special certification to the FAA regarding what devices do and cannot dock with the building, and even before those devices were released. That law didn't protect workers like the ones found here with the C-45. But it also did require that any devices that have been inspected or certified, in the course of testing or maintenance, show that they actually dock as well.

The second hurdle was Congress' failure to move quickly, at least at minimum. In the summer of 1978, Congress amended Section 12 of Title 9, which allows manufacturers to change their certification policies "regardless of whether a product is required to comply with Salamant's requirements, except to: For a new product, if a manufacturer fails to make necessary modifications to the specifications and documentation of a product in force under the provisions governing the new product; or any parts or parts, tools, or apparatus necessary or necessary to comply with the specifications and documentation of a product in force under the requirements governing the new product."

This new law was followed by an early version of the "Certification Requirements Directive" passed by Congress in 1978, when it is referred to as the "Code of Federal Regulations." This directive required builders to submit "certification requirements," and it authorized that equipment manufacturers be required to demonstrate that they maintain their products in the same airworthiness
