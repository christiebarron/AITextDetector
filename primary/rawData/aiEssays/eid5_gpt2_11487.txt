The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' has changed. The song has come on the radio at an increased volume, but the song hasn't come out yet.

"When it comes to it, I love the thing about it more â€¦ it's very uplifting, it's pretty good, I love the characters who play those characters, and that's the main thing to work on and to do that kind of thing," says Hagen. "It's also a new kind of band, and one like that. It's all part of this record and part of this thing. And it's great to see where we're at."

The final album from 'From Home' has had its release date delayed for the past two weeks, as well.

"This whole 'What I'll Do in Life' thing," writes Hagen, who also is an executive producer for MTV's "American Idol" and has been working on that music since June 2015, "is the album that will be on the record in New York and Los Angeles."
