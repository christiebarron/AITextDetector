Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my thoughts on the effects of computers on people. As technology has made its way into our daily lives, computers have become part of our day-to-day routine. Undeniably, computers have made tremendous contributions to our society, but the debate continues as to whether their influence has been beneficial or detrimental to our personal lives.

It has been said that computer use can reduce physical activity due to extended periods of sitting in front of them. Furthermore, computer usage has also made communication less personal, as people now communicate mainly through screens and phones. In addition, concerns about social media usage, such as cyberbullying, continue to be a source of worry for parents.

However, I believe computers can be beneficial if used responsibly. They can be great tools for education and communication, allowing us to stay informed and connected to the world around us. Through the internet, people have access to a wealth of knowledge and resources to further their understanding and to increase their skills. Utilizing computers effectively might even increase a person’s physical activity; perhaps playing a computer game that encourages physical activity or utilizing a program to track physical exercise.

Ultimately, while computers and their usage cannot be completely ignored, I believe that the positives outweigh the negatives. Through proper use and understanding, computers can be a powerful influence on a person’s life.

Sincerely,

[Your name]
