The issue of censorship in libraries has sparked many debates with librarians, patrons, and politicians all having strong opinions on the matter. In many regards, some feel that this kind of material should not be made available for public view while others see it as an infringement on the freedom of speech and the right to access information. 

As librarians, it is our responsibility to ensure our patrons have access to a variety of materials, while also maintaining a sense of civility and morality. We must ask ourselves: how far should we go when it comes to censorship? 

Personally, I believe materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should fall under the jurisdiction of librariansâ€™ discretion, depending on the appropriateness of the content. We should regularly monitor these materials to ensure they are not deemed offensive, and if so, they should be removed from the shelves.

At the same time, we must also respect the right of the patron to access information. People must be given the opportunity to make an informed decision by having a variety of resources available, yet, they also should be warned that some of these materials may contain offensive language, images, or topics. With this kind of open communication between librarians and patrons, censorship can become a more organized and considerate process.

Censorship is a delicate matter that needs to be addressed by librarians. It is our job to not only provide access to resources
