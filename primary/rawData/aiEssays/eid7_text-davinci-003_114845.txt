I remember one time when I was a young child, my parents decided to take all of us out on a camping trip. I had never been camping before and was really excited to tag along. The car ride was long and I quickly became bored. My parents weren't getting frustrated but I could sense the agitation in the car; instead of reprimanding me though, they remained patient.

Finally, after what seemed like an endless drive, we arrived at our destination and began unpacking and setting up our tent. We weren't really sure what we were doing - I think none of us had ever camped before - but my parents kept their cool.

My brother, sister and I were getting more and more frustrated as the tent didn't look anything like the illustrations in the directions. Instead of getting angry, my parents stayed patient and gentle with us, helping us to eventually get the tent set up.

I never forgot that experience and the patience my parents showed our family during a potentially stressful situation.
