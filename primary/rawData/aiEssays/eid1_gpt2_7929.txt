Computers have many effects on people. Most of the things that we know about brain development and affect development are based on the fact that the neuron cells in the nucleus of the brain are very similar in structure and function housing this complex network.

Now let's look at some of the evidence we have collected on the fact that the hippocampus consists of small clusters of nerve cells. The hippocampus contains a number of small nerve cells that connect to the hippocampus and produce a number of synaptic currents which also communicate with neurons in the surrounding brain.

The neurons are interconnected, the region around the hippocampus can store as much information as it is needed during one day, this means that the information we get during a day is much simpler as it is being processed by some part of the brain (the hippocampus).

An important question we need to look at is who this group of nerve cells came from, a question we don't have to ask all the time when a person's brain develops dementia

When we think about 'The first generation of rats' we look at their brains. Some mice (who are genetically identical) have all the same hippocampus. To compare their brains in person we are going to use a test in which we go on to see if they are really the same neurons that they are. And when we do the same thing with an adult you will see which groups of neurons it is like.

Here we start looking at which regions these cells in the brain are in.
