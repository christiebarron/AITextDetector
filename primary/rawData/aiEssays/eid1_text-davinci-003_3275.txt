Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. As technology has evolved, the use of computers has become an increasingly integral part of our daily lives. While computers have many positive benefits, they can also have detrimental effects on people, especially on our health and safety. 

First, computers can have a negative effect on the health of those who use them. The long hours of sitting, staring at a screen, and using a keyboard can cause physical ailments and discomfort. This can lead to an increased risk of eye strain, carpal tunnel syndrome, and neck and back pain. 

Secondly, computers can impair safety due to distractions from the outside world. While being in an environment of solely digital information can be beneficial for getting tasks done, it can also hinder the userâ€™s awareness of the physical world and its hazards. People often become so engrossed in the digital world that they may not pay attention to their environment, putting themselves in dangerous situations. 

I believe that when used in moderation, computers can be a beneficial tool for doing work and managing tasks. However, it is essential that we are aware of the risks that come with its use.
