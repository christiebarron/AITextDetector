I remember the first time I truly laughed with my wife. We had been married for a few months, but somehow, that moment stuck with me more than any other.

We had been out shopping together, picking up some odds and ends for the house. But nothing seemed to catch our eye. Going from aisle to aisle, the shopping slowly became more and more of a chore. So with nothing else to do, we started joking with each other, mostly about things that weren’t quite funny. But as our banter grew more and more absurd, something unexpected happened, and we started laughing—truly laughing—for the first time together.

It felt like a breath of fresh air. We couldn’t stop our sides from aching, and it felt like the tension in the air had suddenly been swept away. We relaxed into each other, leaning into the laughter and feeling an even deeper connection to one another. That laughter was a reminder that no matter what life throws our way, we’ll always have each other in our corner, and that’s worth more than any shopping spree.
