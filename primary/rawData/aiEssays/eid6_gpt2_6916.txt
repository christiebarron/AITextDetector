The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Although they could launch rockets directly over a building, they had no means for their use on a building's rooftop. A few builders of the original Empire State had a better and better solution: In the early nineteenth century in Washington, D.C., two U.S. Government skyscrapers were designed by the same firm. However, in the 1960s and 1970s, three high-rise U.S. Government buildings in New York City were planned: Complete Street, New York State Building, and United States Government Building 6. Both buildings had built with rockets. In this building, a rocket was deployed with an upper tower on the roof and its launch handle was moved horizontally on the tower to raise the lower tower from behind, to which the lower tower mounted a small prop that had been attached to an open end of the rocket for maneuvering around. To achieve this maneuver, the upper tower was placed on the lower tower and pushed up over the top of the lower tower's launch handle. During the maneuvering, the upper tower's lift duct was pulled under the handle to deflect the launch, and the lower tower was released, allowing the prop to come down as far as one third of a mile below the level of the upper tower. The rocket also brought down the lower tower's roof, allowing other buildings to be used as launch pads during the day, and to send other buildings on the
