I was recently on a long flight across the Atlantic and the person sitting next to me didn't stop talking nearly the entire eight hours. Instead of getting angry, I was patient and polite throughout the flight. I listened to her talk about her family and all the cities she was visiting on her vacation. 

She began to talk to me about a problem she was having at work and I tried to offer her advice on the best ways to handle it. She seemed really grateful for my input. 

At the end of the flight, she thanked me for being a pleasant listening ear and being so patient with her. I thanked her for the enjoyable conversation. I was proud of myself for maintaining my patience during the long flight, and not responding to the situation with frustration or anger.
