The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because they are always looking for a new character for a new character to be in this book. The story goes on and on and we do get to see in a story where everyone has to deal with a different character in a similar time period. So these books have those characters that, I think, give you an idea of who they are and who they are not."

We've already seen Winter Hibiscus, however, being presented on a side project. According to Hurd, it's an adaptation he's been working on for a while, which is the sort of thing you can do in an environment where things fall into place. I think it's really cool that someone who was a character before the series took shape will return for another book.
