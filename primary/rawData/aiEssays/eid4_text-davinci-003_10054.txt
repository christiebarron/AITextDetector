The question functions as a metaphor in which Minfong Ho implies that as the hibiscus returns and blooms in the spring, so too will she soon take the same test again. It stands to reason that the test she is referencing is a metaphor for a more intangible problem that Ho is experiencing - possibly low self-confidence, anxiety, or frustration over the lack of control she has in the current situation she is faced with. The hibiscus in the story is a symbol of resilience, since it endures the brutal winter and then returns in the spring. Ho is hoping to find comfort by drawing on the resilience of the hibiscus and is conveying the idea that if it can make it through that tough winter she can make it through this tough time as well.
