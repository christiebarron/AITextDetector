I remember the first time I ever laughed with my best friend. We had just started high school and I was dreading the unknown; I had never had a best friend before, and was scared of opening up to someone. 

One day in class, I made a joke, just to break the silence. It wasn't anything outrageous, just a silly pun about the teacher's last name.

My best friend, who'd been sitting next to me the whole time, snorted and started to giggle. Soon, everyone in the room, including the teacher, was chuckling along.

It feels like a turning point - but one I wasn't fully aware of until much later. 

That moment of laughter, shared between us, opened up a whole new world. That was the moment I knew I could trust her, and she could trust me, no matter how tough things got in school or at home.

We've laughed together ever since, through good times and bad. We still laugh at silly jokes, old ones and new ones, and laugh at all the moments that make life so funny. 

And it all started with that one small joke in class - the one that made us both laugh for the very first time.
