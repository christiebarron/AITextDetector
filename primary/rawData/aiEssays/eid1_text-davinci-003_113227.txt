Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effect computers have had on people. As technology continues to advance, more and more people of all ages rely on computers for a variety of tasks.

On one hand, computers can be a wonderful tool, enabling us to better manage our lives. They offer us unprecedented access to information and communication, allowing us to quickly accomplish tasks that previously took days if not weeks. They are also versatile: from recreational activities to school and business projects, computers allow us to tackle almost any challenge. 

On the other hand, however, I believe that computers can be problematic for some people. Social media, for example, can create feelings of isolation and depression. Crime and gambling have also become more pervasive, as many sites lack sufficient oversight and security. Furthermore, prolonged computer usage can lead to physical discomfort from poor posture and an increased risk of repetitive strain injury.

Overall, I believe that computers can have a positive impact on people, but it is important to use them responsibly and keep our technology use in check. I urge your readers to think twice before diving into the computer world and to be mindful of the potential long-term effects of digital media on our physical and mental health.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
