Researchers have observed that children with an initial traumatic brain injury (STBI) experienced decreased motivation to learn, learning skills and more activity in their brains.

Children with a STBI are at a significantly higher risk for developing ADHD, as they are more likely to develop low levels of activity in the areas found to be important for the development of social, motor and problem solving abilities. However, researchers did not see the benefit of focusing their attention on one area after another. They found that children with an initial STBI did not have difficulty learning skills and the activity at a higher level in the areas they were most concerned about, suggesting that parents are more concerned about emotional and learning skills than attention-related physical and social development.

Studies have also found that children and adolescents with an initial STBI may make more errors than children with other types of injuries. In one study of 3,650 children with mild trauma, there were three causes of brain damage, as assessed by the brain scans (Ammoloid, cerebral hemorrhage, hemorrhoids) and the cognitive tests (Cognitive impairment,
