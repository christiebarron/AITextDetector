The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. These include the fact that no one had built, built, or operated an air conditioning company before, and the building lacked its own elevator system, allowing the engineers to build anything without help from the builders.

The building's "trickle down" structure, which was designed in 1936 under the auspices of Mayor John F. Harding's Department of Buildings, had a "totemic" ceiling. So a large elevator could drop to the ground at a fraction of its usual capacity. One of the engineers working on that first elevator proposed that it should be built on the second floor to stop the elevator from turning in the first place.

The Building's owner argued that this was an inefficient way for the building to operate without its own elevators. A number of engineers disagreed and found it impractical to offer the company the opportunity to build new elevators using a standard, high-voltage power transmission system. They also questioned whether they were able to avoid the loss of any scrap steel from the build.

In 1947, George Bush awarded the building a contract to install a new vertical elevator in its first stage. That elevator went on to lift a thousand people to the second and third floors of the Empire State Building. The elevators were installed during World War II and provided security for the building. Their replacement cost was $150 million. Since 2003, no major American building has ever been
