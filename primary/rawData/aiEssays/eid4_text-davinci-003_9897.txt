The ending question is a way for Ho to emphasize the importance of resilience and determination. While the protagonist may have failed a test once and be struggling with self-confidence, she understands that with enough perseverance she can come back stronger in the spring. The imagery of nature in the ending question — of snow melting and geese returning — serves to further emphasize the idea of renewal and growth. The protagonist is finally hopeful that in the coming spring she will be able to take the test again and have a much better outcome.
