An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I moved here in 1985 when I started off life coaching. I coached clients that would later come to me with questions such as "Who do you love more? Women and children? How about more? People?" (I believe this has to do with my understanding of the concept of patient and professional well-being, as well as my involvement as a part owner of a football club).

I am an experienced coach and one of the many of my clients will want to learn more about the way I perform and understand the needs and abilities of my clients.

To continue with my teaching philosophy in my spare time, I am looking to create a portfolio of podcasts, websites, podcasts, video and other media sources that could use a few extra minutes, especially with the ability to teach and create, as well as to add to your knowledge in another matter.
