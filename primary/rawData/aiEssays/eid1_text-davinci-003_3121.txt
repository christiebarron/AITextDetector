Dear Editor,

As a citizen of this community, I am writing to share my opinion on the effects computers have on people. It is clear that computers play a large role in our day-to-day lives, and it’s important to take a closer look at how this technology affects us.

It’s true that computers can be helpful tools for communication, organization, and productivity. But when used in excess, they can also have a negative impact on our lives. People can easily become overly-dependent on technology and can feel lost without it. The nonstop stimulation of technology can be extremely distracting and can make it difficult to focus on tasks or projects. Furthermore, excessive screen-time can cause physical symptoms such as headaches, eyestrain, and neck pain. Finally, online interactions can lead to decreased creativity and critical thinking skills, and can lead to an increase in depression or other mood disorders.

As members of this community, I urge us all to be mindful of our computer usage. We should make a conscious effort to unplug and take time to really connect with each other. Taking regular breaks from technology can help us stay healthy and productive, while giving us time to consider the impacts
