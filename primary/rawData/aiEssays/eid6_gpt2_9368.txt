The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

"I can't sit there and look at a list of ways to make them safe," said Bill Wagoner, a former city engineer and architect. "It says you are an impossibly easy building."

The city and the design industry both worked to protect the building's structure. Before the project was completed, the building was a major military facility — a major source of income for the city.

"It will be a big hit for the development community," Wagoner said. "We look forward to hearing from the public and planning professionals."

The building was built on the site of Imperial Palace. At Empire State, in its first three floors, the building was built in 1923 but never was used.

The building received substantial construction work, and is just blocks from the headquarters of the Ohio State Medical Research Institute. But there was a snag.

Under federal regulations, government contractors must provide a roof that meets the requirements of the National Electrical Code.

Some say the building is not fit.

"They can't make such a thing," said David Gildea, who manages the building's parking lot. "I know one of my brothers who lives in the building — he'd never seen a dirigible in his whole life" before.

Gildea, 38, retired in 2006 from the city, but still supports
