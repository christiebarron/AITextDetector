Dear Editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Personally, I believe that computers have had a very positive effect on people’s lives.

The first reason I believe this is that computers have enabled us to access and collect more information than ever before. With a few clicks of a mouse, we can search for answers to our questions and connect with hundreds of people from around the globe. Additionally, computers have made life easier by allowing us to easily communicate with others, as well as save and store information all in one place.

Second, computers have also allowed us to stay connected with friends and family who live far away. It’s now much simpler to keep in touch and share our lives with each other through social media, video chat, and other online tools.

Finally, computers have also opened up many new opportunities for us. It is now possible to work remotely and even find new jobs through the internet. This has given us the freedom to pursue our dreams and create more fulfilling lives for ourselves.

In conclusion, I believe that computers have had a largely beneficial effect on people’s lives. We are now more connected, informed, and empowered than ever before. Therefore, I urge everyone to embrace this new technology and see how it can make our lives better. 

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
