My husband and I had been married for five years, but the one thing we never seemed to do enough of was laugh. We laughed on special occasions, of course, but laughed together, just the two of us? That was a rare thing.

One night, though, it changed. We had dinner together, and mid-way through we had the most random conversation. We were so busy laughing with each other and smiling that we hadn't noticed the food getting cold. 

When I looked down at our plates, I couldn't help but burst into laughter again. At that point, my husband picked up his fork and started trying to spear the cold steak with it in an exaggerated manner. This made us both laugh even more.

The next morning when I woke up, I could feel the warmth from that night still radiating in our relationship, and I knew how important it was for us to fill our lives with more moments like that. It was laughter that changed everything for us, and it continues to do so to this day.
