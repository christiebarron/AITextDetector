One of my most favorite memories with my brother took place just last year. We had been at a Yankees game, cheering along with the thousands of other baseball fans. Everything was going normally until the first base coach made a signal that caused the entire crowd to erupt in laughter. It was a funny moment that my brother and I both picked up on.

The game was going on for a while, and with each signal the coach made, my brother and I looked at each other, laughing at the same time. We had a shared connection that the rest of the crowd didn't have - it was just the two of us, in on the same joke. 

When the game was over, we walked out of the stadium arm in arm, still laughing over our shared moment. We hadn't connected with each other like that in a long time and it felt great just to spend some time together enjoying a good laugh. 

It was a moment I'll always remember and cherish, and one that always brings a smile to my face. That moment of shared laughter had been the shortest distance between my brother and me.
