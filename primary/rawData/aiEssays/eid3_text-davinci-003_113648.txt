The story starts with the cyclist, a novice who's never ridden on a gravel road before, riding through the mountainside. The setting is described as an "uninhabited forestland," and "the trees hung heavy with songbirds and twisted branches." Thus, the cyclist is immediately placed in a remote area, which creates a sense of tension and suspense. Additionally, the setting has a powerful impact on the cyclist's emotional state; the seclusion of the setting brings a sense of solace and relaxation for the cyclist.

Moreover, the setting also provides obstacles for the cyclist.

The cyclist is pulled along by a mixture of fear and excitement, and ultimately succeeds in completing the treacherous journey. Thus, the features of the setting in "Rough Road Ahead" are integral
