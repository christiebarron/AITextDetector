One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was 6 years old, when I was wearing an oversized cowboy hat, and a cowboy hat and I was walking with my dad off the bus and he said "that's so cute." He said that my brother wanted to kill himself in my bedroom so I could make a note of my birthday and I said "yeah, sure." He said that his father would buy him a cowboy hat and a cowboy hat. And I said, "Yeah, yeah. You know. That's fine, right? Because you're going to die in a way no one would want to do. That's the definition of a big one."
