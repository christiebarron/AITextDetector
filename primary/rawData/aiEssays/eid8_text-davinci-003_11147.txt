I was on a train heading to an exam. I was anxious and tired, just not feeling up for the test I was about to take. All of a sudden, a family hops onto the train, two kids, a mother and a father. Both kids were cautiously observing me and started to whisper. The father soon noticed and asked them what they were talking about. 

"We noticed that he looks so tired and anxious, so we thought he could use a laugh" said the younger kid with a smile.

That made my heart melt. Suddenly, the family burst into laughter and had a good time. I couldn't help but start to laugh with them. My tense body slowly relaxed, my anxiousness started to float away, and I felt more alive. Then, as the family got off the train, the dad stopped and said "Good luck for the test, kid." 

I took a deep breath of the fresh air, thanked them, and headed out of the train station. That short interaction had helped me gain some confidence and I felt better prepared for the test. That was my first encounter with unexpected laughter, and it made me realize just how powerful it is in making us feel better.
