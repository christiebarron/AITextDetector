When my husband and I first met, we were both a bit awkward and shy. It was our first proper date and neither of us knew what to expect. We were both a little nervous so when the waiter came to take our order, I guess we both had an attack of the giggles. We burst out laughing and couldn’t stop. We were both embarrassed and the poor waiter didn’t know what to do. After a few moments, we managed to calm down and regain our composure and place our order, but the laughter had broken the ice between us. From that moment on, we felt more at ease and the conversation flowed more easily. 

From then on, laughter became a part of our relationship. We shared lots of jokes and often ended up laughing about even the littlest things. It only got better with time and now, we cherish those moments when we laugh together and can even share a joke with a stranger in a matter of moments. Laughter definitely brings us closer and more connected every day.
