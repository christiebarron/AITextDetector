In Joe Kurmaski's story "Rough Road Ahead," the setting has a great impact on the cyclist. The most influential feature of the setting is the roads. The road is described as “a desert of bumpy asphalt…Miles of pothole-covered two-lane highway…a never-ending road to nowhere.” This rough terrain causes the cyclist to be constantly jostled around, and can be quite uncomfortable. In addition, the heat of the desert makes the air thick and oppressive, adding to the cyclist's exhaustion. 

The desolate landscape of the desert also adds to the cyclist's discomfort. He notes that “there was nothing around as far as the eye could see—no buildings, no people, nothing.” This lack of life and civilization further emphasizes the cyclist's sense of isolation and insignificance. The vast emptiness of the desert makes the cyclist feel like he is alone and just a small part of the world. 

The landscape also periodically throws challenges at the cyclist. He faces a washout, steep grade slopes, and monsoon rains. Each of these obstacles tests his abilities and makes him vulnerable to the elements of nature. The contrast between man and nature is brought out in the story, as the cyclist is dwarfed by the power of the landscape around him. 

The setting in Joe Kurmaski's story "Rough Road Ahead" has a powerful effect on the cyclist.
