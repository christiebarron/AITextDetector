The Empire State Building was revolutionary when it was erected in 1931, as it was the first skyscraper to ever be fitted with a docking station for dirigibles. Despite the fact that this unique feature of the building could have revolutionized air transport, the builders faced numerous obstacles to making it a reality.

One of the most significant obstacles to building the mast was the logistics and engineering of the structure itself. Constructing the mooring mast had to be done carefully in order to ensure that it could withstand the wind and impact generated by the dirigibles coming in for a dock. This was an incredibly difficult task, especially considering that the Empire State Building was located in the center of Manhattan, meaning any mooring mast would be subject to some of the strongest winds the city had to offer. It was eventually decided that the mast had to be completely self-supporting and was built using structural steel.

Another obstacle the builders had to contend with was the fact that the airships of the era were very unstable and the mooring mast had to be able to absorb the impact of the sudden, erratic movements of the dirigibles. To overcome this, the mast was designed as a platform with a downward slope, which could accommodate the bouncing and bouncing of the dirigibles. This was a key factor in allowing the mooring mast to function properly, as it allowed for smoother aeronautic movements which ultimately resulted in the dirigibles docking in
