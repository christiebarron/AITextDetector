An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my ex-husband who was in the Army, and then we came home from work and he was about to do my divorce. This worked out okay, he wanted to move, at least he told my ex-husband that he would be leaving if I decided to move. In addition to that, he wanted to divorce me at some point, and I never wanted to have to go through the divorce that we were under. So that was an absolute victory for me.

My life changed when I met my first biological father who was in a mental institution for mental illness and was actually struggling with his PTSD. We had this conversation going back to the day and my husband had told me, for the first time, that he was thinking about going through a mental health evaluation for PTSD. He had also asked me, since I was a very loving person, if I would be able to return to him and his family. I was so glad to find out this because, at the exact moment I asked him, he said, "We can't live without you if you don't love each other. So I'm going to do what I can for you." Since we were both very well prepared and kind people who I am and so dedicated to raising my children, just a few months into his emotional collapse and stress, I'm really very grateful for that and what it has meant for my life. I'm not going to lie,
