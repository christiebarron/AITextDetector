Dear Editor,

I am writing to address the immense impact that computers have had on people's lives. While it is undeniable that computers have been instrumental in making many aspects of our lives easier, it is also important to recognize that they have had a profound effect on how we think and behave.

I believe that the ever-increasing reliance on computers has led to a decreased ability to think independently. The ease of automation and access to vast amounts of information means that people are prone to relying on computers to make decisions without using their own judgement.

Furthermore, computers can also have a negative effect on our development and psychological well-being. The hours that people spend looking at screens can be detrimental to focus, sleep, and physical health. Social media platforms can lead to feelings of insecurity, disconnection, and comparison with others.

I urge your readers to take caution and be mindful of the time and energy they spend using computers. While their utility is undeniable, one must recognize the potential negative impacts and take steps to minimize them.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
