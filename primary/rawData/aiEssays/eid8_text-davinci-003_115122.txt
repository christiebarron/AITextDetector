 

I remember when I was spending time with my partner Jesse. We were not in the best place in our relationship and it felt like we were always on edge. I had had a really bad day at work and I was feeling frustrated and worn out. When I saw Jesse that day, I was expecting the same old polite conversation, but instead Jesse surprised me with an unexpected joke. We both started laughing and it felt like a dam had broken in our relationship. We realized that we had been taking our selves too seriously and our laughter started to become something we shared more often. We started trading jokes and stories about our day, and our laughter quickly became a way of communicating and connecting with one another. Even on my worst days, Jesse could always make me laugh and I was so grateful for it. With laughter, we built a stronger, closer bond that has stayed with us ever since.
