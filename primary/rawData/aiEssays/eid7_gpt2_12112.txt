An example of a time someone in my life was patient was this day in 1992. I was 14 and I was in a hotel room and something happened. Suddenly, my sister and I opened the door and suddenly I had a seizure and a headache. I woke up in the hospital with a headache and had a seizure while lying on the couch. The doctor noticed I was bleeding, was coughing, and had a headache again. I told him my mother, who had seen me, had taken her medicine and he called me back. She said, "She was just taking what had just happened. I'm scared of her but she is here." The doctor then put the seizure back on, asked if he could send me for what had just happened. I told her, "Do you think I understand?" She said, "Yes, I understand!" She was very relieved we were here, this place is so different now.

The following week I went back to my family. I had lost my sister and our little girl. I was a professional psychologist. I started my own hospital, took care of her for three years and it was wonderful. Now the family is no longer with us. Today, they live with their daughter and I was able to leave school. My job is all well and good but no money. My wife has had two children and my son is in nursing school so it is frustrating and scary every day. We do not do anything to make sure we do not lose
