Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. Some of the more useful options include:


High-speed mode (with or without a stopbar) can help the cyclist get to those places that are easier for him/her to travel. It also provides some comfort in some areas (especially between areas where the bike was designed with a stopbar).

Most of these modes (though not all) can save your time on short circuits where you can stop on curves and even corners like these:

Street-oriented mode (on high speed roads) is good for short climbs, as it can take a bit longer to recover from punctures or other accidents.

Road-oriented mode (on small roads) increases safe cruising speeds, particularly when the road is narrow, but when you have the extra safety factor, a higher speed is generally a good idea. I'll leave you with this option...

High Performance (High Performance) and Road-Sport oriented (High Sport) are better choices for those who want to improve their riding technique or speed.


What can we learn from the above?

The main advantage of using a bicycle at these speeds is that it gets up quicker and more consistently so it will help for beginners and those wanting more than just a long ride.

It brings out more of your footwork and makes yourself more stable.

It also helps to feel safe in general.
