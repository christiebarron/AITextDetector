The author uses this ending as a way to draw a connection between the hibiscus and the main character's journey of growth, implying that with the melting of the snow and the return of the geese, the character will have put in the work to grow and conquer the fear of the test. The author is suggesting that the character will be ready to take the test in the spring, when the hibiscus blooms, reflecting the character's growth. This ending is a metaphor for the hard work the character has gone through from the onset of winter and the cold, to the return of spring and the blooming of the hibiscus, where the character is now better prepared to take the test.
