The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First was a legal matter involving the government of the country where the building was located. The government of India refused permission to produce all types of vehicles, including dirigibles, which were banned in the first place. The Government finally granted a waiver in 1997 and, on 13 January 1998, the first of the 10 dirigibles to be built on the Empire State Building, entered service.


The second obstacle was that dirigibles could only be transported in "limited and enclosed rooms" during time of power outages, or emergency. During such times in the Empire State Building, only some of the power outages were kept up, but other parts of the building remained in service due to power outages. READ MORE


In January 1999, five dirigibles and three utility vehicles arrived on the building grounds. The first three were equipped with generators and had a small number of valves located in between the doors. One of the generators used for its heating worked on the building. Later, when power failed due to outages, the only way to get the second one to come online was through one of these closed closed spaces, which is why the third is only accessible through a one-way entrance.
