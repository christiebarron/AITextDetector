The author ends the story this way in order to emphasize the resilience of the narrator. In the end, the narrator has endured a difficult time in her life and although she had nothing to look forward to at the end of the winter, she still resolves to take the test again when spring comes around, and the geese and flowers come back to bloom. This serves as a symbol of the narrator's determination and her unwavering optimism despite any circumstance or hardship.
