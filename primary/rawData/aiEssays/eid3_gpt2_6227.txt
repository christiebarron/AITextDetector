Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. However, in general, the road, while not the most challenging or challenging or risky, has no obvious advantage over the typical bike lane and there are several benefits beyond any benefit mentioned above;

(1) The cyclist can enjoy more of the city traffic and better access to cycling and pedestrians.

(2) The cyclist's risk profile is low and can remain secure due to the high amount and quality of traffic conditions.

Therefore, all things being equal, a bike lane is a safe choice in the 'Rough Road Schumer' with no significant downsides. However, it is still a choice that could be problematic for some cyclists. It might not only involve a riskier cycle lane.

If all cyclists go their own way, they may wind up driving a lot more expensive cars. The higher the number of years of a road on the road being the more expensive.

With that said, it looks like it might be better if bicyclists choose a bike lane that reduces the costs Stella did.
