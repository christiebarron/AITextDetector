It was one of those days. Nothing seemed to be going my way and I'd been feeling down all day. So, I guess it was fate that led me to bump into my old friend from grade school that day. 

I hadn't seen her in so long, and the first thing she said to me was the most ridiculous joke. We both started cracking up. I had almost forgotten how good it felt to just laugh with someone - it was like all my sadness dissipated into thin air.

We decided to grab a drink together and just spend the night catching up, and much of our conversation was filled with laughter. We laughed so hard our faces hurt, tears were streaming from our eyes and everyone around us was looking at us like we were crazy. 

For the first time in weeks, I felt truly happy. We spent the whole night laughing and talking about memories from our childhood. Even though things were rough in my life, that night was so precious to me. 

I was so glad to have reconnected with my old friend, and to share and cherish that moment together. Laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people!
