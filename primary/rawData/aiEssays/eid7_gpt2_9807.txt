An example of a time someone in my life was patient was with their parents and my uncle being in a relationship in a church church. A young couple would be going with another couple or being married in a group of people and it was on the surface that it was going to be so good but we knew it wasn't going to come out in the real world and to the rest of the world. We just didn't know what to think about it and didn't want to feel like this was happening to us."

For her part, Besser says she wants people to take responsibility for their own lives. "This is an issue that I do think about with a lot of people. You have to remember that many of these people are in the same family. It is not one of those people just moving in that we move into a different world because we are part of the family. For me, my experience is that it might not be right for anyone to live a completely different life," she says.
