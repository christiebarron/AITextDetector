The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. When they began to lose confidence in Dirigibles, the American military had abandoned them for a short while. Finally, Congress approved the Eisenhower administration's plan to replace them with a new one.

The Eisenhower Administration, meanwhile, offered Dirigibles an opportunity to meet in an event they'd have to wait years to get approval. The two planes would first meet at Hanford Air Force Base to negotiate a new deal. When the U.S. Government rejected this deal, Eisenhower ordered Eisenhower to use the Narragansetts' Dirigibles as a warning system to warn the United States of a threat.

By this time, Dirigibles had been in production for nearly 40 years. The planes were ordered to test out new technology including lasers and other new technologies. After about 25 years of piloting Dirigibles, Eisenhower ordered a new batch to be installed in a hangar at the American Military Academy in Florida on May 10, 1959.

The plane's final test flight from the cockpit was flown on Feb. 8, 1958. When the pilots tried to move the aircraft to their destination, Eisenhower began to pull the trigger.

The pilots were able to stay on their seat and get up to speed while the aircraft slowly flew off the sky. However, when they reached the Florida airport, they noticed the flight manual was changed just a few feet behind them.
