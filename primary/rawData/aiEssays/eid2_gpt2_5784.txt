I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is against the law and an attempt to punish libraries for violating the First Amendment's Free Press Clause. As a former American attorney, I have worked to defend fair and balanced educational systems, public debate, fair elections, free expression, and fair research. As I've said repeatedly during my experience in the legal and academic industry, we need to look to free speech for the best means of making sure that academic institutions treat people with respect and respect for each other with the utmost respect. In our democracy, there is no difference between protecting the privacy of a student with a disability and providing those other kids with a right to know what information you have on display.

A University of Maine student recently took to Facebook to explain her experience with a library policy that could be used to censor her student's speech. This is the third attempt at censorship on Facebook in the past two weeks. I have seen similar censorship attempts on numerous other sites including a student's Facebook page and I hope this one demonstrates that we need to not only defend freedom of speech in institutions of higher learning, but also not just protect the interests of university groups like the University of Maine. We can only provide a starting point where our citizens have an equal opportunity to make ideas that are critical to our public education and educational process.
