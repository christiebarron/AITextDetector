The building of the Empire State Building presented a unique challenge in accommodating for docking dirigibles, or large airships. To meet this challenge, construction of a 285-foot top mast, called the Mooring Mast, was necessary. 

Constructing the mast presented a multitude of obstacles. One of the major challenges was having a structure that was both aerodynamic and rigid enough to avoid failure. The design had to minimize both wind resistance created by the presence of the mast, as well as the resulting vibrations from the airships connected to it. Engineers of the project had to work around the mechanical limitations of the buildingâ€™s design. Specifically, the mast had to be securely bolted to the two-story enclosed base, and surrounding galleries, at the very top floor of the building. The mast was constructed from steel, forming a latticed structure that created a flexible but strong support capable of bearing the weight of a docked airship. 

The other key obstacle was ensuring the safety of the dirigibles docking at the mast. Too much stress from wind and turbulence could tear the skin of the airships, thus endangering passengers and crew. Wind conditions and air turbulence were carefully analyzed to come up with reliable monitoring and safety systems for potential emergencies. Additionally, the mast had to be tall enough to avoid being an obstruction to the airships docked at the Empire State Building. 

The construction of the Mooring Mast was a feat of engineering that
