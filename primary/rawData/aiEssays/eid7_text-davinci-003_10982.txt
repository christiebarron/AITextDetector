I recently had to wait for a long time in a doctorâ€™s office. Everyone else seemed to be getting seen and I was starting to worry. I could feel my stress levels rising but I kept reminding myself to be patient. I took a few deep breaths and reminded myself that I would get seen soon enough. After what felt like hours, the nurse called my name and brought me in to finally see the doctor. I was so relieved but I was proud of myself for being so patient throughout the whole ordeal.
