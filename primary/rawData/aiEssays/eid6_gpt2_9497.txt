The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

In the early 1920s, a proposed dirigible-based vehicle — an electric version of an automatic speedster used at the time — was sent to the American Civil War National Archives. It was described in terms such as "a car with a rear-wheel drive." That idea, however, sparked an outcry from critics who called it a spy car — not a dirigible or an electric car, per se. They pointed to an aerial view as the point at which the project could be shut down and moved to California, where the car would be scrapped and then leased with an airport.

A number of critics were also concerned about the lack of planning for the city's new building, which was expected to be completed in 1930. After more than 100 months of negotiations, the City Council agreed to a deal that required the construction to be done between July and October 1934, just two years after the Second World War ended. It would only take two years, in 1933, to complete both dirigibles. Yet, by that time, only 25 of the city's 36,000 workers had been certified to use the airplane's technology in all three projects. And, given that the Empire State Building, which was in many ways the precursor of a future airport site, had been developed over the life of state building regulations, the city's first test pilots were often on the move.
