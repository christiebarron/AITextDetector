I believe that censorship of materials in libraries must be banned. If someone uses something that they do not believe is free, how can they use it in the first place?

I believe that censorship of materials in libraries must be banned. If someone uses something that they do not believe is free, how can they use it in the first place? It is my belief that if there is one thing I am sick of doing I need to remove it, because everyone who uses it may not be in a position to benefit or be aware of it. As long as the whole of society does care about free expression, it is ok to have those people. It also helps me to realize that I am not a victim. As long as I am not one, they may not be aware. For me it has become obvious, and it is difficult for me to keep up but as long as I do not create any new material, there is a place for me, even if others keep their eyes on it. If you allow me so to say, I do not have any special rights. The problem I have is that the people who make this stuff are really stupid people trying to be in control of things, and most of us have to accept that.

In any cases, let us keep it as this:

In ANY CASE let us not restrict freedoms of speech, the right to be free from all attacks, and the power of thought which is given to us by a god.
