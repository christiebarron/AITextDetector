The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' was a grim reading for the character, not least because it depicts the personal struggles of young women in the city. "I wanted to convey something about why I never quite felt quite like you and how I felt about my own situation," she writes. "I knew you were going through things, so just writing the story as it played out, and trying to find something better to say about myself, also, seemed a lot like being around you and my situation."

That's especially true given that during her three years living in Toronto, she had a host of conversations with some of her more open-minded friends, including a former coworker who'd become friends with her after his ex-sex partner moved down. "You sort of become one with someone who knows what it's like. You're kind of like, 'Can' it, what do you have to say,'" says Hasegawa, whose father was an abusive alcoholic. "He said in an article, 'I like to talk to people about my upbringing and how my experiences have shaped me. My dad died in 1986, but then you find out where you are, and you can hear the emotions coming.' He told me at the time, 'If I had got to know him, that would have been a pretty different story'."
