One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I saw the cartoon 'Monsanto' that showed a black man looking up from a long hair and shouting, 'I will eat you and destroy your company'. I had seen it before, maybe at a local film festival, where I was being interviewed about the company.

I found something quite peculiar in it: when I was 18 years old, I was invited to be the first African-American to speak at the film festivals. That was immediately followed by a big outcry for it, especially after my name came up in the first round of questions from the audience (the white ones were not very interesting to me at all).

My parents didn't know about it and even though I graduated from high school with a degree, they didn't want to know. So they thought I would never speak at a fair. Their concern was not because I spoke at a festival, but because the local newspaper said it didn't matter to them who came up for the award. They don't know how to respond. In the end, I was invited back to attend film festivals but I didn't hear back. The next day, after my mother's death, I went to the Fair to meet up with my father (after they were divorced in 1978). I went to lunch with my sister and my stepdad, who had bought the land. I went to see my friend Peter. I'm sure I saw very little of what he wore
