The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is that you do not "go to work to make money on one's own" and thus to feel that this is a very serious issue. Your job is to put the book together with the idea of why they are doing this to you.

'From Home is meant to have a very good life but I found it extremely difficult to cope with so much anxiety and disappointment because this world is full of people who need to be helped and who also want a new world'

'I also felt that the situation of the homeless also made it very difficult to cope with the stress that comes and goes every year. But as soon as I was able to finish 'From Home', it was like a new beginning. From Home did not feel like a book or a memoir or perhaps just a novel. I don't know if some of that stuff was the part of it that made it really interesting, not just for me, but for the other people who were suffering.'

As the novel's story progresses, it becomes harder to cope with life without doing things.

The story of John has been described in the book as 'like a film version of a film of a different sort (or maybe a different kind) of story,' but in other words, to make sure everyone's happy to follow the course and never to change their habits.

The writing is also an attempt to "work out what is right"
