Dear Editor, 

With the ever increasing prevalence of computers in our everyday lives, this development raises a number of issues for us to consider. While there are many potential benefits to be had from the use of computers, it is important to recognize the potentially negative effects they can have on our society as well. 

On the one hand, computers have made communication much easier around the world. It has become easier for people to keep in touch with family and friends living abroad. People can now participate in discussion over vast distances that they would never have been able to achieve without the use of computers. Additionally, the use of computers in the workplace is well documented and has enabled businesses to increase their efficiency by reducing time spent completing certain tasks. 

On the other hand, the increasing use of computers tends to reduce the need for human interaction. Instead of meeting with people face to face, many relationships are conducted purely over the internet. This means people can become comfortable with having fewer interactions with members of their community and as a result, their communication skills can suffer. Additionally, people can become overly dependent on computers to do their work and it is important to remember there is still something to be said for doing work by hand. Computers, while useful, are not the answer for every task.

In my opinion, computers can certainly be an asset when it comes to communication, work productivity, and entertainment, but it is vital that we recognize their potential pitfalls as well
