I once had to babysit my five-year-old niece for an afternoon and I was feeling a bit overwhelmed. She was full of energy and was bouncing around like a mini tornado. She wanted to do this and that and wasn't patient when I had to take care of other tasks. I knew it wasn't her fault but I was starting to feel frazzled as the afternoon went on. 

That's when I decided to take a deep breath and tap into my patient self. I was able to take the time to explain things to her in a calm and understanding way. I also found that when I stayed patient, it felt like she was more willing to listen and even started to get a little bit calmer. 

It was definitely a challenge at first for me to stay patient, but after a while it started to become second nature. In the end, we both had a great afternoon and I realized that being patient is the key to success in any situation.
