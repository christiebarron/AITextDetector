I remember a time when I had to be especially patient. I was volunteering at my local animal shelter, and many of the animals had been through tough times before being brought there. One of the cats, in particular, was especially scared and skittish whenever I came near.

I could tell that she was hurting, but she wasn’t ready to let me near her. I couldn’t blame her for being scared since she had been bounced around from home to home for years, so I just tried day after day to build her trust.

Despite her Hissing, growling, and running away whenever I tried to approach, I was determined to get her to trust me. I kept things slow and started by just simply sitting near her and talking to her softly whenever I had the chance. Gradually, she started to warm up to me, and after months of patience, she finally let me pet her. It was a seriously amazing feeling to have earned her trust, and it was all worth the wait.
