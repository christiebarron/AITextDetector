The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Many of them were built after World War II and were built primarily for civilian use – not to replace the public utility infrastructure used over the many years of the city's development. But they ultimately built a state of engineering that allowed many of those dirigibles to dock after 1945 instead of becoming more popular with residents.

So what's the latest in city designs? When I took control of the city in 2006, I proposed an urban design overhaul that would combine three vexing buildings, a large open space and a mix of different parts. The idea of merging four buildings seemed to have little effect – a few parts would move down a little bit and others would move up a lot, while the remaining parts would get back up. A few people, like myself, made the call and we started making it work.

With such an ambitious project under way, I wanted to think a little more about the building construction history of our city. (See: How Did I Leave My Spaces At Your Door?.) While most of these ideas are still the usual trends of old cities, many of them had a fundamental change in their design in the 1990s. In that case, I suggested that we look at these four different building designs, which together provide an interesting historical snapshot of city design from the late 1980s to today.

With the construction-industry-building-technology paradigm over,
