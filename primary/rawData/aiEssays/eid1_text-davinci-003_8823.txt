I'm not sure where it started, but I remember it loud and clear. My best friend and I were sitting in our middle school cafeteria. We'd been playing a game and I had managed to beat her, so I was feeling a little cocky. I decided to break the silence by doing my best chicken dance, which only made my friend's face light up with laughter. 

At first, I was embarrassed and wanted to stop, but then I started laughing too. We were both laughing so hard that soon everyone around us was joining in too! I could hardly breathe, and I remember feeling so happy and so connected to my friend - it was like nothing else mattered in that moment. 

That single moment of laughter set the tone for our friendship. I had been nervous and scared to share this silly moment with my friend, but it turned out to be one of the best experiences I ever had. 

Laughter is a powerful thing: it can break down barriers and bring us closer together, and that's exactly what it did for us. Even today, laughter still brings me and my friend closer together and I'm grateful for the beautiful bond we share.
