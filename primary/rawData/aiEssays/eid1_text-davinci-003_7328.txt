The setting of ‘Rough Road Ahead’ by Joe Kurmaski has a profound effect on the cyclist and their journey. Set in a rural area, the cyclist is surrounded by mountainous terrain and remote areas. This gives the cyclist a sense of physical distance from civilization and evokes a sense of isolation. This isolation gives the cyclist a feeling of vulnerability, as they are now completely in the hands of the elements and nature.

The setting also affects the cyclist’s physical effort as the mountain path is steep and rough. The cyclist must make an effort to maneuver their bike up the mountain and their environment is resistant to such effort. The obstacle the cyclist faces is that of the environment, where the steep terrain requires determination to overcome.

The environment isn’t all negative, however. When the cyclist takes the time to look at the beauty of the setting, it gives them a sense of renewal and connection with nature’s power and beauty. The cyclist is both physically and emotionally connected to the mountain and the environment, giving them an awareness of their own courage and strength in the face of adversity.

Overall, the setting of ‘Rough Road Ahead’ affects the cyclist in many different ways. Physically, the environment provides an arduous obstacle; mentally, it poses a challenge to overcome the mountain and emotionally, it gives the cyclist a renewed sense of strength and courage. This setting helps to shape the cyclist’s journey
