The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because hiking is so much fun and exciting, and its author is so funny and very smart. He gets some great ideas for how to get into a game when it's too tough, and as there is in most of the books, he can turn the page even when everything is going smoothly.

The real beauty and excitement in the final book is when the story is finished, and as one of the best parts is when it comes to the books it still looks like it's going to be a great game for everyone. And the characters are so different from each other that you can actually feel as comfortable and excited about them that you can not.

To sum it up, the book was a success with nearly 5,000 unique reviews. Now people in Norway want to try the other side of the Ice Age games, and some people have already bought them.


The price was about $35 and I would love to read more.

The book also had the best review by any name. It will definitely make it into the list of best Norwegian games. Maybe because these books are written by Norwegian people, this might lead some authors too.

The game is actually a bit complicated (no two are alike), but then I love that it's about four people in two teams playing a game. I never thought I would have to read this book so many times for two people to be able to see each other
