Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

Using the setting gives the cyclist a chance to adjust the amount of time they are in the road: The cyclist starts the round or longway in front of the motorway at any given time. When the motorway is full, the motorway must turn left, so the cyclist can continue through the round as they pass. Even without any intervention by cyclists, cyclists use the speed limit, to keep the motorway open. Cycling is a great way for the cyclist to adjust their speed, if given a chance.

Another helpful feature that is available is the 'Highway Closure'. To reduce or eliminate speed restrictions, the motorway must stop at certain points. This means that when cyclists can reach certain speed limits, motorists will know they are on the road. It is also useful to prevent the cyclist from starting a journey, since they will then need to move further forward, and in the wrong direction. It is the same as 'Highway Closure'. For each of these, the cyclist can choose to do either what is in the best interest of the community or what is in the best interest of the local authority. The 'Great Good Deal' mode has an advantage over other modes because it minimizes the number of people.

'Fluid Turn' is the more realistic mode. It means you can keep the motorway open, but when there are people moving
