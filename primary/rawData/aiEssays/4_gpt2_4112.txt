The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it makes us realize it is no longer a story about me (or what I remember of you), it is an allegory of a woman dying in war in our own lands or the love our daughters offer. We are reminded of how women and men, and even their own husbands, have to figure out what it is we should do for each other.

That has been part of my experience growing up. This book is a good way to explore the subject. I believe that, for me, it is about love that should be our primary focus of the time. This love does not have to consist in marriage, but you learn to appreciate that it is the nature of love with which we can overcome any obstacles. One day we will all be in a field that will have no borders and no boundaries and we will all have to adapt to and love each other more passionately than we ever could before. This story makes for an intriguing take on our lives that should not be dismissed at once.

You might not know it's coming, but I hope you will read it.

What are some interesting books and stories from you and others reading the book?

I am a freelance writer living in New York City. There are a bunch of people at this web event I have to get up on stage and tell about this book. I was excited enough to do two web projects together and the first was on Tumblr.
