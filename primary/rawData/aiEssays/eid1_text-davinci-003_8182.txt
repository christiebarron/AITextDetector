The ambitious building of the Empire State Building included an unforgettable and unique detail: the mooring mast. This mast, designed to allow dirigibles to dock, took imagination and industry to complete. Though the ambitious project posed a slew of obstacles for the builders, they were ultimately successful.

The idea for the mooring mast was initially proposed in1931 by Colonel William A. Starling, a former Naval Air Officer. Starling had discovered that dirigibles, or airships, could be made more popular if they could dock at the Empire State Building. However, the implications the mast had for the building were unknown and the directors of the Empire State Building were hesitant to invest in the project. The mast required the Empire State Building to alter the design, budget, and timeline of the building significantly, and Starling was faced with the challenge of convincing the directors that the mast would be worth the investment.

To address these obstacles, Starling demonstrated how popular dirigibles were becoming, and he published hundreds of photos of the mooring mast being erected and tested. He also showed the directors how pilots and engineers worked with the structure to practice making dirigible deliveries, and the powerful images helped the directors realize the potential of the mooring mast.

The team eventually widened the building's 81st floor to give dirigibles more space for mooring, and the mooring mast was engineered with a unique two-mast design.
