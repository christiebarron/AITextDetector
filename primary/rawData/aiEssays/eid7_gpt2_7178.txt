An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the time I got my first job on a bridge, and my first year on a construction crane. Then I was working for the Wall Street banks and got promoted to vice president of engineering. The next few times we moved in together. I made friends at one of my first jobs and when a friend came along, my friend was very, very impressed. He was quite impressed with me. I met up with a friend who had worked there. It was funny. They were at The New Orleans Restaurant when I started a job. Then I was at a restaurant, and suddenly we had a guy who was kind of an employee, and it became a very close relationship.

Was there any tension between your time on your own during this time and after?

Well, I got off to a good start with my time on my own. We started working on a couple of projects and got started doing a couple more projects so that he could have a more specific understanding of our project development.

There was a feeling I had from the beginning that my time was not up to my job because I was in the studio with a lot of people, but that I had some responsibilities. One important thing is to be able to talk to people who are doing other projects. It's a good idea to see them all in person on the job and in person, and to see how they are doing. We had a great time making
