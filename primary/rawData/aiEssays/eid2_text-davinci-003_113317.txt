Many people believe that the idea of censoring materials found in libraries is preposterous. It is a person's individual right to freedom of speech which should not be revoked by removing certain items from library shelves just because they might be deemed offensive to some of the communities in that area. Censorship in libraries infringes upon a person's right to have access to information and limits our exposure to new ways of thinking. 

Censorship prevents our society from having meaningful conversations about important topics related to social justice, race, gender, LGBTQIA+ issues, and more. When materials that tackle these sensitive topics are removed from library shelves, we are unable to discuss, debate, and understand different perspectives and standpoints on everything from current political issues to cultural or religious debates. As a society, it is our responsibility to promote understanding and critical thinking, which can be done by allowing individuals to make their own decisions as to what materials they wish to access and explore. 

When certain materials are taken off of library shelves due to censorship, it also creates a false impression in the minds of young readers that something controversial or offensive must be inherently bad. Censorship can be damaging to our society as it discourages us from having conversations on certain topics and limits our exposure to different ideas and perspectives. In today's world, information and ideas are constantly changing, and we can not assume to know the truth about a particular subject. Rather, we should strive for understanding and discussion
