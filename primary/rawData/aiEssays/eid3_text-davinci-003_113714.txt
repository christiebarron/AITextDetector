The setting of ‘Rough Road Ahead’ by Joe Kurmaski has a big effect on the cyclist. The rougher the terrain, the harder it is to control the bike and keep balance. This can cause physical exhaustion for the cyclists and can create a challenging journey, even for the most experienced riders.

The landscape of the environment also plays a role in the way the cyclist responds. The steepness and condition of the terrain make a big difference in terms of how much effort the cyclist needs to exert and how much control they have over their bike. Rocky or sandy roads require more power and skill in order to navigate them successfully. If the terrain is hilly, steep uphill climbs can be difficult for some cyclists and steep downhill sections can be dangerous with the risk of going too fast and losing control. Similarly, narrow or winding roads can increase the chances of an accident occurring.

Weather conditions can also pose a challenge for the cyclist. Rain, snow, or strong winds can all make it harder to maneuver the bike. Windy conditions in particular require a different approach from the cyclist, as gusts of current may cause the cyclist to lose balance. Poor visibility from fog or snowfall further increases the risk of not being able to see obstacles or other traffic on the road. With these conditions, the cyclist has to be very alert and cautious or risk having an accident.
