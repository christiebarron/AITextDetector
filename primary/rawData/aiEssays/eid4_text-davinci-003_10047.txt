At the end of the poem, Minfong Ho is providing a kind of resolution to the story she is telling. The hibiscus is a symbol of her own life and struggles; she is saying that the next time the hibiscus blooms in spring, she will have the strength and courage to take the test again - proving that she will have grown and overcome whatever difficulties life has thrown her way in the intervening period. The reference to the snows melting and the geese returning further points to the idea of new life, hope and renewal.
