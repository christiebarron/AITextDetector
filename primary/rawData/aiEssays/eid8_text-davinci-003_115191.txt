I remember the first time my husband and I laughed together. We had been dating for a few months and were out for dinner. We were talking and suddenly he said something that was so silly yet so true that I just couldn't help but burst into laughter.

He looked at me, taken aback, but then started chuckling. Soon he was laughing as loudly as I was, and in that moment I knew that we could have a future together.

Soon we were laughing so hard that other diners in the restaurant were starting to look at us. We tried to compose ourselves, but every time we looked at each other, a brand new laugh erupted.

I could barely eat my dinner, but the best part was that it felt like we were connecting in a way that words alone could never have achieved. That night, we both shared in many laughs, and I know that every time we do, it brings us a little bit closer.
