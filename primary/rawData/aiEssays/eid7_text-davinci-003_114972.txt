I recently had to take a road trip with my family. My siblings and I can be quite rambunctious, often bickering and staying up later than we should while traveling.

The trip was starting to take its toll on everyone, and tempers were rising. I kept getting more and more frustrated and I was about to snap on my siblings.

Then, it happened.

My father silently stepped in and said, "Please respect each other. We are all tired and a little grumpy, and need a break."

He listened to us and allowed some room for us to be ourselves, while still keeping us in line. He was patient and understanding when he could have easily scolded us.

I was so grateful that my father was patient and understanding. In that moment, it reminded me that we were all in it together and that we needed to respect each other. His patience ended up getting us through our long journey, and reminded me to be more patient when things don't go as planned.
