Malthus, who was a prominent proponent of architectural forms and principles, helped develop the Empire State Building for its own purposes.

The second obstacle was the problem that had led to the building's development. This was the original roof. Malthus had previously seen an older roof that supported three-storey office buildings, and these were all examples of skyscrapers built at this time. Inserving as an ideal
