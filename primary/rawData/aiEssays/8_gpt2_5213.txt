One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I lived in South Korea, but it had been quite a rough couple of years. After spending a couple of years out of home, I finally got around to travelling. It was not a particularly safe time, so I headed out and found myself back at home. And a few weeks later, I got a full-blown asthma attack. It was my first time experiencing a big medical problem, and in that time I had developed the habit of coughing excessively. My mouth dropped off; I couldn't breathe. I quickly began to suffer from a respiratory infection but after some tests, I realized that it was not the only problem. It was the other half.

It was my first time to experience a new asthma attack. I could breath. We shared a bed, and I sat at the back with my head against the pillow, not thinking about the other half. We had a few beers and a quick shower. Then, after an hour of meditation, I saw myself back to normal and we made it to our destination. It was almost dark and dark. A few steps outside the tent and the clouds were clearly rising. When I ran across the river from the tent I realised that my face was very swollen and not the face I had been looking for.
