I was walking through the park on a crisp spring evening, my head full of thoughts about my upcoming project at work. As I crossed an empty field, I noticed a group of teenagers in the far corner, huddled together in laughter. Curious, I decided to take a detour and see what was so funny. 

As I approached, they turned to look at me and I felt self-conscious intruder upon their laughter. But then one of the girls, recognizing me, waved me over and said, “Hey it’s [my name], come over here!”

Embarrassed, I smiled and walked over, joining them in their circle. Then, the girl who beckoned me told me one of her funny stories, and I laughed. As I laughed, I felt the tension of my thoughts subside and my head become clearer. For a few brief moments, the laughter was the only thing that mattered. 

The group of teens welcomed me into their laughter and we spent a few more minutes swapping stories and laughing together. As I made my way back home that night, I felt a lightness I hadn’t felt in some time. 

That night, I experienced the healing power of laughter, and the undeniable connection it brings us.
