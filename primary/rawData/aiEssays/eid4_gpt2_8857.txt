The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because they see it for what it is. While the book goes with more depth and details more easily, they still see some of Tolkien's dark themes and mysteries that no one seems aware of. It is very similar to the book The Hobbit.

The most significant, and perhaps most interesting aspect of Snow White is the story of the magical stones. I'm not a huge fan of magic stones, but my favorite idea about Snow White that I have is of a stone of the element of water and the wind blowing between the two. So what I would expect Snow White to do is to start with her father's stone, and to create the water for ice and snow to form. Snow White would start the story by using the magical stones and go back to drawing the stones. Then Snow White would come to the fire, and take his father's stone away and create this magical ice. And that's when Snow White became Snow White. The magical stones would be melted, but in her body and on Snow White's body as well, Snow White is very strong (in some ways). So she makes Snow White stronger than she is currently. The idea of Snow White becoming Snow White could be said to be a combination of a combination of her strength and her magic strength combined with her power.

And that's only part of what Snow White does. Then we learn about how she's going to defeat the Dark Lord and the Seven
