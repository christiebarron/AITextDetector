The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first came after the U.S. Government stopped building dirigibles in the United States by 1967, after the company had been denied permission to build dirigibles for the military.

Then were the final obstacles to allow dirigibles into the war zones during the war, such as when the United Nations began a program to train U.S. military personnel to handle the war by flying them as dirigibles over Europe. The U.S. military then flew the dirigibles over the Soviet Union, where they were converted into long-range bombers used by Soviet troops to counter American military forces at the time.

The United States and China also were reluctant to allow their foreign counterparts, especially China, to build new dirigs, and in 1971, Congress authorized the creation of a Special Committee to study ways to allow them to enter the war zones, and to report back on them in a Congressional hearing. The Committee determined there were no effective ways to allow China to build dirigibles.

In 1977, when it became clear that the U.S. Army's aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson was in the path of a landing mission, the U.S. Government allowed the U.S. Air Force to take the unmanned aircraft carrier as part of its contract for U.S. military transport.
