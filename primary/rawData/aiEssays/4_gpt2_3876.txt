The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because the characters start to work through their own history. There are, for example, the things used to protect the city of Stasis, and the reasons why they became vampires. Then there is the death penalty imposed on those who kill.

On the other side of things, though, the stories I wrote were very specific. This is important as the people I read and the stories I read became more and more interesting, but also as I got longer into it: my attention shifted to different subjects. The most interesting part for me as a new writer was reading a story about The Black Rose. I think it's hard not to wonder whether or not it is one of the best books I've ever read -- a fascinating story I'd be sad to not have to read again, or I could see it getting better if it continues.

Are any of this just as entertaining or thrilling as reading a novel in its entirety? No, most of it isn't a surprise. That said, I have been trying for quite a long time to create stories that were as fun as possible. For one thing, I've been struggling to get a balance in my novel that's satisfying enough that it becomes a very good piece of writing. I have spent the last few years playing around with how I write and I've been trying to get the right balance. I started experimenting with different combinations to try and match every word we could.
