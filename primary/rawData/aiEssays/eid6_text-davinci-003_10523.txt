The construction of the Empire State Building presented a unique challenge when it came to allowing dirigibles to dock. The most significant obstacle the builders faced was finding a way to safely moor dirigibles without compromising the structural integrity of the building. The challenge was largely met through the careful implementation of a technology known as the “mooring mast”. 

The mooring mast was devised by the chief engineer of the Empire State Building, William Lamb, in 1930. Lamb’s idea was to use steel cables to secure dirigibles to the building in the event that they needed to land. The mast ran up the length of the Empire State Building and extended over to the taxiway, allowing dirigibles to be moored at that point. 

However, the mooring mast was not without its difficulties. Its design was complex, with the equipment taking up two floors of the building, and it was hard to install and operate in such a high-rise building. Furthermore, the weight of a fully loaded dirigible was considerable, and Lamb was anxious about the pressure the mast might place on the building’s internal structure. 

To alleviate this pressure, the dirigibles were connected to the mooring mast with specially designed winches that could monitor the tension on the cable and quickly adjust if necessary. Lamb also developed a tension-release mechanism, which allowed the mast to be slowly unwound when the dir
