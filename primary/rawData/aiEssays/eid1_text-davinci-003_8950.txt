Dear Editor,

The proliferation of technology and computers in our lives has raised questions about their positive and negative effects. After a careful review, I have come to the conclusion that the effects computers have on people are beneficial overall.

First, computers offer incredible new ways to store, access, and analyze massive amounts of information, leading to greater efficiency and productivity. Access to information has become easier than ever before, transforming how we do our research. In addition to this, computers have opened up so many new ways to communicate with each other, including social media, allowing for quick dissemination of news and real-time conversation.

Moreover, computers can be utilized for entertainment, allowing for humans to do everything from play video games to edit photos and videos. There is no getting around the fact that computers make life more enjoyable and fun.

Finally, computers have become integral in creating new jobs, fueling economic growth. In many ways, computers are the foundation of the modern economy, allowing for businesses to find and reach customers in a way they never could before.

In conclusion, computers have undeniably had an effect on people in many positive ways. As such, I urge you and your readers to accept the benefits of computers and not fear their effects. 

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
