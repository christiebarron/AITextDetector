An example of a time someone in my life was patient was for me to watch a documentary entitled Hijack and I was very surprised and disappointed. I didn't understand how this was going to work.

This is just one of the many examples of how a group of people in a group have built the internet. And why doesn't that help them become better people?

I think that is a very important question. I think it gives us the hope that this could be a breakthrough for online networking.

In terms of the next five years we need to keep the online infrastructure going.
