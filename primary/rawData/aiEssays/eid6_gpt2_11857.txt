The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first was federal rules that allowed for private development of the structure, such as the U.S. and Canada, while that government would build dirigibles on private property, with permits even from private builders, allowing for the construction to still take place. The private builders could build the dirigibles on their own, as were the government and builders. With the federal government not providing for the use of private construction agencies, and with commercial trucking corporations having a stake in providing the facilities, it's important that private builders could not build their own dirigibles on government property.

On Oct. 11, 1976, the FAA announced that it would no longer require commercial trucking companies to install or rent commercial dirigibles on government properties.

The FAA's decision not to make commercial trucking companies, however, makes business sense over what the FAA and federal highway authority are trying to accomplish. Even though the FAA does not use a commercial trucking company to install dirigibles on public roads within the limits of its regulation, it still would have needed to approve it.

The FAA's position on this issue was reversed in 1982. The FAA moved to create a small state pilot project under the National Transportation Safety Board. The pilot's program would have required companies to establish a pilot program in a particular country in order to run off from there. To implement the pilot pilot project
