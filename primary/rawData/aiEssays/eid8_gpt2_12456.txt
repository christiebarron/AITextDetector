One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was 10 years old. In a lot of ways, that was me doing what I'd always dreamt of: the coolest thing ever. It's like, "OK, I can't stand not being able to see that or feel that. What do I do?" It's like I can't even tell you the meaning of my voice. It's that, right there in front of you, to be honest, it's amazing. There's no way that I can still say that. My voice isn't even capable of talking. It is a real, real deep emotional response, or it's hard for me. It's like if I were sitting there talking to you or something, you'd give me the most severe blow.

What's your favourite part of being surrounded by so many people?

My friends are like, "They're like, 'Why have those people stopped?'" So all of them feel very important. They actually support me. They say nice things to me about me, like, "You're awesome. They need you. If you look good." You'd have to be in that position before you'll be able to say that anything. I got so angry saying it. I was really angry about it because of all of my own life. I was really devastated when I got that phone call from my sister telling me she had been so supportive. I'm almost so alone in this world.
