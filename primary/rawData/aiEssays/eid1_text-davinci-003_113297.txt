Dear Editor,

As technology continues to develop in our society, it’s undeniable that computers are becoming an increasingly important part of our daily lives. While this advancement comes with its own set of advantages, another side of the coin must be pointed out too: the effects computers have on people. 

For one, computers are so deeply ingrained in our society that some may become overly dependent on them. Numerous studies show that overuse of computers can lead to physical and mental health issues. Doing too much work on the computer can cause people to lead a sedentary lifestyle, which can lead to obesity and other health problems. Moreover, prolonged use of computers can lead to stress and anxiety, as well as sleep deprivation. 

That being said, computers certainly have their advantages too. For instance, computers make communication easier and more efficient. People can remain in touch with family and friends all over the world and information can be exchanged in a matter of a few clicks. Additionally, computers are also a great educational tool. The internet has become an invaluable resource when it comes to gathering knowledge for a variety of topics. 

In conclusion, computers have many positive attributes, but it’s essential that we remember the potential harm computers can cause. We must always maintain a healthy balance when it comes to computer usage. Only then can we maximize the advantages of computers while minimizing the risks.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
