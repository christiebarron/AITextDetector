An example of a time someone in my life was patient was her late husband who said that I could never let her run the entire wedding party to pay for her car. I have to say that as a partner it's nice because sometimes they get to do it together. I get to go home with my family just to go to the wedding and have a drink of wine and play the drums with them as we all do. It's a great day!

I know I might have never met you and I am not doing it for myself. But that's all I need to know. How do you live your wedding life without knowing anyone in particular?

Because I have always been grateful for your friendship. And I want to thank The Fierce for so much that inspired me to share with you the details of my relationship with you in my book, Love That I Know. As I wrote it about myself before my marriage, I'm in love with you because I want you to have fun. I want to help you realize that being in love is such a great feeling and it's a special time for me to be together.

Thank you very much, J.
