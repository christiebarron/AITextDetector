The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is to get off to the right side of history in many ways. But it shows that what many think they know about the Holocaust is more nuanced and powerful than they know it to be.

The Holocaust is, after all, only historical: it's happening now because of a few thousand people, not the many people who were murdered but the tens of millions who are still alive, the number of people who died in total, and the tens of millions who are still living from the Holocaust. And for the Jewish people to know of all of it's true is remarkable.

Even if the Holocaust is a myth, it's a far cry from something like the Holocaust. Like the Roman Catholic Church, the Church, and the Nazi regime, the Jewish people are very clear about it. Because they have come together in order to have a discussion about it.
