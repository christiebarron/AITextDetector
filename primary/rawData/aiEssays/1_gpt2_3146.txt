Computers have many effects on people. I've often said that the world is a lot like a laboratory. In some senses it's better than the worldéš›. The main thing is to find ways (and techniques) to increase our capacity, and the world provides one good way to do that. To that end, I'm also making a list of different ways (i.e. methods, methods of thought) we can increase our capacity, not just that we could be more flexible.


In the end, I'd like to mention that there are many ideas that could be applied (i.e. in any order the possible applications would be the same), which might affect each individual individual.


I've spent quite some time thinking along these lines today. I think this is important to remember if you're starting with the general goal of thinking along the lines of what's right and the thing you want to see and use in a system. I would like to see all the different approaches in the different areas. So today's post contains some ideas that could maybe be applied in certain areas to do my own thinking. For today's discussion, I'll be discussing the various concepts and approaches to increase our capacity. In my next post I'll be focusing on my last thoughts, which I hope you'll agree will make it worth reading. Thank you. As always, keep reading and share. It'll be updated as the days get shorter, so take care. If you
