I remember a time when I was tested on my patience. I had a checking account and one day I had two withdrawals come out of my account that I had not authorized. I was immediately worried that someone had access to my account and had stolen money from me. 

I contacted my bank right away to report what had happened and asked them to investigate. After several days of following up with the bank, I received a response that didnâ€™t quite answer my question. I was becoming increasingly frustrated and wanted answers.

I decided to take a few deep breaths and remain patient. After all, the bank was doing its job to thoroughly investigate the issue and I had to trust that the process was working.

Finally, after patiently waiting a few more days, my bank called to explain that the two withdrawals were part of a bank promotion and that I had deposited more money into my account than I had known. I was relieved and happy that the bank had followed through with its investigation and clarified the issue for me. 

I had to be patient, and it was worth the wait in the end.
