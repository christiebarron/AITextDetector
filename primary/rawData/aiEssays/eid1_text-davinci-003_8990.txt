Dear Editor, 

The effects of computers on people is an increasingly relevant topic due to the rapid uptake of technology over recent years. I believe that computers are a fundamentally positive influence on people, and I encourage readers to consider the evidence I offer in favor of this idea. 

For starters, many studies show that computer usage can significantly improve overall mental health. Through activities such as playing computer games and browsing the internet, people are able to find solace and entertainment to take their minds off of things. This can, in turn, reduce stress levels and lead to better overall well-being. 

In addition, computers are valuable tools for creativity and communication. They allow people to express themselves in unique and creative ways, often giving them a platform to share ideas and resources with others. By connecting with friends old and new and developing relationships via digital media, people can easily stay in touch with those around them, and make meaningful connections. Last but certainly not least, computers can be incredibly useful for business and educational purposes, from creating presentations and reports to researching and writing scholarly articles.

To conclude, computers are a great resource for people of all walks of life. They offer convenience, connection, and creativity opportunities, making them an invaluable part of our lives. I hope this letter helped to make you realize the positive effects computers have on people. 

Sincerely, 

[Name]
