A short distance down the aisle were 12 or 15 tons of timber.

In May of 2012 the Empire State Building became the headquarters for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, where it served as the launch site for the Space Shuttle Discovery Space Station on a mission to study new space technology. The Space Shuttle Discovery, the first of the Shuttle's 10 crew to carry human spaceflight supplies back to the Earth, was the first NASA test flight of its equipment. The station was the first American space station to launch astronauts over the ocean and into space. The Hubble Space Telescope was used to see asteroids further than Earth's orbit.

NASA initially asked for another mission to carry the Space Shuttle by the end of 2013. But at first the agency refused due to the difficulty in securing funding and space-faring states. By December of 2013, it had found funding to send the Space
