I was walking down the street one day, feeling pretty down about life in general, when I began to hear laughter. I was drawn to the sound, and followed it until I stumbled upon a funny old man telling jokes to a group of delighted young children. His stories were so funny that I couldn't help but laugh, too!

I was still feeling a bit down, but the laughter coming from the old man and the children started to fill my heart with joy. I started to feel a little lighter, and I couldn't help but smile.

I stood there, watching them, until the old man caught my eye and smiled. He suggested that I join them and have a turn telling jokes, too! I was embarrassed at first - after all, I didn't know any jokes - but I gathered enough courage to give it a try.

At first, my jokes weren't so funny and the children simply stared at me blankly. But then the old man started to laugh, and soon enough, the children followed his lead. Before I knew it, we were all laughing and smiling together!

That's when I realized that laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people. I was standing there in the middle of strangers but, thanks to the power of laughter, I suddenly felt so connected to them! We had created a moment of joy that I won't soon forget.
