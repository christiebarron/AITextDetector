I will never forget the time I shared with my best friend Becky. We had just finished final exams at the end of the school year and were looking forward to the summer break. We decided that day to spend the day walking around the park and playing arcade games.

As we wandered around the park, Becky started to tell me a story about something that happened to her that day. I could tell it was really funny but I had no idea what she was talking about. Before I could make sense of what she was saying, she started laughing so hard, tears were streaming down her face. I was so confused that I started laughing too, not knowing why. We were both laughing uncontrollably and it soon spread to the people around us.

Pretty soon, a small group of people had gathered around us and were laughing along with us. The laughter felt so contagious and freeing and we just couldn't stop. Eventually, I figured out what the story was about and it made me laugh even harder. The laughter just kept going on and on until our faces felt sore.

When it was finally over, we had tears of laughter in our eyes and looked around to all the other smiling faces. Everyone there shared this special moment with us and it brought us even closer.

That was the day we realized that laughter really could be the best medicine. It was a moment of joy between us that I will never forget.
