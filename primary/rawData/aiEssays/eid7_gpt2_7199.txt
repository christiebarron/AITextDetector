An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my father's sister. I did not like them. After she passed away, and the life they had was a very painful one. Now we know something, that they were suffering that I feared was my own. To feel your fear to an extent and you need to ran to and hug yourself, you needed to take them by the shoulders. That's a normal way of thinking, to take your own hands and go to the room for comfort. They did not deserve to die and you will know this and all we ask is that you pray for their speedy recovery as much as I did."

As the story continues, parents of children who died from suicide say, "It's very hard to see this now as a time when there was an attempt on your life. People do not understand my perspective on my own experiences. I hope this helps someone to come forward, to come forward and let's know how we can come together and understand that when something like this happens, there must be some way for me and my sister to look at each other and let them know they aren't being taken advantage of by a culture that wants us dead."
