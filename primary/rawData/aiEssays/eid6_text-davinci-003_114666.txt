The Empire State Building was an ambitious project that was completed in 1931 with the intention to revolutionize the construction industry with its sheer scale and scope. When this architectural feat was finished, one of the most ambitious ideas associated with the building was the concept of allowing dirigibles, or airships, to dock directly at the top of the buildingâ€“an idea that promised to add a new level of transportation, luxury, and excitement to New York City. However, there were several obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome in order to put this idea into practice.

The first obstacle to allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was the physical requirements to do so. Dirigibles are large, cumbersome objects that require a certain amount of space to land safely. In order to facilitate the landing of these huge ships at the top of the Empire State Building, a 'mooring mast' had to be created, with a large platform for the dirigible to land on, and enough vertical strength to accommodate its weight and size. This was a difficult engineering feat, but ultimately the builders were able to create a perfectly-sized mooring mast, and the project was successful.

The next obstacle was more complex: the practical implications of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. The main issue was safety, as it was feared that the turbulent flight patterns of the dirigibles would make landing on the mooring mast
