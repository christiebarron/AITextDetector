The building of the Empire State Building presented a unique engineering and architectural challenge. The need to accommodate dirigibles, or airships, led to the incorporation of a dock for airships on the roof. The development of the airship dock encountered numerous technical and practical obstacles.

One of the first obstacles the builders faced was the need to find a support structure that could hold the weight of the dirigibles and that could withstand high winds. To do this, they erected a steel framework composed of two 400 foot tall support masts. This was not only the tallest steel framework ever built at the time, but also took over two years to complete.

The sheer size and complexity of the mast presented a second obstacle. There was concern that the airships may not have enough room to lower their landing gear or tail wipers and safely attach to the mast. To solve this, the builders devised special steel rigging and tie-downs to connect the airships to the dock. This rigging was also designed to secure the ships even in inclement weather.

The builders also designed a retractable system for the linking cables to ensure the safety of the passengers and crew in the event that the ships were unable to dock before departing. This system allowed the cables to be connecting or disconnected quickly while in flight.

Finally, the builders devised a security system which included establishing security checkpoints, installing floodlights, and allowing security personnel to patrol the airship dock. This was crucial
