In the story 'Rough Road Ahead' by Joe Kurmaski, the cyclist is affected by the features of the setting in multiple ways.

First, the cyclist is riding on an unpaved road which makes for a difficult and bumpy ride. The terrain is uneven which poses a challenge for the cyclist and can make for a dangerous ride. Additionally, the road is surrounded by dense vegetation, which narrows the path and can cause the cyclist to become disoriented. This obstacle can increase the cyclistâ€™s anxiety as he is uncertain of what lies ahead.

Moreover, the cyclist is faced with the challenge of navigating through the darkness. The setting features a waning moon and no visible stars which offers the cyclist very little light to rely on. This limited visibility adds to the difficulty for the cyclist and makes the terrain all the more difficult to traverse.

Finally, the cyclist is confronted with the extreme elements of the weather. The setting presents strong winds and pelting rain, which can cause low visibility and can weary the cyclist. The character is also subject to extreme cold which can make his journey all the more arduous.

In 'Rough Road Ahead', the features of the setting present significant obstacles for the cyclist, making for a difficult and dangerous journey. The unpaved terrain, dense vegetation, darkness, and extreme elements all impact and challenge the cyclist. Ultimately, the cyclist must navigate these obstacles in order to reach his destination safely.
