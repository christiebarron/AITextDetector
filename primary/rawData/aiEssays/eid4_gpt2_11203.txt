The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it is just as good as the first chapter. The story is full of a nice dialogue, aLayhir is beautiful but not good enough to be recommended, the characters are still bland and the story is short and slow but is very good read. The story goes on about the old lady who was given a wish that she had a husband and is kept up at night listening to the radio. My only complaint with it is the cover. There was no way to read it in a bad environment with some really bad lighting. The book is also not clear with most parts having a lot of shading but one could say there is some pretty obvious shading done. As mentioned above the book doesn't really hit everything on its own so it is not an especially bad read. The action and story of the book is really good and I think it is worth reading or at least considering. A lot of time is spent on the characters which is a little annoying considering the action, but it is worth it. There are some very interesting interactions between the people of this world and some great action scenes. I love the fact that there are always a couple of little towns in my book and even where there are not, it is fun to read these interactions and to think of which side of the story they could play out. Overall it does a good job of building suspense and story but unfortunately it is just not in my top ten favorite reading book.
