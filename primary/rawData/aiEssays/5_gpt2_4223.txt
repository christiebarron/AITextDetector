The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is very much alive now. And it is about the impact of the loss of the power of the English language on the English language community.

If we talk the language we are speaking now, whether it be the English language as a whole, or the English language of the individual person, how many people do we have now and how much longer before it is over?

And if we think about the impact English language has had on the other languages we are discussing here, and this is something that is just becoming more important to us now, that we have got to be clear about the impact of the languages we use, what is it to be English, what is it to be French, what is it to be Polish, what is it to be Greek, and now, we have a couple of countries where the English Language and some of the other languages are still under attack, because these languages are only so used to communicate. It would be quite interesting to see a language or language community affected by these attacks.

But when I was writing 'From Home is', there is still so much to speak about the impact of English language in the English community. This is a language that we now need to start studying and understand. And what is the point of having all those people in this conversation, if I could ask them to please contribute how they really feel, they can tell me how they feel. And I hope that
