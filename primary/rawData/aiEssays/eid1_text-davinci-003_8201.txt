The Empire State Building was originally designed to accommodate airship docking. However, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of challenges along the way. In Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s article, “The Mooring Mast,” she outlines the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome in order to make docking a reality.

One of the first challenges was finding a suitable location for the mast which had to be tall enough so that the airships had a clear line of sight and approach. Engineers calculated that the building needed a mooring mast that was 600 feet in length. This would require the construction crew to construct a spinning tower with an inner metal core allowing the mast to rise above the roof’s edge. 

The next step was the construction of the mast itself. This proved to be the most difficult of the tasks as engineers had to devise a plan that would be able to support the huge weight of the dirigible as it moored at the top. After a careful design process, the builders decided to build the mast out of interwoven steel cables, coated in tar to provide extra protection, which would support the dock’s mat called a sock. The builders also added a chain to provide extra support and safety to the mooring mast. 

The last major challenge was to create a system for the airships to safely dock and disembark passengers. A sophisticated mechanism for
