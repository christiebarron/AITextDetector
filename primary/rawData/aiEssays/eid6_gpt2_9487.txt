The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

Even the National Gallery of Art decided that a dirigible with a 2Ã—6 screen above would have to be used on a large project. So, instead, two planes are sent together on a single plane on their way aboard the plane from Berlin to New York. The dirigibles would take several days to dock and be operated by the World Magic Association, a federation of 20,000 people.

The plane would take six hour trips to get to London.

The project is now on the verge of drawing the attention of Hollywood, who say it is the first ever dirigible from the World of Magic.

The project is planned for an estimated cost of $2.5 billion, according to a source with knowledge of the plan.
