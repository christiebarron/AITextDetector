One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my teacher said I was 'the funniest guy ever'. And I did a good job of creating a Grassley response. As you can see the reaction was huge. A lot of people were surprised to see me in a role, and there was a very small amount of 'what have you done wrong' comment that we would get from people, but it was positive. He never asked anyone whether I liked the game myself, was he?

I never wrote it down, but it's been a little off as I haven't played a lot of RPGs, so what did you think of it?

It is my own fault. I don't think I'm very good at handling humor. In one RPG where I'm the biggest doujinshi character in a RPG of any kind: the One Ring Story, I had a terrible time giving them away. Of course, that got me through a lot, but I don't think many of you heard about it. I was a fan of the One Ring Story, as it was. But I like you, so what? In fact, how you got into RPGs? I don't have ever done a serious RPG. I was in a lot of highschool and college. I think the thing that gave me the strongest impression is that I took an interesting RPG approach in the beginning, actually it took 3 or 4 years for me to have a good game.
