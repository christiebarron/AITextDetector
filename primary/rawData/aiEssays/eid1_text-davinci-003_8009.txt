The Empire State Building was an ambitious project undertaken by the Empire State Company in 1930. One of the most iconic features of the building was the mooring mast, which allowed dirigibles to dock at the top of the building, making it the world’s first airship terminal. Although the concept was innovative, there were many obstacles to overcome before the Empire State Building could become a docking station for dirigibles.

The first obstacle faced by the building’s designers was the structural limitations of the building itself. As the tallest building in the world at the time, there was a chance that the force of the dirigibles would put too great of a strain on the building's skeleton. To address this issue, the architects constructed an additional steel frame which created a foundation strong enough to support the additional weight.

The second obstacle was the unpredictability of the weather. As dirigibles were powered by helium or hydrogen, the dirigibles were vulnerable to strong winds and lightning – both of which were common in New York City. To counter this, engineers designed an extensive safety system which included lightning rods, mooring cables, and even a special “tethering system” which allowed the airships to dock without the risk of being swept away.

The third obstacle was the sheer size of the dirigibles. At over 700 feet long, the space required to safely maneuver the airships posed an incredible challenge. To address
