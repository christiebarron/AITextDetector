Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. In the context of their riding style, these riders will often come off riding at a quicker pace and use their speed and braking power to make good use of their situation on the road or on the pavement. The more time a rider is able to spend cycling the bike, the faster their motorist will adjust their grip, braking power and time of riding. Rowing too fast can make the cyclist slip or make the bike fall off on the flat. As a result, these situations can become even more difficult for short distance riders.

In particular, in 'Rough Road Ahead,' the rider will not have time to adjust their balance when they are not riding in a straight line. This also affects how fast the operator can move, allowing the motorist to push the vehicle a fair bit further forward where they want to be.

As such, in a 'Rough Road Ahead' setting, the cyclist will need to maintain a certain amount of tension when going forward in the same way the operator would attempt to pull off a straight line. This causes the motorist significantly less time to pull forward, but not more. While this may be the case in 'Rough Road Ahead,' it is less accurate when working on a very long straight route, such as a fast hill climb.

When riding in any of the following conditions, the operator will have a limited amount of safety control.
