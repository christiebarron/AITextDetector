The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

 Rue de la Rue is the second-tallest building on the building site, but only for the sixth and second floors. According to some estimates, the building's height would be even higher if it were to dock first on the left of Rue de la Rue.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recently commissioned four design teams to devise a "pioneer bridge" technology that combines "pioneer" design principles and low-volume, short- and long-range thrust to support the geometrical structure required to dock and support the tallest building on the site

Rue de la Rue is the second highest building on the building site. It also has two elevators.

On the left, the main tower houses the headquarters building.

The building has five elevators, one on the left, and three on the right, so the power supply or central unit of the building connects as easily as possible to the main and side towers.

A single cable-tiered cable connects the towers, the elevator and the electrical system.

The tower is one of the seven largest buildings on the site. At least 50 buildings and two suburbs were built between 1921 and 1930
