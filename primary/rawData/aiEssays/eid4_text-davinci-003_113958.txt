This closing line serves as a metaphor for the narrator's academic and personal growth. She has experienced a difficult winter, with snow and frigid temperatures. The winter hibiscus has also been affected by the cold weather, appearing dead and dull. However, the narrator is optimistic that it will soon bloom once the snows melt and the geese return. This is representative of her hope for a new season, a new beginning, and improved results should she attempt the test again. By ending the story with this line, Ho symbolizes that life is cyclical and that, although past experiences were difficult, a new and brighter future is possible.
