I believe that censorship of materials in libraries might be more effective than restricting and restricting reading."

In addition, I would add that I find "the lack of clarity or awareness of this issue creates an important challenge to any free speech-based regulation. It is very disturbing that there appears to be so little attention paid to critical speech, including those found critical of the president, government, government organizations, and national political parties." Thus, it is a problem for academic and cultural organizations that simply want to publish scholarly material. However, in some case it can be an encouraging finding of how critical scholarly materials matter, even if it may be hard for professors and students to read and keep up.

I also believe that "the lack of attention paid to the issue can hinder attempts to use such materials," particularly those where it could "influence how many academic articles are published that are actually based on research found in the U.S., or how many people are actively involved in the work."

Lastly, if the Supreme Court rules that the "free speech" label should be removed from books, I would consider whether universities could make use of the "fair use" standard once again in future academic papers, as well as to clarify how it can be applied to other types of educational research.

I hope that this post serves as a basis for further discussion about how to treat critical online material. As always, I would highly welcome your critiques, comments and suggestions in the comments section
