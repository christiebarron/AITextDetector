To the Editor:

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects of computers on people. While technology serves a great purpose, there is no denying that our societyâ€™s over-reliance on computers can have some serious consequences.

To begin, computers are taking away important skills from humanity. Education is being focused more and more towards the development of computer and coding skills, instead of skills like communication, problem solving, and critical thinking. We should be focusing on developing these essential skills in our future generations.

Another effect of computers is how they are impacting our mental health. Too often, people are too caught up in the virtual world and not enough in the physical world. Our mental health is suffering as a result. We need to be aware of this issue, and take steps to promote healthy behaviors and discourage overuse of computers and the internet.

Finally, computers are causing us to become increasingly dependent on machines. We need to remember that the computer is a tool and use it in a responsible and healthy manner. We should be using computers to supplement our lives, not completely rely on them.

With this in mind, I urge readers to consider the ways in which computers are impacting our lives, and take steps to reduce any negative consequences. We should strive to be smart and responsible users of technology.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
