I remember when I first started dating my now-husband. We were both a bit shy and awkward around each other, and it took us a few dates before we really started to becomes comfortable with each other. 

One night, we decided to try a comedy club together. We weren’t sure if it was going to be a good idea or not, but we figured it was worth a shot. We weren’t expecting much, but were instantly in stitches when the first comedian took the stage. 

Every joke he told seemed to get funnier and funnier and before we knew it, we were both laughing so hard we could barely catch our breath. It felt like we had a special bond then - a shared connection over humor and laughter that connected us more than anything had before. 

From then on, we started telling each other jokes and funnying stories more often, amusement often unlocking the doors to deeper conversations and a deeper understanding of each other. Laughter became a major force in bringing us closer together and cementing our bond. 

It’s been a few years now since that night at the comedy club, and the laughter continues to bring us closer together like nothing else can. Whenever we’re feeling a bit distanced from each other, a few funny stories help bridge the gap and connects us once again.
