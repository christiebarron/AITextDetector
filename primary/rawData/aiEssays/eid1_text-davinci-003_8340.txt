I was at the grocery store one day and the line was unbelievably long. It didn't help that the cashier was incredibly slow too. I was getting impatient, wanting to get to my car and go home. I could feel my patience wearing thin, but then I noticed the the elderly gentleman in line in front of me. His hands were shaking and he seemed to be having difficulty digging through his wallet for his money. He was struggling to see the cashier and handed her a twenty dollar bill after counting it out multiple times. He then started to fumble through all of his change, making no motion to count it He seemed embarrassed and uncomfortable with the situation, so I stepped up to the register and told him to keep his change. 

The elderly gentleman was so grateful and thanked me profusely for my patience. He even thanked the cashier for being patient with him, which not many people would have done. Seeing the simple gesture of his kindness touched me. I was reminded that it was important to stay patient, no matter how hard it may be, and I felt humbled that I had the opportunity to practice this lesson.
