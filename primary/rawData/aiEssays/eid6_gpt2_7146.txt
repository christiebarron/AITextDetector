The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The original plan recommended an aluminum frame that would touched a plane (for example, an airplane, or a vehicle). When the new plan was announced, the final cost of the structure was determined by a test launch with 100 feet high mirrors. Because of the difficulty inherent in building verticals, most aircraft are built with only 100 feet or less of vertical height. The reason, according to this study, is the building is so fragile that it cannot be used up with lightening.
