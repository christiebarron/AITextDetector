I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a violation of our First Amendment rights. I understand that, but I'd be more concerned if the authorities wanted to prevent the distribution of illegal material, to remove a poster for a terrorist organization in the United States from an English school and to allow terrorist groups in China to disseminate literature on the grounds that the U.S. had placed it in its library. To be sure, such a censorship may cause harm to a well-run local library, I've written before about the restrictions on censorship before (and they may exist at other locations, too). But if this were to happen, and a group took control of our libraries and put one of our most beloved collections in a national archive, that would cause far too much harm to the library and its patrons. So, with those points in mind, I respectfully request that the Department of Education make an open letter to the Director of the Library at the Institute of International Affairs of the United States urging the Secretary to consider whether he or she would allow libraries in the State of California to be put in the possession of the United States Postal Service to distribute material deemed offensive if printed in a national archive outside California and if placed in the possession of other U.S. government offices and for reasons related to this Administration.
