In Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead," the setting plays a key role in the cyclist's journey. The main character, Ray, embarks on a three-day solo bike tour to get away from the demands of everyday life. The rural setting of mountains, forests, and small towns enhances his experience and serves as a backdrop for his own personal discovery.

The rugged terrain of the mountains is a major challenge for Ray. He must climb one steep hill after another, testing his limits and pushing his endurance to its furthest limits. His determination is admirable as he fights against the inclines and descents of the mountain trails. The forest provides Ray with some respite from his arduous climbs; its trees, dense foliage, and quiet nature allow Ray to find peace.

The small towns along the way give Ray a chance to rest and allows him to meet some locals. The people he encounters teach him important lessons about living life to the fullest in spite of trying times. Ray also takes great pleasure in the small comforts the towns offer; the simple cafes, warm beds, and hot meals near the end of his journey give him the energy and comfort he needs to make it through the last leg.

The rural setting of Joe Kurmaski’s story plays a large part in Ray’s journey. Its harsh terrain is both a test and a teacher for him, and its serene beauty serves to restore his energy. The
