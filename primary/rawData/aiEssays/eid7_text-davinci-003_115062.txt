I remember the day when I had to babysit my younger cousin for the weekend because their parents were away. It was going to be a huge challenge considering I had never done it before. But, I was determined to keep my cool and take care of her no matter what happened.

At first, she was quite shy with me and didn’t want to interact. We were sitting in the living room together when she started to slowly open up to me when I showed her a few of my old toys. As our conversation went on, she shared with me why she felt so scared and insecure. 

I remained patient and understanding, and I could tell she felt at ease. I also had to be better at understanding her wants and needs, so we went out for a walk, ran around the backyard, and even took some pictures together. 

By the end of the day, she was smiling and laughing so much. It was amazing to watch her relax and ultimately trust me. I was content knowing that by being patient and taking my time, I was able to create a bond with my younger cousin I wouldn’t have obtained in any other way.
