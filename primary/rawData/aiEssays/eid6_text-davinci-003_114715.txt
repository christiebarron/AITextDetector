The building of the majestic Empire State Building was an unparalleled feat of engineering, but many people do not realize the unique problems that had to be overcome in order for the building to accommodate lighters-than-air dirigibles. In her book The Mooring Mast, Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted gives an insight into the complex process of building the mast and the docking area that would support dirigibles, and the obstacles that had to be faced in the process. 

First of all, the Empire State Building had to be designed around the mooring mast. The mast was built on the observation tower on the 102nd floor of the building and had to be outfitted with several wind turbines. This required the integration of a specific type of airship into the design that the engineers had never before encountered. Another challenge was the tight schedule; the building had to be completed in only 13 months, presenting a significant challenge with multiple components. 

The mast itself had to be exceptionally strong. Building the mast involved the use of several thick cables and special anchor points. The platform also had to be designed using the latest materials available in order to be able to take the weight of the dirigible. As sturdiness and stability of the mast was crucial in order to avoid accidents, the engineering and fabrication team had to test for vibration, thrift, wind force, and bounce capabilities. The mast also had to be connected to the building in order to provide stability
