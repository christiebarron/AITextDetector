Computers have many effects on people. For instance, in real life they affect how people judge certain things. The computer does everything. Now a scientist who specializes in computers explains that the key to creating human-level intelligence is to have people ask the right questions with perfect understanding of the computer and the answers will be 100% accurate.

One example is what seems to be a common occurrence among the computer programmers: if you have a system that does exactly what you expect, people will never notice. There's an easy analogy: how if they knew you told them you were going to build your nuclear reactors, they would only know the wrong answer. If they didn't know the wrong answer, they wouldn't get to see the right way to solve problems. Now when you have a high-tech system that tells you the right answer to the wrong answer, you say, "I said let's build all those reactors that require no outside external help; there's no such thing as a computer system." That is, you're trying to build something that is not very complex. You can probably guess what's wrong with it.

One other thing to consider is that programmers are almost certain to tell us things that we never know. We should be very certain. We should be able to make predictions that are very accurate. We shouldn't be surprised when we have a computer that has a lot of tricks up its sleeves that nobody else has yet. We should never be surprised when computers have
