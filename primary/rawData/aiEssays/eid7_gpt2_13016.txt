An example of a time someone in my life was patient was her friend who was working on music video for a radio show. The episode that we were doing at our home was 'The Turdle'. Everyone thought it was going to be a good song. And the thing is, we knew how the show was going to play out. It wasn't a good show at the time but we knew it would be good but it would be bad. I thought about whether it's good enough or not. It was one of those songs that really kind of got stuck. We all felt good about the music and the whole thing. But there was also the fact that it wasn't going to be as great as some people had hoped. It was a really difficult thing to make a record. For some reason we couldn't get used to being recorded at the same time. So we were all kind of scared to do this job. So now I think the best things I've ever done were trying to get people to listen to the material.

Now we're in the final stages of this thing. The next step is getting people to be able to understand what people really think and express them. The best way to do that is by making these songs that people get really into and not giving them time to think all day. That kind of stuff is the most difficult.

The first thing I'd like to do is to take people to a song called 'My Heart Will Not Stop'.
