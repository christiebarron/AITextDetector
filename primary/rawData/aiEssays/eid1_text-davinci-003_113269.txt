Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people.

It is undeniable that the introduction of computers into our everyday lives has been a major factor in improving efficiency, providing convenience, and helping us do more with less. In addition, computers have enabled us to do tasks that were impossible without them in the past. They help make or save time and money, allowing us to focus on more important matters.

However, there are some drawbacks to the presence of computers in our lives. Firstly, too much dependence on computers may lead to a lack of creative thinking or problem-solving skills. People may also be more prone to being sedentary, due to the increasingly deskbound nature of many jobs. Finally, increased usage of electronic devices may lead to straining of the eyes, headaches, and neck and shoulder pains.

It is important to be aware of these effects when utilising computers. It is also important to remember that computers should be integrated into our lives thoughtfully, in order to increase efficiency and convenience without sacrificing our physical and mental health.

I strongly believe that if we use computers judiciously, they can do wonders for us in terms of progress and convenience. I hope readers can agree with me and realise the importance of using computers sensibly.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
