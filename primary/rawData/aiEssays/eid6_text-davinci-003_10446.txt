The Empire State Building has long been a symbol of success and innovation. Its completion in 1931 marked a major engineering achievement and signaled the arrival of New York City as a major global city. Its ambition was to make it the tallest building in the world, something it succeeded in that year. But beyond the headline-grabbing height of the building, one of the biggest engineering challenges the Empire State Building’s team of architects and engineers faced involved incorporating the ability to accommodate the docking of dirigibles.

As indicated in the book, "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the inclusion of a mooring mast featured prominently in the design of the Empire State Building. The mooring mast was included because the building’s owners wanted to be able to accommodate the docking of dirigibles. Incorporating a mast in the building’s design posed a number of significant engineering challenges. Firstly, the mast itself had to be mounted at a height of 1,472 feet, the tallest point of the building. This presented the team with a number of difficulties such as the need to make sure the mast could withstand the wind forces at that height and the need to take into account the effects of the mast’s weight on the building’s structure.

In addition to the height aspect of the problem to be solved, the designers were also faced with the need to install a platform to serve as a docking area
