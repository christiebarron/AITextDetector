I was recently on a family vacation where I got stuck in a long hotel checkout line. Everyone was getting more and more agitated as the minutes turned into hours and we still hadn't been served. Everyone was getting quite angry and I could feel the tension in the air.

At one point, I decided that it might help to take some deep breaths and be patient. So, I just relaxed, smiled, and tunes out the other people's grumbling. I promised myself to keep calm no matter how long it took.

Eventually, it worked - the line started to move faster. The people around me also seemed to have calmed down, noticing my attitude of serenity. Before long, we had all been checked out and on our way.

I'm happy to report that the patience I showed in the hotel lobby was well worth it - my family had a wonderful, stress-free vacation!
