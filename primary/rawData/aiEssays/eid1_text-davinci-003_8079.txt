The idea of building the Empire State Building with a mooring mast to allow dirigibles to dock was a grandiose concept proposed by the Empire State Building Company in 1930. Though it was an ambitious feat, it was plagued with a number of barriers and challenges that the builders had to overcome. 

The first obstacle the builders faced was the limited technical knowledge on mooring mast design. At the time, the science around airship docking infrastructure and design was still relatively unknown. For this reason, designing a mooring mast to successfully accommodate the massive size and weight of a dirigible proved to be a difficult task. Additionally, the existing building had to be modified to make it both lightweight and strong enough to support the dirigible.

The second obstacle was cost. The price tag for a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was estimated to be around $1 million. This was a huge amount of money for the 1930s and building the mooring mast was considered a considerable financial risk by the Empire State Building Company, who had to determine if the economic benefit from allowing dirigibles to dock could cover the large construction and operation costs.

The final barrier was legal action. Although the idea of a mooring mast was appealing, the builders of the Empire State Building had to worry about a number of potential safety risks it could bring. The most important legal obstacle was the potential danger of airplane collisions with dirigibles while they
