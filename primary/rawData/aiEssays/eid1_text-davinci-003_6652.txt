Dear Editor, 

I am writing to express my view on the effects that computers have had on people. With the ever-growing presence of technology in our lives, it is impossible to deny its impact. 

Computers have made access to information more efficient than ever before. By a few clicks, anyone can find answers to complex questions in seconds. Something that might have taken days or even weeks of research used to be resolved almost instantly. Also, they have created employment opportunities and enabled innumerable businesses that would have been impossible without the introduction of computers.

Despite these advantages, I believe computers can have potentially negative effects on people. We are spending too much time in front of our screens, developing unhealthy habits such as limited physical exercise and poor eating, and missing out on many meaningful interactions. The continuous exposure to virtual interactions has become almost inseparable from our lives and sometimes, instead of forming meaningful relationships, people use them as a replacement.

For all these reasons, I think it is important that computers be used wisely by implementing the right regulations and supervising the amount of time spent in front of screens. I believe that when used properly, computers can have a positive impact on our everyday lives instead of becoming a distraction.

Sincerely, 
[Your name]
