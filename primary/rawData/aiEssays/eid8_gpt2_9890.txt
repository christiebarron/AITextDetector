One time I experienced laughter in my life was when she had a baby who was getting more and more mature. She has a really strong sense of humor. When I got to her I was really excited because I thought I'd be in love with her. I was very happy. Our daughter had not gotten a lot of media coverage when she was at home for the holidays so we were thinking about going out and seeing how we would feel when she was home.

I am looking forward to meeting her againâ€¦I hope that she is ready and willing to have children in the future.

I am in love with my wife, and we all love her. We love all the children together and I want everyone to have a great time together.

I am looking forward to meeting my son. My wife is just a beautiful young lady.

We really appreciate the love, attention to detail, and the kindness of strangers.

I'm very grateful for the wonderful gifts you give to each of you. Thank you for visiting this past December, and keep giving back and making it happen.

I also want to thank you for sharing the joys and dreams we shared together. Thank you producing so many great videos of my life. I want to do a lot more together. I want to continue to tell more stories of how I had to take it with me and see how everything works out for myself and my family. Thank you so much for sharing these moments and
