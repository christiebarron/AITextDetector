The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first of these was that they only took two spaces, as was required to allow such small elevators. The second was that the second space was occupied only for certain cargo transportation. Some cargo transport was necessary, as opposed to just one. In a city like Seattle, they found a way around all that, using only one of those dimensions.
