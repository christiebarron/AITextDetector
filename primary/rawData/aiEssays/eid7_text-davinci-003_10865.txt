I remember one time when I was in line at the grocery store. It was the weekend and there was a huge rush of people. Everyone was talking loudly and pushing their carts around. I was waiting at the one checkout lane that had a long line. Despite the long wait time and all of the commotion, I remained patient. 

I realized that a lot of the people in the store were out of their comfort zone. Everyone was tired from a long workday and getting ready for the week. I kept my cool and didn't rush the customers in front of me. 

At one point, the checker experienced some technical difficulties. The customer she was ringing up was having issues with their payment. The customer seemed to be getting increasingly frustrated. As I watched the situation with the customer unfold, I silently resolved to remain patient. I reminded myself that it was their lucky day that I was there and had the patience to deal with the situation. 

I must have made an impression, because once the customer had resolved all their issues, they turned to me and thanked me for my patience. That little act of kindness felt nice. From then on, I was even more determined to stay patient and understanding when situations were out of my control.
