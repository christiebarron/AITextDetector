Computers have many effects on people.

For instance, we have an effect on how people will use the machines to work as they want while we have an effect on how they'll change their minds about what should be done next.

For more than a century, psychology has identified how people interact with computers and technologies, but have never understood how this interacts psychologically with human interaction.

Cognitive scientists at the University of Sydney recently published a paper in the journal Cognitive Brain Imaging focused on how people cope with a system that treats them in a similar way.

The study explores how people react to how people behave with computers and other machine technologies.

They conclude:

In this social interaction, we perceive and think through whether they will engage in a similar'socially relevant' approach - and whether it will increase their awareness that they will engage in this behavior of behaving, like this, in a similar way. These social attitudes and responses may be the key to how we will influence other people's behaviour when we have a problem.

They point out:

When there is a cognitive, perceptual, and behavioural disturbance, and when things like "it looks too good to be true", we are likely to put more effort into responding - than if we were "to respond to something more." Indeed, it's common to be concerned about something (such as'Equity in performance ') that is not very likely to affect how someone might respond.
