The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. One of the main issues was the precariousness of the terrain due to being located in the middle of a busy city. The Empire State Building was an enormous structure that reached more than 80 stories into the sky, and this posed a specific concern for those working to bring the dirigibles in to dock.

The first obstacle was the logistics of how to safely attach the mooring mast to the Empire State Building at such an elevated height. Engineers needed to not only determine a suitable grip for the mast, but also make sure that it could bear the force of a large airship. The fragile nature of dirigibles posed a unique challenge, as it was essential that the mast be able to survive any turbulence brought on by sudden winds while the airships attempted to dock. With the danger of potential destruction from the airships rupturing the mast, it was clear that special care would need to be taken in protecting the structure.

One of the biggest hurdles that the crew had to overcome was accommodating the wind gusts that often occurred in the area. In order to address this challenge, a special ballasting system was designed that used water tanks to provide for the necessary stability while operating on the mast. This allowed the airships to dock more safely since they were better able to handle the unpredictable gusts of wind that were common in the area.

In addition to the
