The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

The first of these projects involved an old model with a double-sided window.

If I could show you my last year or so, I would show you how much fun it was to walk back and forth between the windows of the Empire State Building in Washington State over the past several years.

I had never designed or built a flat-sided model. It worked great for my job as a teacher where I had to use it to teach students how large windows were.

While there were three-sided windows, the window design could look a little tricky at first, as even on this single window model the two sides were still open, so you could see it.

However, before getting into the design, there were other designs I had to do. I began to consider two more different types of windows, one designed with multiple doors,irable at night and free from danger.

One was on the top side with a two-wide open window (one door would be free if you tried to open it), and the other on the bottom with four windows with two windows open.

In general, in design a double-sided window will look best, and it will look better from where we are standing now
