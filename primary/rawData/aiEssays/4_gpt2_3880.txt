The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because the narrator brings up his role in the story, the time of an entire world, and he is the same time as Melisandre, the Night Mother. When Melisandre sees me making out in the city and says, "I love you, I love you," it's a very emotional, very important message to her about the reality and reality of her life." There's not much I can say here about Melisandre except, "I'm not happy with him."

So Melisandre is not very happy or that's a problem. But she is happy, and when that's the case, she realizes that her life was filled with pain and despair for four months. When these things occur, she realizes that she has no other choice but to choose her own life. She's been ― through so much grief, a lot of loss, a lot of grief ― for three months now. That's why when I was writing the book, there's a lot of writing about her. She's not happy; she's upset. I am upset that she's not happy because it's a real problem. If I had written something as good as this book, if I had written a piece as good as this book, it would have been a lot better.
