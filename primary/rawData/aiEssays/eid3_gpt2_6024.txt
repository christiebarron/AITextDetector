Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

Rough road ahead is in place when cyclists are walking or cycling up and down the road rather than in straight or uneven ground. It is in very small areas and the impact is minimal.

But on roads where riding a bike is restricted for safe pedestrian walking distances, many times those are in places where bikes are usually allowed and cyclists are very busy, such as where on the road at night.

The more riders an organisation is involved in, the larger the effects of rough road ahead may be.

Rough roads ahead impacts: What they mean and what they can do

Travelling from one road to another (unlike riding a bike), from one road to another is considered a safe way to go without causing any significant injury or disruption.

It means it can be a "good place" for someone to be, but not as good of an athlete, a cyclist or as safe as a taxi.

The risk of serious injury is also reduced if it involves stopping on the road ahead, driving past a fence with a crossrail (a fence which you place between one or both of the cyclists to allow for crossway access), going past pedestrians and motorists, and trying to pass another cyclist onto the road ahead, or trying to use the road ahead to get through other traffic.

To understand this risk, consider the following.
