The issue of censorship in libraries is one that is hotly debated among those in the literary world. On one hand, censorship can be seen as a necessary precaution against offensive materials that might be damaging to younger audiences, and on the other, banning certain materials can have a chilling effect on free expression. Ultimately, libraries should practice prudence in their decisions, making sure only to remove materials that are truly offensive and that have no redeeming educational value. 

Certainly, certain materials should be removed from library shelves if there is a legitimate reason to do so. Anything that is sexually explicit, excessively violent, or downright hateful should have no place in a library. The library is a place of learning and exploration, and should not be a repository for materials that would be deemed unsuitable for adolescents. 

Still, censorship of materials should be undertaken with extreme caution. Libraries should be places of open access to all kinds of information, both good and bad. Unfortunately, attempts at censoring certain materials often end up having a negative effect on the availability of certain literature, art, or other shared expression. Banning even a handful of materials can cause further materials to be silenced. 

Moreover, materials deemed offensive by some are often seen as enriching works of literature by others. What one person finds abhorrent may be a primary source of inspiration for somebody else. To censor materials simply because certain individuals find them offensive is to deny the existence of diversity in our society.
