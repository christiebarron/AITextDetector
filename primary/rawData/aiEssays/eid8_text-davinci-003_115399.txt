I was running late for work, but still had to stop and get a cup of coffee from my favorite corner cafe. When I opened the door, the bell above the door sounded, alerting the barista of my arrival. As soon as he saw me, he burst into laughter. 

At first, I was a bit startled, and then began to smile. I asked him what was so funny, and he said it was my outfit. Apparently he had never seen anyone in the same outfit two days in a row. He thought it was pretty hilarious, and I couldn't help but laugh.

At first I was self-conscious, but then I realized why it had been so funny â€“ it was unexpected! I had a good laugh with him and his fellow baristas about my outfit. 

The laughter was a great way to get to know each other better and break the tension. We talked and joked for a few minutes before I got my coffee and went to work. I will always remember the fun time we had, and how he was willing to take the time to have a laugh with a first-time customer.  Laughter is a powerful, yet seemingly effortless, way to create an immediate connection with someone, and I'm so glad it happened!
