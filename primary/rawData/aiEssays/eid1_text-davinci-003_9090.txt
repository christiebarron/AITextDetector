Dear Editor,

I am writing in regard to the effects computers have had on our lives. I feel strongly that computers have had some positive effects as well as some detrimental ones.

On the positive side, computers have revolutionized the way we work and access information. It has become so much easier to do research or collaborate on projects with colleagues, as technology brings us closer together. We are also able to find quicker solutions to problems, as computers can assist with calculations and other processes.

On the other hand, I believe that computers have posed some disadvantages. For example, spending too much time on our computers can lead to loneliness, depression, stress, and physical health problems such as back pain and eye strain. Additionally, we can become too reliant on computers to do our work, meaning that weâ€™re not relying on ourselves anymore.

I am sure that many readers will agree that computers have helped us in many ways, but at the same time, we should be careful to not let them take over our lives. We have to find a balance between using them for their positive advantages, and avoiding the potential harm that can come from overuse. 

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
