It was so funny that it took me until I went to try and tell her something really, really bad about her. (Because how you talk about yourself doesn't always mean you are going to actually say it.) For some reason I didn't take it very seriously; it was very personal. And that was before I ever mentioned myself. So it bothered me to know that in her life I was talking about Christian views. I was very happy that she could not be alone because she was a Christian. It was so funny. I don't know if she can handle that now.

She looked me way, and said, "I really want to be a Christian, so I want to write. Do you want me to write? It's not really me to keep writing
