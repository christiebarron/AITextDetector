Dear Editor, 

I am writing to express my strong stance on censorship in libraries. Libraries should not be places of censorship, but should instead serve as havens for educational discovery and exploration. 

One of the core values of libraries is to provide access to information of all kinds to their patrons. Whether it is novels, non-fiction, music, videos, or magazines, it is the library’s job to provide content which will help to expand the education of their visitors. Censorship of materials can limit learning opportunities and the scope of content available for patrons. 

At times, there are materials deemed offensive that should be censored, such as books with hate speech or violent imagery. But I believe that even “offensive” material should still be available in libraries and come with a warning carefully placed in the card catalog. Libraries should be open forums of conversation and exchange, not places of censorship. Libraries should provide clear language in their catalogs for librarians to explain how context is important when looking at provocative and challenging material.

In sum, libraries should embrace the power of learning and offer free access to an array of materials, even if they are deemed offensive. Libraries should offer clear warnings to patrons and educate the public on the importance of context in literature. Censorship is a dangerous practice, and should not be allowed in the library. 

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
