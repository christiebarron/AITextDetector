The Empire State Building was built in the 1930s and was initially designed to allow dirigibles to dock, a feature that made the building truly unique. Unfortunately, due to a variety of obstacles, the dream of docking dirigibles at the building was never realized. In her book "The Mooring Mast," Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted explains the difficulties the builders faced in allowing dirigibles to dock.

One of the most significant obstacles to allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was that the building was too tall. Dirigibles require overhead clearance of at least 150 feet, which was much taller than the Empire State Building. The city of New York was simply not organized to build anything higher than the building, which blocked the docking of dirigibles. 

Another obstacle to allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was that the building was also not tall enough to clear obstructions such as buildings or power lines. While a dirigible might be able to pass over a structure without hitting it, it would not have enough height to moor securely to the Empire State Building. 

In addition, the building was located in a densely populated area and did not have enough open space for an airship to maneuver safely before docking. This presented yet another obstacle that the builders of the building would have had to figure out if they wanted to allow dirigibles to dock. Even if the area had enough open space,
