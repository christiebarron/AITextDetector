The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' by Uma Thurman has been to break away from the clich√©d tale of a troubled family and to turn the attention to a more real-world, human-and-wanted life. The main difference coming from Thurman's book is the fact it is largely in a way a memoir about the lives of the various figures in the American political machine working through the early 19th century. Thurman takes place in the days and the middle of the 1850s and begins his autobiographical story of his own childhood in a local suburb of New avant-garde New York. The mood set in the memoir and by the author's choice of time and place in his memoir is somewhat inarguable. The mood is also somewhat self-referential as he attempts to define the "political" reality of the times. The general tone of the book is that political forces at large have made bad decisions and that it was only a matter of time before the American political machine was set free from the constraints of a rigid political framework, a political framework which might very well have existed at any point in time beyond 1844. There is another issue here which would explain many of my objections towards the book. Thurman's narration in this novel is almost entirely absent from the book but all of his writing has been written from his personal perspective. His focus is a political perspective, not of his own in this novel but rather by others in the series
