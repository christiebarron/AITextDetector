In Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead," the cyclist is directly affected by the features of the setting. The first element of the setting that affects the cyclist is the time of year. Since it is fall, the cyclist is battling cold and unpredictable weather conditions. Moreover, the climate presents a unique set of hazards, including wet leaves and the potential for sudden snowfall. The cyclist is not only affected by the weather but also the landscape. The rugged terrain of the roads is unforgiving and provides a constant challenge for the cyclist. The roads are full of sharp turns, narrow pathways, and steep inclines that require a great deal of skill and care to navigate. 

Furthermore, the cyclist is affected by the conditions of the roads. The roads are filled with potholes, rocks, and other debris that can be hazardous for a cyclist. The cyclist must be constantly aware of their surroundings in order to negotiate these obstacles. Moreover, the roads are unpaved, creating a bumpy and uncomfortable ride. The cyclist is forced to be vigilant in order to avoid potential disasters. 

Ultimately, the setting of "Rough Road Ahead" affects the cyclist in multiple ways. From weather and terrain to road conditions, the cyclist must be prepared for any challenge that they may face. The setting serves to challenge the cyclist in multiple ways, and ultimately test their skill, endurance, and courage.
