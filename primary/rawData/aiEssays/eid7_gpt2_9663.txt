An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was growing up in New York and I heard the news that my sister and I were going to be having our fourth wedding anniversary. That made some of you even call me from that year. That is just heartbreaking.

Why did you feel you were just being the one in time and not the last?

My mom was like, "Are you serious?" And her response was: "Well, I'm going to stay home and let them celebrate with me." And so she was like, "Oh, yeah, I love him. I'm in love with him. I'm going to let him do his business." And she was like, "No. I want us to show up when he's doing. I want to see him do his job." And so2013 was so awesome for me. I was able to get myself back on a plane. It was just awesome.

With the birth of their second daughter, do you feel you lost her that day? Was it just a personal decision, or did you see her as something that you might not know about until that moment?

Her mom didn't hold the same faith that I hold. I feel like there's this incredible amount of love and empathy I've never felt, and it's really cool that someone was allowed to do that because I feel like it gave me a step forward for the rest of my life.
