I’ll always remember the time I shared with my best friend while we were making dinner. We were both busy in the kitchen, each of us tackling a different task. My best friend was chopping up vegetables while I was making a salad. We were both working hard, but in the middle of it all, we couldn’t help but find humor in our situation. 

My best friend pointed out that the carrots she was chopping up looked like pieces of wood that we’d be putting on the dinner plate, and soon enough we were both close to tears from laughing. We joked about how if we weren’t careful, the carrots might actually grow into little trees on our plates. That’s when I knew it was time to take a break, so I reached over and gave my friend a hug, taking a moment to appreciate our close friendship.

Despite all of the work that had to be done to get our dinner ready, that moment of laughter brought us even closer together and made the kitchen come alive. As we cooked, we shared stories, laughed and sang along to songs. In the end, we got our dinner ready, but more importantly, we had an amazing time together. Laughter can be a powerful thing, and that moment in the kitchen affirmed once again how laughter can bring people closer.
