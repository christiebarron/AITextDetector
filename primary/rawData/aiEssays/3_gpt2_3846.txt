For the most part the cyclists were able to take the time to use their brakes properly.

How to Set the Distance Ahead

As explained previously, the average distance traveled by any cyclist in 'The Great Ride' has always been under 25 miles, although when the distance exceeded the limit in a number of years (at one point) over the years (late 1950s to early 1960s) the average distance experienced could be in the range -30-40 miles and for some reason at some point had gone up. At any rate the average distance for cyclists is very close to the range of the British average - but it depends on many factors, some of which have nothing to do with speed. There have been quite a few technical problems such as the number of hills andangle of the road but that does not have anything to do with the overall distance traveled.
