An example of a time someone in my life was patient was watching a documentary. The filmmakers say it was really interesting because the women who were trying to talk about the issue went on to appear in other news programs who weren't interested in talking about the issues as anything other than "feminist." At one point someone yelled "You know what?" and she said there were only two sides. I'm going to give that one a try. But for this particular time, I think it really took off. I felt like a great teacher and an incredible person.

The interview is also the first time the two have spoken on the show together.

Yes, I was very uncomfortable with both of us. I would say I was a little ashamed of my own past that I probably couldn't tell you any more. This is a very weird time for people, but I always said that for most people, the other thing that was so hard to hear when I heard it was that I felt really embarrassed for my past. But I think it was really important that I was doing this kind of good work.
