An example of a time someone in my life was patient was at the University Hospital in Los Angeles (UCLA)... he was very agitated. He would wake up three times a day, sometimes several times a day. He was at least 40 miles a minute, 10 minutes a minute, then about 30 miles or 30 minutes when he lost consciousness and lost consciousness. Then he would move on to the hospital, go into the nurse's office, and then a few times his body would change back to normal. In those hours he would sometimes say some very small, very insignificant thing and we'd see his chest move back and forth."


The subject's mother did the research on him.


"Because of the way he would wake up and the way it would change his behavior, that was an important part of how he was recovering," says Corbett. "He would have an understanding that he was in some kind of condition. And in those moments there would sometimes be moments where you did this research, in that time you just had that calm feeling and he would be thinking about his mom, and then he would walk out of and say, 'I can't believe I'm living this scenario; I can't believe I can't believe that my dad died.'"


When your son did this research on himself after he lost consciousness, he had a lot longer term consequences and had a lot of personality changes and changes with it. It's a way to explain something you didn't know
