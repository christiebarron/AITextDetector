One time I experienced laughter in my life was when you walked across a stage and said: "Good. I don't want to get into that here. It would offend youâ€¦" Well you will be sure to hear them again.

In my opinion, laughter is the opposite of the "the wrong attitude does not contribute to joy" mentality (Rauh, 2011). When it comes to social media, laughing alone feels uncomfortable or unnatural.

Nowadays we can look at this in a very simple way. It really does not feel right to feel upset if someone says "good". It doesn't mean it's bad. But it does mean it's not okay.
