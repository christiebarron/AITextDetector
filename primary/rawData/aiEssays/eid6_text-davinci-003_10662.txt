The Empire State Building was constructed between 1930 and 1931, and from its opening day there was a grand ambition that dirigibles could dock at the top of the building. This feat was to be achieved by installing a 200-foot high ‘mooring mast’ that would provide landing points for dirigibles. However, the undertaking proved to be difficult, due to a number of obstacles the builders faced.

The first challenge was creating a secure attachment point. The construction team needed to work out how to build a complex steel cable system that would be able to house and moor the large and delicate airship. This was complicated by the need to minimise the amount of structure exposed to the elements, to prevent rusting and other weather-related damage. After a lot of trial and error, a system of two rows of steel cables was established, though it failed to meet the desired tension and strength requirements.

Another obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome was the sheer expense of the project. The mooring mast and its cables were expensive to construct, and the airships needed to be able to dock safely and securely. To ensure this, modifications had to be made to the face of the building, adding giant curved fairing plates that allowed airships to land safely. Despite the tremendous cost, the builders decided to press ahead with the dirigible docking plan and the mooring mast was completed in April 1931.
