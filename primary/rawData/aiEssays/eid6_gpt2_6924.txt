The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Unlike many of the other buildings in the city of Shanghai, the first of which would eventually be demolished by the city government in 1978, the Imperial Palace has been preserved in good condition and is being used as an educational base after the Great Cultural Revolution and then when it is completed in 2000.


However, the other buildings within the palace courtyard and the first on Chai River, which will be built soon, have not yet been completed. However, they can be built within the framework of the Empire State Building if their construction should become increasingly challenging. The Empire State Building building could have more than 1000 rooms with offices, and each of these could have its own private suites of two or more bedrooms.


As of April this year, the second and third Empire State Buildings, which will be opened later this year, are still in the works. Some of the building designs are in progress which may not be completed in the time available to them, such as a public plaza in the courtyard.
