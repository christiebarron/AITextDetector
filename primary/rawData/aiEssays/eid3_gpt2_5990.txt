Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

Firstly, the level of difficulty will increase the cycling capacity of the roadway and reduce collisions. Also, it will make the cycle more difficult to carry, and makes cyclists more prone to damaging collisions with cars and pedestrians.

Secondly, even without specific instructions for how to set a certain speed, some road markings will be so specific that they will not require changing the speed of the cyclist to achieve the desired difference.
, and also, many road markings that give a rider time (and if the rider is able to keep them, will not be visible from the street, nor do they appear when the vehicle is not on) will result in the cyclist not having their speed indicated to the cyclist and not moving to the right, and when a certain speed is set to go the cyclist should be given the choice to move or stop.

Also, the specific speed of certain road markings and their locations on some of the most popular bikes will vary depending on the rider and their situation: some locations will be the least exciting, others will be dangerous, and some locations will be safer for slower, larger and less experienced riders.

I hope that you've asked some of those questions and had your share of discussions about the setting of the road markings along with the 'Rough Road Ahead' setting by the Bicycle Lane Foundation. The advice below was shared on both the Bicycle Lane Foundation website and
