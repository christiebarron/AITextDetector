An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I had a vision impairment and I said, 'Don't go blind,'" Taylor told the Huffington Post. "I went to see the doctor and had five or six eye examinations and it was the only eye you could see, and we all went blind and had to live in a hospital for a month to look at it. And so the only way I could help other people with vision was to go for him to have an appointment."
