The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because there's a bit of everything and I think the book also serves as a reminder of what that sort of writing process sounds like. I'm sure there's room for improvement in there, because you have to go out and write things you understand and appreciate. I'm hoping that the book will also help people remember a time when life was better than it is now. You might also be interested to know that that point in time I'm talking about was really long ago.
