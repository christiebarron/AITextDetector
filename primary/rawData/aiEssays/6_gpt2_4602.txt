The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The construction companies were not allowed to use vehicles which weighed two to four ounces, as well as trucks which weighed three to four ounces. The building's main dock had been fitted with windows that opened to allow passengers to view and feel the building. The other major problem was its design. According to the Star-Ledger, there had been numerous attempts at redesigning it since it was built in 1846 until 1885. Several factors contributed to the development of the Empire State Building. In 1885 Governor George McGovern of Massachusetts, whose grandfather also owned the building, had suggested to the building council that the building be overhauled. While it looked great, a number of architectural improvements were not. The Empire State Building was a three mile long building which would become the largest U.S. building. The building's upper deck is composed of an 11.8 foot broad, 12.1 foot deep, 11 foot deep wall constructed over a large building structure (1760). The wall was finished with a wide section of concrete to support the upper deck. The design of the Empire State Bridge was inspired by the old Northwoods Bridge and utilized a large double-tapped bridge, also known as the Northwood Cross. The bridge would run across an upper deck that would be connected to a north-south north crossway in an existing bridge. The Northwood Cross would link two bridges of the Empire State
