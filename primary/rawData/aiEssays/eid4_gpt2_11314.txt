The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it offers some pretty interesting characters. I wouldn't go to all this trouble, though. First of all, this is not a story about "bad guys" in the past; this is about our new world. I have always been suspicious of those who make up those worlds. I don't believe "bad guys in the future" is a fair characterization or a characterization that's fair to the author. The book is about "bad guys" in the future, and in the past. It's in the nature of the book to deal with its own historical moment at a moment's notice. By giving us an explanation for how and why the "bad guys" really arose, in a way that has nothing to do with the actual stories in this book, I feel I have finally reached the point where I think I really understand all of the things that stand out on their own merits.

But with this review, I've got nothing.
