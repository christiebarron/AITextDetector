The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it can be understood in a different way.

The whole book is an attempt to make sense of the book by having this particular view, the idea of the events taking place in it, taken from one of the classic books of the 20th century, but more recently translated, so that if you read one of those books there might be a different idea to that place, but the overall message is the same.

There are two aspects to this book there.

1. Winter Hibiscus

In the following post I'll discuss how some of the issues raised in the book can be easily reconciled to what's actually happening in the world of Winter Hibiscus.

2. Book of the Great

After finishing the book you'll begin to appreciate how the world and characters in Winter Hibiscus were created. There are a few things that we've not discussed yet. One of these is the character creation process and the nature of magic and magic energy. This is a topic that's been touched upon previously in the book (and may be touched further) as well, but it might be difficult or impossible to summarize here, so here are a few pieces that will help:

Malfurion is only the first character to be created (or is given a choice to become in his final form by being made) in this book

Seedling is the first character to appear
