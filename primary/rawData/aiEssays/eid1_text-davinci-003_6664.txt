Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my opinion on the effects computers have on people. As most of you know, computers are used widely in our society to enhance our ability to work and to expand our knowledge in the ever-changing world. In many ways, computers offer benefits that make our lives easier and more efficient, and they are an invaluable tool in many modern professions.

However, I must express my concern that the frequent use of computers can also have negative effects on people. In particular, I want to draw attention to the physical and mental risks that come with an excessive reliance on computers.

Physically, hours of sitting in front of a computer can have long-term health problems, as well as reduce one's ability to remain active and fit. Moreover, for those who spend their days staring at a digital screen, I have seen firsthand the negative impacts on one's vision, energy levels, and even mood.

I am also concerned about the mental health dangers that come with our computer-driven lifestyles. By spending so much time looking at our computers or smart devices, people are exposed to unhealthy amounts of mental distraction and stimulation. Additionally, this can lead to decreased focus and concentration, which in turn affect our ability to work and learn.

In conclusion, I believe that, while computers are a valuable tool, it is important to exercise moderation in their use. People should be mindful of the real risks that come with excessive technology use
