In this day and age, censorship in libraries and the debate around it is increasingly relevant. Libraries are places in which people acquire knowledge and learn to think freely and independently. Yet, the idea of censorship in these institutions causes much controversy. 

No one should be allowed to deny the public from accessing information or materials found “offensive”. It is difficult to define all that is offensive, for each individual person has a different definition. Even if the offensive material is deemed inappropriate, it should be kept in libraries because it is still important for people to be able to debate and learn from it. 

Censoring material in libraries violates our right to free expression. It may even prevent people from expanding their horizons and exploring other views and opinions. Censorship does not contribute to solutions and constructive conversations. Instead, it overlooks crises and suppresses crucial voices. 

Libraries should be a place of learning where every person has the same access to information. Individuals should not have to resort to censoring materials. Librarians should encourage their patrons to be more open-minded and strive to teach citizens the importance of a democratic society. The public should also be informed about censorship, its negative effects, and how we can prevent it in the future. 

In conclusion, censorship in libraries should not be allowed. Rather, librarians should choose to remain impartial, and their priority should be to permit access to materials for their patrons.
