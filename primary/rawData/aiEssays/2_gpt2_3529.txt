I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is one aspect that is happening with respect to other aspects of our lives."

This is not the first time the UK Library has come under fire for its handling of a series of free books in print. Last year an individual called James Stirling, an editor at the Reading and Science Weekly, found books by Edward Heath as "shouting slogans". The next year a group of the UK National Trusts released a book for children that said "I would never want to be a child and I would never want my children to grow up in a world like this if I were a child".

These incidents have prompted the department of public prosecutions to launch a new review of its policies towards free use of books and films.

This was part of a wider effort to cut the costs of books that are not in use, which the Department for Culture, Media and Sport has also announced.
