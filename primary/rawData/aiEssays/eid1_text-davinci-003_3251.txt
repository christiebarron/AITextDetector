Dear Editor,

In today's world, computers have become increasingly popular. They have developed to be essential tools in almost every facet of life â€“ from the workplace to the classroom. Despite their incredible utility, however, I believe they have had a detrimental effect on people.

On a professional level, computers have made many manual labor jobs obsolete. This leaves thousands of people out of work, unable to find well-paying jobs that can adequately support themselves and their families. On an individual level, computers have caused an increase in sedentary lifestyle habits and a decrease in physical activity. This, in turn, has resulted in an increased risk of diseases like obesity, diabetes and heart problems.

Furthermore, computers have had a profound impact on communication and relationships. With more people spending time on computers, they are wasting away valuable moments that they could be spending with their loved ones, forming strong connections with them. Social media has taken away from real-world socializing, with cyber bullying and online shaming becoming serious issues.

With the above in mind, I urge readers to consider the potentially damaging effects that computers have on people. We must ensure that our technology use does not come at the expense of our well-being.
