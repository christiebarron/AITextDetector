I was walking around the store the other day, not really looking for anything in particular, when I heard a young couple bickering loudly over a purchase they were trying to make. I could tell they were struggling to resolve their dispute, and I didn't want to intervene, so I decided to move to another section of the store.

As I started to walk away, I heard the woman say "Please, can we just be patient and figure this out?" She was clearly trying to stay calm, but I could tell it was difficult for her. Without thinking twice, I stopped and turned around and offered to help. 

The young couple seemed relieved to have an outside opinion, and they were both happy to explain what the problem was. After a few minutes of talking and listening, we were able to come up with a solution that both of them were happy with.I felt pleased to have been patient and help resolve the issue.
