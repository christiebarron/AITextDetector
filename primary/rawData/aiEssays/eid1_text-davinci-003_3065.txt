Dear Editor,

As computer technology continues to evolve, I believe it is increasingly important to consider the effects it has on people — both positive and negative.

At its core, computers have been incredibly helpful in terms of increasing people’s productivity and access to information. Whether you’re a student, professional, or casual user, the abilities and opportunities afforded by computers have proven a valuable asset. The digital age has also come with a host of conveniences, such as online shopping, which have made lives simpler for many people. 

Nevertheless, while computers can make our lives easier, there are a few noteworthy drawbacks that must be taken into account. Staring at a computer screen all day can result in decreased sleep, tired eyes, and strained muscles - hardly a recipe for good physical and mental wellbeing. Digital addictions and disruptions in socializing have also been linked to extended use of technology.

In conclusion, computers have provided a wealth of information and countless opportunities. Utilizing them wisely is key to making the most out of them without suffering hidden consequences. Don’t forget to take a break every once in a while - it will benefit you in the long run.
