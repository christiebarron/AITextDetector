The memoir From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez is one that creates a mood of nostalgia and reflection. Rodriguez looks at the impact his family has had on his life, and how their relationships helped shape his view of the world and the path he would eventually take through it.

The memoir’s mood starts off with warmth and admiration, as Rodriguez reflects on the influence and support his parents gave him, and his extended family. He talks about life in their small town: the church, the people gathering together to laugh and exchange stories, and the comfort of familiar surroundings. This feeling of belonging is something that sticks with Rodriguez even as he grows older and gets established in his career. He speaks fondly of his mother’s cooking and his father’s stories, which filled him with joy and pride.

As Rodriguez looks back, his memoir also conveys moments of sadness and regret. He remembers the times the realities of life intruded upon the familial bliss, like his aunts and uncles having to work multiple jobs or his mother’s struggles with depression. He expresses distress over the rifts that opened in his family as he aged, as siblings moved away and the strong bonds of childhood were lost. 

The mood of From Home is ultimately one of wistful nostalgia, laced with hope and resilience. Despite the hard times, Rodriguez reflects that it was the love of family that sustained him and kept him
