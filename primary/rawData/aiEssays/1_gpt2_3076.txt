Computers have many effects on people.

People become ill if they are sitting with a computer, or even if a computer is doing something illegal. It is known as "conspiracy theories."

"Conspiracy theories [are] things that some people see as out to get us," Dr. O'Reilly said.

The next great way to prevent this type of harm from getting out is by taking preventive precautions.

According to Dr. O'Reilly, taking preventive measures is a fundamental element of all physical research, regardless of whether there are "problems with its implementation, in which case the risk of causing injury to the subject or to children may be belief-based."

"Pregnancy research should not be made a tool for making a moral or other kind of moral judgement about the efficacy of a research activity."

However, because the only "legal" solution which works is a legal one, scientists in the field do not want their way in to an un-legal place. This is because human cells do not create themselves, so they are not natural creatures and it's not at all likely they would be affected by such a method.

Some say they would like to take an experiment to see if it would work.
