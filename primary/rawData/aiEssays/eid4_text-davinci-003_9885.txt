The speaker of the poem is a student who is about to take a test, but is distracted by the beauty of the winter hibiscus outside the window. The student does not think that they will do well on the test. The theme of the poem is the importance of taking time to appreciate the beauty of nature, as the student promises to take time and appreciate the hibiscus when it blooms again in spring before they take the test again. The ending of the poem is a reminder to slow down and take time to appreciate nature, rather than rushing through life.
