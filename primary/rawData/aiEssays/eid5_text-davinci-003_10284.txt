In From Home: the Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a bittersweet, introspective atmosphere throughout the book. Through vivid descriptions, Rodriguez paints a portrait of his own personal journey and how his experiences have shaped him. The memoir opens with memories of his beloved mother, detailing her courage and strength in the face of adversity. He speaks of the childhood home that he shared with his family, describing it as a refuge. It is here, not only physically, but also emotionally, that Rodriguez finds his home.

The mood throughout the memoir is reflective and melancholic. In the first half of the memoir, the author reflects on his adolescence, remembering the conflicted emotions of a young boy discovering who he is and where his place is in society. The loneliness and pressures to fit in and just “be cool” that are so typical of coming of age are poignantly described in Rodriguez’s writing. Despite the emotionally heavy memories of his past, there is a sense of hope, of knowing that Rodriguez has come out of his struggles and tribulations a better, wiser person.

The second half of the memoir takes a more hopeful tone as Rodriguez speaks of his successes and how he has been able to create his own sense of home. He emphasizes how throughout his life he has never been one to accept the status quo, and his writing reflects a newfound sense of strength and courage inspired by those he has been surrounded by throughout his life
