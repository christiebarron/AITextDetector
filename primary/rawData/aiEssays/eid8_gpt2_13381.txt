One time I experienced laughter in my life was when someone broke my phone cord. It took a little more effort compared to the last time I had to wait for a year to repair it. That's the only reason I was able to. The phone company does it anyway by having employees at their offices to do it â€“ there's no place for it in the workplace. We don't even have a car to drive to work and they're all very stupid. It costs time and money but there's no way around that. Once you start, one more time, that's not even fair. I had a hard time because my wife had an emergency that night while at the mall. Even though she had to come back, I didn't want to leave any time for her to do that anymore because I still have no money and I just had to wait around for a year before we could talk about this.

I was living in a bubble of debt all by myself. I was working a lot but did not have time to care for myself so I had to sell some stocks. That was the next one as I couldn't find an alternative for me. I was already struggling financially so I didn't want to risk it and put everything I had at risk. I spent most of my free time in my parents home. I could have worked full time but I only do four full pay days. I just had to live like that so that when I would finally get there it would be easier
