I had a friend who was going through some difficult times. She had lost her job and was struggling to make ends meet. Despite her difficult situation, she remained positive and was determined to find another job.

After weeks of searching, she had still not been able to find a job and was understandably feeling frustrated. Instead of giving into her frustration, she tried to be patient and continue the job search.

Eventually, she found a job that suited her well and she was offered the position. She was able to start the job the following week.

I admired my friend's patience during her job search. Despite the difficult situation, her strong will kept her going and eventually led to her success. Her patience and perseverance paid off.
