One time, I was at my local grocery store, waiting in line to check out. As I was standing there, I noticed that the checkout attendant was having some issues with the customer in front of me. I could tell that the customer was getting frustrated because she kept having to re-enter her information for the transaction, and the attendant was doing her best to remain calm and help the customer resolve the issue. 

I was starting to get annoyed myself, as the line was growing longer and the customer was taking her time. But in the back of my mind, I reminded myself to be patient and understand the situation. I decided to take my mind off the wait by scrolling through my phone, and before I knew it, the transaction was complete and I was at the register.

The attendant thanked the customer and then quickly apologized to me for the wait. But before I had the chance to tell her it was no problem, the customer thanked the attendant for her patience, and in that moment, I was reminded of why I chose to remain patientâ€”the attendant had shown so much understanding in a difficult situation and I was grateful to witness it.
