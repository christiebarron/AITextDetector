The construction of the Empire State Building was an incredible feat of engineering in early 20th century Manhattan, but the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock posed an even greater challenge. In order to accommodate the heavier-than-air machines, builders of the Empire State Building needed to devise an innovative solution. One of the primary obstacles that the builders came up against was finding a way to attach a mooring mast to the building without putting too much added strain on the structure. The answer to this problem came in the form of a system devised by property developer Edward Doheny and engineer Squire J. Vickers, known as the “mooring mast”.

The mooring mast was made of a cylindrical steel tube that could reach a height of three hundred feet, fastened to the top of the Empire State Building at its corners. This mast would provide the necessary mooring strength for dirigibles, but it also posed an additional problem in its complexity. The engineers had to figure out a way to make the mast both light and stable enough to prevent the towers from tipping over when the dirigibles docked, while also ensuring that it was structurally sound enough to take on the weight of the airships.

To overcome this challenge, Doheny and Vickers developed an ingenious solution that involved mounting a counterweight at the middle of the mast for stability, attaching the mast to the building itself with several layer of steel cables
