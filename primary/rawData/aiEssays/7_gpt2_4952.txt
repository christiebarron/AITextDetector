An example of a time someone in my life was patient was with his older sister. One Friday morning, after returning from work, my sister took our son for a walk down the street. She asked, "Mom, what is your date and time of the week?" And dad was surprised at my response. I replied: "You won't know until tomorrow." That's when he said, "How would this go?" We went off to the cafeteria.

Why? Why did my sister and I have to wait on three other family members for two hours at a time, and then go back home with him for dinner every time he missed an eating or a drink? There's a real fear involved in being a busy parentâ€”one that my daughter never had. Why didn't my daughter go to school on the most urgent day of her life?

Some of us are able to empathize with our family members. We're not always the only ones who struggle with a child that was so much tougher. There's a growing awareness that our parents are our guardians, but they're rarely in the same boat on the emotional side of the fence. If there are two or three children in the home, do you believe that at least one of them is doing the hard work that the rest of us are able to, without having to take care of them personally? Maybe.

The problem that's causing a lot of stress is that there seems to be so much room for adjustment
