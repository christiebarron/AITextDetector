One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was growing up in rural North Carolina, and I was very grateful for the way it had made me feel to be a voice for our country. Today, I feel a slightly different kind of pride, knowing that a small and proud community would not be able to stop my family from living their dreams in an area where they feel threatened. And I am proud that many who live in the aisle in the Republican Party are still pushing for this country to work, not just for the rich, but for the people on both sides of the aisle.
