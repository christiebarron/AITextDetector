An example of a time someone in my life was patient was about 5 years.

I recall the moment when my parents first met my sister. I was a little drunk, I had no idea what her name was and when she finally asked to take me under her wing to go with her sister the whole time, I told her, "Do you remember my name? Can you tell my age?"

I remember what I said to her. "Sorry about that."

It was a big moment on the back end of the date and a whole lot of anger was building. I was so confused by it and a lot of rage I tried to speak in my own language, but she ignored me.

I went the other way, but it hurt so much, so I turned back to her and said, "You were the most brave person from the day I met you!" And in their face she knew. I've met people who have betrayed their mother before. It could be that she betrayed them on purpose.

Being a mother, if a mother doesn't protect a child in this way, she doesn't protect them.

There is nothing you've done or said which shows it for a fact or for the world which she really could never fully understand. She would never think that they would want to harm you in such a way and they probably would. There are no things that any parent can stand upMay be your life, but they cannot help
