The ending is meant to be a very hopeful statement. The author is comparing the hibiscus returning in the spring to her taking the test again. Her state of hope for success can be symbolized by the return of the hibiscus in the spring. Despite the difficulties and challenges they both have faced, the hibiscus and the protagonist both have the potential to bloom, to bloom in the optimism of a better future, and to find success.
