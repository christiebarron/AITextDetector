I remember once when I was running late to a meeting with my boss. I was trying to get there as quick as possible, but traffic was bad and I was getting increasingly frustrated. I was about fifteen minutes late when I eventually arrived, and when I walked in my boss was already there waiting for me. I was expecting a tongue-lashing for being late, but instead my boss just smiled and calmly started the meeting as if nothing had happened. Even though I had made a mistake, his patience and understanding made me feel like it was no big deal. His patience allowed me to remain calm and focused on the meeting, and we were able to have a productive and positive conversation. It was a huge relief and it taught me a valuable lesson about patience and understanding in the workplace. From that day forward, I have been much more conscious of being patient with my colleagues, even in stressful circumstances.
