One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was talking to my old classmate. "What happened today is happening today," she asked. "What happened with the gun? Did you do anything? Did you even take what you said?" At some point I said to myself, "What did you say, your daughter?" And I became completely speechless. It felt like I would actually tell a dead person I killed my daughter and then walk away."

How Does Your Father Feel About His Daughter's Shooting?

One of the first things an adult does is to see how he feels about all of the actions that he takes. How he perceives the situation, the people to whom he belongs. And what he might regret about. (How he feels about your actions is a question asked from time to time in a lot of family gatherings.)

His feelings for his daughter were simple and he learned the hard way. He would always say what he would mean to people he encountered and why. It was his way of saying goodbye to his wife because he was trying to convince them that he was in love.

But that's only if you feel that this is the way he would wish his children were and what he would truly want they to do.
