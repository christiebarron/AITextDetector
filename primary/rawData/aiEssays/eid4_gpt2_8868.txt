The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it's a nice little bit of a narrative. He is also a great writer, who has his own little writing team in the series, so I liked it just as many people wrote on it.

In the beginning, Hibiscus was always very interesting to me. I didn't see much of a character and his situation in any other direction, so I was mostly inspired by him, because he was still a character in my brain. It was pretty early in the series, when I first read it, when I saw what it needed to be like to be a detective.

How did you get it onto TV? My parents were from Ireland when you first read it in 1977 and I was pretty much a teenager and it was very much a film by that time. I just think my dad's love of the TV show was really strong and that's how I got excited about it.

Do you have any favourite characters from the series, apart from Hibiscus you want to mention?

Hibiscus is really cute on the show, but he will probably give a lot of trouble at his next job.

So he's so funny...

I'm sorry, but he doesn't get to do any of the weird stuff that Hibiscus does.
