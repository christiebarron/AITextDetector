The builders of the Empire State Building faced a variety of obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. From technical and safety issues to the large public outcry, the task of successfully allowing dirigibles to dock was complex and daunting. 

The taller the skyscraper, the more difficult it was to figure out how to construct a safe, reliable, and inexpensive structure for mooring and docking airships. Building designers knew that any vertical mast structure they used to attach the dirigible must be able to endure the weight of the airship and its passengers. Because the Empire State Building was so tall at 1,250 feet, building designers ran into a new problem of constructing a strong, lightweight structure that can safely secure airships to the roof.

The technical and financial demands of constructing such a structure were a major concern for the builders, especially since it had to be strong enough to withstand winds up to thirty miles per hour. The use of steel and of advanced engineering techniques had to be considered, along with the potential danger to aircraft and passengers. In order to meet the safety and mooring requirements, builders decided to use round steel structures, which used fewer materials and resources than the conventional rectangular design. 

The public outcry against the idea was another obstacle that designers had to face. People feared that the possibility of the dirigible crashing to the ground would be a risk to New Yorkers. Others were concerned about the environmental danger of the gas that the
