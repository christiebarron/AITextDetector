The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock, making it a unique feat of engineering compared other construction projects. As described in “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the building wasn’t originally intended to serve as a mooring for rigid airships—the mast was included in the plans after developers noticed an increased interest in airships and realized it would be a great addition to the building.

Since dirigibles are much larger and heavier than standard ships, they require more steady and reliable mooring masts. The mooring mast needed to be accommodating for all types of ships and had to be resistant to all kinds of weather and conditions, unlike with other ships which could avoid unpredictable weather. This was one of the biggest challenges the builders of the Empire State Building faced, as the heavy winds that dirigibles trusted upon the building’s mast could potentially cause it to collapse or even detach from the building.

The designers also had to be sure the mooring mast was strong enough to hold the weight of a fully loaded airship, while at the same time not causing any damage or distress to nearby boats and people. This was particularly challenging due to the enormous amount of airships that were expected to dock, as the heavier ships would require sturdier support from the mooring mast.

To accommodate the needs of dirig
