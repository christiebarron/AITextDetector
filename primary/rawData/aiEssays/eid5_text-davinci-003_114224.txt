Narciso Rodriguez’s memoir, From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, is an intimate look into his own life and how the experiences of his childhood have shaped his creative work and design philosophy as an adult. Through his reflections on his family's Cuban-American history, Rodriguez creates a deeply nostalgic mood that resonates within the memoir.

The nostalgia the memoir evokes is one of both longing and joyous remembrance. Drawing on his memories of growing up in Jersey city, Rodriguez describes the many cultural influences that made up his life: from Cuban food to the music his mother and father played around the house sharing elements of Cuban culture with their children. He also captures the sadness of leaving his home in Jersey City when his family moved to New Jersey. These emotions become especially prominent as Rodriguez talks about the time his mother spent the summers in Miami—a city he would eventually make his home.

But beyond the sadness of goodbyes, Rodriguez’s memoir is also filled with a sense of joy and resilience. He speaks about his family’s strong bond and how they worked together to make a better future for themselves, despite the challenges of Adjusting to a new culture. He also talks about his appreciation for the Cuban American communities and how they welcomed him and his family and helped them become part of their new home. 

From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives captures Rodriguez’s nostalgia for both the past and present,
