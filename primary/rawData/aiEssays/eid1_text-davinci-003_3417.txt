Dear Editor, 

As we move into a more technologically-advanced world, it is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore the effects of computers on our lives. From the home to the workplace, computers and their software are having a significant impact on individuals and society as a whole.

In the home, computers enable us to communicate, create custom documents and stay connected to our family and friends. We can even utilize the internet to play a variety of games, watch movies, listen to music, or shop for products and services. In terms of the workplace, computers are essential for creating budgets, business plans, presentations, and any number of other tasks. With computer programs, we are able to increase efficiency and productivity and manage our data with ease.

For better or worse, computers are also influencing the way we think. Our minds naturally become accustomed to the necessary processes involved in effectively using a computer. We memorize shortcuts, become familiar with the user interface, and train ourselves to digest information quickly. This can increase our efficiency by saving us time, but it also alters our thought process. We no longer rely on our own memories, but instead depend on our computers as our external memory.

In summation,
