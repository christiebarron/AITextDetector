An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a nurse who had a long history of having a heart attack. She would give her medication with every prescription for my heart condition. I had to write her prescriptions, and I made the first 10,000 requests. When I wrote back that I didn't like the letter, she told me in pain. She asked, 'You've got to tell us to use a new heart condition treatment instead of another, you've got to tell us that you've had a heart attack. If you're in pain and need help, do it now.' With all the doctor appointments I take now, I tell the nurses to go read my medications. So, now that I have my heart conditions treated, I have a job. I don't have to worry about the pressure of a doctor's office office.

"The nurses and I can't speak very well of each other. It's easy for someone who has worked in the emergency room to get upset but it's much worse for a nurse. I haven't had such a big issue with the nurse. He's patient, patient, patient."
