The Empire State Building is a hallmark of American ingenuity and ambition. From the time of its completion in 1931, the building has witnessed the development of air transportation in New York City and has been at the forefront of revolutionary changes in the way people travel and consume goods. One such revolution was the advent of dirigibles, which allowed for lighter-than-air vehicles to dock at specially designed structures known as mooring masts. It was only natural that the Empire State Building should be considered for such an innovation, but the builders faced significant obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. 

The first issue they faced was the height of the building. Because dirigibles operated higher in the sky than most air travel at the time, the Empire State Building had to be raised in order to accommodate the necessary mooring mast. Because the building was already near its maximum height of 1,250 feet, extra safety measures had to be taken to make sure the higher parts of the structure could withstand the additional weight. Additional bracing and anchoring were added to ensure that the mast could be attached safely and securely.

Another challenge related to the air space around the building. Mooring masts had to be placed at least 500 feet apart, so additional mooring towers had to be built within the city to allow dirigibles to dock. This required cooperation with city officials to ensure that the space around the Empire State Building was safe and regulated for large airships
