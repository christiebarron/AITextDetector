Computers have many effects on people. Their behavior affects their health and they are vulnerable to any number of adverse events, including strokes and diabetes and many are over 80 years old and older but still not as prone to disease as those at the lowest end of the hierarchy.


If you look at the medical literature, there have been major research articles supporting a range of adverse effects on these patients, including increased risk of coronary heart disease. This, despite lack of understanding of how many of them will be affected.


In order to understand the potential of these adverse events to the future health of our people, many people are in fact not living up to their potential and it's clear that all of our issues are under the umbrella of the healthcare industry. The healthcare professionals, in particular in the pharmaceutical industry, provide a large portion of our health care cost. Therefore for these issues, all of the risk is very likely to be borne by the consumers. Consequently they will be left with less money to give to charity.


If the healthcare industry keeps paying for this health care, the people will not be well off. The health care industry will not be as well off so it is not the government's responsibility. However, these people may not get health insurance or if they do get it, the government will not provide much of it. If we leave them with less and less. This will leave them with less and less. The risk of this is very likely to outweigh the benefit.
