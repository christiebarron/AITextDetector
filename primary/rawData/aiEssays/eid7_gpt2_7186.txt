An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when my son was dying at 7 years old that my wife and I went shopping. I came home and she asked if this was her brother, and then we sat down in our car with some friends, and I found you sat there crying for hours, crying while I was in their car with a bunch of other friends. She took it and then I went into a bathroom, and I said, "This should be my brother." She gave me a hug and then they left structurally. I was thinking I could do something, but this had been a lot of trying. I am glad that I was able to pull this off, and to be at my fullest level when I was able I just can't do it," he said.

Preston has worked with some top-line stars, as far back as "The Rock" and to this day, he has yet to get a call from him, as the former only met with his current manager on Tuesday afternoon when they werepointing to their meeting.

"He's one of my all time heroes, just having met some of these amazing guys all the time, he is very inspirational and I'm really lucky to have met him so many times before 1950 and then to have met up with those great guys who would be so special to me. These great guys I met will be missed by so many people and I cannot wait for it to end,"
