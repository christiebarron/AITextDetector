I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is bad," Sartre said.

"We need to address censorship in all things, including the internet."

We've asked some of our favourite libraries what they think about censorship in their libraries. See some of our favourites here.

Consequences

It's a long road ahead.

As for who gets what back in return, we need to look at the impact of copyright, piracy and copyright's value on its long-term consequences. The UK government's "policies on Copyright", for example, are so vague that little is known.

What do we know so far?

Legalisation or not.

We now have the option of asking MPs on copyright rights to make the right to "perpetuate for a future, or perhaps future, duration" the copyright term in our legislation. After all, it's not a question of what rights people have for the things they hold. And what rights are in place to protect the copyright term they hold.

With the possibility of getting a similar act done during parliament's next session, where this is a central theme, it's unlikely that this option is going to be offered in the House of Lords, according to Sartre.

We're getting rid of the copyright term, we make another copyright term out to the states, and what we're sure is we'll do that before the end of the parliament,
