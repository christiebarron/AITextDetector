Censorship in libraries is a controversial issue that has been debated for decades. Controlling the availability of material for public consumption is necessary for a safe and functioning society, but that control must find a balance that respects the rights of library patrons. 

Books, music, movies, magazines, and other materials are a source of knowledge, education, and entertainment for library users. Restricting access to certain material diminishes the libraryâ€™s value to patrons. Libraries function to provide everyone with access to information that would otherwise be inaccessible. Limiting the range of material one can choose from undermines this purpose. 

For those materials deemed to be offensive or inappropriate, libraries can be proactive in providing educational and informative programming instead. Not only would this ensure the safety of library patrons, but it would also give the library an opportunity to provide support and guidance to those who may be negatively impacted by the material. Libraries can create a safe and inviting learning environment for patrons without compromising their right to access available material. 

Librarians should be aware of the concerns of patrons and strive to make everyone comfortable when using the library. We must, however, draw a line between censorship of materials and providing an accommodating and safe learning environment for everyone. Censoring educational material or simply removing it from the shelves should never be seen as an acceptable solution. Libraries should educate and inform library patrons about difficult, or potentially offensive, materials, but should not limit access to material.
