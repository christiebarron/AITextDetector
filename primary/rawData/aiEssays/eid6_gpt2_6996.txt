The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In 1871, a team of German aviators created a new type of dirigibles. This was the same model of glassware, which was manufactured into sheets, then used as a sheet at the ends of a plane's windows and at the upper-left corner of a window at high altitudes on the upper part of one of the windows of an Empire State Building. However, the German pilots of the time did not know how to use this method of glassware when their aircraft were attempting to land. In 1905, the US military began to use aluminum dirigibles. And in 1904, the US Navy employed a single, glass-backed aircraft wing, called the Rota, designed to carry six airplanes.

The main obstacle to the development of glassware was that, although they could easily be opened when an enemy landed on Earth, they were not readily available. "Glass and the glass wing were, after all, in the same class," explains Daniel M. Klein, historian and director of the American Studies Program at the University of California at Berkeley. "Every aircraft wing you needed was in a class that could be done only by light. That was very much the case with the Rota and the Rota fuselage, and their ability to lock onto a beam or the edge of the wing made that problem much worse. The main problem was not that there was too much
