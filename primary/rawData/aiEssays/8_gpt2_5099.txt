One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I heard someone say something to a guy while I was laughing, it was pretty scary (this was my first thought upon hearing that)."

363 KIRK FESTIVAL: If a party goes to a rave, can we ask more people to come over, too?

Dahl is proud of the festival for "making people feel at home," and he has an opening by hosting parties all year for their fans. The band will be coming back to Chicago once a week beginning July 30, with an upcoming set at the end of August.

But in his hometown, where there is one of the most music-loving neighborhoods in Chicago, Dahl can't help but wonder if he will be able to stay true to his ideals.

"Well, for sure it will have its own set list," he says. "For me at least, it'd be nice to be able to go for the biggest show in the world over there, even if it might just be in the East Side area. It'd be really nice to get something done with a lot of this money."
