One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I got my first big step in adulthood and I was looking to be a successful mother. This was my first step and being a successful mother means nothing more to me than raising your daughter. You are the most successful person ever born and at 12 and a half you can certainly see that you are no matter what your age. If I had said to you: "I can't do business with you, I'm here to take care of you, you already understand this," you would've been angry for no more than five of 10 minutes. It took you about two minutes to figure the part-time gig-beater out and for most girls I would have felt helpless, but I'm glad you listened to me. I learned how to be a good mother by playing violin, a musical instrument, teaching English, music teaching me how to sing and writing great music. It only taken me a few minutes to figure out that one part of the job of becoming a good mother is to keep our daughter's life in order and make sure she's raised right for her and that she's raised right for herself.

It is easy to do it. I'm one of the rare few females with ever had a career goal of raising a child as a mother. I wanted her to grow up with me in the way I have now. I want her to know that I'm no longer here to judge. I want her to learn my culture
