Computers have many effects on people. They can affect how you work, how you play, etc. Computers can also use your attention, your focus, etc.

So how can you make it more pleasant to use computing, to do something you enjoy, in a meaningful way, than to be a child? You might think you've mastered the art, you might be able to make computers faster and in some ways more fun, yet by the time you graduate from high school all you have accomplished is you've been working in a lab or an academic project.

Even if you don't know exactly how that's going to play out, it still may actually be good.
