I was recently waiting for the bus to arrive after a long day at work. Everyone else was shuffling around impatiently, exchanging glares and comments meant for each other. Some people started to complain and throw insults around the crowd, but I just decided to stay quiet and continue waiting.

Despite the bitterness filling the air around me, I stood still and remained calm. Eventually, the bus did arrive and the negative tensions melted away into a collective sigh of relief.

It was then that I realized the importance of being patient. If I had joined the crowd in their complaining and agitation, the wait would have felt much longer and put unnecessary strain on everyone around me. So instead, I displayed inner patience and persevered the wait, contributing to a better atmosphere for everyone.
