I was at a family picnic last week and I couldn't help but feel a little out of place. Everyone there was related to each other and I just felt like an outsider. 

At one point, the conversation turned to a funny memory that my aunt was sharing about when my cousins were young and learning how to play soccer. Everyone was laughing hysterically and I couldn’t help but join in. As I laughed, I suddenly felt like I was part of the family. 

My uncle noticed my reaction and turned to me with a huge smile. He said, “See, even the outsiders get to laugh too.” That made everyone laugh even harder. 

It was such a small moment, but it made me feel included and loved. There’s just something about the sharing of laughter that can break down any walls between people. I’m so grateful that my aunt shared her memory and that my uncle took the time to make sure I felt welcomed. It was truly a special moment that I will never forget.
