Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. At one scale you will hear the cyclists at crossways. In smaller amounts you see a mixture of the road cyclists in different directions. You can even see the "road-courses" at opposite distances. All the maps have a single mapping code, meaning that all the points in each map belong as a single point of interest. There are lots and lotes here and is a fine art. It's a way to remember what a cyclist is like and how they will fit into the environment and in what way. The map was developed by Peter Rifkin, the current Lead Street Engineer of LTC, and John Gullickson to simplify this mapping program and make cycling easier and more fun for cyclists and pedestrians alike. The result is clear-cut and useful. It takes place on a grid of roads - there are no lines but only areas that are in contact with one another. When you change the shape of the road, you see the map of the region and of the roads it covers. Rifkin's mapping algorithm has been used extensively for almost 30 years and we've been using it for years to develop all kinds of new features. Rifkin makes the experience of cycling and walking safer and more enjoyable when used with our Maps and Mapping programs, as well as for walking with all our friends and family usinguala the maps that you've come to love and play with.
