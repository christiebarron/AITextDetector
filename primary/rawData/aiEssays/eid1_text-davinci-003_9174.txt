Dear Editor:

The proliferation of computers in our age has had a profound effect on the way many of us think, work, and communicate. As computers have become mainstays in our households and workplaces, there has been an undeniable shift in how people interact with one another.

On one hand, computers allow individuals to stay connected to the outside world with ease, enabling us to communicate almost instantaneously. This has led to unprecedented access to knowledge and the ability to collaborate with people from around the globe. On the other hand, computers can drastically narrow our world, limiting the kinds of relationships we can form and deepening our obsession with technology. 

There is no question that computers have allowed us to explore and unlock incredible amounts of data. However, while achieving these goals comes with undeniable advantages, there are still certain detriments associated with technology which ought to be considered. Spending excessive time at computers can hamper our social interactions and lead to a decreased sense of empathy towards others, which can have dire consequences on our closest relationships. Additionally, computer use can often be a burden when it comes to productivity. While computers offer many tools to help us excel in the workplace, the constant distractions and temptations to procrastinate can render computers ineffective at accomplishing our goals.

In the final analysis, we must be aware of the effects which computers have on our lives. By being mindful of the advantages and disadvantages they offer, we can use computers to our best advantage
