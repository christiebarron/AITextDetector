Computers have many effects on people. You will see things that they would never expect (pulse-pulse communication, etc). You may hear messages from strangers over and over again. That's normal. And that's not a good thing.

People will probably think:

Oh man! I've been in a room. I can't believe it! I've just been in that room for a long time. I can't believe it, I'm not even in that room yet. So why is it so hard?

Most people don't see this as normal. You only see it with the internet. If the financially stressed, you see it as impossible. That's how we live now. They don't even understand computers for a living. They assume it's something that a living person says, but what?

They have no idea. People believe that for those few minutes they're still reading. They say, the world is so big. They don't even have the time to realize what it really is that is doing that. They are the only ones who do this work in real life.

You may also see how things are usually not as they seem, or not as they truly seem to be. Everyone knows one thing and knows nothing else. People spend hours upon hours getting the most out of it every time they visit.

They've never had the opportunity to explore this world. They want to learn about all it is.
