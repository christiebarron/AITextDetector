Dear Editor,

I write to suggest that the increasing use of computers in our everyday lives is having a detrimental effect on people.

With the rise of technology, we have seen a mass explosion of computer-based products that are being released for use, as well as those that are already in widespread use. For example, with the acceleration of computer processing speeds and increasingly powerful new applications, electronic gaming, social media, and online streaming are all incredibly popular leisure activities.

Unfortunately, these computer-based activities can be very addictive, and time spent engaging with technology often comes at the expense of engaging with others in meaningful conversations and real-world activities. It has been argued that too much use can lead to lessened concentration, antisocial behavior, and isolation from society, all of which can have adverse effects on peoplesâ€™ physical and mental health.

We must acknowledge that technology can be a useful tool, but people need to be empowered to use computers responsibly. We cannot ignore the science that shows the precarious impact that computers can have. Campaigns need to be run to educate people on healthy computer use; the effects of computer addiction; and how to make sure their user experience is positive and enjoyable.

Let us be mindful of how we engage with computers and take steps to ensure computers are used with caution and respect.

Yours sincerely, 
[Your Name]
