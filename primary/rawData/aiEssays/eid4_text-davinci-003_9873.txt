The ending of “Winter Hibiscus” by Minfong Ho provides a powerful message of hope and resilience. The narrator has experienced tremendous growth and maturation since the start of the story, and ends by looking forward to taking a challenging test again in the spring, when the hibiscus is in bloom. This is a metaphor for the narrator's tenacity and determination: even through the harshest winter, the hibiscus is still there, ready to burst into life when the spring comes. The ending is meant to encourage readers to never give up, even when times are tough, and that with a little patience and hard work, success can be achieved.
