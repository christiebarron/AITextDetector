The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' has long been that the US Department of State has had a good relationship with Russia and that this policy was part of an attempt to keep US power and influence in Russia. Mr Corbyn told The Sunday Telegraph that "in my opinion, it is important that we are building a new relationship with Russia to create a better relationship with the Western world."

Although Mr Corbyn said he believed "Russian intervention in the election of Donald Trump, and the subsequent election of a US president, need not change our approach to international affairs", he added that such "confrontation with your own enemy will not solve our problems", and "this will only prolong the conflict for so long."

Mr Steinmeier met Sergei Lavrov earlier this year who is currently acting as Moscow's economic minister before being appointed minister of state.
