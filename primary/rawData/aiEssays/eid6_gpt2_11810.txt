The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They didn't want you to land too far up or too close to a wall. And they didn't want you to jump right to get the job done. Instead, their plan was to give you free flying at every second of the voyage, with your friends in the cockpit in tow, ready for anything.

Now, imagine being trapped in a deep dive with this little man. It is no longer possible for a passenger to do this job, and you must decide if you'll be flying up and down with someone for a bit or just for fun. If you manage to get up above the nearest open platform, you'll eventually need to try landing. A couple of things make the problem much more complicated. They are now very easy to spot, but in every case the object in their cockpit is not directly visible.

This does cause an awkward situation in one respect. If a person and a few people have been standing in the foreground on long flights, the first thing they would do would be to take off in the wrong direction, which in a way would mean jumping over a gap between buildings. These aren't necessarily bad ideas, but they do make that problem much harder. It's a lot easier to get out of this problem than flying from one building and then to jump in the wrong direction, because the first thing the ship needs is a landing gear and so on.
