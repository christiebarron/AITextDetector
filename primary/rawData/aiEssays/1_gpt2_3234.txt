Computers have many effects on people. The easiest to understand is: if you see a certain amount of money and get up to 1/10th your number. It's like, if you're like me, there is money on our desk. Well, most people just want 1% of their numbers. Why would you want 1% when other people are not able to see that amount? Maybe your computer isn't good enough?

Think about what sort of life you can expect a computer to last. In my case, it's a desktop PC with a Mac. The desktop PC does what you want it to do. I could say, the computer performs a lot more efficiently when I am using it a lot.

In the end, the difference will be whether you want things that can last forever, or things that should last a long time. My computer only costs about $1500 a year and, at $1,724 per hour, makes me an even better musician. In fact, I use my computer for every gig I do, but I wouldn't argue with the life savings youctory a $1500. I think I would rather have less.
