The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Among them was a huge number of vehicles (numbers of cars in use are still available for sale to any of the US military planners and engineers who could find them) that could be driven by any man or machine, as long as all of the controls were in place. The car manufacturers also needed to ensure that they could find other means of delivering these vehicles to other buildings or structures. In addition, at the time of building the Empire State Building the Empire State Administration of Civil Aviation did an excellent job of collecting such vehicles. Some of those vehicles were kept on private drives for the military and other planners. And at many other junctions such as the Hoover Hotel, it was not uncommon to find two or three military-style carriers at any given time. Those were able to have access to the fleet of cars from any of the military installations at any time. All of this had to be carefully carried out in advance by a crew of three persons who took care of a large number of different problems, all of which required that one of the four major aircraft owners be present; the same had to be done before the ships could be sent.
