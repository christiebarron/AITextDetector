The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Even those who would provide the required equipment needed to provide them were not always required by law. Often, government contractors needed to have equipment from commercial companies that were not able to carry out the construction, but had no other means of providing them.

The government has the power to regulate the installation and transportation of dirigibles, in a way that is unique to this area. In many parts of California, a variety of specialties exist, but each has their own business models or special requirements. The government has the right to regulate what is being purchased when a product is placed within its limits for transportation purposes. However, this freedom was limited because of the relative cost of many of the vehicles involved. Therefore, in a region where the public is concerned with transportation of persons and goods, each had the unique opportunity to drive around a small part of California with some of the limited services provided (such as taxi, limo, carpool), thus leading many to the decision to use commercial transportation as a means of transportation.
