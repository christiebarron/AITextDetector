I was recently with my family at the airport and after a few hours of waiting, we found out that our flight had been delayed. Knowing that this was going to add to our already cramped and uncomfortable trip, I was anxious and frustrated. Yet, instead of complaining and being irritable, I decided to take a deep breath and remain patient. 

I reminded myself that things happen that are out of my control, and I decided to use this extra time to my advantage. Rather than feeling overwhelmed and defeated, I opened up my laptop and started working on a project I had been putting off for weeks. I used this delay as an opportunity to remain productive and get closer to accomplishing my goal.

I was so proud of myself for staying patient and remaining calm in such a difficult situation. In the end, the wait was long but my family and I were able to make the most of it.
