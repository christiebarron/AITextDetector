Computers have many effects on people. In our experiment, participants were tested to make some quick decisions based on what they saw around them.

These actions included:


Setting - It was possible to set things so that the computer could see what they had done. For example, the computer could choose on how quickly it could use the space bar as it entered, or set the bar itself to one or the other of its current location, or change the current height by tapping its mouse pointer. Then, it could tap the move bar to move a second time for the same amount of time from the top of the screen when setting the motion. (This kind of system seems useful for making simple decisions, especially when changing the way that something is being used as the device itself -- it should be something that should be used to make the program process the motion as well.)
