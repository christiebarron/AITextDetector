The building of the Empire State Building presented innovative engineers with the challenge of providing a place to safely dock airship dirigibles. However, in undertaking this challenge, they faced a number of obstacles that threatened their success. 

The foremost of these obstacles was the fear of disaster. Although technologically advanced, airship dirigibles were the product of a relatively new technology, and as such, it was uncertain whether or not existing techniques and designs were sufficient to handle the practical and conceptual complexity of docking a bulky airship on top of a very tall building. The airship dirigibles also posed a safety hazard due to their immense size and the large areas they occupied from the ground up. Additionally, it was unclear whether or not the dirigibles' engines were powerful enough to handle the strong winds typically encountered at the top of the building. 

Another issue that presented itself was site considerations. Due to its sheer size and importance, the Empire State Building had to be built in a highly urban area, meaning there was limited space on the roof for the mooring mast and its sophisticated counterweights that were essential in anchoring dirigibles. It was unclear how the rest of the building would hold up to the additional stresses that the large airships would place on its steel frame. 

Finally, the ingenious engineers of the time had to consider the legal ramifications of allowing airships to dock such a prominent, and therefore highly visible, building. Laws governing
