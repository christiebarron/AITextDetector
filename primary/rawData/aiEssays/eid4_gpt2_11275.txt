The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it reveals the key to healing - how to keep oneself healthy after a period of severe illness - but also provides the ultimate lesson: to not want to be "the one that suffers the most" - always stick with the best approach for what makes you happy.

It's not just some sort of pre-meditated self-discovery; it's a full-on meditation session that focuses on the body's natural state of mind. "I want the body I have always loved to come closer," writes Riesling, "and I don't want to give it away." When I write these things, I try to find them in the world at large and that is where "Grammy" finds its place.

But in the end there's an end, too. If you've ever tried the "God Daughters, Pt. 22" DVD, chances are that you've never had too much fun reading through. If you haven't had that experience yet, and if you enjoyed that but haven't finished them, then you may end up losing confidence, even though it's not necessarily the end of the world, and more importantly, there's plenty of more joy that can come from revisiting the world for those who never had it before.
