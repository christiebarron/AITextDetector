I looked up at my friend nervously expecting her to start laughing, but instead her face softened into a smile. "That's hilarious!" she said. I let out a relieved breath and couldn't help but smile. We had been talking about a mutual friend, and I had made a joke, not really expecting her to laugh. It was a relief to realize that no matter how much time had passed since we had last seen each other we still had the same sense of humour.

We laughed together for a while and I remembered why I loved her so much. Our friendship had been there since childhood wouldn't have made it through the years without laughing together. Even in the hardest of times, when things were taking a toll on both of us, we managed to make each other laugh.

That day I learned that laughter was not only a way of connecting with the people we cared about, but also an essential factor in any relationship. It broke barriers, created bridges and brought people closer together in the most surprisingly simple of ways. That day, I realized that laughter was, in fact, the shortest distance between two people.
