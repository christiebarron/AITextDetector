Computers have many effects on people. One of these is mental illness; even though things like autism and schizophrenia have never been reported, they will take years or decades in to develop. People tend to experience things in the short term, which may even create long-term problems.


This does not negate the fact that some of these things are not always very clear and easy to know for many Americans. And that does not mean that Americans cannot try to understand something. It also does not mean that our understanding of complex issues is just as incomplete as it is sometimes or almost always accurate. For example, a doctor can write about a stroke, but he or she does not know the patient's physical condition. A neuroscientist can learn about an animal's genetic makeup. We can also be convinced that all these things are actually more than the story.


"That may be just the tip of our iceberg of a lot of people who will be talking about things but not in the same way that people have learned about the story in the past.
