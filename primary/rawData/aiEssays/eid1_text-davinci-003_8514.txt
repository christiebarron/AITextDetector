Once I was in line at the grocery store, and the person in front of me was taking a really long time. The cashier was helping them figure out their coupons and it was kind of a mess. I could feel my impatience building up, but I just kept encouraging myself to stay patient. I kept telling myself that I wasn't in a rush and that it was more important to be kind and understanding than to be concerned about how long it was taking.

Finally, the person ahead of me finished with the cashier and I was able to step up and start my order. Sometimes it takes patience to get through life, and that day I was really proud of myself for staying cool and not letting my frustration take over.
