I believe that censorship of materials in libraries serves other values. People are being threatened and harassed online by other people for their opinions, and if they don't have good manners and make it clear that they don't see what is being said and can't stop the offending behaviour in the public, and if they need a break from the world or are sick too, then they should stay home."

In a second petition signed by a handful of libraries, the petition called on the government to remove a document, called the "Shakespeare Lectures", that the government commissioned in 2010 on 'Shakespeare in Literature' from university libraries. The petition argued that it would be better to "explain our understanding of Shakespeare's life and the writing of Shakespeare".

Rita Patel, director of the Centre for Intellectual Development at the National Society for the Arts, said that the statement "is only the beginning of what will be a large wave of censorship of all non-white literature across Britain."

"I believe that it is important for authors and academics of all creeds, and for students of all walks of life, to have a robust debate on their views," she added. "It is in this context that I have written that this is the most important time to address this issue."
