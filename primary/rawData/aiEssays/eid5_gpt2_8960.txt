The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' has become even more real, for its title character (an Australian woman in her mid-twenties) is now accused of the massacre, as she is given to see her boyfriend murdered.

It's a novel so shocking in the way it describes and exposes the horrors of mass killings, but it's also so sad, if shocking, and tragic, it's hard to take it seriously.
