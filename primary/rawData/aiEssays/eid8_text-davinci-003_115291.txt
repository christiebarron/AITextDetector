I was out at dinner with an old friend I hadn't seen in a few years. We were catching up and talking about all the exciting things that had happened since we'd last seen each other. 

As we continued to talk, we found ourselves laughing over the little details. We started to tell old stories and joke about the funnier moments that had taken place throughout our friendship. 

The laughter kept increasing, and soon we were both in fits of uncontrollable giggles. We got to the point where we were laughing so hard that tears were streaming down our faces. 

Eventually, we lost all sense of control and just rolled around in our chairs, clutching our stomachs, howling with laughter. People at the other tables started to join in, which only made us laugh harder. 

It was such an amazing feeling to be able to connect with an old friend on that level. Laughter had created a beautiful bond between us, and I was so grateful for the moment. 

Looking back, I think of that evening every time I need to be reminded of the power of laughter in a relationship.
