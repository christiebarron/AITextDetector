If there are no 'Rough Road Ahead' conditions, the setting will automatically be chosen for each road. This will save your battery life for any road where this setting may occur. This feature is only available on a maximum of 6 vehicles (except two trucks) every 1,000km. This is to reduce the likelihood of a cyclist being hit by a vehicle even if its left on their side. This setting can be changed at any time in a simple way.
