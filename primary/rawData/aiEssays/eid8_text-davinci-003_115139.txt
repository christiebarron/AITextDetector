It was an ordinary day, except for the fact that I had agreed to meet up with a friend I hadn't seen in years. We were meeting for coffee and catching up, but I was a little nervous.

We found a café and ordered our drinks, then settled into a booth. As usual, we had a lot to talk about, but for some reason the conversation stalled. I was about to tell him about the new job I'd started when he suddenly said something so ridiculous that I couldn't help myself – I burst out laughing.

My friend looked surprised for a moment, but then he joined in, too. We laughed until tears were streaming down our cheeks. When we finally managed to pull ourselves together, we were both a little breathless. I knew that no matter how much time had passed, we were still connected.

We spent the rest of the afternoon talking and laughing, and by the time we said goodbye I knew that, no matter how much time passed, the bond we had shared through laughter would always be there.
