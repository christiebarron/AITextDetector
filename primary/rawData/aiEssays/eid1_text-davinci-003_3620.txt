Dear [Newspaper],

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on our society today. Computers are an integral part of our lives, and their influence on us is both positive and negative. 

On the positive side, computers have increased our access to information. We can use computers to find information quickly and easily, to make task simpler, and to find solutions to even the most complicated problems. Computers are also very useful in helping us to stay connected to the world, making it possible for us to do business and communicate with people from all over the world.

On the other hand, however, the use of computers can also have negative effects. People who spend too much time on their computers can become isolated from the world around them. They can become addicted to computers, spending hours of the day playing games instead of pursuing more practical hobbies. Computers can also become a distraction, taking away from more meaningful activities and interpersonal communication.

It is clear that while computers have brought many benefits, they also have potential drawbacks. It is important that people recognize the potential pitfalls of computer use and use it responsibly. We should not allow computers to take away from our real life activities and interaction with others. 

I hope you will consider this opinion when considering how computers are used among our society.

Sincerely,

[Your name]
