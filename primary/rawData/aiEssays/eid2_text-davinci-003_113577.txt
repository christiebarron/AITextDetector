To the Editor:

Materials in libraries should be subject to selective censorship when deemed offensive. Libraries should have a responsibility to the community to provide a safe and accepting environment for all patrons. With this in mind, books, music, movies, and magazines containing obscene content should be removed from the shelves. 

The recent trend of censorship is often misconstrued as censorship of certain ideas or opinions. Rather, censorship in the library should reflect the values of the institution to maintain an environment that is supportive of the community and its citizens. The United States Constitution sets forth that citizens may be free from any infringement of such freedoms that may harm or offend them. Therefore, libraries should not be places that are in direct opposition to such rights. 

In addition to the Constitution, censorship in libraries should also reflect the values of the communities they serve. All too often, libraries are relied upon to uphold the moral standing amongst its patrons. If books, music, movies, and magazines found to be offensive of moral standing are left on the shelves, this can be extremely damaging. Libraries should take active steps to ensure the materials they house are in line with the communityâ€™s values and beliefs. 

Although an argument can be made in support of freedom of speech, it is the responsibility of the library managers to ensure the special environment of the library remains safe, to allow all patrons access to the materials they desire in a protected and respectful manner. 

Sincerely
