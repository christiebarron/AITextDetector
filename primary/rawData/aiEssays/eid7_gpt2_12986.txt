An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when my parents found out someone had died on the way to work for a doctor who was out for days. They were told they had an emergency that had been passed down to all workers. I felt I had only two choices. If they wanted me to keep an interest in their lives they could ask for it, but I don't think I'd tell my parents. They may only agree to keep my interest, and they may still want me to keep it. But then, this person could be an enemy to others! And they'd lose the support system that comes with supporting them.

If these were rides, I'm sorry for you if you hear about these dangers. But if you know someone who has this in their life, or a loved one, or someone that has lost their job, or someone that is hurting, that's my warning, if you think there is a danger of working at the gym, please take some time to research this. I've tried to keep this as simple to understand as possible and then offer my honest opinion. When you read this post, and don't like any of my personal information you won't be tempted to email me.
