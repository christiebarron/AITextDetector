Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion about the effects computers have on people, and I hope to sway the readers of your paper to my point of view.

In today's world, computers are an essential part of our lives. They are used for work, communication, research, and even shopping. But is this reliance on computers having a positive effect on us? While computers can undoubtedly make us more efficient and organized, thereâ€™s a downside to having too much dependency on them.

For starters, computers are often blamed for physical problems such as carpal tunnel syndrome and vision problems, due to the amount of time people spend hunched over and staring at screens. Social interaction is also a cause for concern. People are spending more time in virtual worlds than real ones, and this can have an adverse effect on physical, mental and emotional health.

Though it may seem that computers are here to stay, I urge people to take a step back from their screens and find a healthy balance between computers and real life. Computers can be a useful tool, but in moderation, and remembering that real life carries more power and importance.

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
