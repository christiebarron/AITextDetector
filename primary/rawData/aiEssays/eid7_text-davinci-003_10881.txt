Sometimes being patient is hard, especially when it's something important. I recently had to apply for a high-profile job that I really wanted. The process was long and the application had several hoops that I had to jump through. Despite the long wait for a response, I remained patient.

Rather than getting upset or impatiently checking my emails everyday, I took a step back. I exercised regularly, went out with friends, and did things that I enjoy. Doing this helped me to stay positive and relax.

When I got the rejection letter, I was disappointed but I didn't go into a tail spin. I was patient and instead I reflected on the experience. I identified what I could have done better in my application and how I can improve for potential future applications. Overall, I'm proud of myself for remaining patient throughout the whole process.
