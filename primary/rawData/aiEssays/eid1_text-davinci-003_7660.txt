The speaker in the poem is reflecting on their journey to the United States as an immigrant. They have had to leave their home and loved ones behind and face the challenges and obstacles of settling in a new country. The speaker is looking at the winter hibiscus and seeing in it a reflection of themselves - like the hibiscus, which will die when the winter comes and revive with the spring, the speaker hopes that as the winter comes to an end they will be able to look forward to a better, brighter future. The last line of the poem emphasises the hopeful message of the poem, that despite the difficult and seemingly impossible obstacles the speaker has faced, they will persevere and that in the end, things will be alright.
