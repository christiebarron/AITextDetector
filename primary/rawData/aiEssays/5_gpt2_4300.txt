The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' has been to write the book in the language that we all know, and it has been very difficult.

'I had to make up stories after my family did not like it, so one year I began asking people, "Why do you want to hear from me?"

'We learned it was something for the end of the book, when I would come back to it again and write about my life. I was told it should be written that way.

'It turns out that there is no one else I want to write about.'

A woman from Germany says she had to tell her father to buy her a copy of 'From Home was My Life, the memoir.'

'My father didn't like this story, he told me it had to be told,' she told the BBC's Tom Hanks. 'But I started reading it out loud and it didn't matter. It was my life, and I love it.'
