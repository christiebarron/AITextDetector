The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In 1773, there were four dirigibles, two of which had to be locked with the windows. Once a craft was boarded, a thief could take everything away and drive off the building's exterior wall, leaving no evidence. It was only a small fraction of a third of the Empire's buildings that allowed the dirigibles to be locked: the earliest dirigibles were in the early 1760s, and were locked in the mid-1850s. The building had been made from steel for the first time in 1836, and two dirigibles were found, a second in 1764 and a third in 1860. The building had long been the repository of the first dirigibles, until the building became a source of interest in 1776, when the first three were pulled from the public inventory. The building was taken over by the state in 1828, and remains in use today. After the building's abandonment in 1838, other buildings were made, but all of them have either been dismantled or restored.

When the Federal Government took over the building, the dirigibles were installed in three distinct areas, with one in the Upper West Side and another in the South. These four units were the best known dirig
