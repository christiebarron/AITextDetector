The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' – which is an autobiographical story by a young man that can be read as both a portrait of the early American literary movement, with the literary community and the literary work of the time and in particular the literary works of John Brown and John Berry – has reached a new level that is unlike anything written in the last forty years of the literary movement."

It's important to note here that what Brown writes about isn't unique to his literary work – many of Brown's works have made it into the literary canon. But it is, with Brown in particular, what people from the American literary world have come to realize. Brown's memoir was a kind of new cultural space, to be filled with some of the most thought-provoking and compelling, unspoiled, often highly charged and sometimes hilarious moments in the writing of the works of William Holden. The whole experience of it was profound and touching.

"Here at home we live in a moment that I will not soon forget – at least not for a minute – and this is for those of us who never grew up," Brown writes in his opening sentence.

"Here in our hearts and minds we think you need an adventure – a book. A book is almost a book. This is a book you read or someone else reads. This is a book you read, even though these characters in your life – not all you – seem to be."
