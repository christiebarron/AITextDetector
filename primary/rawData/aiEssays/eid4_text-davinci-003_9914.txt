The narrator of Winter Hibiscus, Minfong Ho, uses the line to create juxtaposition because the hibiscus in the poem symbolizes the narrator's cultural identity, and she is not confident that she has mastered the Chinese traditions that she is supposed to learn. By ending the poem with the thought that she will try again when the hibiscus returns in the spring, Minfong Ho is suggesting that the narrator is hopeful that she will eventually find a way to reclaim her identity. This ending carries a message of optimism, as although she may not have successfully accomplished her goal, she is still hopeful for redemption and a sense of cultural relevance.
