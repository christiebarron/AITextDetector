One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was a kid, when I was in my mid 20's. One of my favorite things about the movie was the two kids sitting next to each other. And you could hear the laughter in their heads as they knew it was coming from the back seat. You could hear the laughter from across the room, and your parents didn't listen to it. Their emotions were so full, so full of emotion and excitement. So the kids could see how much of an emotion it is and how that emotion makes them feel, and you really couldn't understand how any other child could. It was like a little horror movie I saw, where your mom is taking a video and you can see me sitting there thinking, "Oh shit! I think I'm scared and need to get better," and you just can't. And my mom just knew it was happening, and then this was coming from the backs of her eyes. So I kind of watched it and thought, "Wow, maybe it's because I'm so stupid." That's something I can think of myself on, but how do you even understand the world or understand things when we're in a position where we can't see our emotions or our intentions. I'd never see "The Great Leap Forward" in my life since my first movie.

TJ: When you read the book (I got an A- rating from The Times) you immediately think "wow!" Like it
