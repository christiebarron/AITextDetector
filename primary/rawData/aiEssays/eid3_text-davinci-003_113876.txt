In the poem 'Rough road Ahead' by Joe Kurmaski, the features of the setting have a profound effect on the cyclist. The poem begins with the cyclist pedaling in the snow, longing for a better environment that will ease his journey. The cyclist's sense of exhaustion and physical fatigue is emphasized by the slushy roads. As the cyclist travels further along the route, the roads become progressively harder, with sharp curves and rolling hills. The difficulty of the terrain pushes the cyclist physically, but also mentally. The cyclist is forced to stay focused and pay close attention to the turns and curves to reach his destination safely. This sense of exertion is heightened even more by the cold and icy weather, which acts as a barrier to the cyclist's stamina. 

The setting's features also play a role in the cyclist's mental landscape. The sky reflects his inner despair, turning from clear to dark as he races through the wet and suffocating terrain. At the same time, the ever-present wind serves as a reminder of his isolation and vulnerability. The isolated roads, fog, and chilliness of the winter illustrate the cyclist's emotional state - alone, determined, and trudging through one of the most arduous routes possible.

Overall, the features of the setting in 'Rough Road Ahead' have a significant effect on the cyclist. The combination of the physical and mental demands imposed by the environment create a challenging yet rewarding experience for the cyclist. The
