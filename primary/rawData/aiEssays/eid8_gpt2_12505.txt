One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my friend and I met on the internet. We started looking for things to do we found a forum for our hobby and we started creating the first video (like this one) and video clip after video clip, we are using it now to promote our games. This video, is the first video clip we have uploaded yet. We hope this could help to grow the community for us and we would be greatly looking forward to it.

We want to share our passion for creating games and share how we made it to be part of the best game ever. In our spare time we love to be a part of the development of games and what we did is amazing. It is nice to have some fun that can be shared with everyone as little as possible. Be happy and get great videos if what you are doing is great. You may like our latest video clip for TSR:P so I'd encourage you to do that too.
