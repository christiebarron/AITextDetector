I was out shopping for groceries recently when I realized that I had left my wallet at home. I felt embarrassed, but I didn't want to cause a scene, so I quietly asked the cashier if there was any way that they could hold my groceries for me until I could get my wallet and come back to pay.

The cashier was very patient with me, and instead of getting angry like I expected, they just smiled and nodded, telling me that of course I could leave my groceries and that it wasn't a problem at all.

I was so relieved, and grateful for their kindness and patience. I quickly ran home, grabbed my wallet, and returned to the store about 10 minutes later. When I returned, they remembered me and my order, and happily checked me out.

I couldn't help but feel amazed at how patient they had been with me. It was such a nice gesture, and it definitely made my day.
