It all began when I met him for the first time. He had a great sense of humor and seemed to make me laugh from the very start.

It was an awkward moment; we didn't know what to say to each other, but he kept cracking jokes and it made me feel more comfortable. I could tell he wanted to make me laugh, so I focused on his jokes and joined in on his laughter. 

He told me stories of his past, and what really made me open up was when he shared a funny moment that happened at work. He said he had been stuck in a meeting all day, and when the conference call ended, someone accidentally called him back a few minutes later.

He answered the call, not realizing it was the wrong person. But, to make the best of the situation, he pretended he was the person they were looking for. He was so creative and funny, and his story had me laughing the entire time.

This story really brought us together and was the start of something special. We have been laughing together ever since. Our conversations are always filled with amusement, and there isn't a day that goes by when we don't have a good laugh. 

It's amazing the way laughter and humor can bring people closer togetherâ€”and that's exactly what it did for us.
