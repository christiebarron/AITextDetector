The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. "This problem is only about one of many. One of several. Another one of the most serious problems," says Michael Grosjean, vice president of innovation at the AOPA. "It's about the idea that nobody's going to use a real-time computer, a virtual one, to make this kind of data. People like it. I think that it's a big problem." The AOPA has proposed a host of tech solutions that would connect the dirigibles with machines, even ones which are not owned by any computer company, according to Grosjean.

There are no plans to put any dirigibles into cars by 2021, he says, but if the AOPA is granted to any company, then by that point it should have been considered a possibility. He also predicts that people could make their own dirigibles because a lot of other cars don't meet the criteria set out by the AOPA. A couple of years down the line, a few would be commercially available, he says. They could connect it with a self-driving car, but not an aircraft, said Hilleman.

"When you take a car that is fully autonomous it's going to be very difficult to get that vehicle to be ready for a certain distance, and that's what the AOPA should have been looking at with a lot of concern," he says.
