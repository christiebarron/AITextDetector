I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is the only way to preserve the quality and to provide a more open society," said James H. St. John, chair of the faculty of art history and comparative literature at the University of Virginia School of Law. "As long as the Internet is used as a platform for discussion around important topics, and people are free to learn about and make use of it as their daily and weekly interests, there should be no problem with censorship, regardless on its costs."
