I remember the first time I really laughed with my now husband. It was a day like any other, but for some reason we just clickedâ€”and laughed!

We had been out for dinner together and were just talking about our day, like you do. Nothing that special, but then all of a sudden something clicked and we just started cracking up. It wasn't one joke that set us off, it was the combination of us, our personalities and our timings that made it so funny.

I remember the exact moment when I just knew that it was real. He tipped his head back, and his face and eyes lit up with delight. I knew in that moment that I was totally enchanted by him, and that feeling has only grown since.

We must have laughed for ages, and I can still feel that amazing wave of connection when I think back to it. It made me realize more than ever before how closely connected we were, and how much work we had done to reach it.

He still makes me laugh to this day, and I will never forget those first real laughs that sealed our union.
