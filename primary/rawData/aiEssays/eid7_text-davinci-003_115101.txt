When I was in high school,my best friend and I had planned an afternoon outing to the city. My friend and I were both excited about the trip and could not wait to go.

Unfortunately, on the day of the outing, it began to rain. My friend was visibly disappointed and began to complain about the situation. I knew how much this trip meant to her and I did not want her to be upset, so I told her that we could still try our luck and take the bus to the city anyway and that if it was still raining, we could always turn back.

My friend was thrilled with my suggestion and agreed. Sure enough, when we reached the city, the rain had not subsided. But we were pleased to discover that there were a few places we could go even if it was raining. We still had an amazing time on our outing and my friend thanked me for being so patient with the situation. 

I was glad that I could make the day special for my friend despite the weather, and that I was able to remain patient even when things werenâ€™t going as planned.
