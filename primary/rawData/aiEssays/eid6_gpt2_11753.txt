The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, a single-screen TV was not easy to build. The only way to get the building to fit at 2.8 feet tall was with an eight-ball ball, or B. F. T-2. A two-screen TV, one big and very clear as a barometer, was not very convincing for some builders. The B. F. T-2, on the other hand, would allow users to view a 2.3-minute documentary video without a single viewscreen. A third hurdle of building with single-screen TVs seemed inevitable: They were going to cost a whopping $2 million.

This problem, once solved, left the entire building vulnerable to being smashed into pieces over time while on the go. The designers eventually came up with an ingenious solution: They would put a video camera in the entrance to the building in order to capture the impact of all that concrete, the weight of the building, the impact of the collapsing building and the impact of people falling into it. As a result, they could watch the film, all in high definition, for at least the next 25 years. When the B. F. T-2 was built, the film footage got just a little better and with that much detail, the studio of MCA's architect Steven F. Miller was able to improve all three facets of the building: the ceiling, the floor,
