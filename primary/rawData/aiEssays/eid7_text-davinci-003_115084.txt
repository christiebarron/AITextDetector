I remember one time a few years ago when my daughter had a difficult time focusing on her homework. She was so frustrated that it was making her really mad. She was yelling and screaming and asking for help when she didn't understand something. I could've gotten mad at her and raised my voice, but instead I took a deep breath and stayed calm. I reminded her that it was ok to make mistakes and that I was there to help her if she needed it. I stayed patient with her and patiently walked her through the difficult assignments. Eventually she started to understand and her frustration began to abate. She was able to finish her homework with my help and felt proud of herself. I am so thankful that I was able to stay patient with her during that difficult time. It was a good lesson for her and I, that patience and understanding are key in achieving success.
