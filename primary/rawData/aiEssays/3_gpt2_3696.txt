Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

For example, the 'Rough Road Ahead' setting on the car is only available when the cyclist is not traveling at a particularly high speed in a relatively flat area where riding at an extreme angle is commonplace.

For those who enjoy the occasional hard day off at a cafe, there is a different option, but it is often not the optimum setting to use when you do not have time to recharge the battery for at least an hour or so.

One factor that may be a factor in reducing your driving experience is that riding on pavements with short, narrow, light, and comfortable curves (i.e., not fast enough to safely swing or cross through the road) provides the extra safety space to switch off for both riders and traffic.

However, I do not find this very useful for people riding alongside a pedestrian on a street, or on a bus track or a bridge over the River Thames.
