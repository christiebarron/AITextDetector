The memoir 'From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives', written by Narciso Rodriguez, is a unique story of a boy coming of age in a time of immense political and social change. Through his experiences, Rodriguez crafts a mood of warmth and nostalgia.

At the start of the memoir, Rodriguez teases us with glimpses of his life growing up in Paterson, New Jersey, in the 1970s. Here he makes use of vivid visual imagery to describe his neighborhood and the people who inhabited it. This imagery paints a picture of an idyllic community of strong family ties and a healthy appreciation of culture and beauty. The mood is one of nostalgia, warmth and closeness that lets the reader into Rodriguez's personal and intimate childhood memories.

As the story progresses, Rodriguez shifts to focus on his journey towards adulthood. Instead of only looking back, he now looks forward. While still remaining true to the spirit of nostalgia, the mood of the story is subtly layered to reflect the mixed emotions of growth: uncertainty, strength, and resilience.

Throughout the memoir, Rodriguez creates a mood that is both intimate and reflective. Through poetic descriptions, he shows his readers the innocence of his childhood and adolescence, but in doing so, highlights the profound effects they had on him, and encouraging his readers to reflect on their own life experiences. He encourages the reader to appreciate both their past and future, and to realize the powerful emotions that love and family bring.
