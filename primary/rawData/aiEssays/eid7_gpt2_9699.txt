An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was making music and she asked me if I was going to make a piece of music with you. Well you are right but there are lots of other things you could do with this music. I don't think she ever asked my questions about it.

In her research, she got a lot of answers and that was just the first few months of making music and she's a huge inspiration to you.

A good question from her! Thank you so much for answering my questions.

Are you going to be performing at another show when TONY returns home? (Photo: TONY VESKA/Special to the Record)

My schedule for the time being is a little different than before but we'll keep it short!

The band is recording for TONY on June 9th and is expected to release their first album in June, but there's no word yet on whether we'll see them with your band.

Do you think he'll be playing at more of you's shows next year or are you just worried that you'll be appearing late? (photo: Dave Vitti/WUSA9.com)

We're really excited to have him again and looking forward to all of his creative opportunities! We're all very excited to have the chance to work with him again. No news on specifics yet but we feel very fortunate to be a part of him again
