Dear Editor,

I am writing this letter to shed light on the effects computers have had on people of all ages and to urge readers to consider the consequences of relying too heavily on technology. 

Today, computer usage is almost unavoidable, with many professions relying significantly on computers in order to function. However, like with any tool, people must ensure that their utilization does not become excessive. Unfortunately, this is often not the case and people quickly become engulfed in their digital world, spending all their free time playing games or browsing social media. This can drastically decrease motivation to engage in more meaningful activities and lead to depression, neglect of physical health, and loss of connectiveness with the people around us.

In addition, overexposure to electronics can sometimes cause difficulty in normal communication with other individuals. People become so accustomed to talking to a screen that they forget how to effectively communicate face-to-face. This can also decrease a personâ€™s empathy, since they cannot always sense the emotions of those speaking to them through a screen.

It is clear that computers have a great impact on the way we live our lives. Instead of becoming so dependent on them, we should be cautious of any potential issues that this reliance can cause and be sure to find a balance between technology and real life. 

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
