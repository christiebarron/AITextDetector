The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles, or airships, to dock atop the iconic skyscraper. As explained by author Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted in The Mooring Mast, building an effective mooring mast atop the Empire State Building presented unique challenges due to the height and potential winds of the structure, and the unstable nature of the airships.

In order for the mooring mast to be effective, engineers had to create a tower tall enough to reach the dirigibles at an altitude of one thousand feet or more, as well as a platform large and stable enough to anticipate the unpredictable movements of an airship. The mooring mast would also need to withstand strong winds and temperatures of up to -70 degrees Fahrenheit.

The building of the mooring mast also presented unexpected logistical obstacles. Engineers had to find a way to hoist materials to such a great height, as well as how to transport distressed pilots and passengers down safely in the event of an emergency. There was also the challenge of the actual mooring, as pilots had to master the skill of maneuvering and docking an airship atop the skyscraper. 

The rigor of the engineering, logistical, and piloting challenges was ultimately balanced with the benefit of allowing dirigibles to stop and rest at the Empire State Building while flying up and down the East coast. After much research and consultation with the Federal Aviation Administration and
