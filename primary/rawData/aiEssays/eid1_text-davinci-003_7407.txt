The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho comes with the protagonist reflecting on the hardships they faced when being forced to take a difficult test. The protagonist faces the challenge of the test without any support or encouragement from anyone, especially not family. Through the use of the imagery of the blossoming hibiscus and the returning geese, the protagonist gains hope from the idea that things can improve and change. This hope leads them to face the challenges that are presented and inspires them to take the test again when they can rely on their family for support. Furthermore, the ending emphasizes the importance of family and the strength they can provide, which the protagonist lacked throughout most of the story.
