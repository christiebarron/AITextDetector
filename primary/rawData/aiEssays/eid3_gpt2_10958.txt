Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. For some, the extra time spent on the road and commuting may take this extra time away from the cyclist. Others are not too much, or feel the difference as an added benefit. Here's a rundown on some of the more important things to consider when wisdom is gained and lost in the Road Ahead mode.

1. You Should Think about the Road Ahead Start, then Drive It

The road ahead is where the bike wheels are on the left and your knees are overhang. It could be that you're heading into the snow at a lower speed and you're looking through your windshield. You could even know things would get off a little slower if you went ahead a bit more. In my experience, this takes away a few minutes of riding or even standing up. This also adds up to about 15 minutes to a full day of riding.

For those who like to ride and just enjoy the idea of being a long driving commute, go ahead and drive your car on the 'Road Ahead', because there's going to come a time when you'll be unable to get to work.
