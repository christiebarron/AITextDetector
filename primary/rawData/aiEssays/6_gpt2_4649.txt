The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first was the fact that they were not allowed to use a crane to attach the building. After the building was completed, these crane-mounted models of the building were used to build the lobby and lobby-sized windows of the second and third floors of the Empire State Building. These models were then stored outside the building and in the lobby. The third barrier was that the building was not subject to the standards of federal building codes, but also a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation that required that the building be built with no exterior or interior wall or basement insulation.

The FAA and state inspectors then had a number of problems with these models, beginning with the construction of the roof. In particular, it was difficult to make a connection between the dimensions of the exterior and front walls in the building.

"The building in the second, third and fourth stories was probably the most complex.... When you don't think about that sort of ceiling and attic insulation, you're not sure if a concrete barrier was used, was there an outside wall, which is the exterior wall, then what you are seeing in the building is not that concrete barrier. You don't see it that way. The main structural barriers were very well connected. There can be a few instances where they don't connect as well but they all came together and that was probably due to the structural problems of
