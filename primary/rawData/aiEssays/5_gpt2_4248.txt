The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is something that you are no doubt familiar with: a time to reflect, a time to try the 'experience'. You can find it all here and the entire book is a beautifully crafted and heartfelt look into the lives of all those who were hit by one of the most devastating social-media attacks in history. The book has earned a legion of devoted readers from across the world and we are looking forward to seeing how the book translates to the hearts of people who need it the most. I am sure it has inspired some readers and I hope that the book can help people to come at this pivotal moment to their own suffering. You know that being sick, being with a broken family or having to do some emotional pain from a long, hard time for one's family is hard enough. Yet, we have so few stories that can carry off such an emotional rollercoaster by being left alone with the reality. I know that I can relate because it would be so helpful for anyone who is struggling to come through this emotional rollercoaster to understand why we get this reaction so often.

We cannot stop ourselves but are left to learn and change, and we will continue to do so.
