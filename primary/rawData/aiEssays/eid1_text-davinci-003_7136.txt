The features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead” play a critical role in the cyclist’s journey. These features, which include the mountainous terrain, the desert, and the cold, all have effects that can both help and hinder the cyclist's progress.

The mountainous terrain makes the journey harder for the cyclist as it requires a great deal of effort to ascend the steep inclines. The cyclist is also put at risk for a crash due to the unpredictable curves around the bends of the mountain roads. The bumpy ride also adds to the difficulty.

The desert is less of a threat, but still presents a challenge as the cyclist must navigate through its increasingly unfamiliar terrain. The presence of wild animals and creatures such as snakes must be taken into account. The hot conditions of the desert may also make the journey slower, as the rider will have to rest and take on water more often in order to avoid overheating.

The cold weather is perhaps the most challenging of all, as it can take a great toll on the cyclist's body. Frostbite and hypothermia can occur at the wrong temperatures and wind chills. The cold also can make it more difficult for the cyclist to maintain their balance and performance, making the ride even more challenging.

Overall, the features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead” pose difficulties for the cyclist, but
