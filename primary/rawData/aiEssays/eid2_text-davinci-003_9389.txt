While people agree that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, should not be available to the public if found to be offensive or inappropriate, the decision to censor these materials should not be taken lightly. Libraries exist so that individuals can access ideas and diverse sources of information that may otherwise be unavailable or difficult to locate. Censoring particular materials could ultimately deprive individuals of these very important resources.

Doing so would be detrimental to the principle of freedom of expression and the idea that individuals should have the right to access information of any kind.

Redacting certain materials from library shelves would only diminish this principle.
