The Empire State Building was originally intended to be equipped with a mooring mast that would allow zeppelin airships, also known as dirigibles, to dock from the top of the skyscraper. Although the ambitious plan was never realized, the builders of the Empire State Building encountered a variety of unique obstacles in attempting to make the mooring mast a reality.

The first challenge the builders encountered was the actual construction of the mooring mast. Because the mast was to be built near the top of the building, it required an exceptionally durable material that could withstand the high winds and weather conditions that passed the building. As Marcia Amidon Lüsted noted in her publication The Mooring Mast, “It wouldn’t take just any kind of metal to stand up as the highest point on the Empire State Building”. Therefore, the builders had to develop a special alloy that could they could guarantee would last despite the extreme environment of the top of the building.

Another issue the planners faced was the sheer size of the dirigibles. Because of their size, each airship would require a substantial amount of space to dock. Unfortunately, the original design of the Empire State Building was not large enough to accommodate that amount of space. As a result, the builders had to reconfigure the design of the building, which created a significant amount of extra time and costs.

The final obstacle, perhaps the most important, involves the stability
