The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because we know how this story went. A number of players in our past have talked about how difficult it is to find information about people who played with Hibiscus. This might be one of them. This has already given us information that helps us to figure out which team was responsible and where the team was headed.


We will learn more when we're done with this book.
