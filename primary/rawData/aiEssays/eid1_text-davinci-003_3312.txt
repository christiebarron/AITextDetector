Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects that computers have had on people over the years. As technology has become more and more accessible, its influence on society has grown exponentially. 

Today, computers are found everywhere from the workplace to the home. They allow us to complete tasks more efficiently and give us access to a wealth of information that was not readily available in the past. 

However, I believe the effects of computers can be both negative and positive. On one hand, people can now communicate with each other much more easily and efficiently. We can send emails, make phone calls, and send messages over social media. This has allowed us to be more connected than ever before and has undoubtedly had a mostly positive effect on the way that we interact with each other. 

On the other hand, with computers, we have become more and more reliant on them. We rely on computers for tasks that were previously done without them, and are gradually becoming more dependent on these machines than on ourselves. This can have both a physical and mental impact on us, as spending too much time in front of a screen can lead to fatigue, eyestrain, and even depression.
