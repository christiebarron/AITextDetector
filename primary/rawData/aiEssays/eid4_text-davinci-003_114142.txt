The final line of Winter Hibiscus serves to emphasize the fragility of the hibiscus flower and the heroine's hopeful outlook on life. The hibiscus flower is a metaphor for the heroine's own fragile situationâ€”the point of the story is that her future is uncertain, but she has faith that she will get through it and pass her test in the spring. By ending the poem with the hopeful image of the returning geese and the budding hibiscus, the heroine shows her resiliency in the face of uncertainty. The ending also serves as a reminder of the power of nature to keep going, even through the bleakest of winters.
