The construction of the Empire State Building was an arduous undertaking. As the world’s tallest building when it was completed in 1931, the engineering triumph presented a unique challenge in that the building had to accommodate the mooring of dirigibles. Many obstacles had to be overcome in order to create a system that would allow dirigibles to safely dock to the Empire State Building, as described in Marcia Amidon Lüsted's book, The Mooring Mast.

The first obstacle was locating the proper docking mast for the dirigibles. This needed to be situated on the roof of the building, but the weight and size of an enormous docking device would create a huge structural burden. Engineers solved this dilemma by using a lightweight spire that was designed from aluminum and steel and stood 200 feet high and weighed only two tons – minimal compared to the weight of other docking mast.

The next obstacle was providing enough wind stability for the mast. Strong winds could cause the dirigible to be pushed off course and spiral into the side of the building. To minimize this risk, thorough calculations were made to determine the optimal length of the mooring cable and the optimal method to fasten it to the building. The engineers eventually settled on a mooring cable that was 365 feet long and fastened using an arrangement of attaching rings and bolts.

A third challenge was creating a design for the Empire State Building that would manage the fore pressure between the nose cone
