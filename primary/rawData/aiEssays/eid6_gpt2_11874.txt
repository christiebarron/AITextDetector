The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. For instance, many commercial and industrial buildings had the space and materials necessary to operate as domed buildings when the sky was the limit. Some were completely abandoned, while others were kept in the open as private residences.

The lack of a complete and accurate accounting of the condition of an enormous building can be seen in the chart below, created for rebooting a movie-comedy titled "Bagelot." Although the city is known to have been home to a large Catholic population up to 1.8 million years ago, the site on its northwest corner of the Capitol was actually an actual building for an estimated 25 years.

The new scene on the east side of the buildings shows a number of significant damage done by the blast and the large debris from the blast that can be seen on the map above. The destruction of the downtown building in the video comes after some of the remaining residential and commercial properties were put up for sale. There are also signs indicating that the city is not yet ready for occupancy.

The demolition of several former abandoned buildings that were meant to be renovated may have impacted on the number of apartments on an open lot at the northwest corner â€” including some of the former residences on the left-hand side. A new plan proposed by the National Park Service in August 2012 and approved by the National Historic Landmarks Preservation Board had the building demolished, the government said.
