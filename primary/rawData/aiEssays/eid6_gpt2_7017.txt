The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. This led to a new method of building with three wheeled trams that could cross the open air and allow passengers to quickly walk by. The new trams were designed to get to the top of the building without ever landing on the ground.

The new system of stairs made it easier to get more comfortable, including by connecting each trumeled platform to the same platform. This allowed passengers to sit back and not get too dizzy while continuing on in a similar order. The Tram Bicycles and Trolley Tram became popular in the 1920s. In 1964, the Empire State Building was opened to commuters by then-Prime Minister Henry Howard.
