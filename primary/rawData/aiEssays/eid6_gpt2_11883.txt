The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. There were still plenty of open space for planes and airplanes and there were no open ramps for airplanes to go through; just a small ramp in the middle of the street. Another obstacle, which was still there, was that all the ramps that led to the east side were closed off for airplanes flying into an area where they couldn't safely dock their aircraft in the building.

They'd always found this very frustrating, because that opened the door for more planes on the east side, which ultimately had to be moved to the north-west.

"A few weeks ago we opened up a number of ramps for airplanes in two different areas; we took out the ramps and re-opened them back to the street. A few weeks after that we started a process of developing more of the city's open space and expanding it to the existing levels. We're doing a couple of other steps to make sure that the open spaces we built in Queens are fully utilized within time to get more planes on the market. We'll be meeting with the City Manager to address any of the issues raised at this point about our open spaces."

The open space is located behind a new tower to the east.

While there are many more opportunities to rent large elevators, there's only one location within Queens for large passenger aircraft and it will cost one thing to own a one-bedroom home on the east
