There was a time I was walking down the street when I heard a loud noise behind me and saw a car had crashed into a parked car. I approached the scene and saw a woman inside the car who was in obvious distress. She had tears streaming down her face and was shaking uncontrollably. I could tell she was overwhelmed and scared.

Without thinking, I got into the driver’s seat of the parked car and opened the door, so the woman could get out of her car. I didn't hesitate to help her, and I stayed with her until the police arrived.

The woman was very apologetic and embarrassed as she told me the story of what had happened. She said that she was trying to make a phone call while driving, and she lost control of the car.

I stayed with her the whole time, listening to her and comforting her. Even though I had to stay at the scene longer and really wanted to leave, I was patient and understanding. I didn't get angry or push her to leave, but instead maintained a calm and patient demeanor until help arrived. In the end, despite the unfortunate circumstances, I got to meet a wonderful person, and I’m glad I was patient.
