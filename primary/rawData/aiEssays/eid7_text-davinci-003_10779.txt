I used to work for a small tech startup. We were always strapped for resources and working around the clock. My boss was notorious for being demanding and having high expectations. One day, something that had been in the works for weeks suddenly came crashing down. We had missed a crucial step and had to restart the whole process. Everyone was visibly frustrated and feeling overwhelmed. 

Amidst the chaos, my boss remained calm. He took a few moments to assess the situation and explain what had happened. Then, he assured us that we would get through it together. He provided clear instructions and set measurable goals while managing our expectations for how long it would take to complete the project.

Throughout the entire process, he remained patient. He kept us focused, while still being mindful and understanding of our limitations. We eventually completed the project successfully and on schedule. It was impressive to witness the way he was able to maintain his composure and lead us towards the successful completion of our task. It's something I won't soon forget.
