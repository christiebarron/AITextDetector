The Empire State Building was an impressive feat of engineering when it opened in 1931, towering an impressive 102 stories high over New York City. However, the building was designed with more than just people in mind; its creators had grand plans allowing for dirigibles, or airships, to dock at its peak. This remarkable dream, though, did not come without obstacles, and overcoming them took a great deal of creativity, resources, and hard work.

The first obstacle encountered was the proper construction of the mast, the structure that would allow the dirigibles to land, which the architects had difficulty achieving. The mast needed to be strong enough to hold the weight of the airship, large enough to provide a safe landing, and tall enough to clear the spire of the building. The architecture firm consulted with experts on railroad bridge building and other structural engineering to determine a safe, effective design for the mast. 

The second obstacle was finding a method to keep the mast from swaying in the wind. The architects looked into the technology of the day, researching ways to secure the mast, including the use of hydraulic rams and sturdier cable constructions. The option of using hydraulic rams was eventually discarded as being too expensive, so the architects opted for steel anchor cables instead.

The last obstacle to overcome lay in the question of how to support the weight of these new vessels. The Empire State Buildingâ€™s architects looked for inspiration to other projects
