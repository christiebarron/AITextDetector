For most of the first half of the 20th Century, dirigibles were not allowed in the Federal Building. But in 1959, a group of engineers who had led the early development of the first dirigibles in the 1930s created the first commercial commercial dirigible and built a plane for the first time in 1960. There were more dirigibles in use in the late 1960s, but the public acceptance of the concept of self-flying planes made commercial dirigibles less viable. As commercial jet propulsion became more important to aerospace engineers, the idea of the commercial airplane became quite popular, and the public has seen how powerful commercial airliners can be by comparison with the airplanes of today.

The commercial airliner has gained in stature as a global technology and has become a more attractive and attractive alternative to the Boeing 737. From the time the first commercial B.C.-based aircraft began flying on the West Coast in 1965, the industry was dominated by private players including Aeropark, the former Canadian Air Canada and Royal Dutch Air Canada, the Chinese American Airlines, Kirtland Aircraft, T-35 Systems, SAC Aviation and many others.

The public has long seen an almost complete disregard of the aircraft industry. The average annual household owned an
