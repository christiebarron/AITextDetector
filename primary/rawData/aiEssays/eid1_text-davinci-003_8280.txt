The Empire State Building was the first of its kind, a building designed specifically with an eye towards helping dirigibles, which were a popular form of transportation at the time of its design, to dock. The original designers of the building had high hopes that people could easily commute this way between the Empire State Building and other points of interest and locations, but as it eventually proved, the idea of allowing dirigibles to effectively dock at the building was plagued by manifold obstacles.

The first and most obvious obstacle was the fact that the Empire State Building was built in 1931, a time in which the technology necessary to allow dirigibles to safely and effectively dock wasnâ€™t already in place. The designers had envisioned the creation of a mooring mast, which is essentially an apparatus that affixes to a building and acts as a point of contact for the dirigible to tie up to during docking and mooring. But the mooring mast itself was something of an unknown technology, and no existing prototype existed.

Analyzing the existing dirigible models of the time, the original designers determined that the existing dirigibles would be too heavy to safely be moored at the top of the Empire State Building with the existing technology, and thus the decision was made to create a mooring mast that would be strong and sturdy enough to bear the weight of the dirigibles. The challenge was a daunting one, as the mooring mast had to
