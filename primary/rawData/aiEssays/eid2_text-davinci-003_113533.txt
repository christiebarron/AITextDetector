Censorship is a topic that has sparked a lot of debate in the library world for years. Many library patrons and library workers alike have expressed concern over the placement of books, music, movies, and magazines with controversial content. While some are completely against censorship in libraries, others believe that certain materials should be removed if they are found offensive. 

The American Library Association has taken the stance that libraries should not act as censor and should not remove books from shelves for any traditional reason. The ALA notes that censorship is especially harmful for school and public libraries, which are places of free inquiry and expression. 

However, there are some who believe that libraries should be able to remove materials if they are deemed too offensive. Those individuals feel that libraries should be able to protect the children who use libraries from vulgar and immoral materials. They worry that if these materials remain accessible, children will be corrupted and exposed to ideas that may lead them astray.

In order to protect the public, libraries should choose carefully which materials they allow on their shelves. Librarians should take the time to research the content of books, music, movies, and magazines before allowing them to be available for public use. If something is deemed to be too offensive or illegal, then it should be banned. This way, libraries can protect their patrons from material that could be inappropriate or even criminal.
