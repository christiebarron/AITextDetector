Dear Editor,

As computers are ever more present in our lives, it is important to consider the effects they have on us. While advances in technology have enabled us to do more than ever before, one cannot ignore the potential downsides to having this technology at our fingertips.

Many of us have become reliant on the convenience that computers offer, and the dangers of this reliance must not be disregarded. While sometimes computers may make our lives less stressful, they may also lead to decreased social interaction and human connection. We are now spending more time “plugged in” and not enough time talking to one another. Moreover, computer use may lead to a decrease in physical activity since more time is spent sedentary.

On the other hand, computer technology can also provide potentially invaluable educational opportunities. Students and adults alike can access vast amounts of information that may otherwise have been difficult to obtain. Computers may also help people bridge the digital divide and increase access to education, employment, and other resources that would be otherwise difficult to come by.

Overall, computers can be a tremendous asset if used with caution and understanding of the potential risks associated with their use. When these devices are employed thoughtfully, their benefits can easily outweigh the risks.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
