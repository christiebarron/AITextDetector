One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was playing a card game with my boyfriend. It was my first time ever playing this kind of game. It was just like it was real. A part, though, of me wondered how much pleasure I'd get from playing the game. I wanted to feel like I was playing my heart out and that it was possible to be an adult. How would we ever be able to play this game with a child at the age of 3. Maybe we would have learned that lesson sooner or later? Then I had to think about trying to teach ourselves how to play through playing games. How about I teach ourselves about other adult experience to the players, even if I have never had the opportunity (or desire) to play this game with them? That's not an answer I can offer (yet). I don't think there is anyone else in history who has actually done that. In my case, they were young people who started out playing a game they didn't know was possible and it became so overwhelming to know that playing through games that I wasn't prepared at all to take risks or even get out of them (including using a little, though not nearly as painful, torture to try to control it while we played). Then I started having issues. The last time I had played through a game was the second I discovered using an instrument that I was trained to play that I wasn't prepared to put the finger on, despite being completely unprepared.
