Laughter has always been our gateway to connection. I remember being in school and meeting my best friend. We started out as complete strangers, but it wasn’t long before we were sharing silly inside jokes and having giant laughter fits regardless of what was going on. Whenever we felt overwhelmed with school or the stress of life, our laughter would be there to comfort and remind us that we weren’t alone.

One time in particular stands out in my memory. We were sitting in the lunchroom, when my friend made a silly face in an attempt to break the tension of a particularly difficult test looming ahead of us. It worked. Before long, we were both in fits of uncontrollable laughter. I noticed the other kids around us, some snickering, some rolling their eyes, and some throwing us disbelieving glances. But none of it mattered; we were in our own little world of belonging, and it felt wonderful.

It’s been over 10 years since then, but our friendship is still strong. Whenever we’re together, our laughter is like a warm embrace that brings us back to all those moments we spent together in the lunchroom. It always manages to remind us of what connects us at our core and reflects the love and strength of our friendship.
