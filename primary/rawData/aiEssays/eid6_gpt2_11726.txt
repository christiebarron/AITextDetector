The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The building had been completed in 1843, the building was the first of its size in England and was an important site of activity for those of that race.

With the need for smaller building and the development of space and light and air, dirigible makers discovered a new way to build something large and strong.

The two designs in the early 1800s were also influenced by the "dagger-door" model and with a high volume of new light vehicles and aeroplanes made this concept an excellent success.

Despite its low volume and low Fearfinch's design, the early dirigibles were used in military use both during the war and during the next century. In the aftermath of the Civil War they were again used to serve as aids to the French but again it was as though dirigibles were being used in military use.

From 1798 - 1810 several early, highly unusual dirigibles were constructed in the field from various types of small craft including a jet engine. These aircraft were used in the French army during the Spanish war of 1898 up through to 1898.

The first such dirigibles came to market two years later in 1801, this was later modified into the Flying Train which was then used for transport to Fort Collins.

By the mid 2000s numerous other and less unusual dirigibles were built on American property
