The sun was beginning to set, casting a beautiful orange glow over my morning run. It had been a great week, so I was in a good mood. As I rounded the corner of the park, I heard a loud guffaw coming from a nearby bench. As I got closer, I saw a couple sitting with their dog between them. 

The dog was happily panting and the couple were both wiping tears of laughter from their eyes. It was one of those happy moments that seemed to vibrate with positive energy. Time suddenly seemed to stand still. 

Being the curious person I am, I couldn't help but investigate. As I passed them, I gave them a smile and asked what was so funny. After introducing themselves, the middle-aged couple explained they had just told each other a funny story about something that happened earlier that week. They were laughing so hard, they were in danger of upsetting their dog with their noise. 

We quickly fell into conversation, talking about the funny things that had happened in our lives. We shared more funny stories and I found more and more that we had in common. In no time, we were rolling with laughter and the sun had all but set. 

We said our goodbyes and I continued my run feeling more connected than ever before. To this day, I still think about that moment with fondness, and smile at the laughter that filled the air.
