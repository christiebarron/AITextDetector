When the Empire State Building opened in 1931, its designers had intended for dirigibles to be able to dock alongside the building’s mast in order to make disembarking easier for passengers. This, however, proved to be much more difficult than originally planned. A number of complex challenges had to be overcome in order to make this vision a reality.

The most obvious obstacle was the sheer height of the building. The Empire State Building stands 102 stories tall—over 500 feet higher than the maximum recommended altitude for safe dirigible docking. To overcome this issue, they would need a dock that was strong enough to withstand the extreme winds that often accompany an airliner's ascension. To meet this requirement, they decided to build a special seven-story mooring mast that extended above the building’s highest floor. This would provide the necessary height and stability for the dirigible to dock safely.

The engineers also had to consider the massive weight of an airship when it is docked. Dirigibles are much heavier than airplanes, and the mooring platform had to be reinforced in order to support the extra load. To do this, the engineers had to strengthen the walls and ceiling of the mooring mast with thick steel beams.

Finally, there was the issue of navigating a large airship into such a small area. To accommodate this, the engineers designed special guiding arms that would attach to the dirigible’s envelope and allow the
