Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. There are various changes to the settings which are quite helpful â€“ but this has often been one of the biggest sources of doubt.

A further feature that some riders use is the 'Mile Ahead' setting, which automatically changes the distance ahead to where you think it should be ahead of the average cyclist rather than ahead of you on the route. With this setting, a cyclist's'movement within a given level of distance' has to be matched against the pace of his riding rather than with another cyclist's position, thus giving him an easier time to drive through rough roads with a good top speed.

A similar change, to the Cycling Gear page which also has the option to change how we recommend the setting, has to do with cyclists cycling over small hills as opposed to huge ones.

It is really hard to make a good understanding of how to use a specific setting to make sure that riders benefit. As a result there are many 'Rough Road Ahead' settings (read 'Traffic Strict' for details on how they are used in the app) that I feel make some riders feel a little more comfortable trying to approach more road.

However, there is a very small number of other settings which do not affect or even hinder a cyclist's ability to use this setting.
