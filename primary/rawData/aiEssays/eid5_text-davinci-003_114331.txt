From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, a memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, centers around his family’s move from Cuba to New Jersey in the late 1960s, a time of turmoil and unrest. Through his eyes, Narciso shares his experience of settling into a new culture and straddling two worlds while trying to fit in.

Throughout the memoir, a strong sense of nostalgia and homesickness pervades. Rodriguez takes readers on a journey of memory-filled moments that span his whole childhood, switching effortlessly from gentle reminiscence to acerbic outbursts that capture the mundanity of living in two places at once. A pervasive feeling of sadness lingers when looking back on these experiences, making it clear that Rodriguez, despite his successes, never quite felt at home in either place.

The writing style of the memoir adds to the mood created by Rodriguez's experiences. His recollections are imbued with a sense of rose-tinted innocence, of a happier childhood that was stolen away by the political upheaval of their move. As he looks back fondly on a past that he can never truly recreate, readers are pulled along in a swirl of emotions. Nostalgia, loss and homesickness all play a part in the creation of the mood in From Home.

The memoir calls out to readers, beckoning them in to share in the beauty and pain of Narciso’s cultural duality and the poignant nostalgia
