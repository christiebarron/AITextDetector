The author, Minfong Ho, ends the poem with this thought as a reflection on how resilient and determined a person can be. Through the poem, the speaker has managed to transform a seemingly insignificant plant--the Winter Hibiscus--into a symbol of hope and renewal. The implication is that by taking on the challenge of the test again, the speaker is celebrating the power of tenacity and perseverance. In the same way that the Winter Hibiscus comes back every spring, the speaker is driven to keep trying and aiming for a successful result. The repetition of the phrase, “when they come back…when the snow melts…when this hibiscus…” serves to emphasize the idea that hope and optimism are possible in the face of adversity.
