There is much evidence that suggests computers are creating a lifestyle of desensitization, contributing to a decrease in physical activity, and reducing our overall quality of life. The excessive amount of time people are spending on and in front of computers creates a metaphorical bubble that amplifies and encourages isolation from the physical world and its people. The lack of in-person interaction causes problems with communication skills and face-to-face problem solving abilities.
