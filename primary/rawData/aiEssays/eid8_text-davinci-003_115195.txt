It was a night like any other at the dinner table, only my family was having a particularly entertaining conversation. My dad had just boasted about his latest tennis victory, and my mom didn't seem to be in the mood for any more jokes. However, when my youngest brother casually mentioned that he had learned to skip rocks across the local pond, my dad teased him in a way that made the table erupt in laughter.

At first, my mom was a little put off, but as the laughter subsided and we all shared looks of joy, something changed in her. Suddenly, with a lightness of heart and an amused grin, she exclaimed her own story. As it turns out, when my dad was just a teenager, he had in fact learned how to skip rocks across the pond too!

This funny revelation brought the entire table to laughter once again; this time with my mom at the center of it. We all enjoyed the moment and, as I watched the two of them laughing together, I found myself taken aback. Even after all these years, laughter still seemed to be the best way to bridge the gap between my parents â€“ something that I cherished in my heart.
