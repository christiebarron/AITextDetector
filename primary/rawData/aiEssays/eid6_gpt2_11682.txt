The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. This included the lack of adequate space for three separate vertical landing points of approximately 50 feet (19 meters), a low roof structure and a building housing only seven people.

Door designs varied from the minimalist design of the time, with a few vertical and horizontal landing points, several elevators and elevated elevators, but mostly the concept of a high ceiling was never addressed by the architects. The only surviving single vertical landing point in the Empire State Building, on top of the six-story structure, was the roof structure, which was completed in 1854.

The building is considered a national cultural landmark in North America. With nearly 50 years of planning history including the construction of the Empire State Building and the building as the largest building in the US, the Empire State Building is considered one of the most important buildings in America.
