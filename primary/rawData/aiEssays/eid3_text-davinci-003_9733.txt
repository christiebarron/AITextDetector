In the narrative poem 'Rough Road Ahead' by Joe Kurmaski, the features of the setting play an important part in the cyclist's journey. The poem begins with the cyclist on a road, with rolling hills providing an element of challenge. The terrain is daunting in its difficulty, and the use of imagery and description further amplifies the cyclist's struggle to make their way. For example, the poet writes, "tumbling rocks,â€¦ a sinister mountain, covered in grey-green spikes". This stark imagery and setting helps to illustrate the seriousness of the cyclist's challenge and the difficulties they face.

The weather conditions featured in the poem also emphasize the rider's struggles against nature. In the third stanza, the poet mentions the "brutal heat and stifling air", making the rider's task of climbing the hills that much more difficult. The biting winds mentioned later in the poem prove especially challenging for the cyclist, providing a physical reminder of the challenge against nature they must face.

The role of labour within the cyclers journey further amplifies their struggles. As they try to summit the mountain, they battle the physical labour, exhaustion, and draining of strength. The exhaustion of the body is illustrated with the imagery of "heavy muscles", emphasising the strain and pain the cyclist goes through. 

Overall, the setting features of 'Rough Road Ahead' by Joe Kurmaski are integral to the poem's narrative of the cyclist's journey
