The ending of Winter Hibiscus serves to bring the story full circle. The protagonist is reflecting on how she was able to find the strength to take a difficult test despite feeling discouraged due to her troubles with English. She realizes that she was able to gain courage from her mother’s example—her mother pushed herself despite difficulties to find success. By connecting the story to the idea of the hibiscus flower waiting to spring back to life in the spring, the author created an uplifting ending that reinforces the message of hope and resilience in the face of adversity.
