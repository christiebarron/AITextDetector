I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a real problem in some of our country's cities.

"However, such censorship is not limited to libraries, especially within our borders."

Last year, three women made headlines for holding up signs calling for the termination of British Columbia to protect its First Nations culture. Another said they had received death threats at the hands of strangers.

In September, the B.C. government voted unanimously to ban the National Association of Public Art and Art Museum's public display of bison in its Langdale and Langley communities without a permit.

The province is also considering legislation to protect Aboriginal languages from censorship.

Last October, the government held public hearings on banning traditional medicine and medicine-based treatments for cancer.

The proposal was put forward by an independent group of politicians that calls for Canadian students to obtain and use Indian medicine textbooks.
