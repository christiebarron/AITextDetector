Dear Editor, 

I am writing to share my opinion on the effects of computers on people today. As a young adult living in the 21st century, I have seen firsthand the many advantages that computers offer us. From increased productivity to better communication and data storage capabilities, computers have revolutionized the way we live and work. 

At the same time, these developments have also created some problems. The most obvious being the physical health issues caused by long hours spent in front of a computer. It is well known that sitting for prolonged periods of time can increase the risk of cardiovascular and musculoskeletal problems. Furthermore, people can become isolated or disconnected from the world around them for excessively relying on technology as a source of entertainment. 

On a more positive note, computers have also opened up countless educational opportunities for people across the world. Online education platforms allow people to access quality courses from the comfort of their own homes, thus eliminating the traditional barriers associated with learning. Additionally, the internet has allowed us to share information more easily and swiftly, fostering collaborations across the globe. 

Overall, computers have both positive and negative effects. To minimize the potential harm caused by computers, it is important to ensure that our use of them is balanced and in moderation. However, I strongly believe that computers and other forms of technology are an integral part of our lives and should be embraced. 

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
