The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' by a former CIA official was not in doubt.


"We did that because the fact was we had made it very easy for CIA leaders and officials to hide out in the open while those who lived in the country were in hiding," said Mr Wainwright. "It was a sort of covert operation where he could tell to his enemies that he was not allowed to talk to them. It created fear in the world and this made us think very highly about ourselves, about our own personal and perhaps national security.


"We felt like we were trapped and we took advantage of that. One of the people who we were talking to was a CIA official who we saw on a regular basis in the CIA office. But if we were in a relationship and we had to talk about something that we were not allowed to talk about, why was that happening?"
