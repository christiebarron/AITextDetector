I was recently hiking with my family in the mountains. We had been walking for what felt like hours and my legs were starting to hurt. I was about to give up when I saw an elderly couple walking ahead of us. They were moving slowly but steadily and I realized they had to be in their 70s. I wanted to stop, but I thought about the elderly couple and told myself that if they could keep going, then so could I. I took slow, deep breaths and slow, steady steps and stayed with my family. We eventually made it to the top of the mountain and the view was absolutely breathtaking. Although my legs were tired, I was proud of myself for staying patient and pushing through the difficulty of the hike.
