I was getting ready to move apartments, and I was feeling very overwhelmed with the task. My best friend offered to come over and help me, despite it being a Saturday night and the last thing she probably wanted to do. When she arrived, I immediately saw that she was exhausted and not in the mood to be packing boxes. However, she put on a brave face and assured me that she was here to help. 

The entire time she was at my house, she was patient - even though I had to keep running out to the store for more packing supplies. She made it seem like an adventure instead of a daunting task, so that I didnâ€™t focus on how difficult it was. We took lots of breaks, enjoyed some snacks, and even blasted some feel-good music.

The next day, when it was time to do the actual moving, she helped me again. Whenever I encountered a challenging situation or was becoming frustrated, she had a way of calming me down and helping me think of solutions. I was truly inspired by how patient she was in a difficult situation, and I am so grateful that she was there to support me.
