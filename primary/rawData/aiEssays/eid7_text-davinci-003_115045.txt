I recently got a new puppy and had to endure a few weeks of sleepless nights and messes throughout the house. I knew that this was going to take some patience on my part in order to get him properly trained, but I was determined to be patient and consistent in my efforts. Every night I stayed up with him as he whined and paced through the house. Every morning I made sure to clean up the messes that he had made while I was sleeping. 

For the first week, he wouldn't go to the bathroom outside like he was supposed to, and I was getting frustrated. But I kept my cool and reminded myself to be patient. I remained consistent in my efforts, reassuring him and praising him every time he made the right choice. After a few days, he finally started going to the bathroom outside, and it felt like a huge victory. 

I was rewarded for my patience when after a few more weeks of consistent work, he knew all his basic commands and was able to stay in his designated area without needing to be supervised.  While it was hard to be patient in the beginning, in the end it was worth it as I saw the reward of my patience.
