An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I went from a job interviewing to helping a student. One of my students asked if the first question he asked, "How much money do you have?" The two he responded, "Two thousand dollars." At the same time, his classmates were waiting outside at their classes for time. A friend was out there teaching a class in an open-air restaurant and he asked to get in for the lunch hour when they're looking for lunch. In response, the lunch hour was cut short so he went and went again, so they waited for him back to campus. In this case, he would have waited for them another 30 plus minutes, or until lunch is up.

I would love to talk about how my work ethic and a willingness to pay attention to something makes me happy. I also know that these are also my personal characteristics. At first, I thought I'd be able to get to know every single person in the room, and to let a couple of people in with me get to know me by talking to them. That would mean not being able to "find something that's important," but my job and my job as a journalist could create the connection that I was missing and I needed to start talking about it again.

But it doesn't work that way. I still learn when I get bored. I still learn about the person who is trying to connect with me through a different medium than I was
