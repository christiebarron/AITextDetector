Censorship in libraries has always been a controversial issue. While it is understandable that parents wish to protect their children from offensive materials, it is important to recognize that censorship in libraries should be limited and exercised with caution.

Books, magazines, films, and music are all invaluable resources for learning, storytelling, and exploring the world. Censoring these materials encroaches upon intellectual and artistic freedom, effectively stifling creativity and the spirit of exploration. Furthermore, libraries are inclusive, public spaces meant to provide everyone with free access to necessary resources and knowledge. Censorship, however, denies individuals access to certain materials, consequently eliminating the right of individuals to make their own decisions about which materials best suit them.

The decision to ban a material should be carefully considered, and made by a committee representing, and respectful of, diverse perspectives. Furthermore, it should be based upon a reasonable evaluation of the materials, rather than upon personal opinions. Censorship should not be used indiscreetly; instead, it should be used primarily as an educational tool.

Books and other media should be labelled with age-appropriateness, so that parents know what materials their children are exposed to. Furthermore, libraries should provide information resources about materials in question on their websites or in pamphlets, so that parents can be informed and make informed decisions. This allows parents to be more involved with what their children are exposed to without denying other individuals access to the materials.
