The setting of ‘Rough Road Ahead’ by Joe Kurmaski is a crucial element of this story. The setting of a city with its tall buildings, dirty streets and heavy traffic affects the cyclist, Joe Kurmaski, in multiple ways. 

The tall buildings create a feeling of intimidation in Joe. He is surrounded by these buildings that seem to be looking down on him as he works his way through the city. The poor condition of the roads, with uneven and bumpy surfaces, and poor visibility created by the traffic can create dangerous situations for Joe. He has to be extra vigilant to spot hidden obstacles that could cause a crash.

The high amount of traffic affects the cyclist in many ways too. Joe has to battle through constant streams of cars, buses, and trucks that take up the roads. He has to move in and around these vehicles, looking for the best ways to assert himself and stay safe. 

The sheer noise of the traffic is overwhelming for the cyclist. Joe is surrounded by loud engines, car horns and loud conversations from pedestrians, as well as music from cell phones, all of which can be distracting. Joe has to focus and tune out external noises to stay safe. 

The harsh weather conditions also challenge Joe. He has to brave the heat of the summer, the snow and wind of the winter or severe rain. This can be exhausting and dangerous for Joe, as the wet roads can be treacherously slick
