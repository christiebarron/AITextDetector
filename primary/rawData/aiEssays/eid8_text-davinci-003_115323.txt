I remember the first time I ever heard my best friend laugh. We had been friends since grade school, but we had been discussing a particularly sensitive topic when it happened. We had been talking about a difficult situation and I found myself growing increasingly frustrated by the sheer gravity of it all. 

But then she looked at me and let out a little chuckle. I remember it sounded like the tinkling of bells. It was light, unexpected, and so infectious that I couldn’t help but smile in response. I’m not sure if it was intentional, but it took just that one laugh to lighten the mood and make us both feel better.

From then on, laughter became like a secret weapon of ours. Whenever the atmosphere grew too tense, one of us would crack a joke or make a silly comment and it would instantly lifting the mood. We’d be laughing so hard, our sides would ache and it would always feel so good to let the laughter out.

That moment solidified our friendship and showed me the power of laughter. It also reminded me of the lasting impact it can have on relationships. Ever since then, I always strive to bring more laughter into my life and the lives of the people I care about most.
