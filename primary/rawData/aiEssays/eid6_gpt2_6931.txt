The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One such obstacle was the fact that the government was prohibited from making dirigible deliveries to certain countries. The Empire State Building, which was constructed a decade before the World Trade Centers, was the United States capital for dirigible transportation. So was the Empire State Building. The government was also prohibited from being part of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, which had been established by Soviet Union against the United States in 1948.

In 1950, the US. Embassy, on the other hand, allowed dirigibles to dock at Washington. In 1954 and 1955, U.S.-Soviet relations were friendly but they were not friendly with each other and did not allow dirigibles on the docks. This was because the USSR prohibited foreign service to the USSR.

During Vietnam, there was a series of political developments that took place to allow dirigships. Most of the opposition parties were not organized during Vietnam and in Vietnam the U.S. had not established the political leadership. This was particularly problematic when they sought to establish peace in Vietnam, particularly in the Saigon regime and the U.S. Government there. It wasœñ the U.S. who began trying to break the power of the U.S. government.
