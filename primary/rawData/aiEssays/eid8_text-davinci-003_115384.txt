I remember the first time I met my girlfriend, Taylor. We had been chatting online for a few days and I was excited to finally meet her in person. I thought she was beautiful and was really hoping she liked me too.

When I first saw Taylor, she had this huge smile on her face that made me smile too. We hugged and then I nervously asked her if she wanted to go for a walk. I was so scared that she was going to say no, but she said yes!

As we started walking, I wanted to make conversation, but I was so nervous that I couldn't think of anything to say. After a few awkward moments, I finally said something about the weather and she started laughing. I knew she was laughing at me and I was so embarrassed, but I couldn't help but join in. We laughed until we were in tears.

It's funny because that's where it all started. It was in that moment that I knew I was in love with Taylor. We've been together ever since and laughter is still something that brings us closer and keeps us always connected.
