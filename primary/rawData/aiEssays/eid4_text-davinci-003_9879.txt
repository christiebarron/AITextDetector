At the end of the poem, Ho reflects on how her academic status is linked to her feelings of identity. The hibiscus plant, greatly admired by her peers, serves as a metaphor for her worth. Despite being lauded at the start of winter, she knows that come the spring, she's test results will determine her self-worth and the respect of her peers. The imagery is used to emphasize her trepidation at having to re-prove her capabilities, and also to emphasize her reliance on the hibiscus as a symbol of her self-esteem. The line serves as a reminder that her academic performance and self-worth are closely linked, and that she must continuously prove herself to regain self-respect.
