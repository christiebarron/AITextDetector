The Empire State Building was built in 1931 and was revolutionary for its time for its grand scale and advanced architectural design. However, one feature that was truly revolutionary at the time was the innovative construction of a mooring mast atop the building so that dirigibles could dock. Despite this ambitious undertaking, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to make this docking system a reality. 

The first and perhaps most challenging obstacle was the sheer size of the mast itself. At over 200 feet tall, the mast was taller than the building itself and needed to be stable to prevent any damage to the dirigibles docking there. To ensure this, the mast had to be engineered to the highest standards and be capable of withstanding the winds passing over the building.

The next obstacle was designing the mast so that it could be safely used by dirigibles. For this, the builders had to create a cradle that connected the dirigible to the mast. This cradle had to be large enough to fit the dirigible while also providing enough stability for the docking process. Additionally, the builders had to ensure that the mooring mechanisms worked properly and that the dirigibles could be securely attached to the mast.

The final obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building needed to overcome was creating a passage from the mast to the observation deck on the 86th floor. Originally, an elevator was proposed so that passengers and crew could access the observation deck. However, this
