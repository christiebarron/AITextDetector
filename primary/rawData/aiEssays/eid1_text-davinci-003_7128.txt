In Joe Kurmaski's “Rough Road Ahead,” the features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. The story takes place on a gravel road in the suburbs of a small Minnesota town. This backdrop makes the cyclist’s journey difficult and unpredictable. The gravel road is very difficult to traverse due to its rough and uneven surface. The grass and weeds, which are constantly blowing across the road, add an additional challenge as the cyclist must stay alert and balanced in order to avoid them. In addition, the cyclist must be constantly aware of the unpredictable Minnesota weather. In “Rough Road Ahead,” the wind and rain pose serious challenges for the cyclist as it makes staying on balance and staying upright a very difficult feat. Further, the unpaved road is filled with small hills, valleys, and tracks that are often difficult to see. This adds to the difficulty of staying on balance and increases the chances of the cyclist slipping or falling. 

The cyclist is also exposed to the elements with no protection from the wind, rain, and sun. These harsh elements can take a toll on the cyclist’s body, causing soreness and fatigue. Furthermore, the lack of visibility on the roads adds an additional layer of danger to the cyclist’s journey. The cyclist must be aware of any approaching dangers, such as cars, while traversing the gravel road.
