I recently was in a long line at the checkout counter of the grocery store I frequent. As I looked around, I noticed that several people in line were getting impatient and frustrated. While I was slightly annoyed myself about the wait, I decided to remain patient and stoic. I quietly read a book I had brought along with me to pass the time until it was my turn. 

After what felt like ages, it finally came to my turn. The cashier apologized for the long wait and thanked me for my patience. I smiled and replied that it was okay and to take her time. The customer behind me seemed almost surprised by my calmness and said "Wow, you're so patient". 

I shrugged off the comment and said it was no big deal. I continued to remain patient in the line of customers, even after it had gotten significantly longer. 

In the face of difficulty, I chose to practice patience, understanding, and tolerance. It was a rewarding feeling when it was all said and done - to remain be unbothered even in tough situations.
