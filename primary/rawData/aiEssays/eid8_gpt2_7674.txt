One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I accidentally used my voice to make out a joke with his mother before my speech with his mother and I told him when the end came. I'm glad I did. Maybe you still can, but when you're old, things go wrong and you just have to get over it.

I had so much fun with your company. It was great to meet those of you I didn't know, or were just a newbie, and thank you and all of you! In fact, one of my friends asked me to give her a tip on how to write a song. I thought this song would be a good spot to introduce someone who's been listening for ages! My secret weapon examining my blog (and your blog) as a personal, one stop shop for anything you want to do with humor is a lot of book reviews.

You have been reading through my Facebook Page and posting about my writing! It's hard to understand what's happening, but what did people think of me from your page? Did you like my writing? Tell me in the comments below what kind of writing style and humor does you like best: "Pleasance is a gift," "Treat your guests the best way." And when you're happy you should share your comments about what you love.

Love,

Sarah
