The builders of the Empire State Building faced a variety of unique obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of one of the worldâ€™s most iconic buildings. Although the vision of docking majestic airships at the Empire State Building glimpsed a future of incredible potential, the reality was much different.

One of the major issues the builders faced was that the extreme heights of the tower posed a challenge for dirigibles. Dirigibles were only expected to reach the top of the tower if the weather was clear and the winds were mild, since their rising and falling motion made them more easily affected than airplanes. Furthermore, the gusty winds at the top of the Empire State Building meant that the momentum dirigibles gained from catching an updraft could easily be lost in a swoosh of wind.

In addition to the height and wind, the position of the building led to difficulties. The high density of skyscrapers in the area, along with the tight traffic lanes, meant that the air traffic controllers were hard-pressed to discern a safe area for the airships to land or turn around. Given the limited knowledge of aeronautical navigation at the time, it was practically impossible to instil safe docking and takeoff protocols.

The most pressing problem, however, was the construction of the mooring mast. The mooring mast was meant to latch onto the dirigibles and allow the buoyant crafts to park securely atop
