The issue of censorship in libraries continues to be a point of debate amongst patrons, librarians, and lawmakers. While some believe that books and other media containing offensive content should be removed, others maintain that freedom of speech and the pursuit of information should be encouraged and defended. As a patron of the library, I propose that it is beneficial to both patrons and librarians to have certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, available for patrons to view and consider.

Censorship of portions of a library collection can limit patrons' access to an array of information and opinions. A library should serve as a source of diverse opinions and perspectives; however, by censoring content, the librarian can inadvertently censure valuable information that some may use to make informed decisions or gain a wider cultural understanding. Moreover, when censoring a particular item or items, the public might begin to question the libraryâ€™s overall commitment to providing complete and comprehensive materials. This could lead to decreased patron use and a lower sense of trust between the library and its patrons.

In addition, censorship should not prevent the library from acknowledging the presence, with proper labeling, of materials that may be controversial or offensive to some patrons. Librarians can prepare patrons with a way to identify materials that they may find objectionable and the patrons can then make an informed decision for themselves. This system allows all patrons access to the materials while also providing a way to guard against any materials
