I'll never forget the day I met my best friend. We were in a college art class together, and it was our first day. We were asked to draw a mask, so we both did our best and by some cosmic coincidence, our masks were incredibly similar. We started to laugh, and it was like a spell was cast. From that day forward we were inseparable. 

We had so many inside jokes, and we could always make each other laugh no matter the situation. Just the other day, I was in a bit of a funk and he showed up at my house with a bag full of cartoon movies. We had a marathon of all the movies we used to watch as kids, and it was like no time had gone by. 

The laughter we shared in those hours was so freeing. I felt my worries rolling off my shoulders and my heart full of joy. Laughter has always been our bond, a way to create a bridge between us, no matter what distance was between us. 

When I look back over the years and our friendship, I can easily recall all the laughter we've shared, and it's been the best thing I've ever experienced.
