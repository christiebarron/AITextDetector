In Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead," the setting plays a critical role in affecting the cyclists throughout the story. It is set in the Midwest, a hilly area full of abandoned roads and sparsely populated towns. The size and frequency of hills in the area, combined with the lack of people living there, provide a sense of loneliness, and add to the difficulty of the cyclist’s journey. 

The hilly terrain and long stretches of abandoned roads make the journey a physical challenge for the cyclist. The frequent rises, falls, and curves of the road require a great deal of stamina and understanding of the terrain to make it through the journey. It also adds a certain level of uncertainty, as the cyclist is not guaranteed to find aid should something go wrong. 

The lack of people in the area also affects the cyclist’s journey. The cyclist is often alone and not sure where to turn for help or even just companionship. This deepens the sense of loneliness and isolation that the cyclist is feeling. The loneliness of the setting in turn affects the cyclist’s mental and emotional state while they are cycling, as the lack of physical support can be draining and disheartening. 

Overall, the features of the setting in "Rough Road Ahead" affect the cyclist in both physically and emotionally. The hilly terrain and isolated landscape make the journey a challenge, while the loneliness of the setting can deepen the difficulty
