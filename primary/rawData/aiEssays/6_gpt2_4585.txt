The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. This included limited space and the need for the pilots or their engines to be powered off from the deck. Also, a lack of elevator locks meant that the engines illegibly would neverSprinter their cab (which was very problematic for the Empire State Building itself), yet the pilots faced significant logistical challenges facing the city's residents.

A lot of the major hurdles the New York air show faced were more practical ones as many of the buildings would be used exclusively for private use during construction.

Building a private airport in the Empire State Building will require about $60 million, which is less than half of the $1.5 billion the National Transportation Safety Board asked for the first time in the history of the Federal Aviation Administration. As such, New York's airport proposal must also be carefully considered before the State Air Administration can consider its own regulations.

By contrast, when the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration sought a state law to limit the size of small commercial airplanes in New York City, that same agency's request to ban small commercial airplanes came to light. The first state-designed small aircraft allowed passenger service but was never a public policy issue.

The Transportation Department had requested this law to limit small passenger aircraft sizes, and because of its limited size, that law has been changed to permit large passenger planes in the future. The same may apply to large aircraft. That law has been modified
