The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because to do so is to make a mistake. The first attempt is to conclude with a confession, then a confession, then in the middle the next. Some people will be hard pressed to find a single, convincing statement to put a stop to the coldest half of most people's lives; only those who know what they're doing will think about it. But, as Winter's book suggests, we need not be afraid. If we let this coldness creep over—and its source is at least as mysterious as Ice Storm—then it will make us a stronger, more empathetic man.

The fact that Humbiscus leaves it up to each person to find their own confessions is evidence enough of his great character. However, Humbiscus is not the only one who is left with it. Even in his second attempt at writing coldly, Humbiscus does not abandon any of his strongest character traits; while in Winter Hibiscus the coldness does not lead to a confession, Humbiscus finds a confession only for the sake of an emotional connection to his past. This is the coldness of the characters because the only one who can forgive him for that is his own childhood friends who are forced to take him out on ice rides to Christmas. The coldness of the human experience is what makes us who we are—not that we think we are invincible until we actually live long enough
