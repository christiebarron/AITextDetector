This line from Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho serves as a metaphor. The protagonist, Anna, is facing a difficult decision in her life - retaking a test in order to get into college. The hibiscus in Anna's garden serves as a symbol of her own future; the flowers will not bloom until the spring, after the snow has melted and the geese return. This gives the protagonist hope that if she does her best and keeps trying regardless of the difficult circumstances of winter, she will eventually be able to blossom and achieve great success. The line also serves as a call-to-action for Anna, reminding her to keep striving for her dreams and to never give up.
