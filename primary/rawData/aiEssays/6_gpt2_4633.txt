The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

As the city of New York's downtown became increasingly congested, it created a public park as housing for other public buildings. But its biggest obstacle was rising density, which prompted many building workers to move their residences. They wanted them to be closer to the waterfront so they could avoid driving around at night, which they have done for years.

In 1961, two new condominium buildings went up along New York City's waterfront and caught fire, destroying one of the most important buildings in history. That year, the Empire State Building was demolished.

While some builtings were still in use around the city, other residents were losing their faith, in part because the project moved too quickly.

J. Richard Wright and Daniel Dworkin, architects of the historic building and owner of Dworkin Associates, say building owners have been trying to help their houses move more freely since the tower was set up in 1969. Those efforts have failed.

Still, according to Wright and Dworkin, there are only 1.4 million New Yorkers without a home. For the first time in history, a new housing project can be built at any location â€” and more can be purchased if there aren't any buildings already listed.
