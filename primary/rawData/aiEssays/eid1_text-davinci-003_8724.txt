I remember it like it was yesterday. I was in sixth grade and had just gotten to know a new girl in class. She had transferred to our school mid-year and instantly caught my eye. I didn't quite know how to talk to her yet, but I had to try.

One day, I decided to work up the courage and ask her a question. I wanted to keep it light, so I thought of something funny. "What did the turtle say when he asked the chicken to dance?" I asked.

The girl smiled and thought for a moment. Without missing a beat, she replied, "I don't know, but it must have been shell-ebrate!"

I couldn't help it, I erupted into laughter and, as if it was contagious, she started to laugh too. At that moment, the walls between us were broken and we started talking. We chatted and laughed for the rest of the school year and even became close friends. That little joke had brought us closer than any connection we might have had otherwise.

Laughter truly is the best way to make a connection and bring people together. It's that little oneliner that can make a huge difference.
