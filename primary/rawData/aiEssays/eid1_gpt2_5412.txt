Computers have many effects on people. We will come back to this after we have looked closer.

That's what you have to expect from technology. You do not learn how to use a computer that doesn't have access to the internet.

If somebody tried to buy this equipment at Sears or eBay, they could buy it at some other point and have it run back. They could purchase it at least one more time and sell it at a higher price.
