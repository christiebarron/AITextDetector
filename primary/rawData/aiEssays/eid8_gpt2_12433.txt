One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was ten years old when I decided to go to an amusement park. It was a lovely place, but I was extremely nervous, so I didn't know where to go.

After going to the amusement park I was approached by a bouncer, asking me to come in, and he asked where I was from, and so I asked him what his real name was: R. I was confused because I told him that I had no business in Thailand because of our culture. He said that his country has a pretty good working culture.

I then tried to understand my situation. I guess I think about the last time I saw a woman, who had just been married to her husband until she was eighty years old, I was in the middle of a conversation with a young girl who was at my birthday party. She ran down and caught me. She said that she had just finished going up to my birthday celebration with her father when she suddenly went into a rage. I couldn't tell her.

I couldn't believe that there was a man who would give out sweets to young girls, and my father laughed loudly and said to her that I did that as a joke, but I didn't understand any of that until he stopped him, then pointed his finger up his nose. I immediately took off my pants, and as I got up I saw that he had jumped on me and my legs were dangling as well.
