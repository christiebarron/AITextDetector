The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They also have a different approach to keeping space open with the use of a rear-facing projector attached to the bridge.

As a result, the Empire State Building is closed on Sundays, the day after New Year.

The project, which was funded by private donations, cost taxpayers about $15.2 million to complete and $8.4 million more than an original cost estimate put forward. After completing the project, the Empire State Building will reopen on December 2. The building will have room and light up as needed for a few thousand employees as well as some major features.
