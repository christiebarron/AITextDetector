The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

"I was just thrilled," said Eric T. Haney, who is in business at the company. "It makes you work to the top of the stairs."

The state was also in a state of flux. The first two weeks of December saw an economic collapse that triggered an economic slowdown and brought about a spike in wages and incomes. After the recession ended, many of the state's key employers — both public and private — began opening factories and other activity. But the state's economy expanded at a faster pace than previously anticipated. The last week of November saw the economy accelerate, helping to spur investment in several industries and boost the economy.

Today's state of the economy is generally quite good, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. But some experts say that the economy is only improving, and that while the jobs created are good, the unemployment rate still remains low.

The Economic Policy Institute, a libertarian think tank that has been promoting tax reform over the last several years, says the state could have more jobs if it instead built a bigger tower, lowered taxes on oil and natural gas, and expanded access to higher education and training.

Another argument, though, is whether the two biggest private businesses should be allowed to continue operating on their own, which might be hard to do to allow any one group of people to control the building's design.
