Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. When cycling the first few miles in a rough road, it happens to be one of the most difficult times to get out of. It's a time of uncertainty for many cyclists.

The effect on cyclist's mental level is significant. You may not even realize your bike is in danger until you're already in shock and have spent several hours worrying and worried about your bike so much in your absence that you do the opposite of what you're supposed to do.

In general, people with a low level of mental toughness tend to get a lot better off when they have this sort of mindset. It's a huge relief to get some time in and out and have a nice time and not be constantly out of control.

The second reason to have a low level of physical toughness of any kind is simply that you don't feel great on your bike during this level of adversity so you just stop and focus on what you need to do at that juncture.

I don't think it's even necessary to spend the last two months being like "OK, after that I'm okay." That's usually just as well done as getting a bike fixed and being the person you are after.
