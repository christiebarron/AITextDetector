I remember it like it was yesterday. I was on vacation with my family and was feeling a bit homesick at the time. We were walking down the cobbled streets of the beautiful old city, and I was in a bit of a funk.

All of a sudden, I heard a loud burst of laughter coming from an alleyway. I looked over incredulously to see two strangers close to the same age as me, around sixteen. They were both so young and carefree, blissfully enjoying the moment.

I couldn't help but give them a smile, and before I knew it I was laughing with them. We chatted about our families and travel experiences, and that's when I knew that for a moment, all my worries had been forgotten. Time was running out and soon we had to go our separate ways, but as we parted, I glanced back to see them still laughing and joking with each other. It was one of those moments that I knew I'd never forget. That moment opened my eyes to the power of laughter; it doesn't have to involve two people who already know each other, it can simply unite two strangers in a single moment of joy.
