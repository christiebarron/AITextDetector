The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it gives a better understanding of who the characters were and why they were fighting these monsters. The main reason that it does that is because there are quite a few characters who can relate to some of that character's backstory. I think that's why they are even in places like A's camp where there is definitely a sense of how these monsters are dealing with their personal lives at the time and they're taking things about them. You know, just being able to go back and look at the story and remember them and see how they went back and what was going on through life and see what is happening as people have got hurt, just kind of gives you that feeling of someone's journey was different or that they really struggled. There's still that feeling of them living in a world that is really different than most people's, but also the same things are going on there.


But there are a couple of things that there do get to be really cool moments like what Jules and I took for example. And the reason is because when you look at Arianne, in "Jules and A," you realize that she is not simply a girl. She is actually a girl in a whole world. She is not just as the protagonist and someone who's doing something that's different than normal life to live. There's so much more than that, and there's a lot of different things going on in the history of A
