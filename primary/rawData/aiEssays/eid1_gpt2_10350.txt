Computers have many effects on people. The more information you have about them, the more interesting the job will become. We had people who worked at home being asked to go out into the work and go through the computers while they worked. We've had people that were working at home being asked to go out into the work and go through the computer during the day and sleep at night, and their jobs became completely inaccessible by their inability to access those services. People have a job because they were able to go to work without being required. The fact that there have been people in recent years who have had no jobs at all, they now have a job because they could actually sleep at night because that's all there was when your job was open so you could have a regular job and not be required.

This, I think, is one of the reasons why the idea of private enterprise isn't just about providing for the poor and disadvantaged, it's about expanding the marketplace of ideas. That's why the idea of what has been done in China to create jobs, that is why we've been able to create a lot of new businesses so that the people who want to build businesses are able to find new industries.
