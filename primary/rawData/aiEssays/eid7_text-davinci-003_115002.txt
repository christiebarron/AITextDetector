I remember a time when I was in high school and I had to take care of my younger sister. My parents had to work long hours outside the city and my sister was only three years old, so I was the one who had to take care of her. It was very challenging because she was always running around and playing, but I kept my cool and remained patient. 

Every day I would take her to the park and teach her basic things such as how to throw a ball and catch it, how to help mommy in the kitchen, and how to talk politely with others. I was so patient with her and never got angry or frustrated, even when she made the same mistake multiple times. 

One day, I took her to her dance class and that's when I realized how patient I had been. She was able to perform the routine the very first time and I was so proud of her. That day, I finally understood how important it was to have patience while teaching and that it really does pay off in the end.
