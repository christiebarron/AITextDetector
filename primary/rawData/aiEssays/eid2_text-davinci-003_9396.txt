It is a well-known fact that censorship has been a controversial issue in public libraries for years. For some, censorship is seen as a necessary tool for protecting the public from inappropriate materials, while still allowing them access to the resources they need. For others, it is seen as an infringement on a person’s right to access information that they deem important.

At its core, censorship is all about deciding what is and is not socially acceptable for the public to see. Libraries should not be in the business of dictating what people should and should not read. Instead, they should provide access to a variety of resources so that people can make informed decisions for themselves.

Censoring books, music, movies, and magazines in libraries can be seen as a form of censorship. It also limits the range of materials available for public consumption. For example, by censoring books, libraries can prevent certain topics from being discussed, therefore harming the public’s understanding of a particular issue. Similarly, by censoring music, movies, or magazines, libraries can limit the public’s exposure to ideas which could have a beneficial or opposing effect on their lives. 

The ability of libraries to provide access to even the most offensive materials is an essential part of our democracy. People should be allowed to make their own decision about what is socially acceptable. Allowing materials to be removed from the shelves just because they are found offensive is a step in the wrong direction
