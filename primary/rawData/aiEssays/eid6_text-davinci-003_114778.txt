The Empire State Building is one of the most renowned skyscrapers in the world; however, few people are aware of the obstacles the builders of the structure faced in allowing dirigibles to dock. The idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building was pitched in 1929, and since then, the feat has become known as the ‘Dream Deferred’ due to its difficulty and the chaos that ensued. 

The building’s designers did not envision or initially engineer the building for such a purpose. Since the dimensions of the existing structure were too small for large dirigibles such as the Graf Zeppelin, the builders had to adjust the brick exterior, meticulously constructing a 145-foot-high superstructure dubbed a Mooring Mast. The mast, made of steel reinforced and concrete, would be able to secure dirigibles in gusty winds and carry a variety of weights and loads. The builders faced further difficulties, as this structure had to be placed atop the then-largest building in the world – the risk of falling objects, particularly with gusts of winds, was ever-present.

The engineering process itself was quite intricate: engineers had to account for air turbulence, altitude, wind speed and elevation changes all at once. Even after the mast was erected, tests were still required to determine the accuracy of the calculations. To complicate matters, none of the necessary components—ranging from lighting strips to a steel cage – had been designed with
