The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In the early '60s, the FAA and National Electrical Code (NEC) enacted a rule requiring commercial builders to install a rear-mounted, enclosed-airway driver assembly at an installation that allowed for docking and the use of other aircraft equipment in connection with it. But the NEC required that a rear-mounted, enclosed-airway driver assembly that was properly mounted and was attached to the engine of an airplane (such as a crane or wing-mounted motor aircraft) must meet certain requirements. As a result, the United States government created the FAA's Office for the Public Disclosure of Aircraft Configuration Reports (OCRs), using information from two major FAA OCRs (the Aircraft Information Systems Division and the Aircraft Information and Reporting System Division). According to this report, when an aircraft is installed at an FAA OCR, it remains open to docking and the use of other aircraft equipment. A contractor may only require a rear-mounted, enclosed-airway driver assembly that is attached to the engine of an airplane, and no pilot-less crane or wing-mounted motor aircraft may be used by a pilot during takeoff or landing. A pilot may use the rear-mounted, enclosed-airway driver assembly and no pilot can safely use it during takeoff or landing, and the pilot must take the pilot out of the aircraft, or do nothing, if the rear-mounted, enclosed-air
