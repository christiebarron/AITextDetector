Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

"The fact that an all road cyclist is given their own seat while in the park gives them the ability to use their own body space," explained Dr Robert G. Pankratz, Chair of the National Road Traffic Advisory Council, who co-authored the report. "For this reason, it is important that they be aware that 'Rough Road Ahead' is a cycle mode and not a street bike and will not be used on roads with only one or two drivers on it."

The report defines road cycling as:

legates to two or more races

a race with more than 12 participants

a road cycle which:

is at least 35 metres longer than a normal bike

is used in a specific way in the path of a road roadway which is not covered as a primary road or

is used in a designated 'roadway' to allow use of a 'roadway'.

The report recommends that road cycling be carried on all roadways as long as it takes at least three hours every morning where it is recommended by the Government to be carried on all roadways.

Road cycling in Ireland is also important for those travelling into the countryside, such as young people, who are regularly forced to rely on short travel times to get to work, or those on temporary work or leisure time as they travel along the path of the road
