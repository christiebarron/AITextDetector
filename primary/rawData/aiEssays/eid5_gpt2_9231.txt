The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' by his brother, Maximus, who is now in prison in Iran, is a major distraction for those in Syria to avoid that fate. The book, which is only out for three months later, features the author recounting all these years of conflict with Syrians. It's as if he's being asked to come off as a jerk at something that's going to piss off so many people, but now everyone else is trying to catch him.

"Syria doesn't really understand itself in ways other than in its own way," Maximus wrote. "Its politics aren't much different from ours, and as long as you're still trying to explain why some nations are behaving like that, the Syrians are going to treat you like a fool. No matter when you're born, you're still going to think this is some kind of country that's happy to be your brother's country."
