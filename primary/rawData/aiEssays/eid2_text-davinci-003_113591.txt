Libraries are intended to provide access to knowledge, not restrict it. Censorship eliminates the opportunity for debate, discussion, and rational consideration of ideas, and introducing it into libraries would be an extreme violation of the fundamental principles of intellectual freedom that govern librarianship. 

When it comes to our public libraries, different individuals all have different values and expectations for what is acceptable. It is unreasonable to expect that all patrons would agree upon what is appropriate or offensive in library materials. Furthermore, it would be nearly impossible to draw a consensus on the material that should actually be removed from library shelves. As a result, making decisions about the censorship of materials in public libraries should be left up to the discretion of trained and experienced librarians, who can draw upon professional experience and judgment.

In a truly democratic society, it is important for librarians to be allowed to provide materials to patrons that may not be unanimously supported. Instead of censoring what materials appear on library shelves, it is more appropriate to provide resources for patrons who would like to become informed about the potential content of a book, movie, or other work. Additionally, libraries should be encouraged to offer services that allow the community to make decisions about materials in light of their own perspectives and values. 

Libraries are not meant to control or manipulate the thoughts of its patrons, but to serve as places for open dialogue and learning opportunities. Censorship risks eliminating this dialogue and creating an environment
