Dear Reader,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people these days.

I believe that computers can have both positive and negative effects on people. On the one hand, computers have helped us in various ways. For instance, they help us to store a vast amount of information and to communicate easily with people from all over the world. Moreover, computers can simplify a lot of complex tasks, providing us with quick and accurate results.

On the other hand, there are disadvantages associated with the use of computers, especially among young people. For example, the prolonged use of computers has led to physical health issues such as eye strain or back pain and mental health issues like stress and isolation. It has been proven that too much screen time can lead to sleep deprivation and poorer academic performance.

Therefore, I strongly believe that it is important that we use computers in moderation and take necessary precautions for our health and safety. We must find a balance between utilizing the advantages of computers and avoiding their negative repercussions.

I hope you agree with me on this matter and join me in understanding the good and bad effects of computers.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
