The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is very different from the way it came out this week.

'I think it's very real.

'Like the time we went to Paris when I was 14, because I came from a little village in the south of Poland, where most people live, but in the way that things happen. That's what my father, a Polish boy, said. We were the only parents in the church.'

He said he felt betrayed about the book when he got it and read it a few weeks ago, and later discovered someone else, who knew he was Jewish.

 accepts: 'We are not aware of anything that happens during the book, because there was no way we could know which person was the real person who written. No one would give us the opportunity,' he says.
