An example of a time someone in my life was patient was going through a medical emergency and I decided I wanted to take things a little further. There was a piece of cake being served that had to be changed and they just did not have any time to make it, but the timing got so bad that I decided to do it. I then moved to Northampton, Mass., and the next year I went to the University of Rhode Island where I majored in political scienceynamic journalism. I got picked as one of 513 candidates that were asked to be interviewed by the Boston Globe's Glenn Thrush. I never thought I was qualified as a political reporter, I thought there is potential for me to change positions and contribute to the media as a result of that. But nothing like this and I'm glad I did to make this a reality! I'm excited to work for you so I'm hoping other people will come here as well. Just in case any of you not already know, my name is Steve Schlichter.
