To the editor of [Newspaper],

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people and urge readers to agree with me.

As technology has changed over the years, people's reliance on computers has grown significantly. Today, computers are used for almost every type of activity, from shopping to entertainment to communication. While computers can certainly be a convenient tool for people, there are both positive and negative effects associated with their use.

On the positive side, computers can greatly improve productivity. They can help people manage their workloads and provide a more efficient way to complete tasks. Additionally, computers can be used as a source of entertainment and socializing, providing users with an outlet to stay connected with friends and family.

However, there are also potential negative impacts of computer usage. People who spend too much time on the computer are at risk of becoming socially isolated, as they may neglect their real-life relationships in favor of digital ones. Additionally, computers have been linked to an increase in fatigue and eye strain due to the overexertion of users.

When used in moderation, computers can be a helpful tool for staying organized and connected. But it is important to remember that overuse of these devices can do more harm than good. As such, it is important to take breaks from the digital world and be mindful of how much time we spend using computers. 

Thank you for considering my opinion.
