Over the years, my husband and I have developed some pretty funny inside jokes. We always had a good laugh when one of us caught the other making a funny face while no one was looking. But last weekend was something else entirely.

I had been trying to learn some Spanish for years, and I had finally become comfortable enough with the language that I was willing to take a chance and try it out in public. So when we went out to our favorite Mexican restaurant, I decided to take the plunge and order in Spanish.

My husband watched me in amazement as I nervously spoke the words of my order to the server, who responded graciously with a nod and a smile. When the server walked away, I let out a sigh of relief and looked over at my husband with a nervous smile. His helpless laughter came out in a wave of relieved amusement, and I got the giggles too.

We couldn’t stop laughing for the rest of the night. It was the perfect reminder that no matter what happens, we’ll always be there to enjoy a good laugh.
