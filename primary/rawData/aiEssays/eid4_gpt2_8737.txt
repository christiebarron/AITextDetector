The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it captures the essence of the books of the period of great war: the desire to fight but at the cost of victory and the destruction of one's pride and faith.


It gives us the sense of our own fighting against the horrors of war; the fear of death and the loss of faith. It allows for a greater sense of the dangers we face, and brings all of this together. It also offers our young soldiers hope and relief, which is always lacking in our youth and older generations. With this book, we can learn to be a lot more Airbnb and feel truly like a nation and a soldier.

"It takes time to write but if you've spent months playing with these books you've learned a whole lot more than you ever have in all of your life. And I'm happy for everyone."
