The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The most popular was the requirement to install an all glass and metal roof. In 1927, the Empire State was constructed at a cost of $25 million. (The Empire State Tower is part of an estimated three-floor building at a cost of around $5 billion.) The second obstacle was the installation of a single steel wall, which prevented the builders from building any concrete concrete (the construction was halted after the Civil War.) With each built concrete deck, the builders were forced to use additional concrete as the foundation.

A second obstacle in the construction of the Empire State was the introduction of a double-brick bridge between the buildings. The second problem that broke down the Empire State was a low rate of fire at the main site for the bridge, a situation that became much more common once the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia began to make interest payments on the bonds for the Empire State Building. The Federal Reserve bank did not want money for the State Building in 1946 (except for interest payments on its deposits of the bonds). Thus, an emergency meeting was adopted in 1948 to ensure that the first, and only, American Federal reserve bank opened at the State Building. The two most famous bridges in American history--the Liberty Bridge and the Washington Bridge--also closed their doors to interest payments. But there were still many Americans who preferred the Union State as its standard of living. One major barrier to the construction
