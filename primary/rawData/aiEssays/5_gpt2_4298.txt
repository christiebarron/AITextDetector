The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is less somber than that of the previous three chapters:

I'm grateful to my husband for supporting and caring for my children; I don't care about how they look, I don't care about how they feel, I don't care about their education; and I don't care about how much they have to spend on their own and our lives;

That's it. Not a story it should be. It should be a piece of work written about love and family and giving those who share your concerns back.

You can read the rest of the book here!

The rest – and here's the full, original blog post – will be out the end of the year in some form or another.

And if you're interested in how the book was received, I'd love to hear your thoughts or comments… I think you have your own thoughts there (I hope, I don't mind a bit) – I was in a bit of an echo-chamber with many other reviewers. Let me know what you think with the comments.
