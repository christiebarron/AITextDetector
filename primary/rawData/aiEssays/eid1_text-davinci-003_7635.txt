The purpose of the ending of Winter Hibiscus is to emphasize the cyclical nature of life and how humans must embrace change and growth. The narrator recognizes the cycle of the seasons and the inevitability of changeâ€”some things that were difficult, like taking a test, can be attempted again in the future. The closing line serves as a reminder that the narrator can move forward even after the struggles, like taking the high school entrance exam, and that failures do not have to be viewed as permanent setbacks but rather as moments in which growth can be achieved. By ending the story with words of hope and optimism rather than sadness and despair, Ho emphasizes the resilience of human nature and the importance of perseverance.
