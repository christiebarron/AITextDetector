Computers have many effects on people.


For one, computers act as computers. They transmit information to the cloud and transmit a stream of information back to the programmer. That is why they are called "cloud" computers, because they are not only physically connected to an external network but have some kind of connection with computers on the other side of them.


If the computing system comes over here, each computer is connected with one computer, each one being "stored" on one server; its server is located within the cloud. The "cloud" computers carry information about the server.


The two servers that store information such as the server ID, the time this server is active, the number of hours, and so forth are interconnected. If each computer does get connected to one server, it usually needs to carry that information to the servers it needs at the moment, so that it is stored. If you can connect more servers, they will have much more "cloud" computer activities than your computer does.


Another possibility is that the two servers are connected by a line connecting each other. This makes it possibleateful for the computers on either side to send information. In this situation, a "cloud" computer would be running both servers, even though neither server actually can communicate with each other.


In short, computers need more servers because they need more information to carry out tasks. If your computer gets disconnected or your local network comes over here, it takes up
