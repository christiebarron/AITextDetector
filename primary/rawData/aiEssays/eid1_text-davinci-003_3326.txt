Dear Editor,

I am writing today to express my opinion on the effects computers have had on people. As technology advances, computers are becoming more and more of a part of our lives, and I believe this has had both positive and negative consequences.

On one hand, computers are amazing tools that help us to better understand our world. Computers give us access to vast amounts of information and make completing tasks quick and easy. They have made it easier to stay connected and have even enabled some people to work from home.

On the other hand, there are a few drawbacks to computer usage. For example, people can easily get addicted to the internet or to video games. In addition, computer use can lead to eye strain and back pain, due to hours spent sitting in front of a computer. It can also be difficult for some people to stay away from social media and email notifications.

In conclusion, while computers can be incredibly helpful, it is important to be aware of their potential drawbacks as well. With responsible usage, computers can help us to be more productive and better informed.

Sincerely,

[Name]
