I recently had a new job that was out of my comfort zone and I was feeling very intimidated on my first day. I was struggling to understand my role and to get the hang of the company's procedures.

My boss was quite understanding and patient though. She took the time to explain every step to me and made sure I was comfortable with it all before moving on. She also sat with me while I tried to figure out the new software on my computer and encouraged me when I made mistakes.

I appreciated her patience so much and it really helped me to settle into my new role quickly and confidently. I eventually became much more comfortable and now I'm feeling like a valued member of the team. 

It's amazing how much patience can help someone feel more at ease in a new situation.
