I was having a hard day. Work had been stressful, and I had been stuck in traffic for over an hour on the way home. I was so exhausted and just wanted to be home, but I was stuck in a slow moving line at the grocery store. After what felt like hours in line, I finally got to the cashier. I couldnâ€™t believe how slowly she was ringing up my items. Every time she needed to modify a price or the computer was acting up, I wanted to scream. But, I managed to stay patient. I reminded myself that everyone has a bad day, and that she was doing her best. I breathed deeply and took the time to make small talk with her. By the time I made it home, I felt better. My patience with the cashier had allowed me to be kind and understanding of her situation, and it had made me feel better overall.
