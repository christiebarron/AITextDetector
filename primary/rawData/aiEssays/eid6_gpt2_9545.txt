The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, the buildings had to be approved before flying were built.

"If they were to fly by private airplanes and would be towed about 90 miles, that's quite a logistical disaster," said William H. D. Dobbins, a construction engineering professor at Johns Hopkins University who was not involved in the study.

"It's a big decision that we must make," Dobbins said. "It's not a question of whether you could have more dirigibles moving about. I would say you can have more than a couple at one time, but I don't think your system can handle that. We don't have room for it."

He said it "only makes sense" that the dirigible was given a single, short and curved surface, whereas the conventional, cylindrical vehicle had a single axis.

"You put the end of the line on the left side of the vehicle and it's easy to do," said Dobbins. "You put a new nozzle into the middle of the left-hand bow of the vehicle and it's almost like they're going to get stuck in the road. It gives you a more solid surface that you don't have to worry about."

The designers said the aerodynamic characteristics of the dirigible proved popular with pilots and even served as one of the primary reasons the plane was chosen as the model
