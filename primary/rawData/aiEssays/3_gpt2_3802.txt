Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. First, it can be a very important one for the cyclist, but also has a number of effects on the cyclist's motor skills. It allows him to run slower and faster while cycling at greater risk if there's a problem with his car, for example; it creates a sense of security and encourages him to ride better because he knows he won't be alone. Secondly, even when the setting has a positive impact on motor skill such as the situation around the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead', the setting makes the cyclist feel safer too and it brings positive thinking, not only when the cycling is moving at a greater speed (which often is slower than the normal speed of cycling), but also when it comes to road safety. This is because:

There are very few conditions on the bicycle so if the cyclist needs to cross a difficult road or a very short road there should be other obstacles on either side that are preventing him from crossing the road

There should be traffic and pedestrians, as well as the cyclist

Where there's a clear hazard (such as between a cyclist and a vehicle) and road conditions don't indicate that there could be a danger

Many of the conditions in 'Rough Road Ahead' only show up on bicycles and it doesn't matter where they are.
