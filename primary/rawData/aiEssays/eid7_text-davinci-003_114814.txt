I was visiting my aunt and uncle on the other side of the country. My aunt was a bit of a hoarder, and as I started to clean some of the clutter in her house, I realized that my uncle was having difficulty finding things. While I was organizing the items, I noticed that my uncle was growing frustrated. He asked me why I was taking so long, but I remained patient with him and patiently explained why I was doing it.

I went to great lengths to ensure that I didnâ€™t upset him, despite his obvious impatience. I understood why he was stressed and frustrated with the situation. The room had been in disarray for months and he had been trying to find something important for a while. I could relate to how overwhelming the feeling of not being able to find things can be. 

With lots of patience, I carefully organized the items while carefully explaining to my uncle what I was doing and why. After I finished, my uncle was thankful for my patience and thanked me for my help. I knew that it was a difficult and stressful situation for both of us, but I was happy that I was able to help my uncle out in his time of need.
