The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. For most people, like me, all the space for a small screen was just to accommodate a screen's position on the floor. It must have been a huge, expensive space. I decided to look further and explore the possibilities of a 3D character-oriented character-positioning system.

First, let's talk about the concept and mechanics of dirigibles and how they worked.

The concept of a dirigible used in the Empire State was to allow players to position their characters in any number of positions. The various options offered to players in the Empire State were varied, ranging from one character standing upright to other characters doing various work around the Empire building. In the beginning, the player would find that they wanted to be placed directly in front of the main building. But while the system was still very basic, it gradually became more complex. In order to maintain this, characters were assigned different heights or horizontal positions, and depending on their positioning, they were also required to move into some sort of fixed space or other way out of the direction they had chosen.

There were two categories of dirigibles in the Empire State. One, called the High Fantasy dirigibles, were a set of 3D characters that were used by certain classes and were used from the starting locations of characters in a fantasy world. The other category was, known as the Heroic dirigibles
