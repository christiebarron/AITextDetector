The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because of its focus on the journey through time that the book took with it. The book tells readers how to get to know and appreciate a time traveler. But the chapters start off a little slow. Things are a little too little. Maybe it's just that as the book progresses, some people learn to love a time traveler and the author keeps going on about how "now" was a part of the experience. I think a lot of the focus is on the fact that the reader can take a look at some of the events after an event does happen, rather than trying to find out what the real story of a trip was. I can't say it is a bad thing. However, there's a certain level of urgency to seeing the events that happen, but it's actually less than what the book expects. As I mentioned before, the book starts off kind of slow, while I'm trying to keep my head up and the story focused on itself. This could be because I read for about half an hour and I'm just starting to get excited about it. But at the middle of the book I finally get to read it and it's almost the same story again. That's because reading so much takes more than just words to read, and time travel can have a whole different kind of focus. It would go on forever. It's a really great book. It's great to go for a while reading some of my favorite
