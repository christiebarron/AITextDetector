The features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski's 'Rough Road Ahead' heavily affect the cyclist who identifies as an adventurous and skilled mountain biker. The bike rider is presented with a mountain road that more closely resembles a roller coaster than a conventional pathway; it is steep, long, and incredibly rugged. The way the rider meets this challenge reflects their determination and skill, as the biker is able to take the sharp turns and thrilling jumps head on with confidence.

The cyclist must conquer various obstacles while navigating the path, including slippery ice patches scattered throughout the route. The natural environment also plays a significant role in the cyclist’s experience, as certain sections of the landscape are angled in a way that requires the biker to put extra effort into maintaining their speed and balance. Similarly, the road is filled with rocks, branches, and other obstacles that must be carefully dodged in order to make it safely down the trail.

The rider’s lack of visibility also affects their journey, as the darkness diminishes the bike rider’s awareness of their surroundings. In addition, the extreme weather conditions pose a difficult challenge; the presence of snow and sleet causes the path to become wet and icy, reducing the cyclists’ traction levels and making it difficult to maintain balance.

Overall, the features of the setting in ‘Rough Road Ahead’ drastically affect the cyclist’s journey, from the natural terrain and weather conditions compl
