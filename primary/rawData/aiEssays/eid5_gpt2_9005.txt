The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is as bleak as it is optimistic. The new interview is shot in a "darkly dark" state of mind, a mood that seems to be at the forefront of the moment in the book.

The documentary project 'From Home is' will show all of the life and struggle the students faced from the beginning to the end. One of their stories is the devastating trauma experienced by one of their former classmates. "While many of us are lucky to go to love, life still is hard for people who are so young â€“ and it's impossible for us," the author writes.

From Home is an essential book about the life that led to 'The Great Depression'. If you enjoyed the book please consider supporting WGBH by spreading and sharing WGBH on your social media outlets.

This world, one that has gone through terrible moments, has a right to a better sense of human dignity, a chance to live out their future better than anyone else is doing.
