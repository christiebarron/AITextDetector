Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion about censorship in libraries. As a library patron, I feel strongly that libraries should not remove materials like books, music, movies, and magazines simply because they are deemed offensive. This kind of censorship is an affront to our freedoms and a waste of library resources.

Censoring material is not an effective way to prevent people from seeing it. It does not make the material go away, it simply limits access to it. This means library patrons who seek out these materials will be denied the chance to find and read them. The idea of censorship also ignores the basic logic that many readers can be curious about, find value in, and be mature enough to cope with material deemed offensive. In addition, denying access to books at a library implies that anyone who seeks access to this material is not only dangerous, but also not mature enough to handle it. This is an ill-advised attitude.

Furthermore, censorship in libraries is a waste of resources. In order to effectively remove material deemed offensive, librarians must devote time to identify what should be removed and the process of actually removing it. This is an unwise use of finite library resources. 

Furthermore, librarians should never be the arbiter of what is deemed inappropriate and offensive. I believe that anyone should be able to see and read what they choose, regardless of whether it may be of particular classifications or not.
