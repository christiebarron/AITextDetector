Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. For example, riders who ride rough roads will be less likely to get a ride when they are off the road, at least until they are physically more mobile and healthier. This can be especially important for people who are driving, like people who need to exercise.

What is 'Rough Road Ahead' and where does this apply to me? Some people are unaware that ROUGH ROUTE ONLY applies to cyclists and therefore their driving behaviour. Those with limited mobility and a limited time on and off the road will continue to drive a lot longer than those who can drive comfortably. For a range of reasons cyclists will be more likely to fall out of the car into an open road.

Some riders who are travelling in a slower car are less likely to be able to use 'Rough Road Ahead' when travelling in a car. It applies to those who do not ride hard and those who do have mobility issues.

More importantly, riders who use roads which are less convenient to walk or cycle will more likely have accidents that are more likely to happen in front of them.
