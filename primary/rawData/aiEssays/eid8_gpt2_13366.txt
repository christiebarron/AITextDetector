One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was playing with a friend, so she had a little game of poker over me, so I had to pretend it was another person standing in front of me to laugh at it. Sometimes I would smile and talk to them about laughing at it when I didn't have friends here. (laughs) I've always been the type of person that can laugh when someone thinks about it.
