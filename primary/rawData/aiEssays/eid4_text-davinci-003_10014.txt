The final line of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho serves as a metaphor for hope, resilience, and determination. The author uses a hibiscus, a perennial plant which survives through the winter, as a symbol for her protagonist's understanding of her education and her belief in her ability to be successful. Although she has failed the tests that year, she is determined to take them again the following year. The imagery of the geese returning and the snow melting serve as a reminder of the cyclical nature of life and the knowledge that with hard work and dedication, her perseverance will be rewarded.
