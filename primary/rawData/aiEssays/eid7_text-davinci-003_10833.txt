I was recently visiting my aunt and uncle in a rural area to celebrate my grandmother's 81st birthday. We were all enjoying the day when, out of nowhere, the weather quickly turned and a huge storm came in. We rushed to get inside but there were a few of us still trying to get the last of the food and gifts into the house when the storm hit.

My aunt and uncle stayed outside with us to make sure we were all safe and everything was taken care of. Although they wanted to get inside like the rest of us, they stayed calm and patient while they made sure we all got inside safely.

The storm was eventually over, and we all managed to dry off and celebrate the rest of the day. My aunt and uncle's patience and kindness made a difficult situation bearable and I am so grateful for their help. They were truly a blessing!
