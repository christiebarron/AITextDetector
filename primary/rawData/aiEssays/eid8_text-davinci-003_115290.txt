It was a typical Saturday night; my husband and I had just come home from a night out with our friends. We had all gone out to dinner together and had laughed and joked our way through the evening. 

As we started to settle into the couch, it was clear we weren't ready for the night to end. I told my husband I had a surprise for him. I had been watching a lot of stand-up comedy online lately, and I had found a few jokes I thought might get him laughing. I pulled out my phone and read them to him, expecting a chuckle here and there. 

Instead, what I got was an uproarious roar of laughter. Tears streamed down his face as he roared, hamming it up for maximum amusement. I couldn't help but join in, and soon we were both helpless with laughter, sprawled on the couch as the jokes kept coming. 

That night turned out to be one of the best of my life. There is something special about giving and receiving laughter; it unites us in the moment and creates a bond that can never be broken. Laughing together has become a part of our Saturday night tradition, and I can't wait for the next time we can share in such joy.
