I believe that censorship of materials in libraries should be limited to those places where information can be readily accessed online. As well as providing a source of information for individuals who would otherwise be unable to access it, providing a means for individuals to provide information, even if that information has already been published or is made available through the Internet, may also be able to provide people with access to information that may not be readily accessible online.

Libraries in the United States generally have not published or otherwise disseminated public and private information, with some exceptions. For example, libraries in the United States have generally not published or otherwise disseminated information about students. For these reasons, in practice, they are not covered by copyright or other laws unless one of the public policies applies to libraries in the United States or a library in the United Kingdom. However, there should have been no government-sponsored copyright restrictions in the 1980s.

Libraries generally should not sell information they receive in their stores that is "nonpublic," or that will be "confidential." Information which in fact cannot reasonably be used for lawful purposes other than to provide copies or disseminate such information should not be sold in any public or private library, except as authorized by law.

Libraries and others should be prohibited from displaying, receiving, transmitting, or using any of their libraries which are unlawful, indecent, illegal, or illegal to make to or to be made accessible to children.
