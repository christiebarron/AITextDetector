In Joe Kurmaski’s ‘Rough Road Ahead’, the features of the setting play a very important role in how the cyclist deals with the terrain. The cyclist in this story must navigate a network of relatively narrow and winding roads, with “large heads of farm animals looking [at him] curiously” from the sides of the road. The sheer narrowness of the roads present a challenge to the cyclist in terms of finding enough space to move safely. In addition, the presence of the animals and the rolling terrain create an environment of unpredictability; while the cyclist may see a relatively clear stretch of road ahead, the sudden presence of a large animal or an unexpected hill can create a dangerous situation.

The cyclist in this story is also forced to deal with the physical impacts of the scenery. With the combination of the updrafts created by the rolling hills and the strong winds that accompany the passing rain showers, the cyclist is presented with a tough challenge in terms of maintaining balance and staying on track. The cyclist is also contending with an ever-changing temperature as the hilltops offer some reprieve from the strong gusts of wind, while the descending valleys trap the cyclist in a cold pocket of air. On top of this, the cyclist is also having to contend with limited visibility due to the low-hanging grey clouds that cover the sky.

All of these features of the setting present an intimidating environmental challenge for the cyclist
