When it was announced that dirigibles would be allowed to dock atop the Empire State Building, many engineers and architects were eager to put their skills to use in adapting this iconic structure. However, the engineers of the era faced a number of obstacles in building this feature, all of which had to be carefully considered and addressed before the plan could be characterized as a success.

The first challenge that had to be considered was the design and placement of the mooring mast itself. For a dirigible to safely moor atop the Empire State Building, a substantial metal mast was needed. This mast had to be designed to be both strong enough to handle the rigors of docking, as well as lightweight enough that the excessive weight of the structure would not cause destabilizing effects. Additionally, the mast had to be somewhat flexible, in order to accommodate the airshipâ€™s movements during docking. The team also had to consider the potential impacts that powerful winds might have on the mast, and account for those effects in the overall design.

The second challenge was the logistics of constructing a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building. Constructing the mast high above the ground presented obvious safety hazards and logistical difficulties. The team had to ensure that all of the necessary materials and personnel were safely able to access the rooftop, as well as develop procedures for maintaining and servicing the mast over long periods of time. Additionally, the team faced certain challenges in minimizing the impact that the moor
