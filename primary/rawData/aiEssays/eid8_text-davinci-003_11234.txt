I remember this one time when my best friend and I were off on a camping trip together. We hadn't seen each other in years and had so much catching up to do! We had stayed up late talking around the campfire, and when we finally decided to call it a night, we both realized we had forgotten the keys to the tent! 

We were stuck outside in the pitch dark, but instead of getting angry, we started to laugh. We laughed so hard we almost instantly forgot about our predicament. The laughter quickly spread to the other campers, and soon the entire campsite was in hysterics. 

Someone eventually donated a spare set of keys and once we retrieved them, we kept on laughing. We laughed until our sides hurt. We laughed until tears streamed down our faces. We laughed until we ended up in a silly little heap on the ground.

I think it was that moment of laughter that truly sealed our friendship - it was a reminder that no matter what happens in life, we can always find something to laugh about.
