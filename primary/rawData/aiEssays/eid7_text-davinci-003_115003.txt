I was once invited to my cousin's wedding. She had planned her special day for over a year and put in a lot of hard work. I could not wait to be part of the celebration. 

However, a few days before the wedding, I only had enough money for the wedding gift but not for the hotel stay. I emailed my cousin, expecting her to be disappointed that I would have to miss her wedding. Instead, she was understanding and made it clear that I could stay with her and her future husband the night of the wedding, no questions asked.

Her response was so incredibly patient that I was taken aback. I could tell she was a little disappointed, but she did not let it show. She could have easily lashed out since planning a wedding can be stressful, but instead, she was understanding and her patience with me was admirable. 

The night of the wedding was amazing and I am thankful that I was able to attend since my cousin showed me so much patience and generosity.
