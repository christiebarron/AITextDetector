 

Dear Editor, 

Today, computers have impacted daily life for millions of people. Unfortunately, not everyone sees them in a positive light. Some believe that computers are harmful, causing mental health and addiction issues for users. I strongly disagree. 

The truth is that computers, and technology as a whole, have ushered in incredible advances in medical science, communication, and engineering. Thanks to computers, we now have access to information on virtually any topic, from any corner of the world, in mere seconds. It’s true that computers can be addictive, but that’s true of any activity. Whether it’s playing a video game, surfing the internet, or watching Netflix for too long, too much of any one thing can take away from our ability to focus and remain productive. 

However, computers offer so many benefits to society as a whole. We all need computers in order to succeed in a modern world. Businesses of all types use computers to streamline their operations, and professionals rely on them for the research needed to progress their fields. Computers are also helpful for those with disabilities such as vision or hearing problems, allowing them to connect to the world and use the internet
