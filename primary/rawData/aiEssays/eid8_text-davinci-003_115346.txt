I remember last summer when my friend and I, who hadn't seen each other in years, decided to meet up and catch up. We decided to go for a walk in the park together, and while we were out, we started talking about our childhoods. I told him a funny story about something that had happened when we were kids, and before I knew it, we were both laughing so hard that tears were streaming down our faces. It felt so good to be able to share a laugh with an old friend like that. It made me feel connected to him in a way that no other conversation could have, and to this day, I still think back on that afternoon and smile.
