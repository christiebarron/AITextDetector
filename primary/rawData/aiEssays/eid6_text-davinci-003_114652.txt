The Empire State Building was an engineering marvel when it first opened in 1931. It stands tall as an iconic symbol of the city of New York City and was one of the first skyscrapers to have dirigible mooring capabilities. However, the ability to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was not without its challenges. In Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s book, ‘The Mooring Mast’, she paints a vivid picture of the obstacles that the Empire State Building builders had to overcome in order to make dirigible docking a reality.

The first issue that the builders had to address was the height of the mast that would have to support the dirigibles. It required an incredibly tall mast to be built on top of the building, which posed a number of problems. Firstly, it was unfeasible to expect a mast that tall to be stable on the building’s roof; it needed a solid foundation at the base of the structure. Secondly, the mast had to be tall enough not to interfere with the flights of the dirigibles as they approached the building. Finally, the mast needed to be able to withstand the force of the dirigible’s jets, which pushed the airship downwards and threatened to rip the mast from the building if it was not of adequate strength.

The builders of the Empire State Building also needed to create a mooring system that was both secure and easy to
