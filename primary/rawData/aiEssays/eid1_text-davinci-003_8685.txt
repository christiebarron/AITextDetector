I remember the first time I ever felt that special kind of laughter that comes from connecting with another person. I was at a party with several of my college friends, and we were all trying to make small talk, when one of them started to tell an absolutely hilarious story. Everyone was laughing, but mine was the loudest and most genuine of them all. 

It was like I felt something in that moment that I had never felt before. We all just seemed to be on the same page and suddenly it felt like no one else in the room mattered - like the two of us were in our own little world, simply amused by each other's company.

I looked up and caught his eye, and suddenly we both burst into uncontrollable laughter. I still feel a little tingle when I remember it. It was like everything around us was just fading away and a special connection between us was created in that laughter. 

I don't think I'll ever forget that moment. It was like it had sealed our friendship and we both felt something special in being able to share that feeling. To this day, laughter still brings us together and reminds us of the bond we have.
