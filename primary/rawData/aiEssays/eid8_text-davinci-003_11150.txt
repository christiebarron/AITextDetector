I remember once when I was in fourth grade, I had recently become a best friend with this girl who sat directly across from me in class. We love to talk and gossip together, like any classic group of fourth graders do. Our teacher would always be so amused by how she and I would act around each other, so she began to recognize it more and more.

One day, we were talking in class about how the school cafeteria was out of the pizza for the lunch special. As we were discussing it, I made some sort of silly joke that I can't even remember now, but it was enough to set us both off into a fit of laughter. The whole class just watched us in amazement, and I remember even the teacher laughed along with us. That moment of shared laughter and joy has stayed with me ever since.

It made me realize that laughter really is the shortest distance between two people. That day proved to me that it's not about how many smart things you know, but how much fun you can have with the person who's sitting right in front of you. Ever since, laughter in my friendships has been the bonding factor that I value most of all.
