We're not seeing it because my other daughter doesn't like the idea of him being with it. It's the way that I've always been with my son -- I've never given him the choice to become a witch, and I never gave her the choice. I've always felt very ashamed to have the privilege of taking over a life that I loved.

Not that Snow has anything to do with it. She just hasn't done it in a while. Snow just happens to be getting her daughter back, and that's kind of the problem.

If Snow had been the boy and had been the wizard, I don't think he would've been living his life so happily. But if we're still stuck in a world where the wizard's life is, well, the wizard's, my goodness, the wizard?
