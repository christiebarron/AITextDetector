The Empire State Building was designed with an extraordinary feature – it had oversized docking masts on the roof which could accommodate dirigible airships, or blimps, as they were more commonly known. Despite this innovative feature, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles related to allowing dirigibles to dock to the building. This essay will explore the obstacles the builders confronted in their pursuit of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, as described in “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted.

The first obstacle the builders faced was the technological capabilities of blimp and airship companies at the time. As Lüsted explains, the dirigibles of the early 1930s were extremely large and complex machines, and the companies that owned them lacked the technical know-how to safely dock them to the building. This was compounded by the fact that the dirigibles of the time were propelled by large propellers which could create strong winds, making them even more difficult to dock. Although the building’s masts were designed to withstand the wind, the companies believed it was too risky to attempt docking anyway.

A second obstacle came from the dirigibles’ manufacturers. The powerhouses behind these airships, Goodyear and the U.S. Navy, wanted nothing to do with having their dirigibles dock at a building in the middle of a densely populated city. They believed that attempting
