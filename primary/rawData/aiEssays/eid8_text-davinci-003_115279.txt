 

I remember when my husband and I went on a cruise together. We had both been so stressed all week with work and all we wanted to do was enjoy the time away. On the last night of the cruise, we decided to get dressed up for dinner and spend the evening together.

When we got to the restaurant, I knew our luck was in for a memorable evening! The maitre dâ€™ recognized us and seated us close to a lively group of people. We could tell that they had already been sharing stories and having a lot of fun. So, naturally, we joined in the fun.

We started off telling some funny stories of our past travels until someone said something so funny that we all started laughing. We had such a good time that night that all the other diners and waitstaff were laughing along with us! 

Our dinner ended with a several standing ovation from the whole restaurant. Even though we joked that we had done a stand-up comedy routine, it was really the laughter that created a lasting bond between us, our dinner companions, and the waitstaff. Laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people. Even though we all had such different backgrounds, our shared experience of laughter had brought us closer together by the end of the night.
