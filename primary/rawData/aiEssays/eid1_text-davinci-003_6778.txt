Dear Editor, 

As people in the 21st century, we live in an era of unprecedented technological advancement. Computers have had a significant impact on peopleâ€™s lives, and there are both positives and negatives to this trend.

On one hand, computers have enabled people to accomplish greater feats than ever before and act as incredibly efficient tools in our daily lives. With computers, we have access to information that would have otherwise been unfathomable, as well as the ability to communicate with people all around the world.

On the other hand, computer technology has prompted certain detriments to society. An excessive reliance on computers can lead to an unhealthy lack of physical activity, a habit of spending too much time indoors, and an impaired ability to think independently. Additionally, the constant bombardment of digital noise can lead to cognitive overload and impair our ability to concentrate deeply - two essential skills for critical thinking.

I believe that computers can have significant benefits; however, we must remember to take necessary precautions and not let computers take over our lives completely. By regulating our intake of computer-based activities and implementing beneficial habits to counter its detrimental effects, we can ensure a healthy balance between technology and wellbeing. 

I hope that this message will persuade readers to agree with me and to recognize the importance of making responsible use of technology.

Sincerely, 
[Your name]
