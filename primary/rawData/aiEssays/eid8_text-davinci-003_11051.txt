The other day, my best friend and I were walking down the street together when we passed a flower shop. For some reason, my friend started telling me a joke. I couldn't help myself and soon enough, I was doubled over with laughter. The joke was only so-so, but with all the stress of the day, we were both so relieved to be able to laugh together. 

The joke broke the tension of the moment, and instantly made us both feel so much better. We both started talking and sharing stories and before we knew it, the walk home was over. Even though it had been a long day, I felt so much better after our laugh–filled stroll down the street. Laughter has the amazing ability to bond people, even when they’re feeling exhausted and stressed. I’m so glad I have a best friend I can laugh with.
