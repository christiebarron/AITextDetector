The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In 1829, however, a local entrepreneur, James Dolan, commissioned a dirigible-powered submarine to dock. The following year, the city built the Empire State Building to house the two building's five stories; by 1858, it was being used as an industrial workshop for the manufacture of ceramics.

In 1873, the first dirigible took off from New York City and took to the water in an unusual sight. A large wave, which was about 100 feet in diameter and weighing 3,300 pounds and 100 kilometers per hour, pierced the deck of the Empire State Building, which had been designed "with the aim of lifting it to the top," according to historian Paul C. Spence in his essay, The Empire State Building: A Historic Historic Place. The wave pushed the bridge up, knocked the building off its roof, and caused the deck to fill with the seawater. The ship had to be towed out to shore.

The Empire State Building eventually went into service. But at age 53, Dolan decided to add the twin bays in order to get one of the towers off the ground. In his early years, Dolan served in the U.S. Air Force, helping maintain aviation power at the South Carolina airfield, a job
