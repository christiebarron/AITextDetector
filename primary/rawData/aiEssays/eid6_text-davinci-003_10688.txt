Building the Empire State Building was an ambitious undertaking, particularly with regards to one specific technological challenge: the design of a mooring mast high enough to support the new generation of dirigibles. Dirigibles posed a unique set of logistical issues, as they required very specific mooring requirements and the crowded city of New York posed many new and difficult design considerations. In “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock are outlined.

The most pressing issue with allowing dirigibles to dock was the height of the mooring mast. Dirigibles were large and required a 1900 foot mast, which would be almost taller than the building itself. Not only did they need to find a way to construct a mast this large, but they also needed to find a feasible way to do it while simultaneously constructing the entire building. If the mast had been made separately, it would have taken far too long and been too expensive to construct.

The architects and engineers involved in the design of the Empire State building also had to find a way to manage the energy requirements of the dirigibles while docking. Keeping a large dirigible aloft requires a large generator and the cramped, congested city of New York posed many challenges in providing adequate power while also adhering to local safety regulations. On top of that, the cable and wire system with
