The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it gives us to make the connection between this and the book's characters. I will say, though, that we have to read the book very carefully, because it is an epic and a compelling book, to me at least. But, to get this right, let me say, before you buy, if you are into science fiction and fantasy that is not a trilogy for you and your kids, read the book. It's not just science fiction and fantasy you have the movie Star Trek. It's not a trilogy for kids that really is an arc for my kids. It's, instead, more a book we have to watch.
