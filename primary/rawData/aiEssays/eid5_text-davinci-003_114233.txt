Through personal anecdotes from his childhood, Rodriguez paints a vivid picture of his upbringing in a Cuban-American household in the 1970s. He fondly remembers his parents and siblings, their rhythms and rituals, and how those memories shaped who he would become as an adult. Through a combination of humor and sentimentality, Rodriguez captures the warmth of his home life, even in the midst of hardships.

For instance, Rodriguez recalls that his mother was "one of the nation’s first Cuban-American legislators” and “worked endless hours in Albany” to help make ends meet.

In the end, Rodriguez's memoir creates a mood of nostalgia—for a time when family was the center of life and traditions had a lasting impact. He conveys the joy and belonging he felt within the walls of his childhood home, and the pride he gained in his Cuban-American heritage. When readers finish Rodriguez's memoir, they
