I believe that censorship of materials in libraries should also be banned.

The censorship of material on the internet should not be a matter of state censorship.

The censor of materials on the internet, is not a law of the country.

The censor of materials on the internet, is an individual and group of individuals.

The censor who can publish any material or information, by the means of any form of censorship of information, but without the express consent of the people, is not the only one. The citizens of India who think that they are not allowed to publish, is not the only one. The censorship of materials on the internet is also not of state censorship.

This will take courage to resist further actions of the censor of materials on the internet.

I firmly believe that a law should be implemented against those who make use of copyrighted material and give them the opportunity of freely publishing.

However, the laws passed by the Rajya Sabha and all other bodies implementing them, will be against any of it and in violation of the free speech code - I do not want this matter to go further than the Congress Party. There are plenty of people across India who say that any act of the Rajya Sabha cannot happen because the BJP government wants to censor online material so that the party can form government. I do not want that issue to go further than the Congress Party. I demand that the Internet be given a free and open forum in all its forms
