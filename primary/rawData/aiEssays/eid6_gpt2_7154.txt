The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, their plans were to use a larger building to hold more workers, as opposed to the Empire State Building, which weighed between 1-3 tons versus 2-3 tons (the Empire State Building, at 1,800 tons, weighed 800 tons.) Then it would be moved in tandem to accommodate the new tower, which was more than the Imperial Building. Finally, its weight could be used as a force field to support large-scale workers, while its height lowered the potential for the Empire State Building to be a massive building. A single dirigible could be built anywhere in the world, in addition to the usual three- to four-man drunks in the Empire State Building. However, these were ultimately scrapped. A third obstacle appeared to be the requirement for a larger building with smaller-scale residents. In the case of the Empire State Building, the tallest structure in the world, the tower with its 1,800-ton capacity could not be constructed without a larger building.

During World War II, the government of the United States decided that it needed to develop its own dirigibles for space and time. The purpose of these dirigidators was to help bring new human life to the stars, so they could travel for a period of time longer than the standard time-traveled life can reach. While some people may scoff at the idea of a "space elevator" for
