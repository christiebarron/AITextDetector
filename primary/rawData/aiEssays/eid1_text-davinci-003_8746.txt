I was out for a morning walk with my friend when we spotted each other from across the park. We both started to run toward each other in the misty morning, trying to get to the other as quickly as possible. It felt like it took forever even though we were only a few feet away from each other.

Finally, when we were right in front of each other we started to laugh. We couldn't contain ourselves! We laughed so hard that tears started streaming down our faces. Even though it started as a joke, the feeling of contagious laughter was overwhelming and so good. It was one of those moments that affirmed our friendship in a way we both hadn't been expecting. 

After that, we both felt connected to each other in a new way, which was something we both needed to remember. Even though life can be hard and stressful, we know it's important to always make time for each other and find joy in laughing together.
