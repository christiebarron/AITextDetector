The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Even if they did, their attempts to accommodate the traffic of airplanes and motorcycles (and, in some cases, pedestrians) involved a steep steep hill that needed to be swept over a small, concrete archway. The bridge on the left side ran under the bridge at the top of the building at a maximum of seven misshapen, 12-foot-wide-like stones. The bridge across the city was so steep and narrow they needed an alternate access route. The only feasible route was, with the help of the West Side Express Bridge, made so that the three parallel-length ramps on either side of the north section could cross the bridge without encountering a single one-way street.

In 1829, the architect William P. Adams built a bridge across Grand Line on its right-most bank.

The bridge at the center of the city that made way for the new Empire State Building could handle an even larger traffic wave than it did two decades before. A long section of the elevated bridge, with a crosswalk and a few steps that intersect and cross at different points along its span, could accommodate 200 passengers, and a narrow and narrow bridge in the right-most bank could accommodate 15,000.

But in the face of the potential flooding, in 1833 John J. Webster, a resident of the area at the time and one of the architects of the new Empire
