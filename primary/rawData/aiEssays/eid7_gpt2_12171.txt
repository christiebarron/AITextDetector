An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the little girl who I named Marcelle, who got divorced and I kept a job working in my area because my husband was sick. I was very proud of her. She went on to become part of the National Girl Scouts in a few countries, and I took her on. I remember the fact that she went with me to a party of about 20 girls in Europe. That's when I realized that I must have some idea of what had occurred in my life when she and I had married, because the kids from that party of kids all got married, because she and I had that same kind of time apart. And that was a great way of having one look at things -- that was a great way to start a relationship.

BILL MOYERS: You said that you had "great people who grew up together in small towns and never had a problem."


JOEL NODERMAN: That's right. It wasn't very unusual. When it happened, it was a very difficult time for everyone to remember those very rare places where they came and got baptized together in small towns -- that was my home, after all. It was very important for me to be able to talk to that group of people. For each one of them to come and talk to me, who were a part of them, and who would talk to me that day, it had absolutely tremendous impact.
