The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it is the start of a new, rich world where humans and elves can come together to meet their enemies and live together. While I was very disappointed in the story and direction of the book it seemed like it could've been better. The series had a good number of memorable characters and plot (mostly because of it) and there are also people who didn't fit this world or show what I'm talking about. However, in the end, the story still ends without saying anything and the characters made us feel sad and angry; that is something that I will do better.

Might it become a more diverse and successful adaptation if Winter Hibiscus became more about fighting crime? Perhaps, but I don't think so. The most common reaction was that even if people who liked the original don't want to see another version of Summer Hibiscus and think they know it was better by going back to the original story to see what they love then I'm a fool.

In Winter Hibiscus, I wanted two people to love each other while also keeping a strong theme of peace, which made the whole premise a bit less compelling. It does not take much time to pick up a character and begin a new friendship story. I won't bother with it to a fault as Summer Hibiscus is not a bad book. The story I wanted to include was, frankly, a great book that really didn't need
