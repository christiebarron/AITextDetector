It was an unusually busy day in my office, and I was feeling overwhelmed by my workload. I had already been at the office for ten hours, and the afternoon was just beginning. The phones were ringing off the hook and my inbox was overflowing with emails. 

To make matters worse, one of my co-workers was having an incredibly stressful day that was causing them to lash out at everyone they encountered. Rather than returning fire, I stayed calm, tried to lighten the mood with a joke, and offered my support whenever I could. 

Eventually, the day got a little easier. My co-worker was feeling much better, and the work load eased up a bit. It wasn't easy keeping my patience, but in the end, it was worth it. Not only was I able to help a struggling colleague, but I was also able to keep my head and not let the situation get out of hand.
