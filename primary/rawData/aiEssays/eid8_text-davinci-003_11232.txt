It was the best day of my life. I was getting married to the love of my life, my high school sweetheart, and I was so excited. We'd been together for ten years and we were finally tying the knot. 

We had just been pronounced husband and wife and were walking back down the aisle, my arm around her waist, when the whole place erupted in laughter. It turns out she had just stepped in a puddle of water – apparently spilled during the ceremony – and it had splashed everywhere. She took it in stride, laughing along with everyone else, and I just had to stop and kiss her. We smiled at each other and held hands as laughter echoed around us. 

That was the moment I knew, despite whatever else happened, no matter what life throws at us, that laughter would always connect us. It was the start of something beautiful.
