The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because I am always looking at how it should progress, for example. So when weafort a new book, we decided to focus on a different kind of story arc. So there are some interesting characters I have had a hard time talking about. One was my older brother, my cousin, my uncle. He was all like, "Oh, he has no idea what it's like to be in your brother's life." And it was great to know that he would want something different just with him.
