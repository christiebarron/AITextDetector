The Empire State Building has long been associated with grandeur and innovation since its construction began in 1929. Its most original feature was perhaps the incorporation of a docking area for dirigibles, something that had never been done before. However, the path to making that possible was not without its obstacles. 

In order to fully understand the challenges associated with establishing a mooring mast at the Empire State Building, it is essential to first understand the structure of the mast itself. The mast was constructed of a steel tube with a spider-web-like lattice filled with hundreds of thin steel cables in order to provide additional support and stability. The "crown" of the mast was topped with a weather dome to protect the docking mast from the elements, and the base had a large metal plate along with electric generators and a "portable dock" in order to provide a safe place for the dirigibles to rest.

The considerations for such a structure were extremely intricate, and the pressure was high for those involved in its construction. First and foremost, the mast had to be designed in such a way that it could withstand high winds. Winds could potentially cause the dirigible to swing, so the mast must be able to retain its stability and hold in place. Additionally, the various components of the mast, including the cables and the dome, must be manufactured with precision and reliability in order to provide enough support for the docking vehicles.
