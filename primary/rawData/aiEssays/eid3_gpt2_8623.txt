Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. All the different features of one setting affect that bike – for example, on how fast your tires and brakes run by making sure you have a good-sized tire. While we love a wide range of rules you can pick on, if you decide to go up for 'Rough Road Ahead' you will want a good set of rules. The rules are:

The roads will not change.

The roads will not fall to the ground.

The walls of the roads will stay strong

Good-sized tires will protect riders from damage but small tyres won't.

Rough roads are a great way to introduce new rules but there are a number of rules you can use to keep roads clean and flat against dirt and mud. I'm not going to go into great detail about any particular set of rules, just know that to be honest we're quite a bit closer to that of those used by us all.
