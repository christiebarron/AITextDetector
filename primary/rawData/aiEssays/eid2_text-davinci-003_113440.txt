In todayâ€™s world, censorship in libraries is a hot topic for discussion. As the fight for freedom of information continues, many people see an increasing need for censorship in our public libraries. Libraries are a valuable resource that should provide all patrons of all ages and backgrounds the ability to access a variety of materials. This means that the library should have the ability to filter materials deemed inappropriate for certain age groups or which contradict the values and beliefs of a certain section of the society. 

It stands to reason that the library should be allowed to make decisions about the materials it makes available, but these decisions should be made carefully and thoughtfully, and with respect to the right of access to information. By this I mean that while certain materials may be offensive, they still retain an informational value. Therefore, libraries should be allowed to censor materials, but should be justifiably and sensibly specific in their choices. 

As such, when considering what materials to censor, certain guidelines should be followed. For instance, libraries should consider the age group of those using the library as well as the values and morals of the local community. By eliminating materials which contain elements considered inappropriate for a certain age group, libraries can better ensure that children and teenagers are not exposed to materials above their maturity level. Also, libraries should keep in mind the local community's values and morals when making censorship decisions. This is important in order to maintain an atmosphere of respect and support for the community.
