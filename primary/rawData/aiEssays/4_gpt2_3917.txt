(We're still waiting for confirmation, but it's very telling.)

The book's author explains that his relationship with MacLean began when he read an idea that an international team of scientists on the International Space Station came up with back in 2004. The idea was that, since the astronauts from the space station are flying with so many others on board, they would get to do some useful experiments with the rest of the crew.

While he may not have realized it had been laid out so well, he was inspired to write it when some of that team (the guys from Australia, for example) met with him and said they could share their expertise and data, without all the financial support there is today.

MacLean says he's spent four years of his life working with space stations; his career at Nasa in Washington DC dates back to the 70's; his parents were astronauts; his younger brother is a fellow astronaut. He and his wife have their own consulting business, and when he's not busy getting to know people in the field, he often comes by the Space Shuttle Endeavour, a space station made
