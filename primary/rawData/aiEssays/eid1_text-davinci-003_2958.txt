Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my viewpoint on the effects of computers on people and communities.

Over the past several decades, computers have had an enormous effect on our lives—from our work to our entertainment, to the way we access information. Computers have allowed us unprecedented access to data and analysis that has allowed us to make decisions faster and more accurately than ever before. In many ways, computer technology has given us an immense boost in productivity.

At the same time, there have been some genuinely negative effects brought about by the widespread use of computers. Studies have shown that increased computer use can lead to a decrease in physical exercise, impacting overall health and well-being. Additionally, spending too much time on computers can lead to strained relationships, both personal and professional.

Despite these drawbacks, overall, computers have been a net positive for human society. The advancements they have made in our lives—from greater convenience and efficiency, to improved quality of life—outweigh any potential drawbacks.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I encourage readers to consider both the benefits and drawbacks of computer use and weigh them carefully before using them.

Sincerely,

[Your Name
