Computers have many effects on people. On their way to employment, they can be affected by a number of things. Most people learn that they need to learn a new language more quickly and less likely to try and avoid other languages. They may also become more concerned with whether they should attend classes at which the language appears or the jobs they are going back to. People might not realize they are doing what they are doing and are going to find it a challenge to speak.

These problems lead to a lot of problems with the language and with language management. Some of these are: not being able to properly organize and supervise language programs by school; being not knowing how to use a system efficiently, in which case programs are often not as well organized and perform as they should be; not understanding that most languages are written with minimal effort. Learning how to use all the variables used at the end of the program are challenging because of all these problems.

Language management can help. Language management can help people, especially those who aren't programmers or computer analysts, understand that these problems are more than just physical problems that need to be resolved. Language management can make the problems worse. It can do more harm than good. The problem often comes down to: how to deal with the language, and who to find people with the language ability to learn languages, and how to manage these people. Understanding how to manage these people can be very helpful for people who struggle with language.
