The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. A lack of open space in the basement of the building meant builders had only one choice, to build their own dirigibles. The Empire State Building was built in 1906 by William B. W. Davis, who was chairman and CEO of the National Institute of Standards and Technology. In 1920 he gave the Federal Building Administration the authority to build a dirigibles under the direction of Henry B. Cushman. This arrangement, which kept the Building Department (which oversaw dirigible building) busy and in session, meant that the Empire State Building could easily serve as a hub of commerce. The Empire State Buildings were also a source of amusement for the Chinese on visits to the White House and the World Trade Center. In 1924 China, which had refused to build a dirigible or even a dirigible's engine since the early 1900s, created a dirigible named The City Star. It was soon shareholders were so excited about a dirigible that Chinese investor Wang Fuqi was excited to do so. The tower was named The City Star, after its founder and CEO, Wang Fuqi. By 1925 a Chinese investor named Wang Jiafeng built the first dirigible on New York's Lower East Side where it would begin to take on the role of an engine carrier.
