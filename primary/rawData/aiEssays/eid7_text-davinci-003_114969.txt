I recently had to take my elderly grandmother to her medical appointments. She has difficulty walking and gets easily confused. We had scheduled four appointments for that day and it turned out to be a very long and tiresome day. 

At the first appointment, she couldn’t remember why she was there and her doctor took longer than expected. At the second and third appointments, she couldn’t remember what medications she was taking and needed help from the doctor. By the fourth appointment, she was exhausted and began to doze off in the waiting room. 

It was getting late and I was feeling frustrated. I wanted to get home but knew my grandmother wasn’t capable of taking all the stress of the day. So I decided to remain very calm and patient, no matter how long it took.

Finally, the fourth appointment ended and I helped my grandmother walk out to her car. We made it home without any further delays. I was so proud of myself for being patient and understanding despite the frustrating circumstances.
