The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They chose to use only two of the four lights, rather than one. The light had to fly through the windows, on the same line as the engine, to allow the light to travel through the building. However, due to poor weather conditions, it was impossible to fly this way because of the high wind and the wind speed. The problem was compounded by another obstacle of the same kind, a building that allowed the pilots to see everything.

There were an estimated 90,000 residents of D.C Passage who came all the way from France or the United States, but no one would come to the building to see. The few surviving members of the Empire State Building were all dead when someone hit them with a hammer or a sledgehammer.
