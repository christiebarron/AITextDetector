The construction of the Empire State Building was a marvel of engineering innovation and feat of human endurance that forever changed the skylines of New York City. Part of the allure of the building was its creative aspects. At one point, the building was envisioned as having a mooring mast that would allow dirigibles to dock on its uppermost floors. While this impressive idea was full of potential, there were many obstacles the builders of this iconic structure had to face in order to make it a reality. 

The most daunting of these obstacles was the precariousness of the endeavor. In his article, “The Mooring Mast”, Marcia Amidon Lüsted states that “While it seemed feasible on paper, having lighter-than-air craft moor at one of the world’s tallest buildings presented a number of engineering and safety challenges.” Such a feat had never been done before and there were no existing designs to draw from, leading to uncertainty about the success of the endeavor. Height was also an issue. The level of the mast had to be several hundred feet above the ground to avoid the buildings obstructing the craft’s descent and narrowness of the streets beneath the building. It was a difficult struggle to guarantee that the airships would have enough room to maneuver safely, especially considering the constraints of the narrow streets. 

The last of the primary challenges was the landing procedure. Since the structure of the
