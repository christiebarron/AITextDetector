I remember a time when I was driving to work and got stuck behind a slow-moving vehicle. It was incredibly frustrating, but instead of flying off the handle, I chose to take a deep breath and be patient. I didn't honk or try to squeeze around them, which I'm sure I would have regretted later. I was able to stay calm, regardless of the situation, and when I finally passed them, I gave them a friendly wave.

I'm proud of myself for choosing to be patient and having enough self-control to not give in to my impulses. It was a great reminder that sometimes taking things slow and being understanding can be the best course of action.
