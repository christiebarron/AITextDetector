Dear Editor,

I believe that computers have had a profound effect on the way people perceive their world and interact with it. We now have global access to information and ideas that fulfill our curiosities. We can stay in touch with friends and family around the world and access support networks outside of our geographic boundaries. Computers are also revolutionizing our economy, connecting buyers and sellers from every corner of the world. 

However, the effects of computers can be both positive and negative. While they offer incredible opportunities for learning and growth, they can also be addictive and isolating. People can become stifled in their own narrow perspective and rely too heavily on computers for social and personal growth.

As with any technology, balance is essential when interacting with computers. We must strive to take advantage of the potential of this valuable tool while maintaining an awareness of our own thoughts, feelings, and physical needs. 

I encourage readers to consider the positive and negative effects computers can have on our overall well-being, and to use this technology wisely. 

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
