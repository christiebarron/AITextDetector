Minfong Ho ends Winter Hibiscus with this line to create a sense of hopefulness and resurrection. By tying the determination of the protagonist, Su Lan, to the metaphor of the hibiscus bud coming back in the spring despite the snow, the author is illustrating growth and resilience even in the face of adversity. This provides a powerful message of hope and perseverance. Moreover, the imagery of the geese returning symbolizes renewal and also references the migrant experience of Su Lan and her family, reinforcing the story's theme of overcoming the hurdle of being a newcomer.
