I believe that censorship of materials in libraries isn't what the government wants it to be," he said.

Still, a number students at the University of Cincinnati, which has about 450 students, have been asking the department to cut off free speech in public.

"If schools are allowed to censor, they may feel more secure," said Paul Cai., a 19-year-old sophomore at the university, who has never been affected by free speech suppression.

U.S. Rep. Mark Rangel said he supports an ordinance that would allow local schools to require students to remove objectionable material if they find it offensive.

He urged the school and the mayor to work together to make a positive difference.

"I think what you're saying is if we take them to task for their actions, they'll get what they want," Rangel said. "I don't think these government officials are very good. They should think again."
