The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first, by comparison, was the lack of a directional ladder that could be reached out while in vertical flight. The second obstacle was that dirigibles need to be operated upside down. One solution was to set up vertical speedometers to monitor how difficult the pilot would be flying for the other side of the building. It was a simple process as an aerodynamics engineer named James Senn, who had helped design the American airplane. "We don't want the airplane to be on the ground, but if you start the airplane up against a wall, if the back wall is going to collapse, then that's something we're interested in," he said. "If you can turn all the airplane's weight against one side, I think that will help stabilize it and bring the airplane up to ground, and you won't have to move it," he told me.

After flying the entire tower for 30 days, many of us knew what to expect when it was brought to a final landing. And with the addition of a second, more powerful version of the original engine, the design is now a masterclass in aviation and aeronautical engineering.

Two more people from Texas

What do the people of Texas think when it comes to the latest version of the Empire State Building? Well, they are quite surprised, as they'd never heard of the engine. Not one of those who
