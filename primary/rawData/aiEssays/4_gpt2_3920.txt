The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it focuses on an experience, and not just about your personal experiences, about your own and others' lives. On one level Winter Hibiscus does have a profound impact upon the way you think about things, and how you believe things on the surface. The book doesn't just explore the inner life of a bookworm, it explores the inner world and the way that an inner life is experienced. It gives us a perspective into the inner world of an author. And in that sense Winter Hibiscus is a great author, just as that book I published earlier: I believe that there are moments where I can tell and change all of my own thoughts, dreams, and actions, just as I do as I create my own book. The book is written with a sense of wonder. There's no doubt about it, and there will be moments of such transformation that will change my life forever.
