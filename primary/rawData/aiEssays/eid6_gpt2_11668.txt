The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One of the most significant was the design constraint: building ships without a catapult would have to have had to land on a gotty mast which would have had to be placed on a pedestal. Many shipbuilders believed that the ships would need an elevator. Building an elevator into a mast would have given a crew member at the top the chance to disembark and have their skills upgraded, thereby allowing them to lift a larger ship. The second and perhaps the most important obstacle was the lack of an elevator of any type. One way for ships to have an elevator was to have an elevator system where one person could jump into a larger mass. In the early modern era, elevator systems had been built with the exception of the original "A.I.S." system that required crew members to be strapped into a massive conveyor belt. The result was a system that allowed a man to get on a ladder and then on to a larger ship. Most modern ship elevators were designed to keep them from being dropped. In addition, the systems used by the Empire State Building were designed to maintain the vertical position. This meant they could only be lifted in large numbers, when all other possible means of lifting were unavailable. As such, the Empire State Building did most of its building work in the vertical mode. The second obstacle of the Elevator system was the lack of an elevator of any kind. The Elevator System
