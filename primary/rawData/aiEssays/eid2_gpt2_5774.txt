I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is one important reason why certain kinds of content should be protected.


The information in the online marketplace, including social networking sites, which includes public domain online materials must reflect personal information, such as your birth date, gender and marriage history.


You have the responsibility of ensuring your data is protected by law, because, by placing such information on a website, you give it to a website that is clearly identifiable to the website owner.


If you choose to display such information anonymously, you assume your identity, while they do not. If a person uses a website and the website takes direct action to remove it, it is very likely that the information will be used as a way to retaliate against them.
