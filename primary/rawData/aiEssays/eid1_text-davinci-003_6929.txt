To the Editor: 

Censorship in libraries is a hot button issue within the literary and public discourse space. Do we have a right to remove materials from library shelves if they are found to be offensive? I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, should not be removed from the shelves. 

The founding principle of libraries is to serve the public by providing access to information. Books, videos, and other library materials should not be removed from shelves simply because some people find them offensive or disagree with them. Censorship of any kind is a dangerous erosion of freedom of speech and expression. To remove materials that may spark debate, or discomfort, simply isnâ€™t the answer.

By keeping materials in libraries, discussions can take place, opinions can be exchanged, and ideas can be shared. Provoking thought is the aim of libraries, so censoring items is counter-intuitive to its mission. All readers should be advised of the content materials contain. Censorship only serves to deprive the public of knowledge and access to different perspectives.

In a world of increasing digital control, censorship should not extend the physical library walls. Information should be made accessible so discussions can be had, and discourse can occur. Censoring and removing certain library materials for fear that it will offend someone will do more harm than good. 

Sincerely,
