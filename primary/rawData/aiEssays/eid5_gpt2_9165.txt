The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' (1996) is, quite literally, that the film went too far. It features a cast including Billy Shindell, George Reeves, Roger Deakins, Michael Giacchino and Jack White, with a twist that would become central to the film's success: the filmmakers want to see the character's life go on forever. (The Hollywood Reporter noted in an interview with the film's studio in 2011: "It's that kind of thing.")

The plot has changed, and the movie remains as an intensely personal film about a man's need to make a living in Hollywood. That, combined with a series of events that eventually led to his death in a car accident shampooing his clothes in a pool, mean little, when the film ends. The movie doesn't play out as it's told, but it still has a strong sense of story.

'From Home' is available in the U.S. through DVD and digitally at FilmOnDVD.com.
