I was out on a first date with my now husband. We had had a really good evening - chatting and finding out all about each other. As the night was ending, we took a walk down a quiet street near the restaurant. We were chatting and getting to know each other better, talking about our families, jobs, and aspirations.

At one point he said something that I found so silly and unexpected that I couldn't help but burst into laughter. We were both laughing so much that neither of us remembered what we were even talking about.

The laughter was infectious. We just kept laughing and laughing until tears were streaming down our faces. We were making such a spectacle of ourselves, but at the same time it just felt so good.

We stood together, laughing until we finally ran out of breath. We looked at each other, both of us realizing that something magical had just happened. We had already found that ultimate connection between two people through laughter.
