An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the time I was hospitalized and I was out in the middle of a battle over medical issues I was struggling with but did feel safe. I was back home and I was in no position to tell when things would get better but after my first few days of being discharged from that hospital, my anxiety got the worst.

How do you balance the time you're away and the stresses (stress) that you have in your life? We're all different and there are different ways that you can go about it so it's something we see, especially for many adults.

For patients who often don't have that experience, we can get involved to talk for a while and to talk again about problems that will come up, but as it gets tougher for them, we need time to really look at how that's been experienced. Many of the patients who I see these days are really in recovery. They don't even think about the fact that they are dealing with a serious illness and they still have hope that Skype will help them navigate the pain of it.

Are there barriers to getting help?

I feel like I am the one that can help the most. People are still being neglected and I am the one that is able to keep in contact with them. This means that I find I can ask myself questions (like "Can I be there?") and then we will be there for them.
