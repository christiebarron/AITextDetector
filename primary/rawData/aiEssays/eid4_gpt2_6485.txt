The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it's telling the story of a single person that has seen their dad become a millionaire from a single birth with only a simple dream. It's a story of a small family growing up together but going out on a journey with the love of their lives. I wanted him to come off as very, very much a selfish, selfish young XI player, which obviously he is, but he was still a very good player anyway and he's on his way to Agricultural College and probably better than any of us have ever known.

With the book's introduction we see the story taking place in a different world where a younger version of this character (a man named James Fagan) is in charge of the farm which is under the control of the father of a daughter. What this character had before him, as he describes the whole story in the book (not for the first time I might add), was an older version of James from a story in which the father of a girl had been killed and so was the new father who will take over. In the early 1980s that role changed when the new father became the new president.

There was also a number of other changes too, such as the name change so that James C. now has a sister named Diana (who is the female name of his father, although he has no sister, as her father is not the president of the company, is his sister's husband),
