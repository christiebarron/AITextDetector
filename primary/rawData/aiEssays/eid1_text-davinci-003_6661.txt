Dear Editor, 

As technology advances at a rapid pace, computers have become an integral part of our daily lives. They are used in everything from education to entertainment, but what are the effects computers have on people?

I believe computers are a wonderful resource that have had a positive impact on people’s lives. For instance, they allow people to access information quickly and easily, making projects and research much easier and more efficient. They also allow us to stay connected with family and friends who may live miles away from us. By creating a platform of communication, we can stay connected and share information much quicker than was once possible.

In addition, computers have enabled us to be more productive in work or school. For example, they can help us to more easily organize our schedules and stay on task. With all the helpful apps and software available at our fingertips, computers make tasks that were once tedious into a breeze.

Lastly, computers provide us with a vast array of sources of entertainment. We can watch movies, listen to music, play games, and browse the internet in order to pass the time. We can also expand our knowledge about different topics by researching them online. 

Though there are some downsides to the use of computers, the many positives outweigh them. Whether you’re in school, at home, or at work, computers can help make life so much easier and more enjoyable. I urge you to consider the many benefits
