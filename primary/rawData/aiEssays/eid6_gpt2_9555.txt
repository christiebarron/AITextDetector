The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Many were worried that the vehicle would eventually collapse, or that they were going too far. The building's current owner, Fred E. Ebersolberg, and his heirs had a solution: use lasers to block the space behind the driver's seat.

They discovered that the driver's seat had enough mass to allow the rear projector to be removed. By placing a powerful telescope in the front of the window and using the lasers to illuminate the air beneath, they could observe the entire scene with zero risk of a collision. They believed that the projector could be disabled even if the driver's seat remained on the building facade. As an alternative, they could use an infrared laser to see up to ten kilometers (more than ten miles) in the sky.

When Ebersolberg first learned of the use of lasers for the viewing of the whole city, he was excited. This was the first time the laser had been used for a city project, but Ebersolberg believed that it would be a good idea now and in the future, so that any city building would have laser-defocusing devices. So, he began to design the laser-deflecting glass with a mirror and other materials for use on high-tech skyscrapers.

As the sky over the Empire State Building rose and set, Ebersolberg and a few other architects built the Empire State Building
