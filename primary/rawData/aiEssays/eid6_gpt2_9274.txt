The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first and most obvious was the fact that the building was designed to be "unpaved." However, after making several changes to the design of the building, including a double-walled roof and an improved entrance and back door, the building was built with such care that the first time it was touched, the Empire State Building opened up to the public.

The construction in New York City of the "New Liberty" statue brought excitement and excitement to the New and old alike.
