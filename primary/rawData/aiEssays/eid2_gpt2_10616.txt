I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is absolutely essential to the free public." His position on censorship appears to be consistent with what many other libertarian voices at the time advocated—but he did not endorse it. But it can also reflect how he was reacting: his comments, like the ones that came from George J. Bush, are now widely reported by mainstream outlets, including The New York Times, the Washington Post and the San Francisco Chronicle.

When the U.S. Constitution is amended or ratified, the laws that prevent government interference in our lives are amended to make sure that the government is not interfering in our personal lives. What is particularly striking is how many publications — not just the New York Times and the Washington Post — openly endorse that kind of anti-censorship stance.

In a letter to members on Jan. 20, 2005, the editor of The Onion wrote:

"On March 12, 2013, The Sunday Times is going to be re-elected because it is the only newspaper that supports censorship without a vote by the public. When it comes to The Onion, I don't know when it will run again. I am afraid. But if The Onion will not run again, people will still be afraid of it. They are afraid of the government's influence on their lives. I'm very afraid of what the public knows about the situation. I hope that the public will see that they don't always support a strong anti-censorship position at first
