The setting in "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski plays a significant role in showcasing the cyclist's struggles as they navigate the course. The mountainous terrain of the road is the primary obstacle, as the cyclist is forced to tackle a seemingly never-ending uphill climb. The grade of the incline itself is an incredible challenge for even the most athletic athletes, as their physical strength is not enough to carry them up the entire way.

The cycler’s journey is briefly interrupted by a few short, but sharp, downhill sections. These sections offer a brief respite from the rigorous uphill climb, but create their own challenge as the biker finds themselves having to navigate around tight corners at high speeds. The constant presence of wet and slippery rocks throughout the course is another hazard, as the cyclist must remain vigilant to avoid sliding off the side of the mountain.

The presence of other athletes on the road further adds to the difficulty of the cyclist’s journey. The athlete must remain mindful of their actions, always on the lookout for cyclists who may have a different approach to the terrain. Despite all of these challenges, the cyclist still manage to reach the peak of the mountain, a testament to their resolve and dedication to their sport. The setting of "Rough Road Ahead" reveals the arduous task ahead of the athlete, and indeed in life, serving as an inspiring reminder of the power of perseverance in the face of adversity.
