An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was in middle school. I knew I was going to spend my life on one platform. And, of course, if I did that, what could I say? I would be able to say: there's no such thing as human progress. If you have to make progress you have to be human. And that's no good, you have to have a right to progress. So I came to the conclusion that this isn't progress at all, this is progress.

P. S. The first sentence in your essay is "progress" and "progress over time" as if they didn't exist. I've been using the term "progress" as an umbrella to describe various issues, but this is a different topic. The "progress" of the human population is not "progress over time" like the "progress of money" or "progress over government." Human progress should be "progress over time." But at the same time, for many of us, a system that allows us to have more leisure, more leisure for our children, more leisure for our grandchildren and future generations, is the sort of thing that's not progress.

(One of my favorite passages in the essay is "On Wealth," a well-known philosophical treatise on self-actualization that came out of the United States in 1981, when you were at a young age.)
