The setting of “Rough Road Ahead,” by Joe Kurmaski, has a strong influence on the cyclist and his experience. The road cuts through the remote countryside, and the cyclist is reminded of its harshness as he pedals on. The heat of the day adds to the discomfort of the cyclist, and the winding paths, full of obstacles, grinds at him. As Kurmaski’s narrator states, “The sun’s heat bore down like a furnace, and the air was thick and oppressive, making me feel both drained and slightly delirious with my effort”. The heat of the day, combined with the desolate landscape, puts the cyclist in a dangerous situation; the physical strain of the long journey is compounded by his mental struggle as he continues against his own will.

In addition, the cyclist is frequently thrown off by unseen surprises; he must often battle against the thick brush or hidden rocks that threaten to tear into his legs. This inconsistency in the terrain adds to the sense of unease felt by the cyclist, as even the paths that he had once considered safe can suddenly become treacherous.
