Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the ever-growing role of computers in 21st century life. In my opinion, computers have both positive and negative effects on people.

The positive aspects cannot be ignored. Computers provide a wealth of information at our fingertips, while their applications extend to practically every industry, from banking and entertainment, to education and healthcare. They allow us to stay connected with people from all corners of the globe and provide us with the opportunity to learn new skills and gain a better understanding of technology and the tools it provides us with.

That said, there is a less desirable side to computers as well. They can be incredibly time consuming for users and can even become addictive. They take us away from more meaningful face-to-face conversations, and can easily become a distraction in the workplace or in our free time.

I do believe, however, that the positives of computers outweigh the negatives in the long run. We must remember that computers are not bad; they are our tools that offer us incredible potential if used appropriately. We must put in the necessary effort to ensure their proper usage.

Sincerely,

[Your name]
