As an avid library-goer, I believe that censorship in libraries is an important issue that needs to be addressed. Libraries are essential suppliers of information, and they should not be used as a platform for censorship. Certain materials, such as books, music, movies and magazines should not be removed from the shelves simply because they are found to be offensive.

The idea that materials could be taken away from libraries due to the potential of their content to be offensive is an idea that cannot be supported. Censoring these materials does more harm than good, as it can lead to a lack of an open dialogue, the loss of library users' freedoms, and the restriction of ideas and knowledge. Libraries are, after all, a source of knowledge, and it is important that they continue to serve the public in an unbiased manner by not censoring certain materials.

Censorship can also lead to the loss of user freedoms. People should be able to utilize books, music, movies and magazines of their choice without fear of them being removed due to their contents. Not allowing this type of choice and control to library patrons undermines the right to freely access information and express themselves. People should be able to access materials that they find interesting
