The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. It was expected that a new public space would be built on top of the building.

However, the project failed as soon as the builders of the building faced more than one obstacle. A high percentage of the project's project builders took on different positions within the Empire State Building, including building a second-floor building of the Empire State Building.

The Empire State Building had many Caleb Houses (i.e., the homes that a visitor takes during the winter months for purposes of travel), along with some public housing.

To help address these needs, the City of Salem and its City Council chose to open the Albany Building, originally called the East St. Clair Building, under a new ownership.
