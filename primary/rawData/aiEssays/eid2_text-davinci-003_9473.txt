Recently, there has been a growing debate in local communities over the question of censorship in libraries. Should libraries continue to provide patrons with access to any and all materials, no matter how offensive they may be, or should certain materials be removed from the shelves if they are found to be offensive? As an advocate for free speech and access to information, I strongly believe that censorship in libraries is unnecessary and counterproductive.

The most fundamental reason to oppose censorship in libraries is to ensure that Americans have access to all the information they need in order to form their own opinions. Libraries are not only places of entertainment, but they are also institutions devoted to advancing knowledge and understanding. Removing certain materials from the shelves in order to protect certain sensibilities robs patrons of the opportunity to make educated decisions about the materials they are accessing. 

Furthermore, censorship in libraries flies in the face of free speech. While it is understandable to want to protect children from certain materials, this should not come at the expense of freedom of the press. Without the ability to openly discuss and explore different ideas, perspectives, and topics, society would lack critical dialogue, which is necessary for society to grow and make progress.

Finally, censorship in libraries has the potential to backfire. Limiting access to certain materials might have unintended consequences, such as piquing public interest towards those very materials. By banning certain materials, libraries are painting these materials in a forbidden light, which can actually draw more attention to them
