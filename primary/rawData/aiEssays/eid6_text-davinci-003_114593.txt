The Empire State Building was an ambitious undertaking that required the best engineering and construction techniques of the day in order to become one of the most iconic buildings in the world. One of the unique aspects of the design was the inclusion of a mast which was intended to facilitate docking of dirigibles. However, the task of allowing these airships to dock at the mast was an enormous technical challenge for the engineers designing the building.

The first hurdle in providing secure docking for dirigibles was the design the mast itself. The mooring mast, which was an engineering marvel standing 420 feet tall, had to be sturdy and secure while still allowing an airship to dock without damaging the building. The mast was designed using a reinforced concrete core surrounded by steel and connected to the building by two triangulated steel cables. This design allowed for the mast to take the weight of the airships while remaining attached to the building.

Once the structural integrity of the mast was assured, the next major challenge was making the process of docking more reliable. This required an ability to confidently guide and steady airships to dock with precision, which meant overcoming a multitude of technical issues. The mooring mast was equipped with a system of pulleys which worked in tandem with a system of telescopic winches. The winches allowed the airships to descends while the pulley system could be used to adjust the angle of the mast and help guide the approaching airship to its mooring
