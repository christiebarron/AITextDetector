The memoir From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives holds a certain nostalgia that radiates off the pages in every story. Narciso Rodriguez had such an interesting life journey, traveling the world and growing up experiencing different cultures, that it can be hard to nail down an exact mood of the book.

The memoir is filled with a range of feelings that come together to form a unique brand of melancholy. Many of the stories involve moments of nostalgia tinted with sadness, such as when the author recalls his grandmother's voice singing and how it reminded him of lost times in his home country of Puerto Rico. There are times when he looks back on his childhood with both fondness and a bit of sadness, such as when he reflects on his parents' struggles raising him in New York City.

There is, however, something very uplifting about the memoir as well. Rather than letting the sadness overwhelm the stories, the author frames them in this overarching idea of taking what you learn and using it to create something new. He reflects on how his upbringing and experiences shape his design philosophy and new creations.

So, the overall mood of From Home is a mixture of nostalgia and hope. It looks back on the past with a bit of sentimentality, but ties it back to a bigger idea about self-discovery and growth. It's a unique hybrid of both sad and happy that leaves the reader with an uplifting feeling.
