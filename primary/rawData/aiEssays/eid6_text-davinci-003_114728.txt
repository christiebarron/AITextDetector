The simple task of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was fraught with obstacles, as revealed in Marcia Amidon Lüsted's, "The Mooring Mast." Because the airships, or dirigibles, of the 1930s were massive and carried flammable gasses, dirigible docking had to be executed with precision and care. This was especially true of the Empire State Building, the tallest building of the time, and one with an international reputation to uphold. 

One of the foremost problems the builders of the Empire State Building faced was surfacing the right materials with the appropriate capabilities for the mooring mast. It needed to be strong enough to secure the dirigibles and keep them from bumping into the walls of the building either when docked or while maneuvering in the air. The Empire State Building’s mast was eventually constructed from steel and lined with reinforced felt material in order to be strong and absorb the shock. 

However, the issue of putting out fires posed a major risk in the potential destruction of the building and the lives of many of those on board. Since the dirigibles of the time were powered by flammable hydrogen, the builders instituted a safety policy, which included setting up a water sprinkler system on the mast as well as water tanks up on the 102nd floor. In order to prevent collisions, they also created several guide lights on the mast that flashed at five-second
