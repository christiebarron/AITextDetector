The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. After the collapse of the first steam power plant in New York City, builders began to build a single-use elevator for the massive building that was about to enter its 15th floor. This would be the tallest structure in the United States. The Empire State Building had to be built in a fashion designed for heavy vehicles. No longer was the height of the building required to be too high, for those builders would have to increase the height of the building using additional materials.

But all this meant the collapse of the first steam power plant in New York City was too late. Only 20 years after the building began, the tower still rests beneath the rubble of New York's historic buildings that had once been a key hub for trade and commerce. The buildings would not be renovated in light of the collapse. The towers remained standing for nearly three centuries. They will never be demolished and they will remain in their original condition.
