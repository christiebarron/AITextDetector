Dear Editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. As someone who works in the technology industry, I can attests to the fact that the computer can be very beneficial to us as a society.

For starters, computers have vastly improved our access to information. We are now able to research any topic we can think of in a matter of seconds. We can now also connect with people in distant countries and develop relationships with them. Computers have made our lives infinitely easier.

Moreover, computers have enabled us to create new and innovative products that make our lives easier. From cars to household appliances, computers play a vital role in the making of these tools. They also help us to store and access data quickly, and to create sophisticated models for understanding complex phenomena. 

It is true that there have been some negative consequences of computer technology. For example, it has taken away many jobs that used to be done by humans. However, the potential for humans to use computers to create new and innovative products that will, in turn, lead to new job opportunities far surpasses this. 

In conclusion, computers have had a tremendous positive influence on our lives. The ability to access information, create products, and store data quickly gives us the opportunity to better understand the world and the potential to create an even better one for future generations.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
