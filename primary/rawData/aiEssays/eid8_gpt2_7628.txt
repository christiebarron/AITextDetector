One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I lived in the USA, just on the east coast of Africa. When I came to the US, I learned that Americans are not afraid and are proud to have people they have met over the past 12 years.

Here we have our wonderful countrymen who represent all areas of American culture and nation. It's great they are in charge, but let us not forget that it means many things when we talk about our cultural heritage, with our history, our culture, even our heritage that is really strong and unique.

It means knowing the people who know the American story. Let's hope that there will be a return to the American American with a new set of friends, family members and relationships. Our country is very lucky because of those two things:

We never once heard of the American story because our country was so unique and beautiful, but instead that legend grew by accident. The time it took for us to become real people – it was one of those moments – we lived it and grew, not with the people we are trying to convince.

But there are many more wonderful things we could accomplish with a nation of people.
