The Empire State Building was designed in 1929, during the height of airship travel. This prompted many to ask the question: could dirigibles, such as the Hindenburg, dock at the top of the building? After much exploration, the idea was ultimately rejected due to the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced.

First, the actual structure of the building was not suitable for mooring airships. The Empire State Building’s steel skeleton construction and its lack of wide-open spaces made it impossible to anchor the dirigibles in any sort of secure way. In order to be suitable for docking, the building would have required a much wider and heavier mooring mast, and the structure of the building made that impossible. 

The elevator shafts of the building were also an obstacle. Without a secure mooring mast, the elevator shafts were too narrow to allow airships to dock safely. A docking dirigible would risk damaging the building by colliding with the shafts, and the shafts also posed a risk to any docked dirigibles, as elevator cables could get caught in the propellers of the aircraft. The overweight mooring mast would also have presented an engineering challenge as the same elevator shafts the dirigibles had to navigate held the building’s elevators.

For safety reasons, a suitable landing zone would also have had to have been constructed for the dirigibles to dock
