An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my great love for my husband and his wife and all of their love and support and it was really good when they reached them in person. Being around so many people of that age for the past 20 years, the experience was so great.

"That's really what I thought on the journey back to that time.

"It really helped my own life."

Sgt. Kevin Hogg, the head officer at Brisbane Police Station, described the moment:

"I wasn't going to go back and just go to jail any more.

"Those girls were really good, beautiful, strong to go out and that's what inspired me to bring them in here in Brisbane."

The incident is still under investigation.
