Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects of computers and digital technology on people. In an era of rapidly progressing technology, computers have become an integral part of our lives. From our workplaces to our homes, they help us to accomplish tasks quickly, efficiently, and sometimes even conveniently. 

At the same time, what most people overlook is the possibility of their having negative effects on our daily lives. For one, increased reliance on computers tends to lead to a decrease in physical activity, making us lazy and lethargic. With technology taking control of even the simplest of tasks, people become more and more dependent on it. Consequently, as opposed to physical activities, people tend to remain engaged for gadgets, which more often than not, is harmful to the eyes and the body in the long run.

Moreover, technology has had a persuasive influence on our social interactions. We now rely more on texting, video-calling and social media networks to catch up with friends, making our social life quite robotic. We feel more at ease behind a screen interacting with friends than in real, physical interaction, the human touch, which is extremely essential for a healthy social life.

I urge the readers to think twice while knowingly or unknowingly getting indulged in digital activities. Computers have both positive and negative effects on people. We can get the benefit of them if we use them moderately and with utmost caution.

Sincerely,
[
