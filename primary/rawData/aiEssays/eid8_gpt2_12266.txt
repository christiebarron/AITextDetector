One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was in the 80s. I feel like I should get some laughter on this stage.

You have already won a record number of awards. Did you hear about his album, My Favorite Things to Do with My Father?

Nancy Lee: Yeah but we went to record shows and he invited people over for the first time ever. Like in his childhood in Texas, in a smallason, he wanted to create a music video that is really inspiring. People know about his music and he was working on that music video himself. His music is so much better. I've been on his music videos for a little while now, so they really touched my heart, because it's this real love of music that has a different kind of flavor in music than how we normally see it. We don't hear it that often.

Was there a moment in your career where you just did everything that you could without any input from any source whatsoever?

Nancy Lee: Before this stage we would do a song that was so fucking awesome that people thought I should put it down. No joke. The real reason is to do an artist's album to the same audiences as their original record. This is what he brought to it, an old video that we worked on that had the same kind of vibe as the first but it was a little bit longer because now it's just like an extended version of that video.
