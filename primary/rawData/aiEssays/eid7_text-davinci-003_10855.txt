 

I remember the time my niece was visiting us for Christmas and was having some trouble adjusting. She was having a tough time getting used to our family and felt overwhelmed by all our relatives. 

I could tell she was getting upset, so I decided to take her outside to get some fresh air. We went out to the garden and sat on the swing bench, talking for hours. She told me about how she missed her friends back in her hometown and how strange it was to be around so many different people. I just listened, even though I was starting to get a bit chilly from the winter weather.

Eventually, she calmed down and we went back inside. I could tell that she appreciated me being patient with her and helping her adjust to our family. She thanked me for listening and understanding. I felt like I had done something good for her, and it made me happy to know that just being patient could make such a big difference.
