I remember the time when I was 26 and going through a tough period in my life. I'd been in a long relationship that had ended a few months prior, and I was struggling to work through the pain. One day my best friend suggested that we go for a long bike ride to clear our heads.

The path to our destination was very trying. We biked for more than two hours over rough terrain, eventually arriving at a beautiful park to relax. I was exhausted, physically and emotionally, yet my friend encouraged me to stay and appreciate our surroundings. Despite the fact that all I wanted to do was go home, I realized that it was important to be patient and recognize that this experience would be worth it in the end.

We spent the afternoon talking, walking around, and even taking a few pictures. By the end of the day, I was not only feeling lighter but grateful to my friend for being patient with me and helping me to take the time to appreciate where I was. That moment has stayed with me ever since, and serves as a reminder to stay patient - no matter the circumstances.
