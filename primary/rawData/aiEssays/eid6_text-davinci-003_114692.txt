The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of obstacles when it came to allowing dirigibles to dock. Even though the Empire State Building famously featured a mooring mast, built specifically to accommodate airships, the engineers behind the project weren't able to realize their vision. Most significantly challenging their ambition was the fact that dirigibles had never before been used in cities and they were therefore unfamiliar with the engineering requirements for a mooring mast, and the engineering requirements to make a building safe for a dirigible to dock.

When the decision was made to build the mooring mast, engineers had to come up with a suitable plan for the mast and a way to ensure that it was sturdy enough to support the weight of dirigibles. The mast needed to be constructed in a way that it could withstand the increased air pressure when dirigibles docked and that it could be easily accessed from street level. The engineers also had to create a suitable landing platform to accommodate the size and shape of airships.

Unforeseen difficulties arose once the mooring mast and platform were built, as engineers quickly realized that the winds created by passing dirigibles posed a threat to the saftey of people and the building. In order to address this issue, engineers designed a system of tethers that would secure the dirigibles to the mast and platform. This system was built well enough that it could handle the tremor-like movements of dirig
