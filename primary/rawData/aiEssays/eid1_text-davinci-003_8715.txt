I was on the lookout for a romantic comedy to watch with my girlfriend the other night, and we decided to watch a classic. We had seen it a few times before, but we decided to give it one more go. We were lying in bed, sharing some popcorn while we watched, and I could not stop myself from laughing. It felt like every joke was funnier this time round, even though we had both heard them before.

My girlfriend started joining me in my laughter, and soon we were both howling with laughter. We were grabbing each other as we laughed, and nearly rolling out of bed with hysterical laughter. It felt like we were children again, and it was so freeing and joyful. The movie felt different to us this time, and we knew that the laughter we were sharing had something to do with it.

Laughter is an amazing bridge between people, and in that moment I felt truly connected to my girlfriend. I felt a deep connection to her in those moments of unbridled laughter, and I knew then that it was a connection I would never forget.
