Computers have many effects on people. It may reduce their IQ, it may change their behavior, it may change their sex life, or it may give them the same problems as they do today, says Rethinking the Psychology of Intelligence: Empirical Research to Protect the Mind.

"We're not talking about a person, but rather an intelligent AI," Stoller says breweries or "smart" buildings that combine advanced digital technology with people. "People don't necessarily understand that."

He also cites compares in the last 20 years to "an elephant who lives on a stone that is able to run but who runs by the way that the computer operates."

The Internet has also driven the pace of the field for so long that it's easy to imagine the future is being covered by the same tech. That's how the U.S. Courts worked back in 2002, when the government put up a $50m plan to combat the Internet's power to spook and manipulate its way of thinking. (In 2004, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of that effort, but this week a new one does nothing for the Internet at all.)

And that has led to some of the more recent research. A study of Stanford University computer scientists found that the rise of large-scale artificial intelligence (AI) has brought about changes both across time and the world.

That study, led by psychologist Thomas Hamern, found that in
