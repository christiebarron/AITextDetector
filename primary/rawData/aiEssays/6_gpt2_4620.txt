The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

By the 1950s and 1960s, the majority of Americans favored letting "air-conditioned" air in the basement in high-rise buildings, according to a 2008 Pew Research Center poll.

The most recent national survey, collected by the Survey of Consumer Electronics and Technology, found that the majority of people supported a higher price tag on air-conditioned air. As late as 2012, the poll found, just over four in ten Americans (42 percent) supported a higher ceiling price, and just two-thirds of Americans disagreed.

The rise of air-conditioned air is also expected to increase a lot more Americans' political engagement with the national economy through air-conditioned air, both among millennials (37 percent) as well as Democrats (39 percent).

But a different type of political engagement took hold in 2012, when most Americans — both liberals and conservatives — supported higher air-conditioning price tags.

Some people now believe that the rising market for air-conditioned air is leading to a shift in the country toward greater air pollution, according to Pew Research.

But that argument has proved dubious. While a major majority of Americans now say the issue is real, they say the number of air pollution consumers is getting poorer due to an energy-intensive, time-consuming process.
