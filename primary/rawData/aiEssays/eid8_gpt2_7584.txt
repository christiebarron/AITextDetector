One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was younger. My mother went to the school's principal and explained some of the lessons she had been taught. Then my father came after me with a knife and demanded things to be written on the wall while I said "Well then, we'll let you have one or the other." He said "I want you to write on the board saying yes to this," and I didn't stop. It was the toughest year I've had at the school. I didn't have much to do, so I just kind of took the advice of my parents and got on and worked my butt off.

One of my teachers, another one of my classmates, is in the same situation. I remember that one day, my mother and I got into an argument in the playground and saw the one and one-half dozen kids who had already been there all day and we both fell over and ran to the other side of the room. She pulled a knife out with both handles, then pulled the other one down and told me to get up; she was saying "Well, wait for her" even though I couldn't remember what she had been saying. I just had to try every word of it.

"What a jerk of a teacher, it's kind of funny how people say some of these things as if they were just normal and normal. I was talking with my father while sitting next to him when I heard about that."
