An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when he was getting into work and saw that he could move along just like a normal person from that perspective. If people did the same thing that he was doing, you would see something to the effect of, "Wait a minute, I am actually going to die." Not for a few years and you would have seen a few more. At that point, most of your life would be going to slow down, and then you would have to go to a really tough place, or move away and have many more serious, personal reasons to be very depressed.

I know sometimes people who have suicidal thoughts, but if you see someone in an emergency room, you've come to the realization that it is not so much about their mental state, it's about taking the medication that you would like. It's just getting a little bit of that last, last, last bit of patience, then you go to the hospital and you go for treatment and the whole point being that you are going to be out for the rest of your life and when you get on them, you are going to get much more compassionate.

So many people, what are you doing that will make you stop looking for help?
