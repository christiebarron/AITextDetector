An example of a time someone in my life was patient was last January, when I was getting on a flight from New York to the UK. I was sitting in the second row, talking to a woman. The woman said she was in Germany and asked what her visa was. I said I had some in Germany and she said you're going to France next month so she'd be taking you back. If nobody else said anything about it then I ended up going.

Her reaction was, of course, very different. She said I'm not a tourist – I'm not allowed to go with anybody, so I said no, and now we're both getting on a plane! There was no other response. I was taken off. I was just going to go to Hamburg and then I was invited back. It was a little bit crazy then – a couple of weeks ago I was in Hamburg just to go to my brother's house – all these people in front – at the end of the hall, and they asked the man why I was there. He asked me if I was going to go. My brother's house was right on that street. And he's in Germany. And I told him all about that – I didn't have to get in that car and I didn't have to get on that plane because I had just been on a plane there. Well I only had to go and leave my brother for a few hours.

What I thought was an amazing story
