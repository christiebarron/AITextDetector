An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I would wake up late at night to walk my dog, and this was one of the reasons he was so friendly - because he always liked me. When this happened to him, the next day, it was like it was his fault.

I've known his partner a lot since we were children, and it's been one of the most wonderful things he's ever had. I have my thoughts about him to share with you.

Thanks in advance

Mike
