The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is now palpable: "Our lives are full of suffering at times. My boyfriend came to tell me that his girlfriend was sick and wanted him to go back to Russia to get them all back." His mother was also worried about his sons.

Karen said she received threats earlier in her life that if she saw herself as the voice of the 'enemy', that she felt a duty to be the one who saved him.

The book, which is being published by Aron Press Ltd (RPR), is due to launch in November.

The Russian president also gave his permission for Aron to publish the memoir in English after its launch following a series of tweets from Aron, with the caption "No, he doesn-to-ignore" at the top of the page.

He later changed the date of publication of the book to September 10 to coincide with the Russian state-owned Kommersant publication of the same name.

The Russian government has already banned publication of the book in Russia, but not before the government had confirmed to the Guardian that Aron's author, Nikolai Chekov, had left the country.
