I remember the first time I saw her. She had this contagious laugh that filled the room. I knew right away that she was special.

We were at a party and hadn't yet been introduced, but every time I heard her laugh I couldn't help but laugh too. A silly joke, a funny story, the way she creatively blushed each time her laugh echoed through the crowd. It seemed like she always had a special way of making people smile.

After the party we ran into each other again. Somehow we were brought together by fate — it felt like I had known her forever.

We started talking and I quickly discovered she had such a wonderful, child-like sense of humor. Hours seemed to pass and it felt like I had known her forever — we just clicked.

When I look back at that day, I remember the bond that we formed and how it was all due to the power of laughter. We were able to connect with each other in a way I never thought possible; it was like a secret language we shared.

It's funny how a few laughs can bring two people so close together. I'm thankful for that day and the ones that followed, and even though we try to control our laughter, I know we'll never be able to contain it completely.
