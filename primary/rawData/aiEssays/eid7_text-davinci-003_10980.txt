I remember a time when I was tasked with organizing a big, outdoor event for my company. It was a daunting undertaking and I was worried I wouldn't have enough time to coordinate everything.

My colleagues were getting stressed out too, and none of us knew where to start. In the middle of all the confusion, I decided to stay calm and be patient. I asked my boss to set up smaller, achievable goals that we could work towards one at a time.

Little by little, we got everything in order. Everyone was grateful and surprised I was able to keep my cool in such a chaotic situation. In the end, the event was a huge success and I was proud of everyone for keeping their spirits up!
