I recently had a Saturday which was very typical of weeks before - running errands, catching up with friends and getting a few chores done around the house. I decided to do something different and visit my elderly aunt who lived a few towns over. As I drove up to her house, I saw her outside in her garden, tending to her plants. Her back was slightly hunched and she slowly shuffled around the garden, watering each plant with deep concentration. 

I stepped out of the car to say hello and I noticed she was in quite a bit of discomfort. She told me her arthritis had been particularly acting up today and she was having trouble walking about. She pointed me into her home and asked me to make myself some tea as she took a few moments to compose herself. 

I obliged and waited in her living room, sipping my tea and reading a book until I heard her hobble to a chair across from me. She smiled and thanked me for my patience. As we talked, she told me of how she missed her husband, who had passed away several years ago, and of all the memories they had together. 

My aunt then enjoyed a light dinner and we sat in her garden a while longer, finishing off the evening with a few light-hearted stories. By the time, I made my way back home, I felt a great appreciation for my aunt and all those who practice patience and kindness in the face of difficulty.
