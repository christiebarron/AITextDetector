Computers have many effects on people. radios, TVs, microphones, and computers use the same frequencies that computers use when using other computers. The effect is much larger in the absence of electromagnetic interference or by electromagnetic fields. And some people's brain response is so different from computer's that their brain doesn't process the whole information at once. There are a large number of different parts of the brain that produce a lot of information. Some people do everything at once but, in general, they might do a lot of thinking at once. So they have two different brain functions. Those are the brain's processing of information and the brain's processing of what it has to do. The brain is usually on track in a very specific way. There is an electrical field around that. And this field changes over time. So, it's much more focused on the input, more focused on information gathering, which produces more data and/"and so on."

So the question is, does it have the same effect? Maybe the idea comes from the experience of the psychologist. It might be that people need mental shortcuts that allow them to be more efficient in trying to solve problems, whereas they also need some other means to get things done. They may need some other way. So, the brain's ability to create the new tools to solve problems is a very significant part in how it thinks.

Q. Can we also look at "the experience" of the philosopher?

A. But
