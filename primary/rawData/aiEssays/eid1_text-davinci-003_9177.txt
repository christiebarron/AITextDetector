Dear Editor,

It is undeniable that computers have had a profound effect on our society. We have become increasingly dependent on computers for everyday tasks, from completing school work to gathering information from all over the world. Yet, while computers have provided us with unprecedented access to knowledge, they have come at a significant cost â€“ our physical and mental health may be at risk.

Studies have shown that prolonged exposure to computer screens can lead to a range of physical issues, like eyestrain, headaches, dry eyes, and neck and shoulder pain, caused by sitting for long periods of time in a hunched posture. Additionally, people may be more prone to suffer from obesity due to spending more time indoors.

Moreover, excessive screen time can also lead to mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression. This is because internet activities can quickly become addictive, reducing the amount of time spent outside with family and friends, and leading to an inability to focus, difficulty falling asleep, and a decrease in productivity.

It is time for us to recognize the true effects computers have on our lives. Although computers have become an essential part of our daily routine, we must be aware of the negative consequences. We should strive to develop healthy habits related to screen time. There should be limits on our use, and an emphasis put on activities that promote physical and mental health, like going outdoors, spending time with family and friends, and actively engaging with our community.

Sincerely
