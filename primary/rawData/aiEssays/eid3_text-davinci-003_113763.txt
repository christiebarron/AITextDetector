In Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead," the features of the setting play an important role in the cyclist's experience and overall journey. The cyclist begins his journey early in the morning as the sun is just rising. The morning air is "crisp and refreshing," signaling the potential for an exciting adventure. As the cyclist moves through the setting, he notices the brilliant colors of the wildflowers that line the path. This serves to motivate the cyclist and boost his morale. 

The cyclist notices how the setting changes as he rides further along the path. He goes from a flat curve, to a steep hill, and finally to a "rough, twisting trail." This change in terrain forces the cyclist to adjust his speed and remain mindful of the terrain. Every twist, turn, and obstacle that he encounters tests the cyclistâ€™s skill and resilience. 

The cyclist also notices how the sounds of the environment change as he progresses. From the sounds of the beautiful birds in the morning, to the thunder of the storms, the cyclist absorbs the various sounds of nature. These environmental sounds serve to provide the cyclist with insight as to the obstacles he may encounter ahead. 

The features of the setting in Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead" provide the cyclist with a sense of adventure and challenge. Despite the hardship, the cyclist continues his journey, taking in the colors, sounds, and terrain and finding joy in every moment. The
