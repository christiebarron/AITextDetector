Computers have many effects on people. They may make them feel good and be better parents, perhaps even be better scientists or politicians. They may help them make some really important decisions and be productive. They may help them improve their job or be part of a really valuable and very effective social experiment.

"They are more likely to be able to stay with their parents, or get out of poverty or be accepted by groups with better pay," says the study's lead author, Dr Michael Niven, an assistant professor of psychology at Duke University, who led the research.

Many factors may contribute. Some people are less likely to be physically active, but most people are more at risk for heart disease, depression or suicide.

And some children who have been on drugs for more than a decade will have healthier adult lives to look forward to.

Socially, a child might not get as much out of drugs as it might have thought it was going to. But if young people get the drug, they will have healthier adult lives to look forward to, the researchers say.

"The more drugs people get, the better their lives. The more drugs people get, the worse the health is going to be," says Wiggin.

The findings were published online March 28 in the journal BMC Psychiatry.
