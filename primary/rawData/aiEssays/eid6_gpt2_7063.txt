The train was on the way to help with the evacuation. At the time of the crash, many firefighters from neighboring units kept up in the flames under shelter. When the train pulled into a bridge through the woods, it made an abrupt stop while the pilots made their way through the trees. The train eventually rolled across the road before crashing up. All three of the planes that lost their lives were destroyed, and the first of the Boeing B-17s died in the fire. The final aircraft, the German B-2, had to continue on to Europe.

A few years later, a Japanese pilot called Hiroki Nakamura noticed a white object that looked almost like a wing. During a test flight, he tried to explain to the aircraft's pilots that there is a wing in the air that moves through the surrounding woods. They responded by telling him to look for a wing. When he spotted a
