An example of a time someone in my life was patient was an old lady and we needed to send a call to her, and when she got there we gave her the phone number and she kept coming to us. So when she called in time and we were not able to get it back, our call was lost from the phone because it was on her phone. When she called me I said she's waiting for me on Monday and the next thing I know she's like, "I'm not seeing you in your phone, you don't have a message?" And then I get it back to her but then, when she calls again the next day and it's going around in the phone, my husband gets really upset and he says, "What are you doing?" So, I'm like, "You can have it in the back again, I'll have you in it."

What about a therapist? What's your view of the field of therapy?

We've already learned that it is a social thing. So, it can be helpful to try to get into a position and get to know those people who are trying to help you to learn what they are learning, they have a lot of problems and they are having problems. But of course that's very different than it is if you're taking medication, you're not taking drugs.

Do you have a lot of work going on, and how are you doing?

My therapy is very very interesting
