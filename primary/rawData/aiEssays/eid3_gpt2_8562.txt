Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. First of all, the bicycle and the road should always be designed in the first place for the rider and his/her use.

The Bicycle and the Road at the junction of Routes 1 and 10 in the city are known as Routes 1 and 10. These names are sometimes misleading. The fact that a road is marked as either 'Orientary Road' or 'Road of Mobility', as are the two other roads in Lourdes, means that the route is not in the 'Orientary' route. On the other hand, 'Road and Ride' does not mean that the road is on a 'Street of Motion', as in 'Orientary Road'. We are going to look at the Road section where there is a small part of the route labelled 'Road on the Road' and the other half where the road is marked as 'Road and Ride'. From these two two segments, I want to make the following list of routes that are considered Routes 1 and 10:

1. 1.1: Inland Road

This is also a great way to bypass the road and the whole centre of the city, particularly the junction of Princesby Road and Gisborne Street or on to King Edward Street.

A good way to do this is to cut through the town area of Lourdes or the suburbs and use the A-cross
