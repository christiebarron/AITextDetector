I was out with my friends for a game night that my friend was hosting when we all sat down to play a game of charades. We were all playing together and all the clues were hilarious. I was laughing so hard that I was in tears. 

The best part was when my friend gave the clue for his team about a movie with a pet dinosaur. He started pretending to be a dinosaur, and he made some dinosaur noises too. Everyone was cracking up, even those who had no idea what he had said.

After that, my friends and I just looked at each other in shared understanding and began laughing uncontrollably. Of course none of us had ever seen that movie, but the moment of laughter was shared between us all. It felt like those few minutes of laughter brought us all together, and it felt like it cemented our friendship.

I am so glad laughter was the source of this special moment. It was funny at the moment, but even more meaningful in hindsight. I will always remember that shared moment of laughter.
