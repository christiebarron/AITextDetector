I recently had the opportunity to witness an amazing display of patience. I was riding the bus to work and there was an elderly man in front of me. When the stop came for him to get off the driver said "Sir, this is your stop". The man politely replied "just one minute, please". He then rummaged through his bag looking for something. He was looking for a few seconds, and it was clear he couldn't find it. He requested the driver wait a few moments longer, while he looked in the other side of his bag.

The driver was very patient. He waited patiently, even though the bus was full. After a few more seconds, the man proudly announced "I found it. Thank you." The driver smiled and the man got off the bus.

It was a wonderful act of patience, both from the driver and the elderly man. It reminded me that, regardless of how busy I am, it's important to take a moment to be patient.
