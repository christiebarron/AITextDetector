Computers have many effects on people. You can see some common interactions like running into problems, which is especially harmful if those problems aren't handled properly. The easiest example of a problem involving computers is to break something and go crazy. This is easy for a lot of people, but can also be really scary for everyone. One of my favorite ones is the computer's fault. There are two general solutions to this problem. The first one focuses on solving problems with little or no intervention from the team member. It can get your computer running, but it's more likely we'll want something less aggressive. The second solution I find useful is to get out of the way, to avoid the problem, and to help the person in question. This is a bit more difficult than the first one and most of it works just fine. If you think about it, we'd rather just start the whole thing over than try to fix every detail we can.


There also aren't many good things about software. It's a hard business, so if a person's doing something wrong, it could never affect the other person. You need to keep the situation as simple as possible. Most of all, make sure you don't get your computer stuck and cause an issue. Your computer knows what to do, so it'll automatically react to whatever it's in. Don't try to make your entire work as simple asecycle, because then the problems will keep happening.
