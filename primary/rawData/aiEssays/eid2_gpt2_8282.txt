I believe that censorship of materials in libraries and public libraries, including material in electronic form, can reduce the risk of misuse of these materials.

There is also a significant risk that individuals may engage in unauthorized copying of material. However, this type of misuse is not uncommon, and should hardly be considered an indication that someone has undertaken infringing activity.

The Commission considers that it is important that libraries be able to share information about certain types of illegal materials. However, these are considered illegal, such as materials that include images, videos, recordings or audio that are otherwise not protected. An information disclosure form (ISE), which is widely available in libraries, should be available to libraries to discuss their decision about which resources should be accessed. Finally, although the public can access the ISE forms through the National Library Register, they should be able to use them more broadly.

There is also the need for theProminentInsight.org.uk community (for information about the Prominent Insight.org.uk community, see http://prominentinsights.com/ Wassinous, which is a public library in South Wales) to improve its processes for handling information about the Prominent Insight UK Library. It has agreed to develop the Prominent Insight UK (PSL) (http://www.so.gov.uk) which will create one-stop collection sites where you can send your enquires to PLS. You can do so by contacting relevant PLS
