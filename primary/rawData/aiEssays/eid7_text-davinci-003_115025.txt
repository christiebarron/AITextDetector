When I was a child, my father was often busy with work, so it was up to me to help my mother run the house. I had to juggle doing my homework, household chores and helping to watch my younger siblings.

One day, my 2 year old brother had an accident and soiled his diaper while my mother was in the middle of making dinner. She had a lot on her plate and was getting increasingly frustrated. But I stayed patient with her even though I was getting impatient too. I could feel my temper rising, but I knew my mom needed me to be calm so I took a few deep breaths and stopped myself from speaking too harshly.

I went over to my brother, calmly cleaned him up, and changed him into a clean diaper. I also tidied up the mess and reassured my mother that everything was okay. My mother appreciated my effort and patience and was able to get back to making dinner with a sigh of relief. 

In that moment, I truly learned that patience is important and it can help keep things under control - even in difficult situations.
