I remember the first time I met my best friend, Amanda. She was so carefree and full of life and laughter that I was immediately drawn to her. We'd arranged to go for a walk for our first meeting, and from the moment we stepped out into the sunshine, she had me in fits of laughter - with her jokes about people she'd seen, her stories about her cat and her enthusiasm for life. 

As we walked and talked, I began to open up and share things about myself. I hadn't expected this, but it felt so natural to talk to her, and we ended up laughing about things I'd been through that felt like funny stories now I was out the other side. 

By the time we made it back to the cafe, it felt like I'd known Amanda for years, not just an hour. She'd put me completely at ease with her laughter and her warmth. 

Now nine years later, Amanda is still my best friend and I can unashamedly say that I love her to bits. I can't think about her without smiling, and no matter how many times I tell her the same story, somehow she always manages to make me laugh.
