The setting of Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead” greatly affects the cyclist in the story. It is night, and the cyclist is on a dark and winding road. This presents a major hazard to the cyclist, as navigating the dark, curvy road is incredibly difficult and increases the risk of accidents. The cyclist is also surrounded by dense forest. This provides a beautiful scenery but also has disadvantages. The cyclist is isolated from the city and has to rely solely on his own skills and experience when navigating the area.

The cyclist in “Rough Road Ahead” is also travelling in the cold autumn weather. This contributes to the feeling of loneliness and isolation the cyclist experiences. The cold air also makes the cyclist more vulnerable to injury, especially in a situation where the cyclist is pressed for time and must push himself harder. Furthermore, the leaves that carpet the ground from the surrounding trees are wet and slippery, making the cyclist’s journey even more dangerous.

Overall, the setting of Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead” greatly affects the cyclist. The dark, winding road, the dense forest, the cold autumn weather, and the wet leaves all add to the difficulty and danger of the cyclist’s journey, presenting major hazards to the cyclist as he navigates the area.
