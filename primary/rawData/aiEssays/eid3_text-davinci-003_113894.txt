In the story "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski, the cyclist is subjected to the varied and often treacherous conditions of the natural setting. This physical environment thus impacts every aspect of the cyclist's experience, from comfort to safety.

The cyclist must first deal with the terrain, which is full of dips and curves, hill climbs and descents â€” all of which can be both challenging and dangerous. With this topography, the cyclist must ride carefully at all times as they navigate their way through the landscape, judging the best line or route, and possible obstacles that may impede progress.

In addition, the cyclist must contend with weather conditions such as wind, rain and heat. Wind can push an inexperienced cyclist off course, and rain and heat can cause a variety of issues, from fatigue to dehydration. As if this weren't enough, the cyclist also has to confront wild animals and other hazardous features of the environment, such as high cliffs and narrow passes.

The cyclist also has to manage the risk of human predators, particularly when crossing through towns and cities. With all of these elements combined, the cyclist must be ever vigilant and capable of encountering and handling a variety of challenges while in the wild. The features of the setting thus intimately shape the cyclist's experience of journeying through it, making it possible for successful journey but also creating many opportunities for difficulties.
