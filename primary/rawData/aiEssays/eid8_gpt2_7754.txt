One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was 6 feet tall and I got to sit on my left side during an airplane ride down to Florida and suddenly I felt like my head was exploding."

One day, while sitting in an airplane in Sarasota for a training exercise, he saw something and realized there were two people sitting on top of him. Then he said something like "Let me show you the real joke: If I can't sit on the top of anybody's head, I'm going to jump up and down to the top." In the story about the accident, a person could not stand up for themselves either.

I know I'm the lucky guy who has no brain and that the brain is always watching what the brain is saying. And I guess the thing which is so funny is the fact that we live in a world in which one side always tries and tries and tries to escape and tries and tries. The thing is, no matter how little you try and try and try to get to where you are, that always comes back when you get down. And no matter how hard you try to make sure no one can jump up and down on your head, you'll never be able to. You can never get there. And I guess I feel like there's that other side of us where everybody tries to come all up and up and up as fast as they can.

I actually started watching the pilot on the Advisor program on Channel Ten
