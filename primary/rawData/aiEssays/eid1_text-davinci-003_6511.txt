To the Editor:

This is an open letter to all citizens regarding the effects computers have on people. 

Since the introduction of the computer, some people have argued that its influence on modern society has been largely positive. On the surface, it's easy to see why they may think so. Computers have revolutionized the way we access information, communicate with each other, and even do business.

However, the ubiquity of computers in our lives has had major implications on our mental and psychological well-being. Computers make it easier than ever before to be constantly online, immersed in a virtual world at the expense of the real one. This has led to an epidemic of loneliness and isolation among people, which can have serious effects on their mental health. 

Not to mention, computers also put a huge strain on our physical health. Prolonged windows-sitting is a major contributor to back pain, shoulder and neck pain, even carpal tunnel syndrome. In an effort to focus on the positives of computers, we often overlook the adverse effects they have on our bodies and minds.

For this reason, I urge all readers to recognize the impact technology can have on our lives and develop healthy practices for using computers. This could include limiting our time online, taking regular breaks, and keeping balance in our digital and physical activities. 

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
