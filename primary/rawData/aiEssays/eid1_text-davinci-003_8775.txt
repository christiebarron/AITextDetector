I remember the first time my husband and I spent the night at my parents' house. We weren't married then; it was our first official trip to meet them. We'd exchanged stories and shared quite a few laughs throughout the day, and I was looking forward to the next day.

That night, my husband and I tucked into bed in our room and tried to fall asleep. But we couldn't stop giggling, for some reason. We were trying so hard not to make too much noise when suddenly we burst into laughter. We had no idea what had set us off, but soon I was rolling in my bed, clutching my sides as we both tried to contain our giggles.

We must've been louder than we thought, because we eventually heard my father's voice outside our door. He started talking to us, and his gentlemanly, sarcastic comments soon made us fall into a fit of giggles once again. We laughed until tears were forming at the corners of our eyes, but my father only continued to talk to us and eventually, we were able to drag ourselves out of bed.

The sound of laughter that night was beautiful â€“ it was the smile of two people who were just beginning a beautiful path together. That night we rooted our relationship in laughter, and I'm so grateful for it.
