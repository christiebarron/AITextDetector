In Joe Kurmaski's poem, "Rough Road Ahead," the setting plays an important role in how the cyclist is affected. The poet describes the road as being full of sharp turns, uneven terrain, mud, and rocks. The cyclist is forced to navigate these treacherous conditions with skill and determination.

The sharp turns are a major challenge for the cyclist. This forces them to make split-second decisions and take timely action to prevent a crash. Going into a turn too forcefully can cause the cyclist to lose control and crash.

The uneven terrain creates its own set of problems. Potholes, bumps, and sharp rocks can all be difficult to spot in the night, and can easily knock the cyclist off balance. The mud can also provide reduced traction, making it harder to control the bike.

The darkness of night adds to the difficulty of the situation. Without the help of sunlight, the cyclist is forced to rely on their own vision to spot these obstacles and negotiate them safely.

Overall, the features of the setting in "Rough Road Ahead" place tremendous physical and mental strain on the cyclist. It demands every bit of their focus and skill just to stay upright. But the cyclist prevails, showing courage and strength despite the obstacles. The setting of the poem adds another layer of complexity to the journey, making the cyclist's triumph all the more impressive.
