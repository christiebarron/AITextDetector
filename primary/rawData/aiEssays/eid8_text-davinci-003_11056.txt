I remember the first time I met my best friend. We were both around 8 or 9 at the time, attending the same summer camp and sitting next to each other in the dining hall. We were instantly intrigued by each other and began a conversation. 

At first we talked about basic stuff - what sports we played or what movies we liked - but quickly our conversations turned to goofy jokes and laughter. We would just crack up at the things the other said! 

Some of the time might have been spent in awkward silence, but thinking back on it, I remember mostly laughing and having a good time.  That summer felt so special, and I realized that even though I was alone and didn't know anyone, I still had someone to laugh with.

To this day, that same friend is still around - and our shared laughter still brings us closer together. Every time I feel down or overwhelmed, I know I can call her up and we'll be laughing in no time. I like to think it's one of the reasons our friendship has stood the test of time.
