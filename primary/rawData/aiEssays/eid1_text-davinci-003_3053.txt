Dear Editor: 

As technology continues to rapidly expand, it is clear that computers have become a necessary and integral part of our lives. They help us communicate, conduct business, access information, and keep us entertained. But with these many advantages, can come some significant consequences. 

First of all, excessive use of computer technology can cause physical health problems like back pain, carpal tunnel, headaches, and vision problems. Also, prolonged exposure to blue light can disturb our sleep cycles, causing insomnia, sleep deprivation, and even depression. Connecting to the internet can also bring many unwanted viruses, malware, and hackers that can invade our privacy and even steal our personal information. 

But there are greater implications beyond physical health. A reliance on computer technology can lead to a lack of original thought and an over-reliance on the idea that someone else will provide us all the answers. This can lead us to be out of touch with reality, as well as having an inability to think for ourselves or think critically about solutions.

Overall, computers can be a great tool when used responsibly and in moderation, but if used too much or misused, they can cause serious physical and mental health problems. So
