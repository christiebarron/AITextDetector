Every library in the country should be filled with knowledgeable and thoughtful resources, carefully selected by informed professionals to meet the needs and expectations of its visitors. Libraries should continue to honor the freedom of every individual in their right to read, listen, and view materials according to their own individual preferences.

Library censorship, however, can create an environment that undermines this right to freedom of thought. It is understandable that certain materials, such as hate speech or materials that portray explicit violence that may be considered inappropriate or offensive, should not be available. But censorship should not be a random one-size-fits-all policy applied to all books, music, movies, and magazines.

When materials are arbitrarily censored, the general public may be denied access to important and meaningful resources. Libraries are a place of exploration and discovery, and censoring materials only limits our ability to make connections with the thoughts and ideas of others. It is essential that libraries strive for inclusivity and diversity in the materials they provide, and censorship goes counter to these efforts. 

In an increasingly polarized country, it is all the more important for libraries to remain open and free areas of intellectual exploration, no matter the controversial subject matter. Many of the most meaningful books, movies, and other materials contain uncomfortable truths, but we cannot allow ourselves to become comfortable with censorship. 

Individuals should be held accountable for the materials they consume, and libraries should focus on providing knowledge and helpful resources without direct censorship
