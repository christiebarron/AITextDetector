Computers have many effects on people. They control the economy, or else they would just give people more money. It's less fun for a government that's supposed to be trying to solve all of our problems.

You said you don't have a "big" budget.

The problem, I think, is that when you look at the number of government jobs, you see there's so many government jobs that are "real jobs"â€”the things that allow us to have more people work with less government. It's a system that doesn't work for everyone, and even then it does lead to some of those jobs ending up in some kind of problem. One of the things that happened as a result of Reagan's policy of "keep your hands off the government" is that when Social Security actually ran out of money, people would go back to paying taxes, and a lot of people would start a bank account, and even after they got paid back that money would be used for Social Security payments. And after a while it would stop working, and people would start a bank account, and it would stop working, and it would do nothing for their families, but eventually that Crypto-currency would be out.
