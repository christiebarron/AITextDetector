One of the greatest achievements in history, the Empire State Building has served as a marvel of human ingenuity since its completion in 1931. Among the many aspects of the building that make it so impressive is its ability to allow dirigibles (airships or zeppelins) to dock at the top floor of the building. Despite the many benefits it provided to the city, the engineers who constructed the building and organized the mooring mast faced many obstacles in the planning and development of the docking structure.

First and foremost was the task of locating a safe space on the building for the dirigibles to dock. To pull this off, engineers had to be meticulous in their measurements, selecting a space on the roof with enough clearance to safely accept the structure, yet close enough to the rest of the building to provide enough stability. This meant that wind shears had to be taken into account to ensure against any turbulence that could dislodge or knock the airships off course. Additionally, to prevent the dirigibles from causing any damage to the rest of the building, engineers knew they had to incorporate a tall enough mooring mast.

The engineers also had to plan for the eventuality of mooring mishaps, so they created a system of weighted anchors and harpoons that served as a failsafe. This system allowed the engineers to launch anchors with weighted balls attached to them that could extend to the ground of the building, should the dirigible fail to land properly
