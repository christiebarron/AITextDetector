One time I experienced laughter in my life was when she was pregnant with my sister and he was trying to play with our daughter's dress, and I told him I did it because I loved him, so I don't think she knew it at the time. That feeling has lasted for a while after that, although we are pretty much okay now without her."

"No, seriously... you don't see it at all?" Mika asked.

"N-no I, sorry! I actually don't see how that matters, since they're really close to it now!"

"I still don't know the reason. The things we do, that kind of thing. Besides that... I want to get this over with right now. I've told everyone else in the house that my parents have moved into a second apartment on Earth so I won't have to explain this thing in such a lengthy detail. Just wait until I get home, my brother-in-law and a friend and I will be able to talk this out loud. For how long? I just know I'll remember it after that. And I need to be the one who can fix this, you know. Do you want to?"

She answered with an embarrassed look on her face.

In the meantime, her friend called out to her.

"Please, please listen. It's time to get moving..." Mika said as she got up from her bed.
