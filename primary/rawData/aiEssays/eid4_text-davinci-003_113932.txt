Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho ends with that thought because the author is putting that thought out to the reader to create an expectation that the protagonist will pass the test the next time she takes it. The author is leaving the reader with a hopeful message and also creating a connection to nature, which is often seen in Asian literature. The connection to nature symbolizes the protagonist's resilience, in that just like the hibiscus will return in the spring no matter how cold the winter gets, so too will the protagonist rise to the challenge again.
