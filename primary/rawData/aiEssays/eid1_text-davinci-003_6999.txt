With more and more people taking advantage of library resources, a libraryâ€™s responsibility to its patrons is becoming increasingly important. Libraries should think carefully about what materials they choose to provide for their patrons.

Although there are certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines that could be considered offensive to some people, this does not necessarily mean that these materials should be removed from the shelves of libraries and kept away from library patrons. Every person is entitled to their own opinion, and while materials deemed offensive by some may not be suitable for everyone, this opinion should not be foisted upon others. If a library decides to take away certain materials, it should also provide access to alternative materials that are not offensive to readers who are interested in the topics these materials  cover.

Moreover, censoring library materials raises many questions about which materials should be restricted and who should be responsible for making this decision. The American Library Association has outlined guidelines for censorship, suggesting that decisions should only be made through an open decision-making procedure that involves a variety of stakeholders, such as librarians, parents, and community members.
