The Empire State Building was designed with the groundbreaking intention of allowing dirigibles, or airships, to dock. Building the mooring mast and allowing dirigibles to dock was a daunting task filled with many technical and engineering obstacles.

The biggest obstacle was designing a mast and its platform with the strength necessary to support docking. The mooring mast was designed with an embedded steel cable reaching a height of 700 feet and three inches wide. This cable had to withstand the strong winds and the stress of hauling heavy cable to the top of the building and then dragging the airship from the cable to the roof of the Empire State Building.

The second obstacle was making sure that the propellers of the airship had enough room to maneuver while docking. This was especially important since dirigibles were only 67 feet tall, and the mooring mast was 410 feet tall. The Empire State Building needed to have a tall and structurally sound platform that could accommodate the dirigible while it was docking.

The third obstacle was the wind. The mooring mast was designed with the intention of it being particularly wind resistant. However, due to the high winds around the Empire State Building sometimes the airship had to wait to dock until the wind died down.

Finally, the fourth obstacle was the securing of the docking platform. Engineers had to devise a way to secure the platform and tether it down to the roof of the building, so that it could
