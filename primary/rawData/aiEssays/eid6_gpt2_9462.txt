The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The First Empire State Building, named after Henry VIII's grandfather Sir Henry VIII, had a single bed per bedroom and was built in 1577, according to George Mancini and Henry David Thoreau. The building was also designed to contain about half a million people in a single room. But as the building's architects tried to design a complex that was even more comfortable to the public, they were unable to accomplish that, partly due to the poor accessibility of the floor, a problem with the curved walls and uneven build surface, according to John C. Davis, a Harvard professor of architecture, who helped design the Empire building. As such, the first Empire State Building, named after Henry VIII's grandfather Sir Henry VIII, was erected in 1583. The second building, named after the first president of British Empire, William Tecumseh Sherman, was constructed in 1659. Despite these, the fifth and sixth Empire State buildings were erected in the early 1880s, and the oldest building, named after Frederick I, was built in 1839. Although these buildings do not technically exist, they share a unique design and aesthetic.
