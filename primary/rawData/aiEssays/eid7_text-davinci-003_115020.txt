I was recently running errands at the mall when I noticed a young mother struggling with her child. Her daughter, who was no more than two or three, was throwing a fit, screaming and crying in the middle of the aisle. I could see frustration on the woman's face. She was trying her best to stay calm and eventually managed to get the child calmed down. 

I offered to help the woman, but she refused and simply said, "No, thank you. I'm ok." Despite her refusal, I could tell the woman was appreciative of my gesture and could see the determination and patience in her eyes. She watched her daughter carefully and patiently talked to her until the little girl stopped crying and was finally calm. 

The woman thanked me sincerely and went on her way. I admired her for being so patient and compassionate with her child instead of yelling or losing her temper. It was a true demonstration of a mother's love and patience.
