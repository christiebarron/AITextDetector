The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is extremely bleak of men (I have no problem telling you that because I don't know why) getting a kick out of going into battle, and of leaving home.

My heart breaks as I read it, and the thought of what a lot of people are saying and reading it in detail makes me feel helpless. Yet these comments, and the very simple reason they happen and don't seem to happen more often these days than in the past, are not the reason I feel a need to be out there on the battlefield and fighting.

This book is a book that wants to change the world.
