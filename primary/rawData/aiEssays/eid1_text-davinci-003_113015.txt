To the Editor,

The invention of computers has revolutionized our world in countless ways, but its effects on the human race are worth considering.

As our lives become increasingly dependent on the various tools provided by computers, we are all exposed to an ever-growing range of potential health risks. First, there is the obvious issue of eye strain and neck pain that results from maintaining a sustained posture in front of a computer for extended periods of time, often in ill-fitting workstations. Second, we must contend with the psychological toll that staring at a computer monitor for long hours can take: anxiety, distraction, and depression are all potential symptoms of excessive computer use.

Our reliance on computers has had profound social implications as well. People who work at computers spend much less time interacting with those in their immediate environment, leading to a decrease in face-to-face communication. This trend carries over into social relationships as well: with more and more discourse being conducted online, there are fewer opportunities for meaningful and genuine interaction.

Overall, the effects of computers on people should not be taken lightly. As such, it is essential that we are all aware of the potential risks and do our part to mitigate them. Consider taking regular breaks when using a computer, and create a workstation that is ergonomically sound. To preserve social connections, it is important that we make a conscious effort to reach out to those around us.

Sincerely,
