To The Editor,

Over the past few decades, technology has developed at a rapid pace. The introduction of computers into the mainstream has revolutionized how we work, play, and interact with one another. Computers have led to incredible advances and efficiencies in virtually all industries, but they have also had some negative impacts.

As computers have become more ubiquitous, they have changed the way people communicate. People now tend to communicate more through text-based media, such as email and social media, rather than face-to-face conversations. This means that many people are losing the ability to have real conversations and read body language.

In addition, computers are putting a serious strain on attention spans. People can now easily become distracted by the wealth of information available on the internet. This can lead to people being unable to focus on tasks for extended periods of time.

Finally, computers can lead to a feeling of isolation. While people are connecting to others more than ever, these connections are often shallow, lacking the depth and emotion that comes from face-to-face interactions.

Overall, while computers have had some wonderful benefits, their impact on people should not be overlooked. With the increasing reliance on technology and the rise of automated jobs, it is important for people to be reflective about how they use computers and make sure that they don't lose the valuable skills of conversation and focus. 

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
