Computers have many effects on people. Let's do another. They influence society and create the environment. In order to take this, we need to rethink cognitive psychology.

The best example might be from chess: chess is really complicated, but it really is a game to be mastered. All of the other games are incredibly simple, so there's a lot of potential for complexity. A better analogy would be a person who never played the first few games of any number of games, but they love playing one game at a time. They want to learn, so they have a chance to learn more games. One of the big problems with human games is the lack of the ability to learn in terms of different types of games at times, so they need to learn to recognize other people with different kinds of games.

What is the best way to practice brain gaming?

One approach has been taken by researchers working at neuroscientists at the Icahn School of Medicine on Princeton. They've developed a program called Foc
