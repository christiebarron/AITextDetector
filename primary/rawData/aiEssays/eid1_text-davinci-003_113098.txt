Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. In today’s digital age, almost everyone owns a computer or has access to one. With the speed and convenience of the internet, computers have changed the way people interact and live their lives.

On one hand, computers can be incredibly beneficial, allowing people to find information and stay connected easier than ever before. Additionally, computers have opened up many new job opportunities, as well as made many current jobs easier and more efficient. For example, many professionals can now work from home or remotely, whereas before they may have had to travel.

On the other hand, computers can have negative effects on people as well. Research has shown that too much screen time can increase stress, decrease engagement in activities, and lead to sleep deprivation. Furthermore, the digitalized life has reduced people’s ability to communicate face-to-face, which is necessary for developing meaningful relationships.

While technology is an inevitable part of everyday life, it is important to recognize its psychological and physiological impacts. We should remember to limit our screen time to prevent the negative effects of computers.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
