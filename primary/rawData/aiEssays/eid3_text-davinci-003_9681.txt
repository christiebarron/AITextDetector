The setting of Joe Kurmaski’s ‘Rough Road Ahead’ has a great impact on the cyclist's journey. The roads are winding and bumpy, with some stretches completely unlit. This characteristic makes the rider very aware of the winding road and the terrain while focusing on controlling the bike. The cyclist also deals with passing vehicles, pedestrians, dogs, and other obstacles she encounters on the road, adding to the difficulty of the journey.

The setting provides an intense challenge for the cyclist as she must be mindful of the environment to stay safe on the dark path ahead. She also has to respond quickly to changes in terrain and the presence of obstructions to alter her trajectory to continue onward. There is an additional element of suspense added due to the darkness of the night, as the cyclist must use her heightened senses to stay alert and on the lookout for potential hazards. The sudden patches of light provide an additional source of trepidation as each lane appears suddenly out of the night sky.

Throughout the poem, the setting helps to convey the atmosphere and tone of the cyclist's journey. It is difficult and dangerous, but through her courage and perseverance, she is able to push forward. The rough road ahead is a metaphor for both the physical and emotional obstacles that she must overcome in order to reach her destination. The setting of this poem reflects the determination of the cyclist, and the strength of her will to continue even in the face of outward difficulties
