I believe that censorship of materials in libraries, universities, and other facilities is the only way we can address the crisis of online hate speech and promote better, safer online spaces. The government of Pakistan hopes that such censorship will deter radical and violent activities such as those seen in Pakistan. This government is already involved in investigating some of the high number of incidents of online harassment. We need to take the necessary measures in order to prevent such cyber attacks against government and citizens in the future.

We urgeeasy, effective measures to reduce incidents on government and public domain and promote open online environments that respect First Amendment rights.

Citing Pakistan as a country with a high literacy rate, our people live in a multicultural society and we want strong institutions which can develop and foster a strong community. We also hope that other communities, including our neighbors in the world, can join us in promoting peace and mutual understanding between Pakistan and the rest of the world.

We believe it is critical to foster a strong online community that will foster and hold individuals accountable on both sides of the debate. Through efforts and cooperative action, we hope to change the situation towards the betterment of our people by sharing ideas and engaging in action to combat cyber crime across Pakistan.
