The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because, firstly, it turns out the main characters didn't even need to be there, as is the norm: and also, second, the story is very loosely based on the works of Richard Wright, and that's because we know this.

And, of course, it's because the book has made Wright the bestselling fantasy novelist of recent times. His stories have won over and inspired the writers and publishers to create their works. They've drawn upon his vast literary output to create novels that are worth reading.

We've gotten a lot of requests from people who think their stories aren't quite right. That comes from people who don't know what to think about this (even though they should know that this is the book, despite who I am), and it may come from people who think there's a lot of room for nuance, but then, for all I know, we all love the same things we love.

On what's next for this series?

First season of Winter Hibiscus.
