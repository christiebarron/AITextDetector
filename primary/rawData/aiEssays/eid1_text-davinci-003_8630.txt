It was one of those nights where it felt like the world was conspiring against us. We had been together for years, and it was usually so easy to just laugh things off and move on--but tonight was different. We had gotten into an argument over some small detail, neither of us can even remember now, and suddenly it was as if all our frustrations were suddenly bubbling up to the surface.

The atmosphere was tense, so I decided to take a chance and try to break the tension. So, I sighed, and I let out a loud 'harrumph!' and then I just started to laugh. It was a bit awkward first, but all at once my partner started to giggle too, and before long we were both just laughing and laughing, and it felt like all our troubles were just being whisked away.

From that moment onwards, we both started to look at things differently--laughing away all our small disagreements, and instead of finding more problems, we found ourselves enjoying each other's company again.

Laughter is powerful like that. It can create a bridge between two people, no matter how much distance there can be between them. And that night, it really was the shortest distance between us.
