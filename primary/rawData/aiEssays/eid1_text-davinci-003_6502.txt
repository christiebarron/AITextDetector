Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my opinion on the effects computers have on people and the impact they have had on society.

In today's world, computers are used for almost every task. From education to communication to entertainment—computers have revolutionized the way we live our lives and interact with one another. They have enabled us to access online resources that were once only available to those with extensive technical know-how.

When it comes to engaging with others, computers can be both beneficial and detrimental. Though they have opened up a world of communication platforms, their fast-paced nature can lead to the immediate and often harsh judgment of others. This can result in a lack of meaningful relationships and social skills. Additionally, spending excessive time using computers can negatively impact one’s physical and mental health.

On the other hand, computers can be extremely helpful in terms of education and job opportunities. With the help of computers, people can find jobs they are passionate about, and they can gain greater access to valuable education materials.

In my opinion, computers should be used with caution and considered an aid to our everyday lives, not a crutch. They can help us access information at our fingertips, but they also bring the risk of fostering unhelpful online habits like trolling or gaming addiction. To reap the benefits they offer, mindfulness and balance is key.

I hope this letter has been informative and convincing, and I invite the readers
