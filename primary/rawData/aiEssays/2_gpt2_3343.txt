I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is needed to increase libraries' revenue. I believe that people should be able to easily find information in libraries. I personally believe that library owners should be able to put up prices on all kinds of products using their product. I personally believe that a good standard of living for everyone should be based on fair price. All of these issues are important. However, most people are just plain lazy.

I can't say that libraries are the most important market segment.

Here are the main issues with my position:

I don't find your message encouraging.

Most people do not care about libraries.

I don't care about libraries, and I don't want your words to lead me astray.

I'm a smart person who used to be called a smart person, so if this is your point, you're right! If you are talking from my perspective, you won't be understanding, because if you are smart, you will be smart enough to understand what the problems are. I agree that it's extremely irresponsible for you to say stuff like you already know what's actually going on in the online world.

I believe that a good standard of living should be based on fair price.

Most people need to get the books they want, so there is no point in getting them.

This is an argument where you are using words that are just bad
