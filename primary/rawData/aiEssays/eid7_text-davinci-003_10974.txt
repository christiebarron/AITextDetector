Today turned out to be much longer than I anticipated. I was running late in the morning so I was already feeling rushed and behind. As I drove to work, I got stuck in the worst traffic I had seen in weeks. With every minute that passed, my feeling of stress and impatience grew.

But, as I sat in the car, I reminded myself to be patient. I reminded myself that our situation was the same for everyone, and that sitting here and being angry would not do anything to change it.

So, instead of getting frustrated or angry, I listened to calming music and took deep breaths. I distracted myself by focusing on positive things, like the beautiful sunny day. After what felt like an eternity, the traffic finally started to move.

By that point, I was almost an hour behind. But, I decided to take the rest of the day in stride. I arrived at work and calmly explained to my boss why I was late and got back to my work.

I may have been running late, but by exercising patience, I was able to remain calm and get my day back on track.
