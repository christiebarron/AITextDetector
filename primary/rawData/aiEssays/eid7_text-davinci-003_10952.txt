I was walking home from the store recently, and while I was crossing the street, an elderly woman stopped me and asked if I could help her get her groceries across the street. She was struggling with a bag in each hand, and her walker was in the other direction. I could see that the weight of the grocery bags was too much for her, and she asked me to help.

I could have said no and gone on my way, but I knew that in this moment, patience was necessary. I carefully took the bags from her hands and slowly walked her across the street. Once we got to her home, I helped her carry the items inside and put them away in her kitchen. Throughout the entire experience, the woman thanked me profusely and I could tell she was deeply grateful for my help.

Despite feeling rushed to get home, I was patient, understanding, and tolerant in the moment and Iâ€™m glad I was able to help.
