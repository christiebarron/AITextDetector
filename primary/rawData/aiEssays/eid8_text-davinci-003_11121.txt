We all had such a great time at my best friend's wedding reception. The dance floor was full and the band was playing fun music. Everyone was laughing and having a good time. 

I remember seeing my friend at the altar, so happy and in love. When the ceremony was over, everyone cheered and clapped and I saw an enormous smile spread across her face. 

At the reception, the newly married couple danced their first dance and we all clapped and cheered when they finished. After that, everyone wanted to get in on the dancing. I was content to just stand back and cheer for everyone else.

But then something happened that I will never forget. My best friend ran over to me and tugged me onto the dance floor. I was taken aback and couldn't help but laugh at her enthusiasm. She grabbed my hand and we started to dance, just the two of us. 

That moment is etched in my memory forever. We both laughed and smiled and enjoyed being together in that moment. It was a beautiful gesture and really demonstrated the deep bond between us. 

That day, laughter was the shortest distance between us.
