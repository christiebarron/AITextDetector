The ending of the poem reflects the memories of the protagonist, a young girl, and her understanding of the natural cycle of the seasons and of life. The idea that life will carry on no matter what is a comforting one for the girl who is facing an uncertain future in terms of her future career and place in life. The hibiscus symbolizes hope and possibility; it blooms in winter as a sign of resilience and beauty, reminding the protagonist that good things can, and will, come if she perseveres. The line also implies that although she may not be successful at that moment in time, if she continues to strive and work hard, better days will come.
