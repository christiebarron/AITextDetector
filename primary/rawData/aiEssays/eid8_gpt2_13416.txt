One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was 15 and my father-in-law sent me to live with him. He had to have him because he'd got me too good at school and that made him look like an idiot.

When I tried to stop him, he'd pull me aside and ask what I'd done. "You were an amateur. You did that. They call you that now, you're a clown, I can tell you that." I said, "You're just my friend," and he went on and on about things like that. People who're on TV talking about people who go to jail or something like that are like, "Oh, you don't do that," but it's not the big deal.

In the last five years, we've been working together, and I'm glad that we finally are. This is a community at large and a place for kids. I'm not at war with America. I'm trying to do the right thing. I am proud of the people I know today. I was hoping you were here. It was great to be here with you. I wasn't trying to be a villain. I was just going to see my mom at the same time. I'm proud of what I know about America. It's all I want now at age 35, but I'm not going to tell this to anybody else. I love America. It's beautiful, I love America.
