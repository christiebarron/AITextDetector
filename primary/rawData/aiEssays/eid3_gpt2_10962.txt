Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. If you go up the road (i.e. you're on top of a hill when you leave from Hovis) you will hit the rocks and debris or fall over backwards. It has the effect of giving a better view and making it easier to spot areas that are too far ahead by taking a closer look. However, there's so much that's overlooked when designing roads, and the details are so small that it can be difficult to tell how much of any road is safe. The road isn't designed for this and will never be safe - we know in the past that the best way to try to avoid dangerous areas is to not come near them. In fact, this idea is the reason our roads are so common this country. A few years ago, a traffic accident took the lives of three young men from Brescia, Mexico in the 'Rough Road Ahead' area. Their injuries were not fatal. The next year, the same tragedy was found in the same area - another car ploughed into a young woman in Tenerife that killed her.
