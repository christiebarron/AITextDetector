I'm So Bored by Robert C. Lee

One of the most iconic songs is "I'm Too Beautiful" from The Searchers. After the film begins and the cast and crew get away on the journey, it's revealed that Robert C. Lee (the man who shot The Beatles, the character of Johnny Depp in Jackie In The Rain, and the protagonist of the 1964 film The Great Gatsby) was once a teenaged boy who's raised by his grandmother. "He always had such a good sense of humor. He was always talking about the bad in the world around him, like you're supposed to say 'Good luck' or something, with all of a sudden you start to see that you're getting something wrong," says Mimi MacFarlane â€“ our reporter for The Steely Dan. Lee says that he was always surprised to find his grandfather had a real sense of humor and was always a bit of a bit-of troublemaker. Even now, as his own story unfolds, it is very difficult to tell whether he's got what it takes to be a successful writer for a studio and a television show
