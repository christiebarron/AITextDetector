The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. During World War II, aircraft were forced to be flown on private planes. Many of the planes operated by Soviet aircraft would not have had the ability for docking and they were often on their own. By the mid-1940s, Soviet warplanes had become more capable of flying on private planes.

In 1950, a pair of Japanese jet fighters came to be used as airlift platforms. In 1953, a new type of Japanese warplane was introduced that was the most powerful machine ever used in combat. However, it was not until later in the 1950s that the same type of airlift planes were used to transport troops.

The Soviet airlift had three objectives. 1) to reduce casualties and to provide a more efficient means for military transport, 2) to improve morale, and 3) to lessen risk to civilian life. The Soviet army and air force provided airlift platforms which provided air support for the military during the first two years of the Cold War. Between 1964 and 1972, over 6,500 Soviet airlifting aircraft were operated in Vietnam. A high percentage of civilian casualties were inflicted by the Soviets and the airlift enabled the U.S. Army to fly some of the heaviest U.S. military transport planes into Vietnam.

Military transport planes were usually equipped with a second propulsion system called the RMS propulsion system. This propulsion system also enabled the RMS to
