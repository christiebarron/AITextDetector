Dear Editor,

As a frequent reader of your paper, I wanted to share my opinion on the increasing use of computers and their potential impact on people. I strongly believe that computers are making our lives easier and more efficient.

We've come to rely on computers for both our business and personal lives. On the one hand, computers have helped us to increase efficiency in the workplace by allowing us to save time and money by automating mundane tasks. In addition, they provide us with instantaneous access to a large amount of data and information.

On the other hand, it is important to consider the potential risks associated with over-reliance on computers. Human interaction and connection is fundamental to our social and emotional development. If we rely too heavily on computers, we may start to disconnect from each other. Furthermore, computer addiction may cause stress and physical ailments.

In conclusion, computers are an important tool that allow us to work better and faster, but we must never forget about the importance of human connection. Taking the time to connect with others and engage in meaningful conversation are essential to our wellbeing.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
