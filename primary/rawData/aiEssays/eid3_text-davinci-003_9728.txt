In the poem “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, the poem paints a vivid picture of a cyclist who is facing a difficult journey ahead. Thefeatures of the setting are important in understanding how this cyclist is affected by the ride. The first feature of the setting is the geographic location of the cyclist’s ride which is a mountain pass. The terrain would be a difficult climb for the cyclist, and highlight his physical challenge. Furthermore, this cyclist is riding at night, which increases the difficulty as the cyclist has no visual field to guide him through the terrain. The darkness also accentuates the cyclist’s exhaustion, and emphasizes the loneliness he faces in his journey. The weather is also important as the night sky is “clear and starry.” This implies that the only light the cyclist has to rely on for his journey is the stars and the moon, showing how the cyclist has to rely on Mother Nature to help him to his destination. All of these features together create an atmosphere of intense physical difficulty, isolation, and a sense of being up against the elements. The cyclist has to dig deep to make the journey, and the challenge of the setting clearly plays a major part in how the cyclist has to approach his ride.
