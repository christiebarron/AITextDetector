Computers have many effects on people. We just don't see all the positives associated â€” just people we know. We also see all the negativity, and we think about things, and we get frustrated, and we're like, 'We can't make it as bad if we don't stop it,' and we do it anyway.'"

"We are very close to putting these kinds of things out there and they're so precise, and we try to bring things out with all the precision we can with things like high resolution and other, more general observations," says Fagundez, who is working on the technology.

Other scientists have studied how the use of lasers could be used to analyze the skies. Lasers like the one pictured here work through light radiation, but they're far more light sensitive than other methods can detect, because astronomers would only be able to find what the lasers actually reflect against. This is because any one light source could impact the radiation, which is why lasers are so important in some high-level areas.

The lasers, which have some of the same design characteristics eclipsing conventional telescopes, might have been better suited to using in the early stages of the missions. But because of their large size, these high-energy
