Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, takes us into the mind of a talented and successful fashion designer. Rodriguez paints a beautiful narrative of his own life as a Cuban-American, from his lower-middle class upbringing to his rise to the forefront of the fashion world. Rodriguez’s memoir immediately creates a reflective and introspective mood, one that continues to build as he dives into his past.

The story opens with Rodriguez in his hometown of Hoboken, New Jersey, he explains his familial background and how the Cuban influence of his home life, including the Catholicism of his parents, strongly impacted his early life. He discusses how his childhood desires, and his dreams of making a name for himself as a fashion designer, clashed with the traditions of his upbringing and how this conflict shaped his determination.

The memoir continues with stories of Rodriguez’s struggle to establish himself in the fashion world, and his journey of self-discovery. In one scene, he reflects on his mentor, educator, and friend, the Late Professor Arthur Chapin. This is especially powerful to the reflective mood because Rodriguez reveals how Chapin’s influence on him helped shape his own fashion sense.
