Dear Editor,

I am writing to discuss and share my opinion on the effects computers have had on people over the past two decades.

We all know how revolutionary computers are when it comes to providing fast access to information. This has enabled people to find information and use it to inform decisions they make in their lives. But computers have also had a lasting impact on people's lives beyond faster access to knowledge.

Computers have fundamentally changed the way we communicate. We can now instantly communicate with people from all over the world, and even carry out meetings or classes online. This has changed our lives in ways we could not have foreseen even just a few years ago.

Computer technology has also had a major influence on the way we work, cultivate our hobbies, and interact with our family and friends. We are able to do much more in much less time, in comparison to twenty years ago. We can now research our projects deeply, collaborate with people from around the world, and discover new experiences without ever leaving our homes.

In short, computers have changed the way that we live our lives. They have enabled us to work more efficiently, discover new information sooner, and communicate with people quickly and easily
