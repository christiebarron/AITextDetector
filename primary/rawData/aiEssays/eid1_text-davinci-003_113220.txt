To The Editor:

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. In the last few decades, computers have come to dominate our lives. At work, at home, and in educational settings, computers have become an integral part of our everyday routines.

Though computers have made our lives easier and helped us to accomplish tasks more quickly, they can also have a pervasive and negative effect on our social and psychological wellbeing. Computers can generate cyber-bullying, cyber-stalking, and other forms of cyber-abuse that can affect people of all ages. Moreover, prolonged use of computers can lead to physical ailments, such as carpel tunnel syndrome and eyestrain. Furthermore, computer addiction, especially to gaming, can interfere with family interactions, education, and job performance.

It is clear that there are both positive and negative effects associated with the use of computers. Taking reasonable precautions and using computer time in moderation can help to reduce these effects. I urge readers to be aware of the potential downsides, use common sense when it comes to computer time, and strive to keep balance and limits. 

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
