Dear Editor, 

I am writing to share my opinion on the effects of computers on people, which I believe is both positive and negative. Computers have the potential to transform lives in many ways. On the one hand, computers can help people become better organized and more productive. They can be used to research and solve complex problems, streamline communication, and reduce everyday boredom. On the other hand, they can also be detrimental to our health, as they can lead to overuse syndromes, eyesight issues, and excessive gaming or internet usage.

As we move further into the digital age, there is no denying the impacts computers have had on our lives. People spend more and more time in front of screens, leading to an increased risk of various physical and psychological issues that must not be overlooked. Our schools are teaching children how to use computers from a very early age, and parents must monitor their childrenâ€™s usage of computers to ensure they are not exposed to any risks or dangers. Companies must also take responsibility for the impacts of computers in their workplaces and take steps to protect their employees from any potential harm caused by their use.

All in all, computers have become an invaluable tool in our lives and can be used to greatly improve productivity and efficiency. However, it is important to recognize the potential harm caused by excessive usage and take measures to mitigate potential risks. 

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
