Most of all, it's a warning that I'm not alone in my skepticism about its effectiveness, and it's not as if there's not a vast body of evidence out there explaining how it's effective.

In an important piece published Tuesday in The BMJ, researchers at UCLA in Los Angeles discovered that the ride-sharing app that provides information about the number of people on your daily bike trip is the one that can help give riders some idea of what a safe route ahead should be, based on the information they have about you.

They also found that riders of a wide variety of routes, especially those at the highest risk for injuries, get significantly better results if they are able to tell where, where and with what route they want to go for their commute. They also see more efficient cycling choices that have no impact on their risk level.

The research, conducted by UCLA's Michael Southey and his colleagues at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, will be published Oct. 14 in the Journal of Pediatric Aerobics and Sports Medicine.

"This is a very exciting tool for doctors and riders alike," Southey said by telephone as he and co-author Dwayne Martin of the UCLA study sat by a car parked in a traffic lights-
