I have a dog named Daisy who loves to dig in the backyard. She can spend hours happily digging at nothing in particular, and sometimes she gets out of my reach. Not wanting her to wander too far, I always invite her back towards me with some treats. 

But one day, she didn’t seem particularly interested in the treats I offered. Instead, she wanted to keep digging and wouldn’t budge. I tried offering her different foods and toys, but to no avail. I had a feeling she had something in particular that she wanted to find.

At that point, I could have gotten frustrated and yelled at her to come, but I chose to stay patient. I let Daisy keep digging for a few more minutes before slowly moving closer to her to get her attention. Sure enough, after a few more moments, she finally came out of the hole with a stick in her mouth. She seemed proud of her find and I was proud of her for finding it.

I had to practice a lot of patience with Daisy that day, but it was definitely worth it. The experience taught me that sometimes the best way to handle a situation is to stay patient and let things happen in their own time. Instead of forcing things, I showed patience and understanding - and it made all the difference!
