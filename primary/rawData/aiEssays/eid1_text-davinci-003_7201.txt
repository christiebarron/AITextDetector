In the poem “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, the poet uses the setting to illustrate the struggles of the cyclist with his environment. The setting in the poem is a road, or a journey, which symbolizes the struggles of the cyclist in his life. The cyclist is facing a long and difficult road in his journey, which is further highlighted by the “potholes”, “climbs and descents”, and “headwinds” of the road.

The potholes represent the roadblocks or difficult obstacles the cyclist faces. These obstacles must be overcome and can slow down the cyclist’s progress. The climbs and descents symbolize the highs and lows of the cyclist’s journey. The highs represent moments of illumination, joy, and success, and the lows represent moments of failure and hardship.

The headwinds further add to the struggle of the cyclist’s journey. Headwinds make it more difficult for the cyclist to move forward due to the force of the wind against them. The cyclist has to use all of the strength and resolve he has to push further. Additionally, it symbolizes the extra effort it takes for the cyclist to reach his goals and make progress.

Overall, the features of the setting in the poem “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski give life to the struggles of the cyclist on his journey
