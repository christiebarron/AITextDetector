Dear Editor,

In todayâ€™s tech-savvy world, computers have become an essential part of our lives. But there is a lot of debate about the effects that they have on us as humans. I strongly believe that computers have a greater effect on us than most people think. 

For starters, computers have made our work far easier. They allow us to quickly finish tasks that would have otherwise taken hours or even days to complete manually. Moreover, computers open up opportunities for people to expand their knowledge on new and interesting topics. We can access an unlimited source of information with the help of computers, something that was not possible a few years ago. 

However, there are also certain adverse effects of computers on people. Too much screen time can lead to a decrease in creativity in children and adults. Similarly, it can have an adverse effect on our mental and physical health if we stay glued to the screens for too long.

Ultimately, computers can be an invaluable asset in our lives, but it is important to recognize the potential risks and take preventive measures against them. Ideally, follow the 2-hour guideline when using a computer; that is, no more than two hours per day should be spent on the computer for healthy physical and mental wellbeing.

In conclusion, I would urge all the readers to use computers wisely, taking all the benefits while being mindful of the risks involved. 

Sincerely,

[Name]
