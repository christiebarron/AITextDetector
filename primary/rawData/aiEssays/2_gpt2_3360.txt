I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is an important step that we must follow when deciding on censorship of content of interest to children. While we are proud to be a partner of public libraries, we recognize that libraries are also a source of value within the State and community from which the public is directed to their education, and that they share the needs and preferences that citizens have in making a decision about how to be able to engage in society.

Sincerely,

Libraries Minister
