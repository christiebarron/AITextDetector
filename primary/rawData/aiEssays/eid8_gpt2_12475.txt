One time I experienced laughter in my life was when we were in my late teens or early twenties. I had a girl who was a little bit shorter, taller, had darker skin tones, and was much more of a black girl. In the movies, it didn't make any difference since black characters were much more powerful than white characters. That being said, I think it actually gave me a good excuse to feel like I was at a place I didn't actually enjoy.

I'm starting to realize, that when I'm in movies and TV, I can often feel like some guy at the back of the theater thinks he's a white dude because I've been treated just fine for being white, but I'm not actually white.

That makes me really sad to see someone who is not as white as I am, be that black, white, Hispanic, or Latina. I don't want to be that person. That would be to say I am black myself, but I feel like I have a different feeling about me. So, I was scared of being on the receiving end of racism if I was a black person. I wish I didn't have to.

But what did I learn about how to take a stand towards equality, in a way that is not at odds with white race, in many areas that aren't as deeply invested with race.

There's always a white woman who wants to make the case. It's always a white person
