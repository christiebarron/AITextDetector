I was in the grocery store the other day, and the line at the checkout was incredibly long. After about 10 minutes of waiting, it was finally my turn. As the cashier started to ring up my items, the register froze. She immediately shot up from her seat and rushed to find a manager. As I watched her walk away, I began to get frustrated. It had already been such a long wait, and now I had to wait even longer. 

However, I took a few deep breaths and reminded myself to stay patient. Instead of focusing on the time I was losing, I decided to use this as an opportunity to chat with the people in line behind me. We talked about our days and what we planned to make for dinner. Not long after, the cashier and manager returned and were able to quickly fix the issue. 

I was so thankful that I had chosen to remain patient rather than display my frustration. I know that getting frustrated wouldn't have helped the situation, and I was happy to have spent the time getting to know the people in line.
