The builders of the Empire State Building had a unique ambition when it first opened in 1931: to allow dirigibles to dock at the building’s mast. However, due to the size and complexity of the project, they soon had to contend with a number of obstacles.

The first and most obvious obstacle was the size of the building. Although it was the tallest building in the world at the time, its design didn’t account for dirigibles and there simply wasn’t the space to accommodate them. Furthermore, the wind limits around the Empire State Building were much stricter than those for smaller structures, meaning the builders had to work within very tight parameters if they wanted to make it work.

The structural integrity of the building itself was also a major challenge. The addition of a docking mast would need to be structurally sound and able to withstand the significant stresses of large dirigibles docking. In addition, the mooring mast structure itself needed to be designed in such a way as to allow the dirigibles to maneuver effectively onto the mast without damaging the building.

The Empire State Building's location in the heart of Midtown Manhattan was also an issue. Incorporating the dock would require the surrounding area to be cleared of pedestrians and vehicles to ensure the safety of everyone around when the balloon was docking.

Finally, the inflation of the dirigible was an obstacle of its own. It was an expensive and labor-intensive
