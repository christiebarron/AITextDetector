The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is more of a celebration of an individual rather than a depiction of the world we're living in than an expression of how we value and appreciate our own individual experiences of the world. 'It is the end of history' â€” or "it's the end of the world." It may take us a long time to even get used to, but that doesn't mean we're not going to get used to.

That's a message to the public. The public knows it might not have the answers because it's a media age and the only way to understand the story is to be brave to try.
