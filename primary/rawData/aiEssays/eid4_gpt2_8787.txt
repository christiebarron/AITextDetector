The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because the author is now able to draw on an actual real historical figure. Winter Hibiscus is no ordinary person with very large and beautiful feet and hands, but he is a real and very good character who is well respected by his wife and by others. There is a huge sense of continuity between the two accounts from now on which allows for the development of the plot even in the very early parts of the tale.

The story will continue on in the following sections of the book:
