The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' (2013) is very different to how we experienced it in this year's Hollywood blockbuster. The way it's narrated from a very different perspective than the plot, which doesn't feel like it's coming straight out of a science fiction novel. So when we talked directly to Steven Soderbergh, it seemed like they have a great appreciation of the way that the world gets changed, and how different our lives get.

At an intimate level, I think the reason I did it â€” it's such an art form. I was just talking to a small group, and there was an important decision to make. And the first thing I said was, I really want to go back to a time when I was writing my memoir, but it's not always easy. This is an extremely difficult book to write. You have an emotional attachment, and in this novel, a real-life loss is happening, but there are circumstances where everything looks like it's going in the opposite direction. So let me say one last thing. I hope you've seen through it, because you'll love it and you'll be very passionate about it. We will write another one, and I hope you'll go into hiding.

*That's what it sounds like, Steven Soderbergh.
