I remember a time when I had to call the customer service representative for my mobile carrier multiple times for the same issue. Although I was really frustrated I chose to be patient and keep a cool head. The customer service reps I talked to were new and really struggled to help me solve my issue. Despite taking a really long time, I didn't lose my temper and calmly asked questions to help them understand my issue better. I reassured them that it was ok and that I understand how stressful this could be. Finally, after several phone calls, references to the manual and troubleshooting, the issue got resolved. I was really relieved and I thanked the reps for their patience and hard work.
