I remember the first time I met my now-husband. It was almost two years ago and time seemed to stand still. I was so nervous I couldn't stop fidgeting, and he was equally stiff. With no ice-breaker in sight, the air seemed to get heavier and heavier. 

Suddenly, out of nowhere, he threw out a joke - something about our choice of dinner that night - and we both chuckled. And that laugh, that silly, spontaneous laugh, broke the ice. We both found ourselves unable to stop laughing. 

We ended up having the most wonderful time that night, all because of that laugh. To this day, I have no idea why he chose to make that joke, but it was the perfect way to bring us together.

Since then, we've been married and laughter has been a part of almost every moment we've shared. It's strengthened our bond and kept us connected even during the hardest times. We can always turn to each other and laughter to make things better. 

Laughter is really one of the most important ingredients in any relationship and I couldn't be more thankful that it brought us together all those years ago.
