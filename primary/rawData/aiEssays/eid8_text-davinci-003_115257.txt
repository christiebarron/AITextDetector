The other day, I was at the beach with my husband and a group of friends. Everyone was talking and having a good time, just enjoying a beautiful day at the beach. Out of nowhere, I felt a sudden urge to start giggling uncontrollably. I couldn't seem to stop! I caught a couple of side-eye glances coming my way, as I couldn't contain my own laughter. 

My husband then started to join in on the fun by making silly faces and playing around with me. Before I knew it, everyone was in on the laughter and smiles were on all of our faces. The whole experience was so magical and without a doubt it brought us all a lot closer together. 

The laughter had started with me, but in the end it was something that we were all deeply connected to and enjoyed as a group. I realized that laughter really is the shortest distance between two people, and I was so glad I could be the catalyst for such a special moment.
