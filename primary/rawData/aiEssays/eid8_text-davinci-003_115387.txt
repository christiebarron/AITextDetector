I was out for a walk with my best friend when we stumbled across a circus parade taking place in our neighborhood. We both looked at each other in amazement and rushed to the middle of the chaos to take it all in. 

The second we got there, the elephant trainer began honking his horn, and everyone around us started clapping. The animals got so excited that they began to do all sorts of tricks, like spinning on their hind legs and balancing themselves on wooden balls! Everyone around us started to laugh, and soon enough, my best friend and I were both in on it.

We laughed until we were practically crying, and then we'd start the cycle all over again. It truly felt like we were both having a magical moment in time, not only with each other, but with everyone else in the parade.

Just then, the rain started to drizzle and the parade came to an end. Regardless of the weather, we all walked away with giant smiles on our faces. I realized then how much laughter can bring people together and create something special that no one will ever forget.
