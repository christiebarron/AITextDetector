I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is what the government should focus on."

But in fact there is a problem here as well, says Dr Lee.

"The government should not let the public know there's something fishy going on there," Dr Lee says.

"It's not the type of thing that you have in public libraries, but it's still a very problematic thing. That says a lot about how little accountability or transparency the government has and how far those authorities do have any idea whether a building is truly public or not - and not what the public really understands."

'Stolen credit'

Dr Lee's comments come just a week after the National Academy of Sciences published its landmark review of the security of computers for research purposes, saying that they must be made "in an open, reliable way".

It says that even if a computer is not in a computer lab, its security must be considered public when it is downloaded or copied by anyone who enters its data.
