I often find myself in situations where I'm tested in how patient I am. One situation in particular comes to mind.

Recently, I was picked up at the airport by a friend after being away for the weekend. My flight was delayed due to a storm and my friend, who had been waiting at the airport for hours, was exhausted and frayed from the experience. Despite this, they remained understanding, patient, and kind with me. Instead of lecturing me on how long they had waited, they offered me comforting words and reminded me that these things sometimes happen.

They then drove me home and the entire way, they did not mention the delay or express any frustration. Instead, they focused on catching up with me and sharing stories about what happened in my absence.

The patience of my friend in this situation was quite admirable, and it taught me a lot about how to handle difficult situations with grace and understanding.
