Through his story, we get a glimpse of how he and his family navigated the cultural and emotional dislocations of being outsiders in a new country, along with how he found solace and strength in existing communities while building a future of his own. From the very beginning, Rodriguez establishes a melancholic yet hopeful mood.

There is a sense of longing in the memoir, as Rodriguez reflects on the places his family left behind in their move to the United States. He speaks of his yearning to feel rooted in a place that he calls home, which is deepened by the physical and emotional distance that separates him from his homeland.
