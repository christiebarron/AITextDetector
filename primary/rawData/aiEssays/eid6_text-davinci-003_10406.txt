The Empire State Building’s mooring mast was an ambitious project that, if successful, would revolutionize air travel. The intent was to enable passengers to board and disembark from airships — dirigibles or blimps — without having to land. Aiming to provide the same convenience as a railway station, the mooring mast project faced many obstacles in its quest for successful airship docking.

The most fundamental challenge was the building height itself. At the time, dirigibles were limited in size and could not physically make contact with the Empire State Building. To enable airship docking at the mooring mast, a flexible mast had to be designed and installed on the building’s rooftop. This would allow the airship to extend out and make contact with the mooring mast.

A second challenge was engineering a mechanism that could moor and secure a dirigible to the mooring mast. The mechanisms planted on the mooring mast had to be airtight and resistant to shock. Furthermore, the mooring mechanisms needed to be adjustable and capable of holding a wide range of airship sizes, weights, and shapes.

The mooring mast had to be placed in a precarious position. Located on the building’s 72nd floor and 1,000 feet above ground, the mast exposed workers and engineers to strong winds and other unstable conditions. To overcome this, the mast had to be welded on
