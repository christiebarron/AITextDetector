I was recently at the grocery store shopping for some things with my mom. We had been there for quite some time and the line was growing longer and longer. Everyone was getting impatient and start to express their frustration, but my mom remained calm and patient.

She smiled at those in line with her and patiently waited her turn without letting on how frustrated she might have been. I admired her strength and patience in that moment, and it was a valuable lesson for me to learn.

When it was our turn to pay, the cashier was having trouble with the register and was getting flustered. My mom reassured her and let her take her time. After it finally got fixed, she thanked the cashier for their patience. 

I was relieved that my mom was patient with the cashier and her struggles. It was a powerful example of what patience can do in difficult situations. I am so thankful for my mom's example and the way she handled the situation.
