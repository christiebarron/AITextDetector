Although his journey is not physically taking place within a specific locality—he is cycling atop an open country road—the distinct details of the setting serve to determine the type and degree of obstacles he must endure. 

For instance, the cyclist passes through “hills and valleys where the wind was blowing” and “gulches and creeks” where the “emptiness of the landscape was deafening.” These elements of the environment—the hills, gulches, and creeks—represent physical impediments he must pass through. Exacerbating the challenge of the geographic landscape is the overall characteristic of a solemn desolation to the environment, which contributes to the poem’s overall emphasis on loneliness and struggles.
