I'll never forget the time when I first met my best friend. She was trying to put together a new desk for her room, and things weren't going so well. She was getting so worked up and flustered that I could hardly not laugh. In an attempt to hide it I tried to cough and turn away, but my face was already too red. I was just about to apologize when she paused and looked up at me to then burst out laughing with me.

That was the moment we bonded. It was like something lit up between us and our friendship was born, all thanks to laughter.

We often joke about that moment over the years and now can hardly complete a conversation without the both of us laughing. Itâ€™s easier to open up and share our feelings with each other with laughter as the foundation of our friendship.

Laughter has brought us closer together and has been a great source of stress relief, comfort and joy over the years. I'm thankful every day that we shared that moment together that first time, and our friendship has only grown stronger over the years.
