I remember the roll of laughter that escaped as my grandfather spun his tall tales. He was always able to make us laugh, even during the toughest times. 

One of my favorites was the story of his magical fishing hat. He claimed that it always made the fish bite no matter how long he had been out on the lake. When he described the hat's powers of persuasion, we could barely keep from rolling on the grass from laughter.

I remember how special it made us feel whenever he shared his stories with us. He used laughter to draw us closer to him, and it always seemed to make whatever challenges we were facing a little more bearable. 

Years later, I still find myself thinking of him and his stories. I remember his laugh as he tried to tell us outrageous stories. His laughter still fills our family as it connects us all.
