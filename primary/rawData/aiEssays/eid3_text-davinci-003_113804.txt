The features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead” heavily influence the cyclist’s experience. The main character is a cyclist who is attempting to climb Mount Tamalpais, a hill in the San Francisco Bay area. Throughout the story, there are multiple instances where the terrain, landmarks, and other features of the setting are explicitly described.

At the beginning of the story, the cyclist is slowed down by having to maneuver around trees and other vegetation on the mountain path. The thick bushes that the cyclist comes across need to be maneuvered around, and he mentions the branches of the trees and shrubs scraping against him as he moves forward. Not only are the trees and plants making it difficult for the cyclist to progress, but the terrain itself is described as “rugged and rocky” with “a multitude of broken branches and stones”.This rough landscape has made it more difficult for the cyclist to pedal up the mountain. 

As the cyclist continues to climb, he is reminded of the difficulty of the climb when the wind picks up and the fog gets thicker. He is also distracted by the picturesque views of the Bay, providing a momentary pleasant distraction from the difficulty of the climb. The fog and wind further slow his progress and make navigating more difficult. 

The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead” significantly affect the cyclist’s journey.
