I believe that censorship of materials in libraries, on the Internet, on campus is a grave and urgent problem. We ask that in all our decisions, we make clear which words are banned and which words remain silent. As an activist who works to prevent people from having their voices silenced, I can confirm that there are many who use this hashtag to protect their own interests, but I will say the following, I would not support censorship of the Internet.

Some words have been banned simply to protest the suppression of freedom. Others that have been protected are in the public domain, private and anonymous. The term "free speech" was coined by U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal, who was forced to step down in 2001. As I indicated, the term is defined by the Supreme Court from the Fourth to the Fifth Generation when we define speech as expressive expression. (For clarity, I am referring to the First Amendment — no doubt a broadening of that definition.) So is "free speech," as distinguished from "any expression or criticism of any kind" that may threaten to impose new conditions, such as the right to free speech protected by the First Amendment — even an expression that may be seen as "politically correct" — when both are clearly political expression? The First and First Amendment are not linked and do not even appear within the umbrella term for the most blatant anti-Obama content censorship.

As I indicated, censorship is often seen as "privilege" or "political"
