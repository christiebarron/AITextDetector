The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The lack of a single space and the lack of a solid glass window made it difficult to install an extra pane between two sheets of concrete.

The building eventually proved problematic when the first windows were rolled down. This resulted in a total blackout, which prevented 79.5 per cent of the building's windows having their final opening. In addition, this caused the exterior panels from the windows to get damaged.

One of the many problems was that the windows needed to be locked in place, to prevent them from falling out of the frame with a falling debris on they way out the window.

Even during construction, the exterior walls became a problem. If you stepped on the glass, you could see the concrete coming up and down inside. So the building was a different story.

"The first window was rolled down and we have had a lot of problems with the glass," said Mr. Dutton.

When the roof got very hot, he said, many of the windows and the windows on the right began to crack and burn.

"The second window would pop open and you would see it coming up and down the steps," said Mr. Dutton. "There were even things that were visible from outside. The one we have never seen has cracked again."
