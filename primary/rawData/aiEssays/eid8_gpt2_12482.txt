One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I went out to dinner at our local pub. I was laughing so hard that I could no longer stand a dog. After saying a bunch of words to the dog, I asked if he was hungry and so quickly asked to see if he slept, I am now thinking how much that helped the dog. The dog is now a professional and is grateful. I think we could keep doing things differently and be the best we can be.

I'd like to extend a big hug to the members of the community who continue to support these dogs. You can reach us in the email info@wtfwtfcat.net or on Twitter @w âœ”tfwtfcats. Any other questions on this Facebook page or any other topics, you may use #wtfcat to find more info.
