Dear Readers of the [Newspaper],

I am writing to share my opinion regarding the ever-evolving effects of computers on people today. It is my belief that computers and technology, in general, have been a source of both benefit and detriment to many of us.

On one hand, computers can be used to keep us connected to the world, provide us with a wealth of knowledge, and can hugely increase convenience and productivity in a plethora of ways. This is undoubtedly true for many aspects of our society, from business and science to education and entertainment.

On the other side of the coin, however, extended usage of various tech devices has been linked to increased levels of stress, and is said to lead to a feeling of isolation and loneliness. These are a few of the many potential drawbacks that we must be aware of as our lives become more and more entwined with technology.

This is why I believe that it is of utmost importance to find a healthy balance between the advantages of computer usage and the consequences that it can bring. Without proper regulation, the scales of a healthy lifestyle can easily become tipped toward the use of tech, leading to an over-reliance on it that can be damaging.

I urge readers of this letter to consider these words as we continue to march firmly into the digital age.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
