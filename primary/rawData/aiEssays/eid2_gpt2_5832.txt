I believe that censorship of materials in libraries and online are the greatest deterrent to the emergence of an art and literature culture that is based on violence in the guise of art and literature.

The fact that literature is now in its minority means that it has little chance of producing its best.

And it is that in a world of a handful of authors publishing only stories that are based on violence, the very nature of the work can become more and more suspect.

The story that emerges within a literary text is not how often that story was written or how many people have read it.

And I do hope that this report will cause readers to reflect on how much the 'bad book' – the 'bad author' or 'bad person' – that the press, the world's press, and society, sometimes seems to do towards the writer and not how we perceive it.

For me, the best antidote to the problems we have faced over the past century is to change our media and our practices.

But at the end of the day, most of the work that people write about is about violence.

It is about people telling stories that are based on violence and they get far more credit, and they are rewarded for their deeds than people who are merely not physically violent.

And it is about people telling stories with a sense of urgency and an intention to tell their story, and that is precisely what I am calling for.
