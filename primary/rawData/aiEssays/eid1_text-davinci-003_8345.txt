 

I remember one time when I was patient. I was out dining with a friend of mine at a popular restaurant. We had been waiting for around 20 minutes and the waiter had still not taken our order. I could feel my impatience rising, however, I consciously chose to remain patient. Instead of snapping at the waiter, I continued to wait calmly and politely asked him for the menu.

After another 30 minutes had passed, the food was still nowhere to be seen. Again, I was feeling irritated but I chose not to express my dissatisfaction. I waited for the waiter to arrive, and when he did, he informed us that there had been an issue with the kitchen's orders and apologized for the wait. This time, instead of getting angry, I thanked the waiter for the update and politely asked to receive our food soon. A few minutes later, our food showed up and we enjoyed a lovely meal together.

This experience taught me the power of being patient. I had continued to be kind and polite even when frustrated and impatient, and in the end it all paid off. I'm grateful for the reminder that patience is often the best response to a difficult situation.
