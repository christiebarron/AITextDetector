It was my best friend's birthday, and we've been planning a surprise party for months. As the day arrived, I knew I had to come up with an amusing way to get her attention when it was time for the party to begin. After doing some quick work on the computer, I decided to make a funny poster with an outrageous phrase that she would never expect me to say.

I printed out the poster, taped it to the wall, and waited for her to walk in. When she did, I waved and gestured at the poster. She looked at it, then at me, her eyes squinting in amusement. It said "Birthdays only come once a year so make sure you LAUGH out loud!"

The moment she read it, she busted out laughing. I couldn't help but join in. Soon the entire room was filled with our contagious laughter. That laughter was the spark that ignited a room full of good vibes.

My friend and I was soon celebrating her birthday surrounded by close family and friends -- united by laughter.
