The Empire State Building is an iconic structure located in the heart of Manhattan, and perhaps its most notable feature is the docking mast which was expected to become an integral part of the transportation of the time. Yet even as construction on the building began, the dream of allowing dirigibles to dock atop the spire was fraught with obstacles.

One of the main obstacles facing the builders of the Empire State Building was the weather. While airships were designed to travel in fair weather, even small changes in the wind could make docking atop the building a challenge. Furthermore, the airship pilots would be navigating their vessels through dense air traffic and city skyscrapers, further complicating the matter of finding a safe place to dock.

Another challenge was the design of the spire itself. Since the Empire State Building was being built in the late 1920s, the spire had to be strong enough to support the weight of an enormous dirigible. Engineers had to take into account factors such as pressure and temperature when calculating the structure's pound-per-square-inch ratings. This was no easy task, as extreme variations in temperature can change the strength of a building's material, which could drastically affect the integrity of the mooring mast.

In addition to the construction, there were also safety regulations which had to be considered. In order to make sure that dirigibles docking atop the Empire State Building would be safe, officials had to ensure that the building was equipped
