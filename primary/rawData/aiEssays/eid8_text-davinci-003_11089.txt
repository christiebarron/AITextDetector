I had been friends with Steve for years, but recently he had been a little down. He had lost his job and was feeling a bit lost as he searched for a new one. 

One day, we decided to have lunch together. We both ordered the same item on the menu without even realizing it. When the waiter brought us our meals, we looked at each other and both started to laugh.

The waiter, who was clearly trying his best to remain professional, took it all in stride and even laughed with us. It was a small moment, but it made me realize how much I valued our friendship. And I knew that it was moments like this, when we could just enjoy each other's company and laugh, that we needed to cherish. 

We continued to joke and laugh as we ate our lunch, and by the end of the meal we were both in better spirits. We waved goodbye to the waiter, who smiled at us knowingly, and left.

In that moment, I realized that laughter was the shortest distance between two people. And the more I shared it with Steve, the closer we became.
