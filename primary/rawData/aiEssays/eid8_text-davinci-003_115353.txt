 

I was on a date with my now-husband, Antonio, and things felt different. I hadn't expected it, but we just clicked. We were talking and joking around, and all of a sudden I made an offhanded comment that made us both erupt in laughter. Antonio had the kind of laugh that just made me happy. We hadn't even been dating for long, but I knew I had found something special.

The laughter that we shared that day made me feel close to Antonio in a way that I hadn't with anyone else before. From then on, laughter was very important in our relationship. Whether we were simply joking around with each other, playing a prank, or even just relieving stress from a long day, we always found something to laugh about.

Months and years passed, and the laughter never stopped. Even during times of difficulty in our relationship, we were able to work it out with a good laugh. To this day, laughter is the most important thing in our relationship. We don't just laugh for amusement - it's a way of bonding that carries us through anything.
