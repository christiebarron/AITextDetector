The Empire State Building is one of the most impressive works of architecture ever created, and a landmark of New York City. Despite its many spectacular features, what perhaps captures the public’s imagination the most is its ability for dirigibles to dock on the roof. Yet achieving this unique feature was not without its challenges.

The main obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock was finding an effective way to attach the airship to the roof without causing any damage. This was due to the lightweight nature of the airships, which necessitated the use of an extremely secure mooring system. Fortunately, the building’s designers, in consultation with aeronautics and engineering experts, came up with a solution--the installation of a hollow steel mast atop the building, on which the dirigibles would be able to securely moor. 

To ensure that everything worked properly, several prototypes of the mast were constructed at the Empire State Building site beforehand. In addition, a steel cable was wound around the outside of the mast, allowing the airships to be quickly and securely fastened to the building. However, as the engineer in charge of the project, William E. Prindle, noted, if the winds were too strong, it would be almost impossible to hold the dirigible in place. 

The mast also had to be designed with safety in mind. This meant that a number of modifications were
