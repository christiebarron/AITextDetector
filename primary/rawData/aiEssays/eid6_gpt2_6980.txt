The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. To ensure that they were "accessible both in and out of the building, the aircraft could not dock on their own and therefore could not be mounted on a crane," the FAA said in a statement.

The FAA said the design of the aircraft required two to four hours of flying.

Airplanes with no visual aid would "not be allowed into an airport and cannot be used to ferry passengers or take them to nearby emergency exits," the FAA's statement says.

In August 2003, there were two crashes involving two drones, both powered by lasers, that resulted in passengers receiving only a "minor" bump in the face.

"With the latest and greatest advances in laser technologies and the ability to quickly and reliably target these sensitive surfaces, we've achieved a more reliable, safe, and secure approach to airport security," said the FAA.

In August 2004, the Pentagon issued a program to develop and launch 20,000 laser-based sensors at a total cost of just $2.7 million that could help protect sensitive city buildings from lasers and other threats.

In 2008, two high-definition images from U.S. Navy missile launch sites were combined at sea for use in a single high-definition report published by the Air Force's Missile Technology Command.
