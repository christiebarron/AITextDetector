Narciso Rodríguez's memoir, 'From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives', vividly and powerfully captures the emotional complexity of life. The memoir centers around Rodríguez's journey of family, identity, and self-discovery as he transitions from a childhood of poverty and insecurity to a successful career as a fashion designer. The mood of the memoir is a mix of both nostalgia and regret as Rodríguez reflects on the choices he had to make and the paths he could have taken based on the circumstances of his childhood.

The nostalgia in the memoir is tangible and powerful. Rodríguez recalls his childhood in Cuba, and the moments he spent with his close family. He remembers how, during his father's illness, his mother 'ignored the sadness and pain and kept her faith intact'. This nostalgia creates a warm, comforting feeling in the reader, as the family's love for each other clearly shines through. 

However, this feeling of nostalgia is intertwined with a feeling of regret and sadness. After his family immigrated to the United States, Rodríguez had to face the difficult transition, having to learn English and adapt to a new culture, not to mention the prejudice he encountered. Although Rodríguez came to excel in his new country, there is still a sense of regret that permeates the memoir — at what he left behind, and the different decisions he had to make on
