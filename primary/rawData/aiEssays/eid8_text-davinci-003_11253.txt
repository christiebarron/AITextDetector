I'll never forget the day I first met my partner. We were both attending a family gathering at her house. I had come with my sister to meet her family and form some connections. 

When we arrived, the house was bustling with activity and the family was already in the middle of a lively conversation. I was feeling a bit nervous to try and fit in and be accepted by them.

Just when I was starting to become overwhelmed, my partner stepped in and started cracking jokes. Everyone began laughing and the atmosphere in the room suddenly changed. It was like the tension I felt had completely vanished. 

Before I knew it, I was joining in with the laughter too. We kept the conversation going and shared jokes with each other. I was relieved to see that she was incredibly easy to talk to and I felt an immediate connection. 

That's when I realized that laughter really is the shortest distance between two people. 

It has been over a year now, and no matter what happens throughout the day, we always make sure to end it by sharing a few laughs. It truly makes all the difference and brings us closer!
