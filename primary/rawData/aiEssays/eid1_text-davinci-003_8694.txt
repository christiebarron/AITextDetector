I'll never forget that day when I met my best friend. It was the first day of high school and I was feeling incredibly nervous. My palms were sweaty, my knees weak, and it felt like I was about to have a panic attack! But then, in walked this loud, boisterous girl who had the biggest smile on her face. She introduced herself as Jane and I just couldn't help it— I started laughing!

We started talking and, from then on, we just clicked. We had so much in common and we just talked for hours. But it was the laughter that kept us together. It was like no matter how busy we got or whatever challenges life threw in our way, we found a way to laugh about it and carry on.

To this day, laughter is still one of the best things we share. Whether it's laughing about silly jokes, that ridiculous movie we just watched, or the funny thing someone said in class, we know that we can always find something to laugh about.

It’s been over 6 years since we've met, and I’m thankful for each and every moment spent with my best friend. Laughter will always be one of the greatest gifts we share, and I’ll cherish it forever.
