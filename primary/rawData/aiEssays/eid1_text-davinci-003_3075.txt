Dear Editor,

It seems technology has been advancing faster than ever in recent years, leaving people facing the dilemma of whether or not they should embrace the many advantages of computers. As someone who has embraced computers and seen their impact on everyday life, I can definitively say that computers have had both positive and negative effects on people.

On the one hand, computers have allowed us to access more information, be more efficient at work and even keep in touch with distant family and friends. They are without a doubt very useful tools that ensure our lives are a lot easier. However, computers have also become a source of distraction and are in some cases even changing the way humans interact. We donâ€™t need to talk as often or even look someone in the eye when speaking, as technology gives us the opportunity to communicate mainly through screens and keyboards.

My opinion is that we must be mindful of the effects computers have on people and ensure we not only embrace the positive aspects of technology, but also the human contact and social interaction they can take away from us. Technology should be used to supplement our lives and never fully replace our personal relationships.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
