The mooring mast atop the Empire State Building was one of the most ambitious building projects of its era. Instituted by then-governor Alfred E. Smith, the goal was to create a docking station for dirigibles, or airships, allowing them to travel at high speeds between cities. As such, it posed a number of unexpected challenges to the construction team.

The first obstacle was the construction of the mast itself. At almost 200 feet tall, the mast was the tallest of its kind in the world. Envisioned as a three-stage tower, it was constructed of steel and reinforced concrete, with an observation platform at the top. The engineers had to overcome specialized issues including reinforcing the building's structure, designing it to withstand severe winds and other harsh weather, and ensuring its impressive height could be safely accessed by passengers.

The second obstacle was the lack of clear guidance on how best to moor a dirigible. The team wanted the smallest mechanical elements possible to assure a safe and reliable mooring. Moreover, they had to take on the added challenge of finding a suitable material that was both lightweight while also strong and durable enough to afford years of service. As explained in 'The Mooring Mast' by Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted, the team ultimately settled on a combination of steel rod, steel cable, and strong elastic rope tethered to the building.

The final obstacle was the height of the mast in relation to the
