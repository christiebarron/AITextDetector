I remember the time I took my wife out to dinner for our anniversary. Between courses we had a few jokes back and forth, but nothing too out of the ordinary. We moved on to a dessert and it was a deep-fried ice cream ball. I took one bite and some ice cream got on the side of my face. My wife, who was across the table, started to laugh uncontrollably as I tried to wipe the cream away vigorously. I couldn't help but join in the laughter. We laughed for so long, people around us started looking, trying to figure out what was so funny. 

The waiter came back to check on us and finally found out what was so amusing when I showed him the ice cream still on my face. We all cracked up and the waiter even joined in our laughter. 

It was one of those moments that I felt so much closer to my wife than I ever had before. It was spontaneous and nothing like the jokes we had made to each other earlier. I felt that the laughter had brought us closer together and it was the most organic, genuine thing that I've ever felt in that moment. 

I'm so grateful for the memories this experience created for us. Even years later, we still talk about that moment and how it brings a smile to our faces. Laughter truly is the best medicine for all relationships.
