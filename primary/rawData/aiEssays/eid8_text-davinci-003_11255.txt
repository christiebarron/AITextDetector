I had never seen my grandma laugh so hard before. She and I were sitting on her front porch, watching people pass by on the sidewalk below. When a group of well-dressed older men came walking by, she suddenly leapt up and called out to them.

"Hey, you all look like you know each other!" she shouted. "You three walking like that, you must be leprechauns!" 

The men stopped and stared up at us for a moment. After a brief silence, one of them waved back and yelled, "No, but you must be magical, too!"

My grandma and I both burst into laughter. I couldn't remember the last time I'd seen her so genuinely amused. The men kept walking, smiling and waving goodbye.

That moment on the porch with my grandma was one of the happiest memories I have of her. Even after all these years, I still remember the joy I felt whenever she smiled and let loose her infectious laugh.
