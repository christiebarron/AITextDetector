I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a positive and reasonable thing to do. I see this as a good thing. It would mean that someone could not just print books out of their own hand and buy online, but that an entire country like Japan could also print books. People could choose and freely distribute their own content. There wouldn't be any way that they would be forced to give up their freedom to get one for free, and we would not see a third party censor a book. This is the wrong approach.

Kai: There are a lot of publishers that make books available online that could be read in the future. I think that this problem is in fact more about what publishers want to do. How could the government choose which books they will print and which book they wouldn't print in the future, or if they have to do something that is not what is expected or not important.

Will Siegel return in 2015?

Kai: Because he has given us our first hint as to whether Siegel could be back in 2015. Siegel is an academic. His research studies how the human body differs from other organs. He is an expert on the nervous system and how other organs have different functions and there are other aspects to the system that might be interesting to him.

Kai: We are planning on hearing more from Siegel so check out our podcast live on Vimeo. We are looking forward to hearing more.
