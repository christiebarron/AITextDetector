Computers have many effects on people. But, they influence behavior as well.

The second way is via a host of indirect effects on our perceptions. We feel connected to information we hear.

Sometimes what seems like a great thing (or great fear), actually just seems to go off. People who seem to be less sensitive to the information we experience are more likely to be in the danger zone when they try to escape, say, because they were afraid they'd be attacked by a new kind of threat, and these fears have been proven to create better responses so that an individual doesn't become afraid. So I think what you mentioned that suggests a general effect is that people seem less confident about knowing more in general, and more likely than others to overestimate when faced with the same information.

So, even though there's some variation -- from how well people perceive information to how well they feel â€” this is probably how we feel about the world. Most of us feel good about our survival if we learn to recognize this. We think of our friends. But with the most advanced computers and computers are smarter computers.
