Censorship in libraries has been a subject of debate for many years. Proponents of censorship believe that certain books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves of libraries if they are deemed offensive in any way. On the other hand, opponents of censorship argue that such works of creative expression should remain because they contain valuable information and lessons that we can all learn from. 

Personally, I believe in free expression and think that censorship should be kept to an absolute minimum in libraries. While individuals should be careful not to be exposed to offensive materials, these works can contain important messages and ideas, and some readers could gain greater insight about their own lives and values by reading them. As long as these materials are not used to further hatred or hurtful sentiments, they should be allowed to remain in libraries. 

Furthermore, prohibiting library users from viewing certain materials is a form of censorship in itself. Libraries offer compelling works of art and literature that reflect the human experience, and denying someone access to these works is losing the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of life. Not to mention, it goes against the core purpose of libraries--to provide knowledge and information without judgment. 

In conclusion, books, music, movies, and other materials that some may find offensive should not be censored from library shelves. Libraries are crucial institutions for knowledge, and prohibiting citizens from accessing certain materials is an unacceptable form of censorship in itself. Instead, libraries should keep all materials
