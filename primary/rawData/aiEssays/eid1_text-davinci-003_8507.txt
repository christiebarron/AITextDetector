From as early as I can remember, I was told to be patient. Everyone said I needed to cultivate this skill in order to get through the hard times of life, and I took it to heart. 

One of the toughest lessons in patience I've ever gotten was during a trip I took to the grocery store one day. I was already in a rush for being late to meet up with friends for lunch, but when I got up to the checkout, the cashier was having some technical difficulties with the register. He apologized multiple times, and I could tell he was feeling really embarrassed and frustrated. I could also tell he was trying his best to fix it quickly and get me on my way, but it didnâ€™t seem like we were any closer to moving.

I took a deep breath and tried to think of how best to help. Instead of getting angry, I stepped up and asked if there was anything I could do to help speed up the process. That simple gesture was enough to melt the tension in the air, and soon enough, the register was running as normal again.

My patience and willingness to help was rewarded as the cashier thanked me sincerely and even gave me a discount on my groceries as an apology for all the trouble. I was grateful for the lesson in patience and left the store much happier and calmer than how I had arrived.
