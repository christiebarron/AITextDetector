The Empire State Building was a groundbreaking architectural feat when it was completed in 1931. One of the most impressive features of the building was the 190-foot mooring mast, which allowed dirigibles to dock. Although the mooring mast was a revolutionary feature which could have revolutionised air travel, the builders faced numerous obstacles in making it a reality.

The most obvious obstacle was the sheer height of the Empire State Building. A typical airship of the time could reach an altitude of up to 5,000 feet, but the Empire State Building was over a thousand feet taller at 1,250 feet. This meant that it was far taller than most dirigibles could handle. Additionally, the prevailing winds would cause the airships to drift when they tried to dock, making them more difficult to anchor. To make matters worse, the mooring mast was located directly above the building's two-story observation deck, making it harder for manoeuvring. 

The builders of the Empire State Building also encountered difficulties in designing the mast. It had to be lightweight, strong and able to withstand wind, vibrations and moisture. To ensure it was able to hold the weight of a dirigible, it had to be constructed out of a combination of steel and rivets. The mast also had to provide the ropes for the dirigible to attach to and included a ‘docking hatch’ so that passengers and crew members could disembark without difficulty.
