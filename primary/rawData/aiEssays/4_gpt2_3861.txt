The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because most of the previous problems they encountered occurred within the context of the book's first few chapters. These problems had a relatively brief period from the introduction, as they were the one that was most likely to be fixed until the end of the novel, when he would get the very first major problem. The only solution the novel made was perhaps that the reader should actually be able to figure out the correct way to solve all of them, and because a book is so complex, it would require more than just one easy trick with a few exceptions. Unfortunately, Winter Hibiscus never reached this point and was eventually killed without any further solutions, which leaves the reader with only two key points. First, because he could not find a solution to this problem at all, he could either just take it for granted or use it as his own. The second point is that Winter Hibiscus was a clever little writer, who also put forth great technical ideas for writing that only him could find. As for his final point, and for my own amusement, the book closes with a rather silly idea that one of D&D's core mechanics revolves around "the idea" of magic. "If you're reading a campaign that has a character who can't actually cast their own ability, is it right to kill yourself?" that question was raised a couple of times, because by then the character's abilities would have already been known.
