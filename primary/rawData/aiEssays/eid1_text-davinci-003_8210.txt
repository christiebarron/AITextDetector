In 1930, the world’s tallest building to date, the Empire State Building, was constructed in New York City. Despite the ground-breaking feat of engineering, the building posed a unique challenge for the engineers: how to accommodate dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building. The idea of providing a safe place for dirigibles to dock was exciting as it signified the possibility for a new mode of transport and travel. However, this goal also brought several obstacles and issues to overcome in designing the building’s structure.

The first obstacle for the engineers of the Empire State Building was the strong winds that sweep the area around New York City. Since dirigibles have limited control over their speed and direction due to their size and weight, they are highly susceptible to wind conditions. To combat this challenge and ensure a successful liftoff and docking, the Empire State Building was erected with a tall, light mast at its center. This structure, also known as a mooring mast, is located 1,050 feet above the city, high enough to be safely immune to the winds and produce an even more secure platform for the dirigible.

The second obstacle faced by the engineers of the Empire State Building was the sheer size of the building. The long span of the building’s walls and towers presented a daunting structure to be navigated by the dirigible. The aircrafts needed some guidance to safely dock at the Empire State Building, and so
