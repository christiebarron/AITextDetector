I was late to my dentist appointment once and when I finally arrived, I knew I was in trouble. Immediately, the receptionist scolded me for being late and I apologized for my tardiness. She sternly asked me to take a seat and wait. I started to feel nervous, wondering how long I'd have to wait and if they would punish me for being late. 

However, a few moments later, one of the dental hygienists came out and asked me to come back into the office. She was very kind and said she was patient with me and would be able to get me in right away. I was so grateful for her understanding and patience. The dental hygenist was genuinely concerned for my well-being and made sure that I was comfortable throughout the entire dental visit. 

It was a pleasant experience and I am so thankful for the dental hygienist's kindness and patience that day.
