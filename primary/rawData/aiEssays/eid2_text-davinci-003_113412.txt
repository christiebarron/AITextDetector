The issue of censorship in libraries has long been a contentious one. It is the responsibility of librarians to provide resources to their patrons in a manner that is fair, honest, and free of bias. However, this responsibility is becoming increasingly difficult to fulfil, as the knowledge available to the public continues to expand and societal norms continue to evolve. 

The question of whether it is right to allow certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, to remain on library shelves if they are found to be offensive to some patrons is now being debated. The opposition to these materials often argues that to allow them to remain in the library could be seen as an endorsement of the material’s content. They propose that, by permitting the materials to remain, librarians are in fact condoning messages which may allow for damaging behaviour. 

However, this view fails to take into account the noble purpose of a library. Primarily, libraries are a source of information - one in which patrons have the right to access material free from judgement or restriction. Censoring these materials could be seen to limit the knowledge of the public and could potentially discourage librarians from engaging in robust dialogue and discourse, which is essential to the functioning of a healthy and informed society. Further, it could be argued that it is not up to librarians to play ‘censorship police’; rather, it is the responsibility of every patron to make informed decisions
