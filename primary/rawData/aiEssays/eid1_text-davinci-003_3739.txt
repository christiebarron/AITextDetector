Dear Editor,

I am writing today to discuss the effects computers have had on people's lives. Computers are ubiquitous in our modern world, and their effects on human existence are far-reaching and not to be underestimated.

First, computers have had a major impact on the way we work. They have allowed for the development of more efficient, faster, and smarter ways of accomplishing tasks. Businesses have been able to make more profits and offer better services due to the use of computers. Furthermore, they have allowed for increased automation and the possibility of remote working, resulting in more flexible schedules and furthering globalisation.

Moreover, computers have had a marked effect on the way we learn. The internet has allowed us to access a vast amount of information on any topic in mere seconds. This has broken down many barriers to learning, as you can now access knowledge from anywhere in the world for free.

Furthermore, computer technology has spurred innovation in several areas, ranging from travel to entertainment. From GPS to Netflix, computers have had a major role in improving our lives in countless ways.

Ultimately, while there are still areas that need to be improved concerning computer use, overall computers have had a positive effect on our lives. I urge the readers to keep this in mind, especially when considering the possibilities of computer usage and its implications for our future.

Thank you for considering my view.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
