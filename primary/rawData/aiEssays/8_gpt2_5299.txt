One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I looked at such an odd angle as I was standing there staring down or something. One time I had a big laugh because I was playing guitar with a bunch of kids. And I was going to throw it, and I saw it at the other end of the street Makes you laugh, it's funny Makes you laugh, you like the humor. I just feel that in the way and I love the laugh and I think that would have made me even more happy. The way that it goes is that it's kind of a funny story, you just laugh and think about it, then it turns into something else.
