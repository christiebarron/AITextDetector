Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have had on people in today’s society. Nowadays, computers are indispensable tools that have made everyone’s lives much simpler and more convenient. Despite the many advantages that computers bring, I believe that they have begun to have an adverse effect on people and I would like to urge your readers to consider these negative impacts.

It is no secret that computers have made our lives easier when working or studying, providing us with an array of tools and information. However, the excessive use of computers has caused people to become ever-more detached from the social environment around them. Relationships with other people have been replaced by interactions with a screen, and this detachment can manifest itself in loneliness, depression, anxiety, and even physical withdrawal.

Furthermore, the digital world has such an immense presence that it can cause people to become addicted. This addiction can lead to intense cravings and the need to constantly seek stimulation online, resulting in a complete disregard for traditional activities such as reading books, sports, and outdoor fun. 

In conclusion, I believe that the increasing use of computers may be more harmful than beneficial. Computers can be a great source of convenience, but it is important that people remember to keep their screen time in moderation and not let it come at the expense of forming meaningful connections with other humans. 

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
