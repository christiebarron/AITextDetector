Computers have many effects on people. I was in a small shop that used to have 3 or 4 different power supplies as machines. The power supply is connected to the internet using USB cable so we don't need 2.5-foot wires. The computer is connected to a small display and is designed to read from hard drive, memory card or flash storage. (In theReplyTo) http://www.mesh-computers.com/credits/mesh/credits.html
