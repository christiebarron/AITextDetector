One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I had been in the hospital crying after falling asleep early Friday morning. My eyes were in a red haze that was almost black out, and I could barely see my eyes. The pain child was sitting on my lap when she said, "Let me go." My sister had run downstairs to get back to me and I had just been there as well.

Then I was in intensive care again, in a wheelchair. I got home on the back of a stretcher to check on my leg, and at once I felt good. So, I started walking. I was sitting down near my couch, hoping it was really okay. At one point, I told myself, to the doctor, she's been trying to give me a couple of weeks, so I didn't want to do it anymore. That night, when I got home from the hospital, she was still on my lap, trying to calm me down. "Don't let her run. Don't go in there. Don't turn your back to her, just turn your back to her. Let her down. Don't move. Go in with her." I started running because the doctor was going to give it back her. She then told me that they had treated another parent with no problem during childhood. She also told me that my daughter was fine and it seemed she'll be fine at the beginning of the season, but it started to get worse.
