I was under a lot of stress. Everything that I had been planning for my birthday celebration was coming undone and it was the day before the big event. I was panicking and had a lot of decisions to make. My friend was patient with me and let me talk out my worries. She was by my side the whole day listening to my different ideas and opinions. She helped me to keep calm and to prioritize the most important tasks. Being patient and understanding, she never complained and encouraged me to take my time. Her calming presence was exactly what I needed and eventually, I was able to pull everything together and make my birthday celebration one to remember.
