The building of the Empire State Building was marred by obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Dirigibles are large airships filled with helium or other gas, and the thought of allowing them to dock raised many unique challenges for the implementers of the project. 

The largest obstacle in integrating dirigibles into the building-project was ensuring stability of the mooring of the dirigibles. An airship was designed to dock atop the Empire State Building, and was not expected to stay for any significant length of time. Therefore, a tangible system of securing its position was critically essential to the success of the project.

The creators of the Empire State Building considered construction of a “mooring mast” to place atop the building to secure the airships. This mast was to be comprised of a series of rings fixed around a steel base. Worker-installed cables were then to be woven into a net-like structure on which the mooring mast would dangle, and act as an anchor point for the dirigibles. 

The challenge arose in ensuring both the safety of the dirigible and of those present in the Empire State Building. With the significant size and potential fragility of the dirigibles, securing them in the steel rings seemed far too perilous. Additionally, the presence of the dirigibles and their weight posed a significant threat to the building and its inhabitants. After evaluating the pros and cons, the
