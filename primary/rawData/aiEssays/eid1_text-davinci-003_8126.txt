The Empire State Building was a major engineering feat of the 1930s and a popular landmark to this day. It was originally designed to accommodate dirigibles, but the obstacles builders faced in allowing them to dock proved too difficult at the time. 

The first obstacle to building a dock for dirigibles was the hight of the building. At 1,250 feet tall, the Empire State Building was the tallest building of its time. A dirigible would have to dock at a height almost twice the size of the airship, making it nearly impossible for it to enter the dock without hitting the side of the building. In fact, the airship Hindenburg which was the largest of its kind was only 792 feet long, making an ideal docking spot a virtual impossibility. 

The second obstacle was the strength of the winds. The Empire State Building was located in the heart of New York City and was exposed to strong winds and turbulence. This could create a safety hazard for a dirigible, as it was not designed to withstand such conditions. Additionally, the turbulence might make it difficult for the dirigible to maintain control and achieve a secure landing spot.

The third obstacle was structural stability. In order to create a dock for dirigibles, the builders of the Empire State Building would have to construct a large and durable mooring mast made out of steel. The mast would serve as the anchor point for the airship, but also put added strain on
