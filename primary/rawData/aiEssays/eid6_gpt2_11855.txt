The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

In 1905, they erected an extra floor for two cabins at the same time. The first cabins were built to accommodate a passenger's luggage in the back of the room. With more space for passengers, it would be possible to attach double bedsheets to a seat. By the 1920s, people found the additional room, in the back of the building, comfortable.

This was considered an ideal solution. However, in the 1940s and 1950s, many designers took this for granted. In 1951, the new room became the centerpiece of the Metropolitan Museum of Natural History in Washington. The room included an open-air bath, two chairs to offer more comfortable bedside areas, and a chair and table.

The two cabins were eventually demolished and replaced by a new, more rectangular room. The original interior was built of wood by hand on the site of a large brick building. This allowed modern space to be built on the site. In 1959, it was sold to the city of Los Angeles for $1.2 million.

More recently, designers, architects and engineers have developed a new approach to constructing a two-car garage. This will allow guests with both bed and desk to enjoy up to 20 to 30 minutes of room at the same time. The addition of a new "garage system" (the modern-luxury unit designed to reduce heat
