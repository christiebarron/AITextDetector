The cyclist is an anonymous athlete who is pushed to their limits by the conditions of the road on which they travel. The setting is described as a “parched, dry, lonely, barren terrain with only a few lonely trees clinging to life.” This description provides a sense of foreboding and isolates the cyclist from their friends and family. The lack of people and resources on the road make the task of completing the race more difficult for the cyclist.

The remote location also adds to the difficulty of the race. The cyclist is forced to battle the rough terrain and unpredictable weather alone, with no one to rely on for encouragement or help when they need it most.
