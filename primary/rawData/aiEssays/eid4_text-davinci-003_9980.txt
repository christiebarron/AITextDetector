The winter hibiscus is a symbol of hope in 9-year-old Zheh's life, representing her wish to return to school after being forced to work in the fields. The book ends with Zheh looking forward to taking her entrance exams again in the spring, when the cold winter ends and the hibiscus blooms. This captures both Zheh's new hope and determination and the coming of better conditions with the end of winter. Ultimately, the closing line of the book reflects Zheh's transformation from a voiceless, downtrodden worker, to a confident and hopeful young adult.
