I remember one time I was in a long line at the grocery store. It seemed like every person in the store was in the line. Even though I had been waiting forever and was really starting to get frustrated, I just stayed put and patiently waited my turn. I noticed one of the other customers start to fuss and complain about how long it was taking, but I just shrugged it off and didn't let it affect me. 

Eventually everybody made it through the line and I was free to go. I personally felt proud of the way I had handled my frustration throughout the process. Instead of complaining and letting my frustration boil over, I had chosen to be patient. It definitely paid off in the end!
