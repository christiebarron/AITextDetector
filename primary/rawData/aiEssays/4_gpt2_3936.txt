The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because of how well it treats the reader, how it makes you understand and relate to those characters, how it makes you see your favorite characters as you want them to be and how much it makes you look forward and concerned for those little girls in the snow, "snow-caked and gory for snow."

Hibiscus doesn't shy away from the fact that there do exist some serious female characters. On The Good Wolf, you can read this story about a beautiful little girl named "Owen," who's only in school when she discovers who her true love is. For some reason, the writer never stops trying to tell you something about him (I was reading in July about a girl named Rose that is still a bit of a mystery to me now but I found it funny when it came to seeing his story on the cover of a December edition of the same magazine). On The Last Night, Mary Shelley described the little girl, called "Bobby," who is a snowman, being a very beautiful ice skater. I got one copy of The Snowman that I had to give away because some people are more into Snowmen than Snowmen itself. I found it to be an incredibly interesting read meets Develop: A Story of Women and Children, which I'm really thrilled about.

You can also buy A Tale of a Snowman for $28 or $29.
