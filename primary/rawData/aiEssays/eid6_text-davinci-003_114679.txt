The building of the Empire State Building in 1931 was a significant moment in American engineering history, but its designers also recognized the potential to usher in a new era of travel to the building’s iconic towers: airship travel. Not only could passengers easily travel to the building via dirigible, but also the towers were tall enough to potentially allow dirigibles to dock at the top. Despite the appeal of this idea, the obstacles they faced in achieving this feat were numerous.

The first challenge was finding a suitable design for the building that could accommodate the airships. Too much weight on the top of the building could be dangerous, so the engineers had to find a way to evenly distribute the load between the two main towers. This dilemma prompted the engineers to install large steel beams between the two towers, which connected the four corners of each tower and provided a structural platform from which an airship could dock.

In addition, the engineers had to build a mooring mast that could securely anchor the dirigibles to the building. This was no small task as the mooring mast would have to be strong—strong enough to withstand the airship’s fluctuating weight and wind gusts. Initially, the engineers vainly tested various materials, including wire rope and timber, but eventually settled on large steel cables that offered increased strength and stability.

Further, the engineers had to consider the logistics of airship travel, such as the need for air
