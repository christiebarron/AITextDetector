I was out to dinner with my date and things were going great. We were laughing and enjoying each other’s company. Suddenly, my date started talking about a funny story from their childhood. I was in fits of laughter at the story. Before I knew it, the waiter was standing at our table and gave us a knowing smile as if to say, “I can tell you two are getting along just fine.” We both looked at each other and shared a knowing look that was made even more special by our shared laughter. That moment was a true testament to how laughter can connect two people in a way that nothing else can.
