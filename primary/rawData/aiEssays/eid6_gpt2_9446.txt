The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. On the other hand, the use of a crane was the next obvious impediment to their ability to dock the elevator.

In 1795, the British parliament prohibited the use of such an airplane if it proved unstable and unstable had not been repaired by a mechanic.

Even so, the concept of a dirigible continued to play an essential role in the architecture and design of New York's Federal Buildings.

In November 1917, the Federal Building Museum, in collaboration with the New York City Railway Museum, issued a dirigible brochure called "The Empire State Building" titled "The New Transportation Museum." This brochure contained all four elements of New York's original Department of Transportation, including the air traffic control system. [1]

In April of 1918, a new version of the Building was constructed. With the exception of the pilot's manual, the dirigible provided "an orderly air traffic controller."

These efforts eventually collapsed and the building was closed to the public. In 2009, it was purchased by New York City's Board of Building Commissioners.
