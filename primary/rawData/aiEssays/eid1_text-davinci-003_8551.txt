There I was, stuck in a major traffic jam with minutes ticking by until my appointment. Not only did I also have to pick up my daughter from school soon, but I was becoming increasingly anxious that I might be late. I had to take a few deep breaths to keep my cool, and that is when I suddenly remembered that I had the power of patience in my hands.

So, I reminded myself to take it one moment at a time and to relax into the situation. I did not feel the need to rush, or to become agitated. Instead, I thought of it as an opportunity to take the long way and enjoy the scenery instead.

As I made my way through the gridlock, I kept a positive attitude by staying in the present moment. I tried to focus on the good things I could appreciate during the traffic, like the music I had in my car or the beautiful views.

Eventually, I was able to make it to my appointment one minute before my scheduled time. I felt grateful to have had the patience to make it through safely and enjoy the journey along the way.
