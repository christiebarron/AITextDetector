As a community member and avid reader, I firmly believe that libraries should not practice censorship of any materials – books, music, movies, and magazines – regardless of how offensive some may find them. Censoring library materials can have far-reaching consequences that inhibit the free flow of ideas, limit access to vital information, and unjustly silence certain voices. 

In the digital age, the traditional role of the library as an open access to books and other materials is increasingly important. It is our duty to protect the resources libraries have to offer and actively oppose any attempts at censorship. Allowing offensive materials in the library maintains the integrity of the institution and ensures that as many ideas as possible are available for consideration. If libraries begin to censor certain materials, this “space for exploration” could become closed-minded and exclusive.

Moreover, censorship can lead to the mislabeling of certain books or materials, which may result in people avoiding the library altogether. Censorship also denies access to vital information. For example, information on LGBTQ+ issues can be particularly valuable to young people who may not otherwise know they are not alone. When libraries reject materials that deal with topics such as these, they are actively underlying messages of intolerance and discrimination. 

Rather than censoring potentially offensive materials, libraries should provide resources that promote critical discourse and offer methods for processing difficult material. People of all ages should be welcomed into a safe and enriching environment that presents diverse ideas
