The memoir "From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives" by Narciso Rodriguez is a powerful piece of writing that captures the nostalgic and reflective mood of reflecting on one's past and dearly held memories. 

Throughout the memoir, Rodriguez recounts his time growing up in his home in the Lower East Side of New York City. He remembers it being a vibrant, kind place, where the streets teemed with life and his family was happy and close-knit. Rodriguez builds an atmosphere of childhood innocence and fondness for the past that is so evocative that it resonates with readers from all backgrounds. This nostalgia is underscored with details about the colors of the walls in his home or the smell of his grandmother's tamales cooking in the kitchen which transport the reader to an earlier time in Rodriguez' life.

The memoir also serves to demonstrate Rodriguez's appreciation of the culture and diversity of his home city. He writes about the bustling street life and the various languages he hears spoken which he interprets as a sign of the many cultures coexisting peacefully and happily in his home. This gives the memoir a sense of optimism and peace, a strong contrast to the difficult and uncertain times we are living in today.
