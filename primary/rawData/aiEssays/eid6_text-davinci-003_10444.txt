The perhaps most astounding accomplishment of the builders of the Empire State Building was their attempt to make it a structure that dirigible airships could dock onto. Despite the odds, the original builders had a mighty sight in mind, and though their plans did come to fruition, they faced a number of challenges along the way.

First of all, the plans as they were initially laid out would require numerous modifications and adjustments to make them feasible for the docking of a dirigible airship. As Marcia Amidon Lusted notes is her book, The Mooring Mast: Technologies of the Sky, “In order to dock the airship onto the mooring mast, a group of architects, engineers, and navigators had to create a powerful edge grip” with “a frame around the perimeter of the airship that [was] strong enough to not be affected by wind or other weather conditions.” This task was formidable and an intricate set of calculations and much consultation was required with a team of aviation experts.

In addition, safety considerations posed their own set of problems. A crucial sketch of the plans would have to be approved by the Department of Commerce and the Army Air Corps in order for the final plans to be approved, and their own assessments would have to address certain safety concerns. For instance, adequate response teams for rescue would have to be on call, and the construction of the mooring mast, itself, would have to be able to sustain
