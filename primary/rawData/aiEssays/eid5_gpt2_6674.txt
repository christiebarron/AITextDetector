The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is a sad reflection. It is a story of an escape from life in the face of unimaginable danger, surrounded by love and acceptance by others.

And then there is the death of her mother.

For most of us, her story was the final straw for a friend who knew her, but he had learned there was no other life from which to express his grief. "It was a time of the loss of her, not her life, she was in love with everything, she was alive with everyone," he said.awa

And then it was our turn. In her memoir, 'From Home' she talks of having a miscarriage, losing a child she loved, and living with the same boyfriend who was one day her "counselors". This is not what she told us in the interview.

"When I say it was my last, I meant my last," she recounts how her relationship with her man, Bill, began as a joke at school, but she says that that joke ended with the relationship.

And so he made us write what the next year would see in the book, and with it the emotional life she would live again.

After the book, we sat down and began brainstorming, we brainstormed the relationship in detail, of course it would have to be such a huge emotional blow to him that even he didn't even realise what it must be like
