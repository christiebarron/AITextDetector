Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. Firstly, it makes cycling smoother because they give the cyclist more of the choice with which road is in your path. Secondly, it's easier to go for fast and easy rides with shorter distance and shorter ridership. By making your road more roundly, more scenic and toasty, we can get the cycling community riding smoother.

In summary, this setting will give you a smoother but more comfortable walking journey with less traffic, no more awkward stops and fewer crashes. It will make your cycling experience more "natural":

This is particularly important in New Zealand because, as I mentioned before, a lot of the cycling behaviours we have today are more behaviouralised than we used to think they'd be. And while many people may believe that they feel much better walking in a certain way because they can cycle with minimal traffic, that's hardly the case. Our research shows that cycling has a very positive impact on our physical health, and with just one thing in mind, it would be a great way to help people become more bike conscious (or more confident, depending on your state of awareness and training).
