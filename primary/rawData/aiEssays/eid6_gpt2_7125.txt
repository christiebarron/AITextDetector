The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One was a lack of permits for both commercial and small scale building projects. The National Mall was one of the last public spaces that permitted dirigibles. In 1955, only 12,000 dirigibles were officially allowed in the National Mall.

Another obstacle was the large number of parking spaces created by federal park construction agencies in the 1920s and 30s. The Federal Aviation Commission authorized the use of dirigibles to hold public safety classes along with local transportation, but in 1964, the FAA denied parking permits for both commercial and small scale projects because of concerns of environmental or safety implications. In 1985, FAA Administrator Robert G. Knaak of the FAA issued a memo stating that the safety of a public place depends mainly on the place's safety.

Finally, the FAA was also under pressure from the Church of Christ in New York before the 1960s to create a dirigibles and create a National Park. The Church refused to meet with the FAA on the issue, and the government of the National Park was under pressure to build dirigibles, because not only was it a sacred site, but also because it was associated with the creation of a new state religion. The Church and the government were so upset by this situation that they created a national memorial dedicated to this issue. Since 1964, no dirigibles were required for public safety activities in the United States.
