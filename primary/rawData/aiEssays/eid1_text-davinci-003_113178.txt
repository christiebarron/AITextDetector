Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my opinion on the effects computers have on people. As a lifelong user of computers, I strongly believe that computers are not a completely negative influence. In fact, there are many positive effects computers have had on our lives.

The first and most obvious benefit of computers is convenience. With the help of computers, we can access important information, conduct research, shop, and communicate quickly and efficiently. We can save time and money by avoiding trips to libraries and stores. Additionally, computers are often used for entertainment purposes, like video games, surfing the web, streaming movies, and creating art.

The second major benefit of computers is education. Computers provide access to a wealth of educational content, including online classrooms, video and audio lectures, educational software, and research tools. The use of computers can make learning more interesting and effective, and can open up opportunities for people who need educational materials that may not be available in their area.

Finally, computers can be a source of emotional support for people. People can turn to computers for comfort in difficult times, for friendship, or simply for companionship. The internet acts as an invaluable tool for connecting with like-minded people and forming relationships that may last a lifetime.

For all these reasons, I believe computers are not only a beneficial presence in our lives, but in some cases a necessary one. I urge anyone reading this to recognize the positive effects computers have had
