The line reflects Minfong Ho's struggle with her identity. In the poem, she explores her immigrant identity as someone who not only resides in an unfamiliar land, but also misses aspects of her home country. The winter hibiscus symbolizes this struggle between the two cultures, but more specifically, it gives her a sense of hope that she can still find a place somewhere in between. The last line of the poem signifies the renewal of hope that she can find this balance again come springtime. Against the backdrop of the two cultures continually clashing, taking the test again would be a physical manifestation of that hope.
