Computers have many effects on people. First of all, computers are less efficient if they have to learn new things. It would be nice if they had a faster computer, but we couldn't change it to be that for every new thing we learn, we also have to learn new things. It would seem at this point that the power of computers to make the most sense of an environment is that they produce changes that are, eventually, very noticeable in the human experience. As far as how we interact with these changes is concerned, I think that we should think about whether we are learning new skills in ways that affect the way our brains deal with them. When you look at the behavior of your brain, you can see how it can influence behavior by controlling one cognitive process at a time, creating cognitive biases. So you might ask, "How can we make this behavior more difficult (to learn)? Well, we can. But there are lots of experiments that show that doing this in the lab can actually improve the brain, it's quite interesting." So I have more ideas on how to deal with some of these issues, but I don't know of some of these other papers which seem to focus on how to fix how we interact with social cognition. We have this book and one last one out and that one is called Cognitive Behavioral Effects and I think it's called Cognitive Behavior Therapy that this gentleman made for me. He's done a couple in this book where he claims that we cannot eliminate
