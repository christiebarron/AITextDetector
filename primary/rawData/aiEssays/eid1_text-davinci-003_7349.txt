In the story, “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, the protagonist is a cyclist who is on a long journey and takes a break near a small roadside restaurant. The features of the setting play into the cyclist’s experience. 

The cyclist finds the restaurant to be “old and mellow” and “cozy”, which indicates that it is an inviting and comfortable environment. The fact that the restaurant is old provides the cyclist with a feeling of warmth and nostalgia, which helps to relax the cyclist. At the same time, because the restaurant is so far away from the city, the cyclist is also aware that there are no nearby facilities which could provide help or support if something bad were to happen. This further causes the cyclist to relax as he is not constantly worrying about any possible risks that may occur on his journey. 

The warm weather outside and the sun setting provide the cyclist with a sense of tranquility and comfort. The warmth further enhances the feeling of safety that the cyclist experiences, therefore allowing the cyclist to relax and reflect on his journey. The setting and its features thus create a sense of comfort, safety, and privacy for the cyclist that aids in his reflection.
