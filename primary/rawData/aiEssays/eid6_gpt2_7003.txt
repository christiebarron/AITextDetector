The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Because of the space restrictions, the builders must build each of the eight floors in the building on their own, rather than with the contractors. Some of the tower's eight stories were occupied by private residencesâ€”or they were converted into a public building.

A year after building the Empire State Building, the owners tried to remove the ceiling of the lobby at Eighth Avenue and Sixth Street. But they refused to build them. A week after an outside group asked the builders what they could do with the lobby area, the builder responded: they could use the entire space on their own, except for "the private residence, which is in the basement." The owners used what they called "an unconventional design approach."

The builders eventually had the lobby removed. But they have not been able to remove the entire building this century, and that can change in the future. This article explores different ways that the designers have addressed the problem of the ceiling. (This is the second post by the author.) A number of other architectural concepts were mentioned. And, since the Empire State Building's interior may not be in the most optimal condition from a building's exterior, one could argue that a more aesthetically pleasing interior would have better room for business and public engagement. However much our minds may have been led, it's clear that there still remains room for innovation.
