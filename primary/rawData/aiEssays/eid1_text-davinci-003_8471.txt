I recently accompanied a friend to a crowded shopping mall to help her find a birthday present for her daughter. After several unsuccessful attempts to get into the boutique store we wanted to visit, we realized that it was too crowded and decided to go to another store. Although my friend was becoming increasingly frustrated by the crowds, she remained patient and tried to stay positive. 

We eventually found what we were looking for and the birthday present was a hit with her daughter. I was really impressed by my friend's patienceâ€”she could have easily given up when we found it too crowded, but she remained calm and persistent. Her patience paid off in the end.
