In Joe Kurmaski's story, "Rough Road Ahead," the cyclist is presented with a challenge unlike anything they have faced before. The setting of the story is key in helping to explain what makes it so difficult for the cyclist, as the features of their environment play an important role in determining their success or failure.

The first significant feature of the setting is the terrain the cyclist must traverse. The path is covered in both "debris strewn across the winding road" and "deep rutted surfaces," making it extremely difficult for the cyclist to maneuver through safely and securely. Combined with the "rough, rocky path" that the cyclist must traverse, these features can cause major issues for the cyclist in the form of weak tires, worn brakes, and inadequate gears. All of these make for a challenging ride for the cyclist, requiring them to carefully monitor their wheels and their progress.

The next significant setting feature is the weather. On this particular journey, the cyclist is faced with icy rains and strong winds, making it even more difficult and dangerous to traverse the winding path. The icy rains can cause slippery roads, making it easy to lose control of the bike, while the winds can cause the cyclist's balance to be off as well as cause a weakened grip on the handlebars.

Finally, the darkness of the setting adds an extra layer of difficulty to the cyclist's challenge. Without the ability to see properly, the cyclist must rely on their senses
