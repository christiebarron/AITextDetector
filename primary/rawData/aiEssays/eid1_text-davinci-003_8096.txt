The Empire State Building was built between 1929 and 1931 by the architectural firm Shreve, Lamb & Harmon. The Empire State Building is known for its iconic art deco design and its observation deck and was the first building to have a mooring mast added to the top of it in order to accommodate airships, or dirigibles. However, the process of building such a mooring mast was not without its challenges. This essay will discuss the major obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock.

The first challenge that had to be addressed was the potential for damage to the building. Since the mast had to be built on the top of the unfinished building, it posed a safety concern to workers who had to reach such a high point on the building. To address this, a pair of steel cables were strung along the sides of the building to help by providing additional support and structure for the future mooring mast. This allowed workers to safely ascend to the mooring mast location without fear of there being structural failure due to the buildingâ€™s unfinished shell.

The second obstacle to building the mooring mast was the daunting task of actually securing the dirigibles to it. It had to be able to withstand the tremendous force exerted on it by the tugboats bringing the dirigibles in, as well as the heavier gusts of wind that could occur at that altitude. To address this, the
