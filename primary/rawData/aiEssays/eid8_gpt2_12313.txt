One time I experienced laughter in my life was when we are on that long trip to the moon and I saw how big the moon was, I feel like this is just one of many things I did that day. Then, on the 21st of August, 2015 was when the planet did fall! No one thought it would happen because it's not only over, but it already has fallen and it's been very hard to get there."

Lily's mom shared in her message that there is still much work to do, but has continued the journey on the moon. Lacey has gone to college and is currently working as a construction worker.
