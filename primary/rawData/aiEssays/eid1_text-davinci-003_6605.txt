Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my opinion on the effects computers have had both positively and negatively on our society. While technology has been beneficial in many ways, limited computer literacy and overuse of computers have become a cause for concern. 

On the positive side, computers have changed the way our society functions, allowing for easier access to information, enhanced communication abilities, improved security, and otherwise impressive leaps in efficiency. We have become increasingly dependent on computer use in various industries, from tracking cargo shipments at ports to helping medical professionals diagnose diseases. Computers have made our lives easier when used appropriately.

However, limited computer literacy and overuse of computers pose serious challenges. Many people, especially youth, are not properly prepared to properly use computers the right way. This can lead to addiction, decreased physical health, and reduced social skills. Furthermore, instead of encouraging people to think critically, computers have become a means to a short cut scheme. This undermines the ability to think independently and has become a barrier to learning. 

In my opinion, computers have been a double-edged sword. On one hand, they have enabled us to do incredible things; at the same time, they have posed a danger that must not be ignored. We should make sure we use computers to enhance our lives but not be controlled by them. By being aware and actively engaging in responsible computer use we can gain the full benefits of this technology.

Sincerely,
