I remember a time when my friend's car broke down on the side of the road. We were in the middle of a long journey and had been on the road for what felt like hours. The car wasn't going to start and it was getting late. I could tell my friend was getting frustrated. But instead of complaining, I stayed patient and calm. 

I put my technical skills to use and called the tow truck, then I found a nearby motel for us to stay in until the car was fixed. Throughout the entire process, my friend remained patient and optimistic despite the inconvenience. 

In the end, the car was fixed the next day and we were back on the road again. It was a good reminder that it pays to be patient, no matter how difficult the situation may seem.
