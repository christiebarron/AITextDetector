I wanted to do something to help the kids who did not know anybody to go and do something to help them to be in a safer place where everybody knows them and understand them, which they did not before. But when they decided they needed that space to be there on Thursday night, we were going to have to come up with ideas and to tell them where to go and where we should go.

And she kept doing, all of a sudden, "Your mother could have been at fault because I felt like she wasn't doing something right. Her husband was out on bail!"
