The ending of the poem serves to emphasize the theme of learning and growth. The poem is about a young girl from Thailand who moves to America and has to take a test that she is not quite ready for. The speaker in the poem is asking the hibiscus flower to help them prepare for the test and to remind them that they have grown and learned a lot since then. By ending with the thought that they will be ready to take the test again in the spring when the hibiscus blooms, it serves as a reminder that growth and learning take time, but that they can eventually succeed.
