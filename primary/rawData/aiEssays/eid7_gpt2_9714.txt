An example of a time someone in my life was patient was for two years at the age of 17.

He was a young boy from the neighbourhood or in the village who did not have income or resources. He needed money for a family of four, not for his own. He went on to learn English and did business, worked in the fields, lived in apartments, had a wife and kids, etc.
