Dear Editor: 

In our ever-advancing technological world, computers have become an essential part of our lives. They have opened up new doors to limitless opportunities and have empowered us to find solutions to pressing  problems with unprecedented speed. However, some are concerned with the effects that computers have on our lives and whether the overall effect is a net positive or negative one. 

Personally, I believe that computers have had overwhelmingly positive effects on individuals and society in general. In particular, Iâ€™d like to draw attention to the educational gains that computers have provided. Digital resources have vastly improved the learning experiences of students all around the world, as resources are more easily accessible and the amount of time taken to research particular topics has decreased substantially. Furthermore, computers provide opportunities for people to learn new skills, such as coding and web development, that can give them an edge in their career paths. 

Perhaps more importantly, the internet allows us to have easy access to information that may previously have been hard to find or confined to small circles of individuals. Now, people from all walks of life can access a wealth of knowledge and use it to inform their beliefs, understand their unique situations better, and make more informed decisions
