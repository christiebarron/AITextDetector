The ending is meant to be symbolic of the protagonist's determination to keep fighting and trying despite the odds against her. The hibiscus flower, which is strongly associated with the character, serves as a metaphor for her resilience and courage as she faces her struggles. The imagery of the melting snow and the returning geese represents a new start, a fresh hope, and the promise of a brighter future. The test mentioned at the end is a representation of all the obstacles the protagonist has faced, which she will be ready to tackle again when the spring returns. The concluding lines remind the reader of the protagonist's hard-earned optimism and her commitment to never give up.
