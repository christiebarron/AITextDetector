Dear Editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have had an on people. Technology advancement has caused a significant shift in the way we live over the last two decades. Increasingly, technology has been integrated into every aspect of our lives, and one of the most powerful inventions is the computer. In my experience, computers have both positive and negative effects on people.

I believe computers are a great tool for learning and expanding knowledge. With computers, gaining access to information is incredibly easy. Thanks to the Internet, people can easily research a vast array of topics, enhancing their educational opportunities and furthering their understanding of the world around them. 

On the other hand, computers can be an unhealthy distraction. Many people spend hours a day on their devices, leading to a sedentary lifestyle. Furthermore, the majority of the available online content can be highly addictive. This can lead to physical and psychological health issues.

In conclusion, computers have vastly changed the way we approach education. However, it is important to remember that the situations surrounding their use can result in either a healthy or an unhealthy outcome. As with any other tool, we must exercise moderation and willpower with our use of computers.

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
