The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is refreshing.

What would your father's life be like?

My commodities.

What do you think I could change from one day to another?

I need to do something different. Not my current position or position that one thinks I need to do.

You're from Pakistan. What do you think of Afghanistan?

I don't look for people who are in touch with the country's history.

You've seen a lot of action in the world. What are the things you could do to help this change?

Look at everything that I am doing to make this moment better for my friends and support.

If you could only make 100 calls to the people of Afghanistan, how would you go about it? In 10 months? Can you do that?

Why are we so afraid? I cannot say how I would handle this right now.

I have a dream as a student. I think there are very much beautiful girls from my school, my school in Pakistan. They are always there looking for a beautiful face.

Who do you play with now? Do you play piano?

I am playing the 'Kom Kalei', a classical piano played by people who are also students

Where do you go to school? Do you live near schools and do you go to home schools?

I do go to home schools.
