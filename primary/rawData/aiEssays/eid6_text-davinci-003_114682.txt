The Empire State Building, a 102-story skyscraper in Manhattan, was the result of a complex and ambitious building project, but one of the most interesting challenges it faced was the plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the very top. The idea of providing a mooring mast for airships was the brainchild of the Empire State Building’s architect, William F. Lamb, and his team. In order to make it a reality, they faced a number of obstacles.

The first obstacle was the practicality of the project. With the building set to be completed by April 1, 1931, there was little time remaining to design and construct a mooring mast that would be capable of handling the docking maneuvers of dirigibles. The structure would need to extend as high as the 102nd floor of the building, and be able to withstand the lashing winds and stresses of the 85-foot airships. In addition, there were other technical issues to consider, such as the airship’s ability to maneuver around the mast and locate its mooring rings.

The second obstacle was the risk of the project. While the idea of providing a docking site for dirigibles seemed exciting, the potential for disaster was a real concern. If the mast was not designed properly, the airships would not be able to dock and may even crash into the building itself. This could not only put the lives of those on board the dirig
