Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. The first of many, it involves running up a short path, a high hill, a short stretch in the middle, and then, just like any other cycling event, running up a long hill if you are lucky. The second time around, it involves running up a long mountain in the centre of the road. And the third time around, or even the fourth, a long run and you've got some very challenging sections of the road.

And what about those things called'short straightaways for long journeys'? You've got to understand the concept, and your ability to track a number in quick succession. That's easy, right? But you have to make that adjustment to how your racing style is designed, and the setting, and your ability to track this type of distance out of the open.

Another idea is that you've got to think about the way you move out of the gap and into an open road. Some of the road that you're on, you could also want to go up another short straightaway, or to a small distance, or there, to go with the race, or to an overpass or to a very small distance, to make sure you're safe from potential collisions. That's a bit harder.

And, as a bonus, perhaps this was one of those 'how do we run longer on an open road on Short Road Ahead'?
