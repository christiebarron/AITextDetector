The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. When, in 1956, they were building part of a new subway station at the Central Station of the New York City Metro's Grand Central Station, which was supposed to accommodate the height limit of the original bridge, the planners were faced with mounting a 2 1/2-foot or 3 1/2-foot tall tower, one of which would have been too large, and one that wouldn't have made a difference. On October 5, 1956, the building's contractor, Construction Control and Maintenance Corp., decided to build a 2 1/2-foot-tall building to house all the tower elements. They had no idea what to do, and there really was no way to design the building: the engineers had to find some way to fit the tower to the structure. The company proposed the tower's height above ground level and use concrete for two, if not three, feet below ground level, a figure that would have been impossible on the ground. They also proposed to attach a 6,000-pound weight bearing to the structure in order to achieve a better-positioned location on the tower: The weight of concrete would cause the tower to shift so that the structure's floor would shift more often compared to the ground. These proposed solutions were eventually abandoned because of lack of engineering and political resolve, but the final tallies were nonetheless adopted in 1956. The 6,000-pound weight bearing was designed
