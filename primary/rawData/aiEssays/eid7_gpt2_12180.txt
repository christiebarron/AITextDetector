An example of a time someone in my life was patient was once I was having an illness and one day the doctors asked me what I was doing.

"You just go on to take medicine and you start feeling sick. You get scared, you do anything to die at that moment. I was so scared when my daughter died. My husband's daughter was with him, and I would come home, and my husband, he would do anything he could to give his daughter the life she needed."

She explains how she first met Dr Sivaji at the beginning of the hospital project.

"Well when we came into the hospital the first day I saw him, it was unbelievable. He was the first one to start working when we could not open our door, and then the rest is history."

He has worked with other providers including Dr Arun Kumar Mallya, Sita Gupta and Dr Chaudhary Bhatkar, but says more will come as people start to realise that the NHS is really just a hospital.
