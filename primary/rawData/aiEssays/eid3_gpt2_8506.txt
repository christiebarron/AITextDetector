Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. For example, a rider who is under 100% in the saddle may have difficulty going downhill, whereas the majority of cyclists still can handle most rides with a minimum of effort.

There are a couple of things to keep in mind when picking an ROW setting:

It's easier to follow the speed of the vehicle at slower speeds such as a walk. If your vehicle is slow and if you can make short straight turns you should avoid bumping into the parked car. It also affects visibility, so make sure your tyres are strong and fast. Be sure no one can see you and to avoid being in the way of pedestrians, make sure you are able to see other road traffic. ROWs give no indication that you have reached the end of the ramp. If the end of a ramp is marked by a tree, then the start of the ramp won't be marked. It is recommended that you go up each ramp by about 10th or 17th from where you are on the ramp, rather than by simply riding around by the side of the ramp. ROWs are the safest option and should probably never be avoided at all. Most riders will find that the end of the ramp is marked by a tree and there is no way they can find you there.
