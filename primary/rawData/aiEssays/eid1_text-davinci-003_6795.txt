Dear Editor, 

As technology constantly advances, so does our reliance on computers, and with the ever-growing impact of computers on people's lives, I would like to state my opinion on the topic. 

While computers can be extremely useful, it is my belief that they are having an overwhelmingly negative effect. Computers are used to decrease the effort of tasks, but this has caused people to become dependent on them. People are increasingly becoming incapable of making decisions or solving even the simplest of problems without turning to their devices for assistance. Furthermore, people are often so absorbed in their devices that they lose a sense of the physical world and fail to interact with each other, creating a digital disconnect amongst society. 

These issues are further compounded in children, who are spending more and more time using their electronic devices in infancy and through adulthood, resulting in stunted emotional growth and development. We should all be paying more attention to the use of technology on our children and encourage a balance of meaningful and interactive pastimes.

Therefore, it is my belief that we should be aware of the consequences of using computers and work to limit our dependence on devices. Computers can enhance our lives, but only if used in an appropriate and healthy manner. 

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
