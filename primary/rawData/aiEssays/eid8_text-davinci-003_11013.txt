I grew up with an older brother who wasn't the most responsible person. He loved playing pranks on people and always got into trouble. Whenever I got the chance, I tried to get back at him.

One day, when things were particularly tense at home, I decided to take a little revenge. I had learned that my brother loved to take long, hot showers, so I decided to sneak up on him while he was in the shower and turn it to cold. I figured it was the perfect prank.

But when I opened the door to the bathroom, I was surprised to find my brother standing in the shower laughing. It turned out he had figured out my plan and was ready for me! We ended up laughing together for what felt like hours, my prank utterly foiled. 

That day, we established an even better bond, one built on laughter. He knew that I understood his sense of humor, and I felt like I had finally been accepted. From that moment on, laughter became the thing that connected us, no matter what else seemed to go wrong. With laughter, we had much more understanding for each other.
