Computers have many effects on people. As the brain becomes more specialized in recognizing complex visual information, the effects of its interactions change. Those relationships with other functions of the brain begin to become more real. There's little hope that any of those processes can be taken into account as the technology of artificial intelligence reaches its limits over time.

A study of brain chemistry by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health found that computer vision has more serious problems than many people realize. The paper concludes that brain-computer interfaces are the single most important aspect of human vision. And that means it needs new technologies to improve the speed of human vision, according to the paper.
