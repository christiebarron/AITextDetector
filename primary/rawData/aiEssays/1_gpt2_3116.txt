Computers have many effects on people. The biggest thing that comes to mind is that, if a person has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, a family or friends might ask if you know about them, but unfortunately you can't keep track of them and even then that can get a family member who has it diagnosed.

What could possibly be causing a family member whose family has bipolar disorder to take advantage of treatment? A bipolar disorder diagnosis is quite unique, we think â€“ you need to be able to establish a history of what is causing the symptoms of the disorder. It's even possible for someone who has a diagnosis of bipolar disorder to be diagnosed with depression, anxiety, etc., which is something very rare for people with bipolar disorder from the time they have bipolar disorder until Angus Campbell came along. He did these assessments and he had a very easy time dealing with the symptoms and what may have been contributing to his bipolar disorder in the first place.

Can I support my family through diagnosis?

Of course. In my case, yes. The problem for anyone should be that they are aware of the fact that their family members may have bipolar disorder. But, that goes without saying, because, you can't control their behaviour, they need to know that they need to have treatment. However, that's a different problem for me. I really, really do need a family with bipolar disorder to be fully supported, without that stigma so I can help them feel comfortable.
