In “Rough Road Ahead,” Joe Kurmaski’s protagonist is a cyclist that is about to tackle a difficult mountain pass. The setting of the story affects the cyclist in a number of ways.

The fact that the protagonist is about to ascend a mountain pass is the primary challenge that they will face. As the story progresses, the cyclist is met with increasingly difficult terrain that will test their physical and mental endurance. For example, the steep grade of the incline will slow the cyclist down and make it harder for them to ascend without having to stop and catch their breath. In addition, because of the incline, the cyclist will be forced to use more energy and exert greater effort.

The overall atmosphere of the setting also serves to heighten the cyclist's senses and feelings. The lonely and isolated road, coupled with the silence and the sense of stillness of the landscape, create an air of mystery and suspense. This atmosphere adds to the protagonist's sense of anxiety and uncertainty as the setting helps to further the suspense of what could be waiting for them at the top of the pass.

Finally, the beauty and grandeur of the landscape further motivate and inspire the cyclist to continue on their journey despite the hardship. From the mist- shrouded trees to the snow-topped mountaintops, the setting helps create a sense of awe that further fuels the cyclist's ambition to conquer the obstacles ahead.
