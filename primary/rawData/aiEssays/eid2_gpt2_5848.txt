I believe that censorship of materials in libraries serves two functions. In one way, in one sense, those who use library content are not merely making up the rest, but, rather, giving it a voice that is independent of what society says is being said, and that voice is often a source of self-censorship. In the other way, the person who uses library content seems concerned that those who are not using it may see themselves as having come under attack.

One of these functions can be expressed in the following way: that of the reader. A reader comes to your website as a member of a group. You may respond by commenting for your community. This is a form of self-censorship. But one should remember that there is one fundamental difference between authoring a blog and sending out threats that you feel should be posted. When a person receives threats, they may respond with a "I'm a troll, don't publish that stuff," and they do not have the right to censor that response. A new post on a previous post might take place in a different context, but that may well have been the response to your post. It does not necessarily mean that your community is being attacked. Rather, they may be using a very different tactic.

The reader may have given themselves this opportunity to create new voices, and that is fine. I have always thought of readers as a sort of community in which every word you wrote was something that was being read,
