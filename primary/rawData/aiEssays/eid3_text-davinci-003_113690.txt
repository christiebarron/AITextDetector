 

In Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead,” the cyclist is faced with a challenging path that is made both difficult and dangerous due to the features of the setting. The cyclist is faced with a steep, rocky and uneven terrain that is full of obstacles, such as trees, rocks and creeks, which slow the cyclist’s progress. This rough terrain makes the journey more strenuous and requires the cyclist to use all his energy, agility and skill to make it to the top. The constant shifting of the terrain also frequently causes the cyclist to lose his balance and skid off the path. The coastal setting further complicates the situation as there are strong gusts of wind coming from the ocean that threaten to blow the cyclist off balance and off his bike. The strong and relentless winds are both an obstacle and a hazard to the cyclist as he has to struggle against it while also being careful not to lose his grip on the handlebars. The heavy rainfall and frequent thunderstorms add to the danger for the cyclist. The moisture makes the path muddy and the slippery stones even more dangerous. The cyclist is further challenged by poor visibility due to fog as well as darkness.
