The building of the Empire State Building is one of the most iconic pieces of architecture in the world. Not only was the Empire State Building a great feat of engineering and design, but it was also the first building ever designed with the intent of allowing dirigibles to dock. This was a daunting challenge to the architects and builders of the New York City landmark, as obstacles such as weather, safety, and budget were complicating factors to their successful endeavor. 

The first obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in their effort to design an airship docking station was the weather. New York City's striking weather is known for its drastic changes, which could be dangerous for both the building and the airship when in flight. To this end, builders had to ensure that the airship mast was designed in a manner that was durable and wind resistant. This necessitated the use of an internal mooring system, featuring both steel cables and Kevlar lines to secure the airship to the building. To add to the complexity of their task, the builders had to fabricate the docking mast, designed by Swiss engineer Ivan Fuat, in an expeditious and cost-effective manner. 

A second obstacle the Empire State Building builders encountered was the safety of the building and the airship occupants. As such, builders had to make sure that there were no unexpected gusts of wind that could knock down the airship and damage the building or injure passengers. To address
