The final line of the poem is meant to suggest the cycle of life and death. The winter hibiscus, which appears to be dead in the winter, will come back to life in the spring, symbolizing renewal and hope. By ending the poem with this line, the speaker is honoring the life cycle and the resilience of nature, and acknowledging that no matter how hard things may seem, things will eventually get better. Additionally, the line could also be interpreted to suggest that the speaker is comparing their own struggles to the hibiscus, and will take the test again when they feel strengthened and renewed.
