To the Editor:

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects of computers and technology on people today. As technology advances and we rely more heavily on computers, I believe it is important to recognize and discuss the potential risks associated with that reliance, as well as consider the benefits they bring.

First and foremost, let’s consider the potential benefits of computers. Through the use of computers, communication has become easier, faster, and more reliable. We are now able to make connections and interact with people worldwide in a matter of seconds. Computers also allow us to quickly access a wealth of information in almost any subject imaginable. We have access to an ever-growing library of knowledge at our fingertips.

However, it is also important to consider the potential negatives associated with computer use. Too much time on computers can lead to physical health problems such as neck and wrist strain. It can also lead to problems with sight, if you’re constantly looking at screens. Additionally, it can lead to an overall decrease in physical activity and social interaction.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that computers and technology are beneficial, but that they can also have risks associated with them. We should be aware of both and take steps to mitigate the risks. I hope readers will consider these points and become more conscious of the potential consequences of relying too heavily on technology.

Sincerely,
