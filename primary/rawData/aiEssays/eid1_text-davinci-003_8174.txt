The construction of the Empire State Building was a monumental task in 1930s America. The construction project faced many obstacles, one of which was the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock on the top of the tower. The main obstacle in allowing dirigibles to dock was ensuring that the dirigibles could be safely secured and that the tower itself could withstand the extra stresses that were introduced with the docking of large airships. In “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, we can explore the many challenges the architects and engineers had to overcome in order for the Empire State Building to accommodate docking dirigibles.

The structure of the Empire State Building was considered state-of-the-art at the time of its construction. However, it presented one massive challenge in allowing dirigibles to dock. The Empire State Building—at 1,250 feet high—had never been seen or attempted before, and architects and engineers were uncertain of whether the building could handle the stresses of docking with large airships. They also had to consider the safety of the passengers. The planners had to modify the steel frame structure to account for the additional stresses on the building and this meant adding steel girders to support the load of the airships.

The next obstacle to overcome was finding a way to secure the dirigibles to the top of the Empire State Building. At 1,250 feet, the wind was much stronger than at street level
