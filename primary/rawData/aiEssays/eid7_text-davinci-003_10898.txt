 

I had a particularly hard day at work the other day. I had been assigned a project with an unreasonable deadline and I was already feeling overwhelmed with the work I needed to complete. 

I was working long hours and had no breaks in between. My back was starting to ache and my eyes were heavy, but I couldn't afford to take a break. I tried my best to remain patient and endure the difficult situation. 

I was close to giving up when out of the blue, my co-worker came up to me and offered to help. I couldn't believe my luck and I thanked her for her generosity. She finished the project in no time and I was forever grateful. 

I couldn't help but appreciate how patient she was with me and how understanding and kind she was. I am truly blessed to have her as a friend and co-worker.
