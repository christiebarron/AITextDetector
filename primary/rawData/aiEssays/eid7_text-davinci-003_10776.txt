 

I remember being in middle school and feeling a lot of pressure to fit in. One day I saw a really popular girl, and I was really excited to talk to her. I mustered up the courage to go up and introduce myself, but she was a little cold and stand-offish. 

At first I was taken aback and a bit hurt. I had really built up the courage to talk to her and get to know her better, but she seemed uninterested in getting to know me. Despite this, I stayed patient and continued to talk to her, making conversation and trying to make her laugh. After a little while, I could see her starting to warm up to me. 

By taking my time and being patient, eventually she opened up to me and we ended up becoming really good friends. Patience made all the difference in this situation, and it taught me a valuable lesson about how important it can be.
