As an avid reader and supporter of public education, I am writing to voice my opinion on the subject of censorship in libraries. While I understand the need to protect vulnerable readers from explicit materials, I strongly disagree with attempts to outright ban books, music, movies, and magazines from libraries. 

Censoring a book or any other type of media deprives readers of access to information or entertainment that could potentially benefit them. It also restricts the freedom of expression that should be guaranteed by public libraries. Books, music, and movies can serve as an important source of insight and reflection for readers, and to deny them access to these resources is a disservice to the public. 

It is possible to provide appropriate access to materials while also protecting the public from offensive content. Libraries can implement guidelines that allow for materials to be available but also set parameters, like age ratings or parental discretion notices. This way, vulnerable readers are protected and adults have the same freedom of expression as any other person. 

Censorship in libraries is a double-edged sword, as it not only cuts off the right of access to potentially beneficial materials, but it also opens the door to the censorship of books that bring a valuable source of insight and reflection. In order to protect the rights of the public, and ensure everyone has access to information and entertainment, libraries should not resort to censorship. Instead, they should establish adequate guidelines to help protect vulnerable readers.
