It was the first time that I had seen Amy laugh out loud. We had been dating for a few weeks but had yet to spend a significant amount of time together beyond conventional outings. 

We decided to spend the day hiking our favorite trails together. The sun was bright and the air was warm, and we were happy to just be together. I had yet to witness her bubbly personality in full force but it seemed like that was about to change. 

We eventually stopped for lunch at a picnic spot about halfway through the hike. We were both feeling a bit tired and decided to sit while we ate. As we started digging into the delicious sandwiches I had made earlier that morning, I noticed a tiny chipmunk staring at us from behind a nearby shrub.

Before I could say anything, Amy threw a crumb of sandwich right at it! That immediately caught my attention and before I realized, I was laughing out loud. Stunned by the boldness, I looked up to see Amy also smiling and laughing with me. 

We shared some more food with the chipmunk, which kept intending up as close as it dared, and laughed at itâ€™s boldness and tenacity. The day was filled with more fun and laughter, and has since become one of my fondest memories with Amy.
