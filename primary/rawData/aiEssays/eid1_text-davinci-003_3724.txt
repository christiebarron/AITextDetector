Dear Editor,

In todayâ€™s digital world, computers are an integral part of our lives. However, there is a growing concern as to the potential effects computers can have on people.

With the widespread use of technology, technology has become pervasive in our lives. From work, home and education, it has become difficult to think without the aid of a computer. Depending on how it is used, computers can either act as allies or substitute our human capabilities, leaving us disconnected from the real world. 

Excessive use of technology can also lead to physical health issues such as strained eyes, headaches, and neck and wrist pain from sitting in the same position for long hours. Additionally, mental health issues such as depression, frustration and anxiety are becoming more common among technology users, while sleep disturbances and anti-social behavior are other effects, caused by excessive use of technology. 

However, this doesn't mean that we should reject technology altogether. With the right training and thoughtful use, computers can be incorporated into our lives with great benefit. Technology can be used in educational settings, such as aiding in basic books and keyboard skills. Moreover, online resources should be utilized to virtually socialize and communicate with friends and family.

We must be aware of the delicate balance between our virtual lives and real world interactions. Computers can be used as a way to socialize, communicate, educate and better our lives, without compromising our physical and mental wellbeing.
