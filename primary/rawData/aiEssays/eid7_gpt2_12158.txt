An example of a time someone in my life was patient was me who was having a hard time finding the person to walk the dog. I got a letter asking if that person still wants to walk to work and to be a part of the community. I went to her door with an expression of joy on my face as we walked. Her response was "Yes I love doing this, but if you want to get involved, I have other things I need to be passionate about like teaching, volunteering or even learning new skills to people at the local park." We then went to the dog bar. I took a seat and got to work, a bit late, and we had no choice but to end up with the puppy. He immediately started barking and was aggressive as well. "Is that ok?", I asked. "Yes absolutely." "So don't leave those guys with all you're heart has left?" he began to call me a f***y dog and I was like, "No, just let me stay just one more minute." It was a rather rough, but not insurmountable, situation to have to deal with on my own. Once he started to bark that was an absolute pain and the rest are great and I've spent a lot of time in it, it was easier to deal with it than in any other place we've been in the community that we've interacted at. He's now like 20 years into my life and still is.
I love having a dog
