I recently had to pick up friends from the airport and I was running late due to unforeseen circumstances. I was very frustrated with myself as I was driving to the airport. I was already envisioning the disappointed look on my friendsâ€™ faces as I pulled up late. 

When I finally got there, my fears were confirmed. My friends were already at the curb and they looked visibly disappointed. 

Instead of getting angry or defensive, I took a deep breath and calmly apologized for being late. I explained that something came up and I couldn't make it on time. My friends were understanding and appreciated that I was honest with them about the reason why. 

Despite my frustration with myself, I managed to remain patient and apologetic. I was rewarded with understanding from my friends, which reaffirmed the value of patience in tough situations.
