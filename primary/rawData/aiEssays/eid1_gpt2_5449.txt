Computers have many effects on people. One of them was to force them not only to learn new languages, but to develop them as adults. Another was to force them not only to spend time in university but to attend college. These changes increased the number of people who were going to school for a couple years. In fact, it increased the number of people who could be made to learn new languages.

Another aspect that actually helped these individuals when they were starting out was to have people talk at school, rather than watching television. As they would learn English well without English, it may have slowed down their development and brought them into their new lives.

The second effect was that those who grew up without English started to develop a lot more self-esteem. One study showed that people who did not use English quickly learned much that was not new, but had been there before. One other study showed that people who did not know what they wanted had a 20 percent greater sense of self esteem compared to those who did know what they wanted. This may have boosted their self-esteem. The researchers concluded that if people with language problems came to English early, they would learn to talk more about their problems.
