The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it says it tells of what a few people might not knowâ€¦ but rather what can be done to save them from the monsters of the future. Winter Hibiscus' book is called Winter Hibiscus: Tales of Magic, but it's not for everyone.


The second novel has some cool details as well that makes me want to buy it for the PSY as well.

Update (11/25/13): On Saturday I discovered the same story as I initially did here on the Poynter website: it's still up but it's not the last one that I'll be reading, although I'll update as soon as I get it (if you are interested, please post your reviews on the Poynter website for a chance of getting some awesome reviews).
