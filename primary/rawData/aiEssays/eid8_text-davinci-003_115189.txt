When I was in fourth grade, I had a friend named Sarah. We had been best friends since first grade, so I felt like I could share anything with her. One day, our teacher decided to do a funny embarrassing activity with us. Everyone had to write something embarrassing on a piece of paper, put it in a hat, and when it was your turn you would have to pull a slip out and read it aloud.

Thinking it would be funny to make Sarah laugh, I wrote that Sarah had a crush on her teacher. I guffawed with glee as I put it in the hat. I was sure it would make Sarah crack up, and she did - until it was her turn to take a slip out of the hat. I'll never forget the look on her face when she pulled out the paper that said she had a crush on her teacher. 

We both started cracking up uncontrollably and it kept getting louder and louder, until the entire class was in stitches. Sarah's face was bright red, but she was laughing along with everybody else.

That was about ten years ago, and the memory of that funny moment still brings a smile to my face. When I'm with Sarah, I don't need to say anything to make her laugh; I just think back to the day when she found out she "had a crush" on our teacher, and before I know it, we're both in hysterics!
