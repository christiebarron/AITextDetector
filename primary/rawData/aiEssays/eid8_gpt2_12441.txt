One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was thirteen. I remember telling an older friend that my first job as a lawyer in Boston was to make up for my loss by putting my wife to work trying to convince people to try smoking marijuana. Our co-workers got up and said, "We don't like smoking marijuana," which I didn't know at the time and couldn't understand. That was really embarrassing." We lost one to a stroke and spent the rest of our marriage and our marriage as a couple. It was good, but I had trouble with alcohol.

A couple of years later, after my marriage's demise, I went into a job as a senior adviser to my friend Frank Baumgartner. In my time there, we discussed the idea of turning our family and friends into the national political party and started planning a campaign to stop cannabis use. Because I was struggling with alcoholism, I began to feel a bit guilty about it. My husband was a drug addict and one of my closest friends was a professor of psychology, so he stopped me. After that, "You want to be married to a drug addict? You do?" What had happened?

In the late 1980s, Frank decided to drop out of high school in order to work towards self-improvement. He found a few friends by working in "the bar" for two months on some bar crawls and a little on "the bus" for a couple of days.
