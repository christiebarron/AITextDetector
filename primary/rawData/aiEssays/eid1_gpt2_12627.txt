They may increase their confidence, which has positive social consequences, as well as stress and anxiety. In addition, many of the benefits of a computer are related to how easily it can be used.

Researchers have found a connection between computers, computers and mental health.

"It's a pretty big difference and an understanding of computer science has shown us that there's a relationship between them that seems to keep up," says Dr. David E. Blunt, president of the University of California, San Francisco. "I think it's really interesting."

But, as you might expect, the best way to develop your own computer skills is to put your idea down there, which is extremely difficult, says Dr. J. Renske, a researcher at the University of Connecticut. For example, he points to a survey in 2007 that showed that Americans who work at a computer think they are smarter than most.

"If people just looked at the computer system and they said, 'Actually, it is actually better than what I've heard from computer scientists,' it would be very disappointing to the rest of society," says Dr. Robert J. Pendergast, director of the University of California, Irvine's Office on Computational Health Policy.

But, according to Dr. Shaver, the computer system's effectiveness is not simply due to its ability to help
