Dear [Editor],

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects of computers on people. I am convinced that computers have both positive and negative impacts on people, thereby creating a delicate balance in their use.

On the positive side, computers have enabled unprecedented access to information that was once afforded only to a select few. This has enabled people to make well-informed decisions and to research and analyze complex topics. Additionally, computers have provided access to a wide range of educational, business, and entertainment-based tools, enabling people to stay connected, informed, and creative.

On the downside, computers have had the tendency to disconnect people from each other. With computers being used so often, people often forget the value of face-to-face interaction, and the potential for forming intrinsic relationships. Moreover, the constant stimulation of computers can lead to fatigue, headaches, and questions about the efficiency of one's actions.

Ultimately, I believe that a balance can be found between the positives and negatives of computers, and that the key to achieving this lies in creating intentional limits on their use. I hope that this letter provides readers with a more nuanced perspective on the impacts of computers on people, and leads to the proper use and enjoyment of technology.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
