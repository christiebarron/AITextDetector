Censorship has no place in libraries. Libraries should provide patrons with access to materials from all points of view so that they can form their own conclusions about the world. Therefore, it is not appropriate to remove any materials from shelves just because some people find them offensive or believe that they may be harmful to society. 

Individuals should be able to exercise their freedom of expression and be exposed to ideas or topics that could challenge their current beliefs. Libraries should strive for inclusivity when curating collections and actively pursue special collections of books and other materials on all sides of controversial topics. It is ultimately up to the individual to decide which books to read and what content to be exposed to. 

At the same time, libraries should still exercise their own reasonable judgement when it comes to materials. Age-appropriate materials and safety should be taken into account, and libraries should continue to provide patrons with guidance and context when needed. 

Libraries are not only spaces for borrowing books and borrowing DVDs; they are public institutions that should serve a variety of communities. Censoring materials and removing them from the shelves just because of offensiveness only serves to create an exclusive space. Libraries should remain open, inclusive, and neutral â€“ providing patrons with access to all kinds of materials.
