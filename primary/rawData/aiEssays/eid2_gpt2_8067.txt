I believe that censorship of materials in libraries andts is necessary to maintain a healthy and effective government.

I believe that government may need to be a repository for information, information that is a product of history, it may be a repository for intelligence, it may be an information system for culture, it may be a repository for the art of the soul.

It is a matter of time before governments of all kinds are taken out of office with the threat of death.
