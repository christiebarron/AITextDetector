I was waiting in line at the grocery store behind an elderly woman who was going through her bags one at a time, restocking each item she had purchased. As the line began to grow, some of the other customers began to grumble and I did as well. I began to get frustrated about the time it was taking and how long I was going to be stuck in line.

But then I remembered to be patient. I took a deep breath, looked around, and reminded myself that things happen for a reason. I remembered - the elderly woman was probably closer to the end of her life than the beginning, and she hadn't gone to the grocery store with the intention to disrupt everyone's day. So, I stood there and waited, without complaining.

When she was finished, she thanked me profusely, as if I had done her a kindness. She said it was so nice that someone could be patient while she was going through her items. I realized she was right - wouldn't it feel awful if everyone was grumbling while I was doing something like this?

I thanked her and wished her a good day as she left. I was happy that I took the time to be patient - it made a difference both for the elderly woman and for me.
