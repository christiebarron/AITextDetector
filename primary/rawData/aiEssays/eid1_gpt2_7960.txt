How does the brain regulate sleep and rest?

We know that you can't wake up from a long sleep. By increasing melatonin levels in the body, your body may begin to store more serotonin and dopamine when you sleep. During this process, serotonin can send the signal to your brain to start syncing the brain signals to your brain (called melatonin), and this signals up your mood.
