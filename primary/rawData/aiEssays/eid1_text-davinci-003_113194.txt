To Editor, 

As technology advances, computers have become a larger part of many people’s lives. However, due to excessive use, the physical and mental effects of computers can have both positive and negative impacts on individuals. 

On one hand, computers can be incredibly helpful when it comes to managing one's life. Since computers organize and store data, they can help individuals maximize their productivity while reducing stress through easier communication and more efficient data management. Working remotely and from the comfort of one's home is now seen as a standard thanks to the ubiquity of computers. Additionally, computers have opened up the world to anyone with an internet connection, allowing instant access to news, entertainment, education, and more. 

At the same time, there are certain disadvantages to using computers. Staring at a screen for hours a day can lead to physical problems like headaches, eye fatigue, and even back strain. Too much use can also negatively affect mental health by isolating users from their physical environment and leading to feelings of depression or loneliness. It’s even possible to become addicted to computers, leading to a lack of real-life social interactions. 

In conclusion, computers have become an important part of our lives. While there are both positive and negative effects, careful and mindful use is what’s most important. I am sure the readers of this newspaper will agree.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
