Dear Editor, 

As technology continues to become increasingly prominent in modern society, the impact of computers cannot be overstated. Many people believe that computers have had a negative effect on peoplesâ€™ lives, pointing to issues such as decreased privacy, a decline in face-to-face communication, and a decrease in creativity. However, I believe that computers have had a positive influence on people. 

For one, computers have had a revolutionary impact on education. With the widespread use of tablets and laptops in the classroom, students are able to keep up with their homework with ease, and are provided with countless resources from the internet. This has helped produce an entire generation of lifelong, tech-savvy learners. 

Moreover, computers have helped people break out of their limited geographic boundaries. In addition to allowing people to stay in better contact with family and friends who are miles away, computers have enabled people to search for new job opportunities in other cities. Computers have made the world smaller by helping people stay more connected to each other. 

Finally, computers have had a positive influence on the economy as well. By providing advanced working solutions, computers have allowed businesses to stay competitive in a rapidly changing world. From inventory tracking to automated customer service, computers have changed the way businesses operate. 

In conclusion, the influence computers have had on people is undeniable: from communication to learning and the global economy, computers have proven to be invaluable in making life
