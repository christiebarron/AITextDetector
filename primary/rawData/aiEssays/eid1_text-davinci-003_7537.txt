The author of Winter Hibiscus, Minfong Ho, chose to end the story with this line because it is a reminder of the protagonist's determination not to give up despite difficult circumstances. The imagery of the snows melting, the geese returning, and the hibiscus budding represent hope and renewal, and this inspires the protagonist to try again. This ending emphasises not only the protagonist's commitment to her education, but also the hope and resilience of those assimilating to a new culture and way of life in a foreign land.
