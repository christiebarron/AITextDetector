The Empire State Building has a remarkable history. When it was originally built in 1931, the plans included an early technology known as a dirigible, or airship, docking station. Though it seemed like a strange feature to include, the architects were forward-thinking and wanted to capitalize on this technology of the future. However, the dock was never used and the challenge of allowing dirigibles to dock at one of New York City's tallest skyscrapers proved to be insurmountable.

In her book, The Mooring Mast, Marcia Amidon Lüsted explains the obstacles that the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock. The technology of the time presented the primary barrier; there was simply no practical way to attach a dirigible to the mooring mast, or even hold it in place in a secure manner. The lightweight airships needed a more sophisticated docked design than the one envisioned by the Empire State Building’s structure. Dirigibles were also much larger than airplanes and needed a different kind of anchor system. Since the mooring mast was mounted on the roof of the building, it was too tall to access and modify for the purpose of mooring dirigibles.

Additionally, safety regulations posed a problem. Regulations in place at the time called for a minimum distance of at least 300 feet between the docking area and adjacent buildings, which the Empire State Building did not have sufficient space for. This meant that
