The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first was the fact that the roof of the building stood off the sides. Then, all the ground floor spaces were boarded up, which meant that the roof would block a great deal of the view. The first real problem faced by the builders was the lack of the vertical crane underneath the columns during construction, so much so that they built several vertical cranes under the columns.

The second factor was the fact that they needed to have a little more space on top compared to previous eras. As opposed to most skyscrapers, the Empire State Building's vertical columns were very low and did not allow gravity, meaning that the column could not extend at all. Another reason for the absence as a support structure, was that the lowermost levels were filled with debris and sand.

Also, the new building, which was built in 1904, had a curved roof, which made the buildings easier to work on, as opposed to the high level columns that were normally installed here on American buildings.

By 1928, it was a reality that Empire State Buildings were getting big.

The next big challenge facing the Empire State Building lay in the amount of windows and the structure's ability to provide air and light. The new Empire State Building provided a greater contrast to these problems because it provided a greater height by eliminating many of the problems of vertical sloping overlying areas.
