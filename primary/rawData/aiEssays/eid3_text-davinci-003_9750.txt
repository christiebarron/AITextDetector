The setting in Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead" has a significant impact on the cyclist. Throughout the story, the cyclist encounters challenging terrain mostly due to the harsh weather conditions in the mountains. The cyclist has to navigate through a treacherous mountain pass, which is described as a difficult climb with rough terrain, variable temperatures, strong winds, and blinding snowfall. 

The cyclist has to contend with the ever-changing terrain as the cycling route takes them over sharp turns and steep inclines. The icy roads are unpredictable, and the cyclist has to be especially careful when cornering. The constant wind chill makes it difficult for the cyclist to keep warm and their muscles working consistently. With the limited visibility, the cyclist can often miss opportunities to speed up or take advantage of easier declines and smooth ascents. 

The cyclist has to make frequent use of their brakes on the snowy roads to prevent slipping. The bike's frame has to carry the additional weight of the tyres, mudguards and the cyclist's clothing without suffering any potential wear or tear. Moreover, the cyclist has to stay focused and alert at all times as the uneven roadways can cause them to be thrown off the bike or hit with rocks or other sharp objects. 

The features of the setting not only affect the cyclist physically, but also mentally as they have to be constantly vigilant of the terrain and environment. The cyclist is constantly facing daunting challenges in order to reach their destination safely. Throughout
