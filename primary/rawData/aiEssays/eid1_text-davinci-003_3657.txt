To the Editor of the (Newspaper Name):

As a concerned citizen, I am writing to express my personal opinion on the effects that computers have on people. In this technological age, computers have become the cornerstone of our everyday lives.

It is undeniable that computers have changed the way people work. Businesses can now communicate with colleagues and customers in entirely new ways, and file-sharing functions such as Dropbox and Google Drive have made it possible for us to collaborate with others in real-time. From conducting research to managing finances, computers are invaluable tools that make our lives easier.

At the same time, there are risks associated with the use of computers. As people are now so heavily reliant on computer technology, it can have a negative effect on their physical and mental health. For example, too much time spent on the computer can lead to physical ailments such as eye strain, headaches, and carpal tunnel syndrome. It can also create an excessive dependence on technology, which can be harmful to peopleâ€™s social lives.

Personally, I believe that the use of computers should be moderated to ensure the well-being of users. We must also take advantage of the positive aspects of computers to increase productivity and efficiency.

I hope that readers will agree with me that computers can be advantageous if used responsibly.

Sincerely,

(Your Name)
