The geography of the road is described in detail, and this provides the reader with a vivid image of the extreme difficulty of the terrain. The road is winding and bumpy with sharp turns. This is in stark contrast to the peaceful view of the countryside, with trees and solitary houses.

The cyclist is severely impacted by the difficult road. On the winding, bumpy road they are forced to ride slowly in order to keep their balance and be able to make the dangerous turns. They also find it difficult to maintain a steady pace to get to their destination quickly.
