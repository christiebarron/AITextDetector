One time I experienced laughter in my life was when one of my older brothers heard me talking about his father and said I'm sorry. He tried to speak up but he fell back on the last thing he knew.

It's sad to hear the same kind of thing about your mother as well, but I can only express how sad and terrible you have been to her. I always saw that on my own terms you never got over her death at all. I think about what you still look like and feel that she did not deserve that, but her death means something to me.
