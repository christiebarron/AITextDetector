Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. For example, when cycling on rough roads or on hot or cold road surfaces, people fall out more often, are more likely to feel sick or have high blood pressure, tend to be more prone to bleeding and the number of injuries increases.
