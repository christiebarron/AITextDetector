Dear Editor,

I am writing out of concern over the effects computers can have on people. Over the last few decades, modern technology has allowed us to be connected virtually at any time, from any place. This is an amazing advancement in our society, but unfortunately, this evolvement is not without consequences.

It has become increasingly clear that computers not only have the capacity to increase productivity, but also the potential to disrupt our lives. First and foremost, they can contribute to loneliness and isolation. When people are spending their time on a computer, they can be less engaged with the people around them, potentially forsaking real-life social interactions in favor of digital ones.

Moreover, the use of computers can also give rise to mental health issues. Prolonged computer use can lead to increased stress levels, sleep disturbances, as well as other physical and mental health problems. Focusing too much on the computer can cause people to feel overwhelmed, burned out, and disconnected from the real world.

To improve upon the current situation and ensure that technology is used safely and responsibly, it is important that we build an awareness of these risks. Although technology often has a positive impact, it is essential to remember the potential harms computers can bring. I believe we as a community must create an understanding of what is healthy computer use and strive for a better mental health society.

Sincerely, 
Your Name
