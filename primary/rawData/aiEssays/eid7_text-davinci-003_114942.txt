I remember back in college, when I was taking this intensive Histology lab course. It was notoriously difficult to get a good grade, and everyone was stressed out. I was trying to keep up, but the material just wasn't clicking with me. My professor was getting frustrated with me for not understanding it, and I was getting really discouraged.

But then one of my classmates, Josh, stepped in. He saw that I was struggling and took the time to sit down with me and explain the concepts in a way that was a lot clearer. He was incredibly patient with me, taking his time and going over things several times until I finally got it.

He didn't have to do that; he could have been focused on himself. But instead, he was patient enough to help me understand the material. His patience and kindness really showed me the value of helping others. I ended up getting a really good grade in the course, and I'm sure it wouldn't have been possible without Josh's help.
