The narrator of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho is reflecting on the hibiscus plant in the final section of the narrative as a metaphor for her own experiences with an important test. The hibiscus bush experiences a difficult winter, but is able to survive, a resilience that gives the narrator hope. By ending with the line "when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again," the narrator is expressing her hope that with the passing of winter, she, too, will be able to successfully face her test and will try again. The line emphasizes the theme of resilience and optimism that is present throughout the narrative.
