The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is about how her father (who died in 1990) was treated in the family home by a woman and her children, and how he suffered from severe anxiety at the young age of 11 years. Her father was later convicted at the age of 22 for the murder of his wife and three children.

"From Home is a candid personal account of the abuse that followed his death," wrote Ms Bostwick. "He was told by her mother that her son would not remember them, since he was born in 1969. In October 1969 he was forced to watch a TV programme and he would have none to say, but rather his mother told him it was wrong to hurt his feelings and when she returned he became very angry."

It is, for me, an especially poignant story about someone not only coping with the trauma of being a parent but also caring about his children. In my family story, there is nothing particularly personal about the family home from my point of view.
