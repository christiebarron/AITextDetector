Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

• People who do not ride or ride unsafely or who do not like their speed can fall more.

• If they need a break from a car, their bike is a good option if you are in need of one.

• People use the roads as safety ramps rather than as a safety sign.

• People are more likely to crash and suffer severe injury.

• If you experience any problems cycling or a problem is with your bike, your local police force or any other emergency help is available.

• The police will be able to use a public address system instead of one that does not have a police line up. If you have to go into the police cars or on foot, they will ask you to step off the bike so that they can take you to the police station before you are charged and sent home.
