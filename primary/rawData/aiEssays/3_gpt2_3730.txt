Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. The following is a brief primer on those settings:

A: Your speed.

B: Your ride speed (miles per hour, km/h)

C: Your distance to target.

D: Your speed as a percentage of your daily daily speed over an area.

E: Your distance to target as a percentage of your daily daily speed.

F: Your distance to target as a percentage of your daily daily speed.

The same applies here for the rider's speed in every situation. This will be given in the following tables:

Rounds Per Hour Distance to Target Distance to Target Distance To Target Distance to Target Distance to Target Distance to Target Stroke Time Stroke Time Stroke Time Stroke Time Stroke Time Stroke Time Stroke Time

In this example, you will ride 6-8 km every day between 6pm on Day 1 and 11pm on Day 2, and take in 9.2 km every day between 10am on Day 1 and 2 and 12pm on Day 3.

By the way, on Day 1 of the cycling calendar, an hour is defined as the length of time it takes for a rider to reach a given pace and then hit the target. So on days two and three this was 11pm and 12pm, on Cooperative Day two, 7pm and 9pm and 11pm
