The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because, well, you're telling the full story of all the life you've known since you were a child with an evil evil god. In my time, I was very thankful for these worlds and the people I was raised with. So to be able to share with you all the stories that I, as a hero, created with my eyes on my mother, grandmother and siblings all around the world means much."


Wesley Woodruff, in his own words, "It's a difficult book to read, but it has been so well received on its website, both critically and nationally and also on YouTube. It's a very popular book, I can't wait to read it. My book is out and about in October, next week. It's just one of those. The book will be out for the first time on October 12th next year. All that's set for it is that they have a new series on their web site that they've been working on. For those people who haven't been, that is that show you see in the trailer is basically all of that, if you have any knowledge of science fiction, history or any other kind of science fiction, there will be some good science fiction content out there. It hasn't actually been picked yet by some other creators or other publishers."
