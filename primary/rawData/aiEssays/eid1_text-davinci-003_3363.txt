Dear Editor,

As technology evolves, computers have become a major part of our lives. They are not only tools which allow us to increase productivity and efficiency in our lives; but, some would argue, they have the potential to greatly benefit our society too.

The reality is that computers have both positive and negative impacts on us. On the one hand, computers have helped to bridge gaps and improve the quality of communication. We can now communicate with people around the world nearly instantaneously. We also have increased access to information, learning, and entertainment. On the other hand, computers can be detrimental to our health physically. Eyestrain, headaches, backaches, and obesity are just a few of the problems linked to computer usage.

In conclusion, computers should be used with caution and moderation. Kids and young adults should be educated about the risks associated with too much screen time. Although computers can be beneficial, if we do not understand and monitor our use, it could have a detrimental outcome. Therefore, I urge readers to use the technology responsibly and keep a balance between computer time and other activities.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
