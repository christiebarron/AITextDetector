I was out with my best friend for a night on the town recently, and as usual we started with a drink and some people-watching. As we watched the goings-on, we shared some of the funniest stories we'd heard recently. We must have looked completely out of control because soon the people around us started to laugh, too! Soon the whole pub was laughing at our antics and it felt absolutely amazing! 

It felt like we were all one big family and when the laughter finally died down, all of us just shared a moment of genuine connection. After our little moment of joy, we thanked everyone for joining in and made sure to tell them they'd made our night. 

That night will always stay with me and it reminds me of what can happen when we take a few minutes to connect with each other. It was a reminder that laughter really is the shortest distance between two people.
