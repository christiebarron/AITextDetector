Computers have many effects on people. Think about it: it doesn't matter if you like the song. That song has the best impact. But what do you write your own lyrics that won't be copied? We don't care what some artist says about your song. We don't care if they're a piece of shit or a hate speech. We love our customers. But sometimes people will do the same thing, and they just don't like it. The music industry just wants more of those kinds of things. We're not going to make it hard. We're going to make it really difficult. And we don't even want to make it harder.

That's why you wrote the lyrics with your new song and your new project. I had a job that brought in great management.

I don't know about the other artists. I can't say they're all the same. We all have that same sound and we both share that music. And my main challenge was being able to do it without just thinking, "I'm not gonna need a manager." If your problem is getting it done and you want to go out and do it, don't worry. You can do it without trying.

I still got questions about your musical interests, and your love of rap. If you're from the west coast, can I expect you to work with a local group?

I don't know if I have people from the east coast working with me
