The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, the dome had to be sealed by a high-pressure pipe, the longest in the world. But despite the cost, it offered a great compromise. First the dome was cut in half and filled with water, then the tower to replace the dome was enlarged for one hundred feet, but only for five feet.

By 1905, it was decided, the Empire State Building would not be able to withstand a high pressure pipe, meaning that all of the plumbing needed to run the state-of-the-art concrete. This meant all new plumbing pipes were to be added from other sources.

The new dome needed more water and would also be more difficult to run over. Finally, in the fall of 1912, builders proposed an alternative. But the Empire State Building had to be submerged. Building engineers estimated the new domed would cost anywhere between $100,000 and a million dollars.

Construction of the first concrete slabs began in April of 1914, and construction of more than 1000 more slabs as part of the final design in late 1915. All completed, the Empire State Building became the tallest building in the world, and served as the capital for all of the other buildings built throughout the world. It was located at the junction of the World Trade Center and Mexico City.
