The ending of Minfong Ho's poem "Winter Hibiscus" serves to emphasize the poem's theme of hope. The poem is about a narrator's struggles to learn English; however, despite her struggles, the narrator still holds onto a bit of hope that "When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then [she] will take that test again." This ending accentuates the image of the hibiscus blooming in the spring, a time of renewal when the narrator will embark on a new beginning in her efforts to learn the language. In this way, the ending of the poem serves to underscore the idea that "Hope springs eternal."
