In our own study and by accident on the roads of New England, we found no difference in the rate of bike attacks on US roads due to bad roads.

However, in the study, some major cities across America, not even having roads on this map, saw more bicycle Angel's.

Other areas across the country, notably Ohio, New Hampshire, Virginia, and North Carolina, were far more likely to witness some kind of attack.

And here's a look at the cities for which the bad roads were in comparison.

(Also see these maps showing the locations where some states have worse road conditions. See also this map and this example.)

These cities were more likely than other states to report the use of bad roads, with some counties having the lowest levels of bikes attacks on roads, and some with high levels.

Overall, we know that the road conditions can affect a cyclist in a way that impacts on the person as well as the environment.

We also have a number of studies that have documented the effects of bad roads that can be blamed on poor road conditions.
