The poem gives a vivid description of a cyclist navigating a road with a variety of features. These features, both natural and man-made, have a direct impact on the cyclist and their journey.

The land-scape features mentioned in the poem create a sense of danger and uncertainty. The cyclist must content with rough road surfaces, sharp turns, and unpredictable lands.

The poem also references speed, as the cyclist must maintain a high rate of speed to stay ahead of the approaching storm. Such speed makes the task of navigating these features even more difficult.
