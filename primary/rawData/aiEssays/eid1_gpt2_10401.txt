Computers have many effects on people. Some of those effects are physical and psychological: You take longer to learn things. In general, the more a computer knows about the world, the better it can do things. For instance, when someone who knows more about mathematics tries to read a mathematical formula, their knowledge of this formula is limited by a small number of steps. In other words, they don't remember any of the steps they took when they were given them a break.

However, machines do a lot more than that. Computer programs, on the other hand, can do virtually anything a human can imagine. For instance, they can predict a fire or a tsunami. (The biggest difference can be a couple of different variables that are often misunderstood or misinterpreted: people perceive how much smoke this event does, or how strong this earthquake does.) The fact that computers do things with such precision to produce such complex predictions doesn't mean they can't also do things with such precision to make predictions.

And so the more human experience people have with computers, the more things that machine-learning algorithms can learn to do. For instance, a computer program can read your body temperature by looking at its surface, which is a very useful way to create a human face. (Some of the faces we can see on computer screens are called human skin tones.) This tells us that the computer program recognizes the human face. But its own computer programs must guess to understand the natural body's natural
