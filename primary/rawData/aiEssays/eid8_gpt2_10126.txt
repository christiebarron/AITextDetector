One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was in Vietnam. I realized that there are other ways to describe that kind of reaction. There are people who laugh a lot for doing something good. For example, there used to be something called "chung chien," which means "to be quiet." I think that's something that has faded with all the attention. People are going to think that being quiet when looking out the window and seeing people is funny, but nobody can have a perfect world that's perfect. We have some parts of the world where it's not about being loud or loud enough, and that's going to do people hurt if we're outside. But people are saying, "I really do enjoy laughing at people's laughter." I love when people laugh, and that's cool. I think people have an internalized sense of humor.

J: Is it like playing at a party?

D: Yeah. Because if people are talking, it might bring out something or something different. We've lost our old band and now we're trying to rebuild the whole club around ourselves. I think people get tired of our loudness, and we can't be comfortable in the club. So we can just have fun. But it's not just about listening to stuff and trying to be loud. We all get on the same page.

J: That can be very motivating.

D: I'm glad people think it's about music
