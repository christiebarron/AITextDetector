One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I walked into the local McDonald's. I never heard any of those comments, and I actually really enjoyed the idea of being in there and seeing people getting ready to eat. It was such a cool idea that I didn't even have to ask for the burgers."

Mr. DePaul also says that he, for one, feels inspired to go back to the way he grew up in New Orleans and live in the West Village.

"I've had several friends who go to my events and come to see me play basketball. I've had people who go to see my children play ball. I've had strangers come to see me play, and I've taken them to a certain point, and it makes me feel very special," he said. "When I get back to the experience of living in New Orleans, it is so different than what I thought I would."
