It was the morning of Thanksgiving and I had been preparing for the dinner for hours. Everything had to be perfect so I was up early prepping and cleaning. As I was working, my two-year-old nephew wandered in knowing there was something exciting going on. He wanted to help, but that obviously wasn't going to work because he was just a toddler. 

I knew he was excited and probably bored, so to ease his boredom I decided to give him a few little jobs to do. I would clean something and then give him another small job like putting the napkins on the table or folding a dish rag. Eventually, he got bored of that too and started to get a bit whiny.

I was very patient with him. Instead of getting frustrated, I just simply smiled and knelt down to his level and asked him if he would like to help me with something else. I think he realized that I wasn't bothered by his behavior and he happily obliged. He started picking up the toys off the floor and putting them away. He really enjoyed helping me out and I was so proud of him that I gifted him a new teddy bear later that day.

I was happy that I was patient with him that day because it taught me a valuable lesson. Patience is key when it comes to dealing with small children, and it was rewarding to be able to show him the type of behavior I wanted him to have.
