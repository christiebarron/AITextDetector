To the Editor,

As technology continues to evolve and become an integral part of our daily lives, an increasingly important conversation is taking place about the effects computers have on people. 

I strongly believe that computers are beneficial to people in many ways. They have opened up a world of knowledge and information previously unavailable, allowing us to stay informed and productive. For individuals looking to learn the basics for job interviews or looking for a career in something entirely new, computers are invaluable resources. On top of that, the convenience of online shopping and banking eliminates time-consuming trips to the store or bank.

Computers also help strengthen relationships. With the rise of social media, itâ€™s easier than ever to stay in touch with friends and family. People can communicate even if they live far away from one another.

That being said, there are some potential drawbacks to using computers. The constant temptation of the internet can lead to issues with distraction and procrastination. Too much time in front of a computer can also lead to physical health issues like poor vision or obesity.

Ultimately, it is important to strike a balance between the benefits and risks. By simply being aware of the potential issues, people can make sure they use computers responsibly and reap the rewards.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
