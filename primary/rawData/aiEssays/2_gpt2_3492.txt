I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is necessary for academic freedom, but there are issues of importance to academics as well. It is necessary in order to develop research, and that is not something that is going to be easily achieved by censorship of materials in any form, or any organization or organization trying to censor materials from a wide variety of sources. The media have traditionally restricted public comments as their core subject, and this was the focus of public access. The main reasons this is impossible for a person to access through a library is that it is uninteresting, and in some cases it is even harmful. When I wrote about this issue of censorship a decade ago, it had been noted that people would be very upset if there were any information to be found of any kind. That is the real problem. The issue of censorship in libraries is only one issue. As a professor of literature research, I have to deal with that. I can say that I have been told there are problems with this for decades. What I saw, and the most recent, is the problem of the "Posterior Culture and Cultural Condition in Public Libraries". This is not a question of what is not in the book. It is a question of what are there, in the literature. If it was clear, the book was supposed to provide some research material, but it has been reduced to a list of "uninteresting," "obscene," and simply "irrelevant." I don't accept this as an excuse
