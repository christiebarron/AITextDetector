The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is very similar to that of what I have known for years in the United States: a feeling of relief, of a new adventure. A sense of a new sense of connection with the past. A new sense of the way in which you interact in a society where there are a lot of obstacles to overcome, and where you don't know what to say or how to write. I have found it to be a liberating, almost poetic, experience.

How did you like going to church?

A little bit.

What did you talk down to this morning?

Me and a friend come upstairs in our house, and some people there are talking together at the side table and talking about theology and social, and they are chatting about their religion and about what they believe. Then I read a book and they say, "So, what happened yesterday?" And I look at the text. In other words, I kind of understand what is happening but that I'm a bit afraid of a certain sort of response.

It's a very difficult time, for sure. You're talking to some students right now about the history of atheism.

It's not just atheists.

Yes, many of us are atheists. It goes back a long way back.

But you were a good atheist, and you talked about religion in that book. Isn't that, ashab-Bhab?
