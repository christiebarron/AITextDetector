The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. These were the problems of space and the large open areas of the building where space is limited. For the majority of builders, space was minimized, so why not just add these obstacles into the roof to support and help move the ship? The answer lies in the idea that space is the right place for the elements to be positioned and not the other way around. That is why if space is limited, what you need to do is create a new space to support and stabilize it when the gravity pulls it out again.
