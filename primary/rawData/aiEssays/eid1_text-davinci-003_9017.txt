Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my opinion about the effects of computers on people. Too often, people focus on what technology is doing to the world, without considering the positive impacts it has to offer. We cannot deny the convenience that computers bring to our everyday lives, making multitasking easier and more efficient than ever before.

One of the most important impacts of computers is its ability to connect us to the world around us. Modern technology has enabled us to access information instantaneously and build relationships online. We can talk to our friends from all over the world, order groceries from the comfort of our own home, or even take a virtual tour of a museum - all while using a computer. It has made our lives so much easier and more enjoyable than ever.

Moreover, you can’t ignore the possibilities for educational enhancement that are available with computers. Studies have shown that children are learning at higher standards when exposed to computers. They can use computers to listen to educational podcasts, follow video lessons, or take part in online educational courses. We no longer need to limit our children’s education to the textbooks they have in class. 

In conclusion, computers bring people many incredible advantages, and should be embraced with enthusiasm. I believe that the positive aspects of computers far outweigh the negative, and I am confident that readers of this newspaper will recognize this fact. 

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
