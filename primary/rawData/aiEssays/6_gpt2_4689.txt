The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First of all, most of those built by the Nazis were built by Allied engineers who had to spend countless hours constructing their new aircraft as soon as they arrived at the German factory. Secondly, the World Trade Center had no airfields, and most of its buildings were built by Soviet engineers, while other buildings built from scratch by the Nazis were in operation in Poland. Thirdly, and probably most significantly, the buildings and all associated work were located on the western side of the tower. Lastly, the WTC was not surrounded by any buildings and so had no elevator shafts. There was no evidence of any deliberate or attempted damage.

So, this raises a lot of questions. One is does the WTC have a single story, a staircase, or does it really have a single story at all? The two can differ. The building itself, if the only story is a single story, may have to be divided into two sections, either by construction or by weather. According to Dr. George Schlosser of the University of West Texas, there is just one part (the two building segments are separated by several feet of water) that has a single story. In another study about the WTC and the WTC's collapse, the authors found, the first "hollow" part of a twin-story structure was much larger than this. The second "ventral" feature was quite shallow in size
