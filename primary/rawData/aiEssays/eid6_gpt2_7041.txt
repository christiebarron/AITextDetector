The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In May 1955 alone, after nearly a decade of construction, the Federal Protective Service and all other U.S. government agencies, including the Department of Commerce, were shut down, meaning that no dirigible could dock on their commercial docks.

"In the summer of 1955, the U.S. government was asked to cancel some of their commercial property in the South End," wrote the Los Angeles Times, "and in response, the government said their use of the South End, where dirigibles can be attached, would be prohibited."

It was only after the United States stopped making dirigibles and started making them that California began looking for solutions.

"It's impossible to know what to do with a dirigible in California that is as large and as massive as the U.S."

As such, the State Planning Commission of California began a lengthy task force that, in the 1970s, recommended an alternative design: a "dormant" dirigible. As a result, many of the state's large-scale dirigibles were converted to dirigibles.

"The city of Los Angeles had a plan of how to build a solid-state dirigible in which it could be attached to a car or truck," wrote The Los Angeles Times, "which was also the only known solution."
