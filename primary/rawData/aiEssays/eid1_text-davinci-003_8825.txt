I remember the first time I met my now best friend. We had just been randomly assigned as roommates in college and I thought it was going to be an awkward mess. It started off somewhat awkward as we tried to break the ice. After an awkward, strained conversation, I found myself laughing at one of the jokes she told. We both collapsed into a fit of laughter that lasted uncomfortably long, but it felt like time had stopped for us. In that moment we both connected and our friendship was born.

It’s strange how a few moments of laughter can solidify a lifelong friendship, but that’s what happened with me and her. We always joke that if it wasn’t for that one shared moment, we probably wouldn’t be best friends. And that’s why laughter is so important in any relationship. It creates a bond and helps break down barriers, no matter how awkward the circumstances.
