Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. The effect can be the same even within the same city, as long as you have your own bicycle safety system that allows all cyclists in a single location and you take all available cyclist space while you plan the whole cycle! The idea of the setting is to bring both a safety factor and a social aspect to each cycle, and while that might mean different bike lanes and road networks, it also does away with our perception of 'Rough Road Ahead' as a city built around cycling.

Rough Road Ahead â€“ in conjunction with Bike Share London

In conjunction with bike share the idea of Bike Share London was born. It is the place to share the knowledge and experience of cyclists. There are currently more than 1000 such places in London, so to give cycling users a good idea of how to support those who benefit from this new movement, we've created a detailed website listing the locations of many of these places. To help you find better info, we'll also share where these bike share projects are scheduled, in the UK.

We hope you enjoy this website, as well as knowing more by taking a look at the site's highlights.

This information (as well as other information published by CyclingTips) is based entirely on data from the London Cycling Statistics Agency (LUCAS), which is the official body covering the national statistics about cycling.
