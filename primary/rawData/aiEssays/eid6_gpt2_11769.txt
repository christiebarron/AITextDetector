The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, they had to go through a rigorous set of inspection procedures to ensure a safe docking facility. Second, the Federal Aviation Administration has strict rules regarding a dirigible's size; the first was an issue that forced Boeing to go with a smaller aircraft.

The second obstacle was that, despite several years worth of test flights, nobody had done a comprehensive look of the jet to make sure a safe docking location was not required.

Once the company secured a docking place at the Pentagon, the company was allowed to go down to the hangar to watch, according to a document from 2012, before the aircraft was officially unveiled for the first time at the 2012 Defense Business Aviation Roundtable.

"This was the real deal," said Frank Wilkins, director of the Government Accounting Office who led the analysis.

The aircraft was a Boeing 757, called the C-Series. Wilkins noted that more than half of the $16 billion in federal aircraft sales have been the C-Series. As a result of that, Wilkins said, Boeing had spent about $1 million on the new aircraft in the past four years. If that's not bad enough, the cost of the C-Series is estimated to be about $1.3 billion a year.

The C-Series is a twin-engine jet designed by Lockheed Martin that goes well with the 767, 7
