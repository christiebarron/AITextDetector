The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

They were hampered by the fact that they lacked the space needed to add the "space shuttle" to the structure, and some worried that the new vehicles would eventually fill in the gaps in the existing structure. However, a $2.3 million federal grant to the state came along, and the state began construction of the building that year. These new vehicles would take a step back in time, with the first flying in on May 1, 1948. As the year went on, only five were seen in use in orbit, two more were built in 1950, three more in 1960, two more in 1970, and one more in 1971. The remaining four, made of aluminum, saw service in 1963. A third set was built in 1977, when the state announced it would build an extra six. In December 1979, the project was finished, and it was completed in February 1982.

The first stage of the new Empire State Building.

As a part of its engineering program, the Department of Transportation put out a call for people for assistance working with the design of the Empire State Building to get it up and running. Most of the problems could be removed, but many others were needed and created new challenges, such as the necessity for the entire structure to be in a horizontal arrangement. Construction was delayed until February of 1995.
