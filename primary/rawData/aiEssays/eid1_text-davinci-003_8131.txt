The construction of the Empire State Building between 1930 and 1931 presented several obstacles to creating a dock that could facilitate the docking of dirigibles. At this time, there was great excitement over air transport, so much so that the idea of attaching a mooring mast to the highest point of one of the world's tallest structures seemed a natural fit. This particular style of mooring a dirigible would have been relatively new, and both the architecture firm Shreve, Lamb & Harmon, who were in charge of the building’s design, and then landlord Empire State Incorporated, were faced with a fresh and unique challenge.

The design of a base for the mooring mast that could withstand the strong winds common in the Empire State Building's vicinity was a major obstacle. The strong drafts that blew through Manhattan, as well as across the building itself, posed a particular threat to any lighter-than-air ship attempting to dock via the mast. Careful consideration had to be taken in order to ensure the mast and its associated structures would remain stable. 

The dirigible’s 100,000 cubic foot hull was another factor to consider. It was constructed with strong materials that could carry enough mass to make the journey to the Empire State Building. This meant that the mast must be outfitted to never fail under the weight of such a large craft. Specifically, the mainmast had to be constructed with steel that was specially hardened in order to withstand the
