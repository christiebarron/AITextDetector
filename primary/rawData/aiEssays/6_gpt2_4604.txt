The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. There was the fact that a big chunk of the structure could not withstand the vibrations that would be experienced from a huge crane or a car. This became a problem. The building builders had to rely on traditional wooden frame construction, which was very expensive.

"However, what is important is not what kind of equipment it will do but what kind of parts you will need. For instance, the crane will need to be heavy enough that it needs to be able to lift about 6-7 of the ceiling and over it can make many problems. In that way it's better to have an equipment of suitable dimensions."
