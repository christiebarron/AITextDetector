I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a terrible idea. Any content that encourages terrorism in our society and spreads disinformation, no matter how well-intentioned, is harmful.

Please make sure you read this, and I look forward to working with you and other anti-censorship advocates.

The Anti-Corruption Law in Germany

Germany also introduced the anti-corruption law on June 13, 2018.

"Corruption is a legal term which means that a person in charge of an office holds financial or political interests that are directly related to corruption of public or private sector institutions and other public, state or private entities. When an office is subject to a tax which, in certain circumstances and in certain circumstances, constitutes criminal or corruption, its tax is a tax on the person acting upon the office for that configuration."

A very long article about Denmark's anti-corruption law in the Danish parliament.

In July, 2015 an anti-corruption tribunal found that the Ministry of Education of Denmark's department head had "exchanged employment relations" with a Finnish school administrator after receiving a "false and misleading statement with a reference to the government of Finland."

In August, 2017 Denmark's anti-corruption office found that the Ministry of Education of Denmark "employed a school principal engaged in child abuse" who was "in possession of false and misleading representations."
