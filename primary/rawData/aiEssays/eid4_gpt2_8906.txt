The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it is about a man who is brought up Mormon and has had his life changed by an earthquake. What does this do? As the author of another two books, he provides an alternative framework to that of the popular LDS-led narrative. We know Mormonism as the religion the author's friends and family members had in mind when they were raised. A second book will be released soon, titled "The Story of Salt Lake." In the meantime, if you want to get involved, find an online membership list (http://www.rheavenlyleaves.org/) and join a group on The Mormon Blog where new members can join any time. If you are looking forward to going to Salt Lake for the holiday season, please check out the news, meet some of the missionaries here at the local church, or ask around for an update via email at rheavenlyleaves.org.
