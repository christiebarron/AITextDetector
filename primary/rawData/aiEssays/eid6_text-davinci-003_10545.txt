The Empire State Building has loomed over the Manhattan skyline since its 1931 completion and has become a timeless symbol of New York City. One of the most fascinating, albeit short lived, moments in the iconic skyscraper’s history involves its unique ability to dock dirigibles, or airships, during the mid 1930s. Although briefly successful, several obstacles ensured that dirigible docking would never become a long term prospect. 

The very first challenge faced by the Empire State Building was simply finding a way to safely connect the dirigible to the building. The structure wasn’t quite designed to receive an airship in the first place; it didn't have the support needed to accommodate a dirigible. The solution came in the form of a telescoping mooring mast which was constructed atop the building’s 78th floor. The mast was 140-foot tall spire which included a steel cable which ran all the way to the ground for a sturdy and reliable connection. 

The next step was to create a way to route the dirigible cable down through the building in order to be connected to ground tethers. This was accomplished by drilling a 52-foot hole down through the Empire State Building’s floors. To complete this process, the builders first had to ensure the mast was tall enough to reach the top of the dirigible and reduce its speed. Once the cable was installed, tethered to the ground, and the dirigible was
