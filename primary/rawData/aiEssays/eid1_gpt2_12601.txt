Computers have many effects on people. They have some impact on people's physical health (e.g., their perception of stress, stress tolerance) and their cognitive ability, e.g. their ability to process information more quickly. However, we believe the impact of these effects on mental health impacts on both cognitive ability and behavior.

Our objective was to determine whether people with a disability were underreporting mental functioning of others to better understand how a child or teenager is affected by these effects of some age of disability.

Methods We used the Children's Online Survey (CAPS, 1998) and the National Research Council's (NCR, 2000) Mental Health Survey (MHI) to identify and examine whether people with various types of autism had been or are more likely to report mental health problems to the government or public, such as mental health disorders, physical problems, family problems, substance abuse, or other serious medical problems (see Table 2 for more detail). Participants in CAPS, 1997 and 2001, also collected information concerning self-reports of mental health problems and problems faced in adolescence, and reported problems with children, adults, and those living in different populations at age 3 and under. The National Research Council's (NCR, 2000) Mental Health Survey (MHI) was used to identify and assess educational and self-reported problems with autism in the context of educational and self-reported issuesPrivate and public information: information about child, adolescent, and adult health problems (
