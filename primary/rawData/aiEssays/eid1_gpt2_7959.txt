Computers have many effects on people. In fact, it should come as no surprise that there are some people who believe that programming can be used to make everything right.

"Our focus is on making it easy to make good connections between computer systems," said Dr. Rangas. "At the same time, it's important that systems remain accessible to the human mind. It doesn't take much effort to make a computer more readable. It should be free of human errors and can be used without many human errors. Computer systems have problems accessing their data," Dr. Rangas said.

As mentioned above, programs may work well with computers, but they may not without a system's faults and errors.
