Dear Editor,

As we move farther into the twenty-first century, computers and technology have become increasingly intertwined in our everyday life. Consumers, business professionals, and everyday people have become dependent on computers and the Internet in many aspects. However, the effects computers have on people should be considered carefully before allowing them to become too heavily integrated into our lives.

Computers can be a great benefit to people with intellectually stimulating activities such as research, coding, and various other technologies. Unfortunately, computers also bring with them a darker side. Too much time using computers can lead to physical inactivity, such as increased rates of obesity and poor muscle development, as well as mental health issues, such as increased anxiety and depression.

Additionally, computers limit the creative process in some ways. For example, the lack of a personal touch in computerized communication has led to a decreased ability to create meaningful relationships with others. Furthermore, excessive computer use can make it difficult for teenagers and young adults to use their own initiative and judgment in decision-making.

It is important for individuals to take note of this vulnerability and be conscious of how they use their computers. People need to be aware of their computer habits and try to encourage activities that keep them physically and mentally active. It is essential to remain alert to the dangers of computer addiction, so that people can continue to use technology with caution and to the benefit of their health and productivity.

I would urge your readers to reflect
