Dear Editor,

First off, I would like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to express my opinion about the effects computers have on people. As we all know, computers are increasingly becoming an integral part of our lives. They are more present in our daily activities than ever before and, to my mind, their effects on people are both positive and negative.

On the positive side, computers help to simplify and speed up various tasks, increasing efficiency in our work lives and home lives. They also provide us with access to a world of information, helping us stay connected to friends, family, and events around the world. Furthermore, computers open up the opportunity to learn new skills and hobbies that bring pleasure and intellectual stimulation to our lives.

On the other hand, computers can also have some negative effects on people. Through computer screens, people can become isolated and socially withdrawn. Excessive use of computers can also lead to sleep deprivation, poorer concentration, and headaches.

In conclusion, I believe that computers have a powerful effect on how we live and should be used thoughtfully, but not excessively. We should be aware of both the positive and negative aspects of computers and use them consciously and in moderation.
