I was walking home from school one afternoon when I noticed an old man sitting on a bench on the sidewalk. As I walked past him, he waved at me with a huge smile on his face and asked, “Do you have time for an old man’s story?” Feeling a bit apprehensive, I hesitantly agreed and took a seat by his side.

He went on to tell me a rather outlandish story, punctuating it with exaggerated gestures and funny faces. As his story progressed, he would look up at me expectantly and every time I couldn’t help but laugh out loud. We sat there for a good while, my occasional laughter and his enthralling story binding us together in an unexpected yet strangely comforting way.

When we finally said our goodbyes, I felt strangely sad. I thanked him for such a fun afternoon, but I found myself wanting to stay in that moment longer. It was a reminder to me to not take life too seriously, to appreciate the seemingly small moments and that laughter can bring unexpected joy into our lives.
