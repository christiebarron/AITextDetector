Dear Editor,

The world today is run by technology, and the most significant part of that is computers. There is no denying the role computers have come to play in our lives. From helping with our work to playing a game for leisure, they are everywhere.

On the one hand, computers can be a great tool to help people be creative, efficient and productive. They can make a complicated task simpler and easier for people and can help people to stay connected with family and friends in different places.

On the other hand, there can be a negative impact on people who overuse computers. It can lead to social isolation, lack of self-esteem and the inability to connect with people face to face. People can also be exposed to cyberbullying and online predators.

Given the pros and cons outlined above, I believe that computers should be used in moderation. It's important to keep in mind the potential long-term effects that computers can have on people, both good and bad.

I urge readers to think of the effects of computers on people, and I encourage them to use them appropriately and mindfully.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
