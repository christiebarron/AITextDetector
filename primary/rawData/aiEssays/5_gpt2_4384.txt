The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is no stranger to the literary world. In fact, the entire season focuses on its Helen Bracken, the mother of a 14-year-old girl kidnapped from a relative's bed.

'We wrote as a team,' says Bracken. 'We looked at ourselves in the mirror, wondering, 'What if she is really important?' And delightful, 'I don't think she is. At some point, it's time to take her out.' "When we started writing 'From Home is' we did what any novel would do, we put it out on the road from first to last, then to last, and then, finally, to the end.' As a writer, it's important to know what drives you, it's important to write without losing focus. To me that's what made the book so special, a testament to the depth of the reader who could never have been an actual writer. On the other hand, we didn't feel like giving up on her before. What made the novel so special as a writer was that, no matter what, it felt, through it, in her body. A book that was filled with moments of love and laughter and passion. And that meant that 'From Home is' gave us a place to leave our house in person. We wanted to show the world a very real and hopeful homecoming.

'From Home is' begins on October 7
