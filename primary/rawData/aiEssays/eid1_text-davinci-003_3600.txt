I still remember the first time I laughed with my boyfriend so vividly. We had been together for a few months and I was still caught up in trying to be the best version of me around him all the time. I kept my thoughts and feelings to myself and wasn't particularly open with him.

Anyway, one day we decided to have a picnic in the park and we could both tell it was going to be a little awkward. We started making small talk and I could sense the tension in the air. 

Then, all of a sudden, he made a joke about one of his family members. I had heard him use the same joke a few times before but I hadn't ever laughed at it. This time I couldn't help but let out a big chuckle and I saw a smile break out on his face.

The tension immediately melted away and we both laughed until our sides hurt. From that moment on, I felt like I could be my true self around him and we easily developed a strong relationship built on mutual respect, trust and, of course, laughter.
