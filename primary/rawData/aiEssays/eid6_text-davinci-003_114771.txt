The Empire State Building was constructed in the 1930s, and while it was the world’s tallest building at the time, the structure was also constructed with a unique feature—that was even more extraordinary and ambitious for its time—a docking mast that could accommodate dirigibles. In the non-fiction book, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building experienced in allowing dirigibles to dock atop the building are explored. 

The Empire State Building boasts a magnificent mast in its design—a docking tower to be utilized by the blimps of the day. The mast was designed to be roughly similar to the structure of a ship's mast, 140 feet tall and 20 feet in circumference, made of steel with a wooden staircase inside. Constructing the mast, however, was an immense undertaking as the architects had to make sure that the top did not move in the slightest when dirigibles moor to it. Making sure that the structure was able to withstand the effects of winds, gusts and the sheer force of the blimps was a difficult obstacle to overcome. In addition to the mast's stability, architects also had to figure out how the dirigibles would be able to maneuver into position. 

Another challenge had to do with providing a comfortable and safe disembarking for the passengers of the dirigibles. The team of architects wanted people to have access to the building
