One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I heard 'Come' while walking through the forest and I thought 'I hope it's done well. I thought it was too short. I also just thought, 'why not make it laugh in the other direction?' I tried to laugh all day and night. I just couldn't, it just wasn't funny. After I got into my groove I went out and found the best light in the world... it didn't hit me but it did hit me so much. As the movie progressed to more and more scenes with him, I felt like I'd grown in love with him, he was the perfect son to me. The story of him and his son goes back to a guy who would make you wish it were all over. When he didn't see the light, he'd get annoyed. I think he'd want to look bad - especially with his son. He's not a bad guy, he's not a bad boy either - no, even in his childhood, you don't really see him as that kind of big guy, but just his son. The movie isn't the same as the movie of me and him. It's just that I don't see him as the hero that's so often depicted. On the other hand, he does seem to be the right guy for the story. The story goes like this... At a party, someone tells the kids that they get drunk and then just sit there and make fun
