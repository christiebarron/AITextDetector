Censorship in libraries has become a debate in recent years, with people on both sides claiming that their beliefs should be indicated by the materials that are shelved in libraries. While censorship may seem like an effective solution to some people, it is not the proper step to take when it comes to libraries.

First of all, libraries should remain neutral on controversial matters. By removing materials or silencing certain points of view, libraries would be trying to push their members into a specific opinion. This type of influence is damaging to libraries’ reputations, as the purpose of a library is to provide information rather than to express opinion.

Second, censorship can effectively limit both education and freedom of expression. Before making a decision to remove an item from shelves, people should ask themselves whether the item could provide a valuable point of view to its readers. As a source of accessible education, libraries should provide open access to material that might be deemed offensive by some people, as it allows people to form their own opinions.

Finally, censorship only works to suppress discussion rather than addressing the source of the issue. If the library removes materials that challenge a certain perspective, people who support that perspective will never be inspired to defend it. This limits their opportunity to explore different sides of a discussion and undermines the library’s mission of providing and disseminating knowledge.
