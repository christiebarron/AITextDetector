 

I knew that today was going to be particularly difficult. I had an overwhelming amount of work to do, but I knew I had to remain patient. It wasnâ€™t easy to stay motivated as I knew I had a long day ahead of me. 

I reminded myself to take things one step at a time. This was the only way I was going to be able to finish all of the work I needed to do. I started with the most difficult assignment and worked my way down to the more manageable tasks. 

I eventually worked my way through everything, which felt like a huge accomplishment. I was proud of myself for being so patient and sticking with it even when it seemed like the tasks all blended together. My patience paid off in the end, and it felt great to know I could be resilient in the face of difficulty.
