I remember a time when I was visiting my parents' home. My mom had planned an elaborate dinner, and I was looking forward to it. It was a special occasion, and we were expecting a few of my relatives to join us. Mom had been hard at work preparing all day and my dad had to take care of some errands.

When dinner time rolled around, my dad was still not back yet. I could tell my mom was getting tense. She wanted everything to go perfectly and the delay was causing her to worry. In spite of her anxiety, she put on a brave face and tried to stay calm. 

I will always remember and admire her patience as she waited for my dad to return. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, he came home. We quickly got the dinner table set and everyone enjoyed the meal.

I learned a valuable lesson that day, watching my mom stay calm and patient in spite of the delay and uncertainty. It reminded me that sometimes we have to be patient and trusting of the bigger picture, even when things don't go as planned.
