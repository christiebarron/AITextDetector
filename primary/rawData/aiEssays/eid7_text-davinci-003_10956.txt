I will never forget a time when I had to be incredibly patient. I had the opportunity to travel overseas to visit one of my best friends who had recently moved. Since I had never been abroad before, I was very excited for the long-awaited trip.

The day that I started my travels, I expected to be on a direct flight to my destination. Little did I know, my flight plan has changed, and I had to take two separate flights instead. It was a huge inconvenience, but rather than letting my disappointment show, I remained patient and understanding.

To make matters worse, my second flight was delayed over two hours. I knew that if I had gotten upset, it wouldnâ€™t have changed the situation, so I decided to stay calm and use the time to find some good books at the airport bookstore.

Finally, when the flight was ready to board, I was so relieved. As I got to my final destination, I felt proud that I was able to remain patient during such a long journey. That experience taught me a valuable lesson of the importance of being calm and understanding during times of adversity.
