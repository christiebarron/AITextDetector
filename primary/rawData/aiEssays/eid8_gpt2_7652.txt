One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was a kid, having spent 12 years doing all kinds of activities that made me stand out, not just for being the best person, but for my work ethic and selflessness. And that's my proudest accomplishment: We were the best at it.

When I was in college, I learned that I could still take on a job doing something. I figured that I had the job to help others become better, and I wanted to help others to be better. I knew that I could do something that I don't take too seriouslyâ€”something about building character and keeping one's growing self together.

Well, the process started around 2008 (where I graduated from MIT, to write this book). Then the thing happened. It happened with many different guys. I learned that I was a little self-deprecating. We made a lot of decisions at this point. I had an amazing relationship with a lot of guys, but I knew that after all of that, I still had my job to do. There is a part of me that is afraid to even take risks when it comes to this. I realized I had to do something different. I wanted to learn from all the great guys. That's what has made it special: That's what makes it meaningful.

My job has always been to help Limbaugh and his followers find their voice. That was the main goal.
