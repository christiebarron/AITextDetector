The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it will give us a new insight into a person's unique way of behaving, its connection to the world and the way we feel about his future. I was intrigued by this book in the previous ones, so I will continue to do that. I am very excited to start a blog as well.

The most interesting thing about the book is that as you become more advanced, you will make it harder to talk to kids. In this book, you cannot tell young people how to interact with others and how to tell older ones about their lives. This is a real problem, because children are not always adults as they should be. It was really hard and I have very fond memories of how I got up on the street and told my mom, "What do you want me to do?" and they all said, "We need to talk to each other. We know how to talk to each other." The thing is like, how could this be? The books do talk about the impact, but we can't tell young people. You don't know how to talk to each other. It's like talking to a child who is blind, and they Remember everything they see from your parents. All you can do is follow what you imagine is a bad dream you have in mind, and you lose track of what you are seeing.

I have to say, I love it now because of the book so much. Also
