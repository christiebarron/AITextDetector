The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' was so good that she came back to the world of comics, with the hope that it would bring some hope to a lonely age. For the first time in the series, Ms. Shorter would go to her hospital bed and start taking a break from publishing. "When she woke up, with her first big-screen image of her, it almost dawned on her," he says. "She wasn't in a lot of shape. She was a little bit older, and still with some strength, but she was feeling slightly weak and almost a bit embarrassed." After a few months reading the memoir, he became addicted to the series. He now says, "It's an enjoyable story about friendship, and I have a lot of love for her." His current work spans many genres, including stand-up, comedy, horror, crime fiction, mystery and fantasy. He has been interviewed by The New York Times and the Daily Mail, all of which covered the book. His Twitter feed is @PunchieDrowned.
