To the editors,

I am writing to express my opinion concerning the effects computers have on people. As technology has become a major part of our everyday lives, there is no denying the many positive effects computers have had on society.

From an educational point of view, computers have enabled us to access vast amounts of information with the click of a button. Students have access to an unparalleled amount of resources not available prior to the computer-age, allowing them to become more well-rounded and informed. Additionally, computers have enabled us to become more productive with our work as well as research projects.

Computers have opened up a world of entertainment and connectivity. Games and virtual learning environments have enhanced learning and, while providing a great source of entertainment, can reduce stress. Finally, computers have helped bring people together. We can easily keep in touch with friends and family members, no matter how far away they are, through email, video chat, and social media.

In short, computers provide countless benefits that cannot be overlooked. Through the technology, we can access a variety of resources and expand our knowledge in difficult subjects. We can easily connect with like-minded individuals, explore for an endless amount of entertainment possibilities,
