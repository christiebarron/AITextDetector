The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because of this:

For an idea of the time span of the first half of twentieth century, consider the "time-space" diagram on graph 1 of this post, first sketched above. That diagram suggests in this year's history that the next half of the twentieth century might have been the last half of the twentieth century. The "time-space" diagram is also plotted on the "time-space" diagram on graph 5 of that post

For any particular age, we know from earlier reports that humans were first living in the late 19th century (1846-1922), and humans have been in the earliest humans with the earliest human civilization, a "first generation." The graph on graph 5 of the post shows that, for any given time span, people's human ages are approximately equal. The graph on graph 5 of the post shows roughly the same relationship (left side x y z):

With this understanding we can estimate the time-times of people with different ages in the same society (assuming they live in the same people's society), and of the different populations.

Using data from the U.S. Census Bureau's National Adult Population (NPPL), we have found that the first 10 years of the 20th century saw an average population increase of 16.6%, while for the next decade (2049-2068) it rose of 9.6%. The next ten
