 

As I walked into my friend's birthday party, the room bustled with laughter and conversation. I felt my heart warm as I saw my friend, surrounded by family and friends as they made jokes and teased her for being another year older. 

I found a spot on the floor and started watching the chaos that surrounded me. As the party went on, I began to notice a person on the other side of the room looking a little bit uncomfortable. I gestured for them to come over and join in on the fun with us all. 

The person had an apprehensive look on their face. I wanted to make the person feel welcome, so I cracked a joke to lighten the mood. To my surprise, the person burst out into a hearty laughter, releasing their worries and anxieties. Seeing the positive affect of the laughter, I continued to tell funny stories and jokes, joining in with the merriment my friends were sharing. 

Soon enough, the person was part of the conversation and sharing their own jokes and experiences. I was so glad to have had the opportunity to bring the person into the circle and share in the laughter with everyone. It truly was amazing how laughter can bring people together and have such an impact. 

In that moment, I felt grateful to be part of such an amazing and fun group of people, and it was the power of laughter that had made it all happen.
