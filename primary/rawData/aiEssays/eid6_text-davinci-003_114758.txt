The dream of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building was a bold one, with plenty of obstacles to overcome. The designers and builders of the building had to battle several major challenges in order to make the mooring mast a reality.

The first challenge was the location of the building. Located in the heart of Manhattan, space was scarce for such a massive project. Manhattan has a very dense population and the probability of a dirigible colliding with another structure or a person posed a serious risk. The Empire State Building had to clear a large area directly in front of the building on 326th Ave to safety hazard of a potential crash and debris.

The second obstacle was the design of the building. The building was extremely tall and narrow and the mooring mast had to be built symmetrically centered to ensure the airships could moor properly. The designers had to develop an elaborate system of guy wires and strong steel cables fixed to the roof of the building in order to keep the structure secure and stable.Wind-resistant plates were also attached along the sides at varying angles to optimize cross winds, or else the dirigibles risked causing too much strain on the building.

The next challenge was engineering the mooring mast itself. The mast had to be built to withstand the force of an airship docking and prevent it from toppling over. The designers managed to build a concrete caisson filled with 400 tons of steel and concrete into the
