Dear Editor,

I am writing this letter to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. I believe computers have the potential to both enrich and debilitate our lives.

Life before computers was much different for us. People went to the library to do research, they respected teachers more, and they had to actually get out and meet people to socialize. Now with computers, people have become more organized, efficient, and connected. On the plus side, computers give us access to a virtually endless amount of information that would have been impossible to amass before their invention. They have allowed us to make connections through social media, communications, and collaborative research.

At the same time, however, this convenience has had a downside. Computers have altered our behavior, both mentally and physically. They have led us to become more sedentary, time-starved, and uncertain of our future. Even more concerning is the effect computers are having on our youth. Studies have revealed that they are increasingly facing mental and physical health issues from being over-connected and overly exposed to digital environments.

I believe that computers should be used responsibly and should not be used excessively as they can cause serious damage to one's physical, mental, and emotional health. As such, I hope that my fellow readers will agree with me that computer usage should be limited and monitored.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
