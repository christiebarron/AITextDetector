I was out on a date with my now long-term partner. We had been together a few months and had been getting to know each other pretty well. We were having dinner when suddenly she cracked a joke that made me burst out laughing. I was literally doubled over in my seat because it was so unexpected and funny. 

My partner was taken aback by how hard I was laughing and started giggling as well. We then spent the next hour or so just sitting there laughing, sharing more and more jokes with each other until our sides ached. 

It was a moment that I will never forget. From that evening on, we knew we could always rely on the other to make us laugh. Looking back, it was one of the moments that cemented us as a couple and we have been together ever since.
