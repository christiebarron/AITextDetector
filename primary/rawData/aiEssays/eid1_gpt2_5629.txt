Computers have many effects on people. They are influenced by all kinds of psychological influences, and so one of the most important influences is the social role models that they have in the study of human behavior."

A new study from the University of Colorado at Boulder is helping solve the puzzle. This time, they report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that people can become very conscious about their own feelings about social issues as they cope with social situations. The researchers then found a "new neural pathway to the social process" that helped people decide whether they would be self-aware and not, even when they were not conscious.

The results of the study, which is published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggest that the same neural pathway may also be responsible for recognizing that someone must be "fully aware of others' feelings of helplessness and hopelessness."

This new pathway may lead to less feelings of fear of self, but it is not sufficient to make a person self-aware. In such cases, these fears are not limited to negative feelings and should be considered more of a symptom rather than a cause.
