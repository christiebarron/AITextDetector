An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when a patient who was dying from a virus. Someone he was close to had been infected with Ebola. That's when things began to work out pretty well with him, and we sort of got through the early part of his life."

However, the new study doesn't give proof that his illness was caused by Ebola. They also note that not all patients are the same, with some cases of acute cases potentially becoming the focal cause of disease in others. That's why it's important to look for things that should not be seen as a causal connection, such as lack of healthcare, lack of access to care and lack of healthcare facilities.

The researchers note that some of the symptoms may be not quite as prominent as they might seem. For instance, Ebola symptoms can last two or three weeks in isolation, and while some symptoms may be more common in late symptoms, they can take several months before they get better enough to cause a significant symptom disturbance.

"While some of these other symptoms may have nothing to do with the virus, they represent a small sample size of early symptoms," said G.L. Miller at Duke University in North Carolina. "It's not hard to point out that many individuals seem to have these very early problems and the only way to find out who they are is to look for them early." She added that some of the early symptoms are in people who have not had a chance to
