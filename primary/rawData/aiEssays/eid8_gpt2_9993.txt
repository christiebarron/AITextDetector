One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was sitting on my sofa with my husband just sitting in front of the television and watching the world. In that situation I went all laughing and laughing with his help. It felt good.

The other day I noticed that I had experienced a big change. I was being more mindful of our food options and even went to the farmer's market. As I listened to the farmers' market when I was in front of the TV with the kids I found myself thinking, this isn't the best thing. The farmer's market, which is a very good thing. But the question is who is being more mindful of the consumer for something like this to come in and see.

The other time I was at an event I was at in the countryside. When the first line up for the event started with many people in red t-shirts, I said, "This is how everyone is," and my eyes lit up and I said, "This is how everyone is." In the end I lost that confidence. I was so embarrassed by myself that I looked over at my daughter and she came up to me, said, "I'm just looking at you and you're smiling," and I said, "That's the one!" I was so ashamed because then I was too embarrassed to look at the farmer's market!

How often have you seen something that's different to what you were thinking after you've felt something?
