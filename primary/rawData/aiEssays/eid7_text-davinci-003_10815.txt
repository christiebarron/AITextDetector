I remember feeling a combination of excitement and anxiety as I waited for my interview results. I had applied to a highly competitive program, and I knew my chances of getting in were slim. I spent a lot of time preparing by reading up on the program and practicing for potential questions. I was sad, frustrated, and anxious every time I checked my email for the results. When I finally received the news that I had been placed on the waiting list, I was discouraged.

Instead of giving up and feeling defeated, I decided to be patient and optimistic. I decided to use this time to strengthen my application. I really did my best to remain positive. Each day, I read articles on the programâ€™s website, connected with alumni, and worked on my personal essays. I also worked hard to be a leader in my own community.

Eventually, my patience paid off. It was a long journey, but after a few months of hard work and dedication, I was accepted off the waiting list. I was thrilled, and it reminded me that patience really pays off in the end.
