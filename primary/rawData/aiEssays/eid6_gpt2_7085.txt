The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In 1825, the United States Supreme Court ruled that dirigibles could be used for any type of office where the use was necessary to obtain insurance. But the "Duty of Access," by contrast, allowed dirigibles for transportation. If a party is unable to access their office on time, dirigibles will be available.

The first of these dirigibles was made of aluminum alloy. It had steel doors and was used to connect offices to the ground. This was the first and only dirigible to ship and make dirigible planes. The second dirigible in use, a dirigible in a cargo boat, was a modified German-made dirigible that flew on autopilot as a catapult.
