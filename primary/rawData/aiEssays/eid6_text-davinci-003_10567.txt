In the early 20th century, the idea of having large airships dock on high rise buildings seemed like an ambitious but no doubt achievable goal. This is exactly what the builders of the Empire State Building hoped to do by allowing dirigibles to dock at its summit. Despite the countless amounts of dedication towards this difficult project, its architects were confronted with numerous obstacles along the way.

The main problem surrounding this ambition was related to picking a method of which to allow the dirigible to dock safely yet efficiently. After consulting with German zeppelin engineers, it was decided that creating a mooring mast to attach the airship was the best form of action. This mast would be several hundred feet tall and constructed with steel and concrete to make it structurally sound and enduring enough to host the vessels. As such, one of the most difficult obstacles was transporting and assembling the materials required to construct the mast. Steel parts had to be shipped from Pittsburgh and hauled up the building’s mast by hand, making the task incredibly labor intensive.

The second obstacle the builders faced was unfavorable weather. Wind, rain, and other meteorological phenomena posed safety risks that hindered the mast’s normal installation process. To increase speed, part of the mast had to be created first on the ground, then lifted and fastened into place. In the fear of leaving the ship in an unconventional yet ultimately more exposed location, the builders had to rush the decision to finish the mast and
