The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. At the height of its development, many builders chose non-residential-style "spaceside attractions," such as the Chrysler Building or the California Building. The new design, developed by architect Edward G. Toth, sought to create a more compact environment with fewer moving parts and more amenities in a relatively confined space. Some critics criticized the location for its lack of access to utilities and the large number of people aboard who took the unusual measures. A few developers who were unhappy with the location and its lack of visibility and mobility also faced problems in planning their designs. The first of these was proposed by an engineering student at a college in Oklahoma City who proposed using a "light, portable, and air-tight" structure for the large central elevator shaft or for a third-floor corridor through which workers could stand in a more comfortable position as workers made their way through the building to a job. A second of these proposals developed by another engineering class also suggested using a light, portable, and air-tight facility for the large corridor beneath the main elevator. When the building construction manager of the university called upon the state to provide the transportation systems with a "filtration" system, the problem became apparent: the high-occupancy elevator was moving slower than the standard freight elevator. A third option suggested by another student proposed a second "transit system" -- the equivalent of the existing rail and bus system
