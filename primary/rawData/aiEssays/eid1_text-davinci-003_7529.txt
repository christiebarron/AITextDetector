The author ends the story with this message of hope and optimism. The protagonist is feeling overwhelmed by her studies and the difficult test that she needs to take, but at the end of the story she is reminded that there will be a new cycle in spring time which means her failure is only temporary and she will have an opportunity to take the test again. The metaphor of the hibiscus in the winter, which is usually a symbol of life and beauty, highlights the idea that despite the hardship of cold and snow, life will continue and bloom again when the warmth returns. This is symbolic of how the protagonist should persevere and overcome her current difficulties, for new and brighter opportunities will arise in time.
