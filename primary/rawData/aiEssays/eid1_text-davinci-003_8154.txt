In the early 1930s, the construction of the Empire State Building posed a unique set of obstacles to enable dirigibles to dock atop the building. While it was recognized that the ship was of a size and design that demanded innovative solutions, the lack of precedent in constructing a large enough mooring mast limited the possibilities available. As Marcia Amidon Lüsted writes in her article ‘The Mooring Mast’, the height of the building, alongside the limited resources of the time, meant that constructing a tall enough mast that could withstand the strong winds and other elements of New York City’s weather, was a challenge. 

Like any major construction project, there were limitations to the use of the resources available at the time. In order to overcome the problem of constructing a mast that was tall and strong enough, the engineers proposed a solution to strengthen the steel mast. This was to be done using a combination of triangular braces and structural steel plates, similar to that used in aircraft industry. This combination of materials was designed to give the mast the additional strength that it needed to withstand strong winds and other conditions. 

The mast had to be designed in such a way that it would be visible to oncoming dirigibles, and hence had to remain within the height restrictions imposed by the city ordinances. The engineers had to take into account the extra buoyancy of the airship, so that the dirigible would land safely onto the mast. To
