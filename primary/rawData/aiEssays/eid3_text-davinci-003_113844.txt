In the short story, ‘Rough Road Ahead’ by Joe Kurmaski, the features of the setting have a big effect on the cyclist in the story. 

The main character, the cyclist, embarks on a long journey along a rural road, and the setting of this road becomes important for understanding his experience. At the start of the journey, the road is flat and open, making it easy to ride and allowing the cyclist to relax. The weather is beautiful and the surrounding area is peaceful and serene. There are no other cyclists, so the cyclist can enjoy the feeling of being alone with his thoughts and the world around him.

Further along, the setting changes. The road starts to become rocky and steep, challenging the cyclist’s endurance. The weather also changes, becoming hot and oppressive.
