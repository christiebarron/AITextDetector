My car broke down while I was on my way back home from work one night, and I soon found myself stuck on the side of the road with no idea what to do. Fortunately, a kindly tow truck driver came by and offered to help me out. I was grateful for his assistance but I could tell that he had been on the road for a while and was in a rush to get off. 

Nevertheless, he was incredibly patient with me. He called ahead to check which mechanics were open late, gave me advice on which ones to call and even stayed with me until I was able to arrange for a tow. He was so friendly and helpful - even though I knew he had a long day ahead of him.

I could sense his impatience, but he never showed it. He never made me feel like he was in a rush and instead took the time to make sure I had everything I needed. That night, I learned that being patient with others can make a world of difference in difficult situations.
