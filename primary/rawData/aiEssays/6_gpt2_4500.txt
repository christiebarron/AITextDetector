In December, the government took its first step toward building dirigibles on the site by approving a tax on the fuel for combustion vehicles, the first of its kind. This was a necessary step toward the development of a vehicle capable of carrying heavy loads as efficiently as a motor. But the state's reluctance to adopt more efficient cars was also evident to the builders.
