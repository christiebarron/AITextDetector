The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it offers a deeper account of a life that includes a profound understanding of how you can live up to a high level of self defense, with all forms of self-control and self-preservation.

From being a child, learning how to read, to working out and developing your health, to being a writer, to taking the initiative and getting the attention of a real therapist, Winter Hibiscus gives us an insight into the ways you can achieve the impossible, be it a great life or a tragic one. These are hard and exhausting journeys for many of us – those who experience these and those who take the time and effort to learn.

*If you like this book, please check out my book Book: A Life on the Side, which is the perfect introduction to book therapy. My book has been translated into three languages and contains over 2,000 chapters – so I could have expanded the book in many directions. It is also worth pointing out that Winter Hibiscus has been available in a limited edition of over 10,000 copies, to buy for a couple hundred dollars today (for under $60 USD)!
