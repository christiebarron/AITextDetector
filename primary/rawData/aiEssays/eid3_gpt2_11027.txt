When you are driving to work or school in a narrow street you are more likely to experience problems with cross-traffic and crash damage than motorists and cyclists. This is because cross-traffic is often more risky than a car.

The car is also more likely to drive off at a high speed if you see it come down the road at a high rate of speed but that is not guaranteed. And the collision risk is higher if the car runs low on gas and the cyclist is travelling at high speed.
