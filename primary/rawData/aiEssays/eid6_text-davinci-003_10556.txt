Building the Empire State Building in 1931 was a major feat, with construction requiring a tremendous amount of effort and time to successfully complete. One idea for the building was to allow dirigibles to dock near the top of it. While this idea seemed exciting and promising, it was met with numerous obstacles.

One of the most significant obstacles was that the Empire State Building was significantly taller than other buildings in Manhattan, which halted the planning and implementation of mooring masts for dirigibles. At the time, there were regulations in place that limited the height and thickness of mooring masts to just two feet, which would make them nearly impossible to secure to the top of the Empire State Building. This phenomenon also limited the size of the airships themselves, as they required extra space to maneuver around the docking procedure.

Also, the prevailing winds in Manhattan at the time did not allow for navigation of the airships, so it would have been incredibly difficult to safely moor any vehicles to the building. Furthermore, given the height of the building and the force of the wind, the mooring masts would have been subjected to intense structural stress, making it difficult to securely fasten them to the building.

As a result, engineers ran into a variety of issues while trying to come up with a reliable design for the mooring mast that would safely allow dirigibles to docked. According to Marcia Amidon Lüsted’
