 

Dear Editors,

I am writing to express my opinion on the impact computers have on society today. Computers have become necessary for almost every job and activity we partake in, and their influence is undeniable. But perhaps more importantly, computers have both positive and negative effects on people that should be discussed and considered.

On the positive side, computers have been incredibly helpful in providing us with better access to education, communication, entertainment, and even simplifying everyday tasks. For example, there are abundant online platforms for modern-day learning, such as virtual classrooms for students, video conferencing for work meetings, and streaming services to access TV shows. In short, computers can open up a plethora of opportunities for people. 

On the other hand, computers can also have a detrimental effect on people's lifestyle and wellbeing. Too much time spent staring at a computer screen or focused exclusively on technological features can lead to fatigue, lost socialisation, and harm to physical health. Furthermore, people can become addicted to the time they spend on the web, scrolling through social media, or playing video games. 

In conclusion, computers have the power to offer great benefits to society, but also major drawbacks for users,
