I remember a time when I had to be very patient. I was on a crowded bus and there were no empty seats. The bus driver was taking forever to make all the stops so the ride was lasting a lot longer than expected.

People were getting impatient and frustrated, especially because it was hot and there was no air conditioning. I could feel the tension rising on the bus. I knew I had to do something to keep everyone from erupting into chaos. 

So, I took a deep breath and remained calm. I used my most reassuring voice to try and make the situation less stressful for everyone. I said to the people, "Let's just take a step back and stay cool. Weâ€™re almost there. Hang in there everyone."

My words seemed to really help, and the people on the bus began to relax. After a few more stops, we made it to our destination. Everyone was so thankful for the patience I demonstrated on the bus. It felt really good to assist everyone with keeping their cool in such a difficult situation.
