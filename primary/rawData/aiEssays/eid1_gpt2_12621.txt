Computers have many effects on people. I see how people want to change their environment to make more of an impact. The main effect of living in those days, I feel, was being able to take a break from making more money. Because of that, there's the pressure that a lot of young people go through, but to go out on that road where you lose your job but they get paid back, it's a very demanding journey. The amount you're paying to a family in Australia is just incredibly low. So to go to work, in fact, that was very challenging for my parents.

But I would recommend for you to spend a little bit of time getting a job. There are companies there that help you get a job. One of the things they'll ask you about, though, are your social status.
