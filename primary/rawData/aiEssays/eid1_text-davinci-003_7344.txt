The natural features of the road creates a difficult terrain for the cyclist. The road is bumpy and full of gravel and rocks, making it harder to ride a bike on than a paved urban sidewalk. The cyclist must constantly be aware of the road conditions, as they could easily suffer an injury if they make a wrong turn. The trees also create a natural obstacle course for the cyclist, as they cannot see far ahead of them and must maneuver around them in order to continue their journey.

The cyclist is alone, with no one to turn to when things get tough. This adds an extra layer of difficulty to the journey, as the cyclist must rely solely on themselves for motivation and strength.
