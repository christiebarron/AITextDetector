One time I was in line at the grocery store and the person in front of me was reloading her card with cash. The process was taking longer than expected and the line was getting increasingly longer behind me. I could feel the anxiety building up, but I decided to stay close and be patient. I took some deep breaths and imagined that the other customers and I were all in the same boat.

I was reassured when the lady finally completed the task and quickly moved forward. Everyone seemed relieved. After that, I realized that being patient is not always easy, but it often yields positive results. Patience is a virtue that can help us all make the world a better place.
