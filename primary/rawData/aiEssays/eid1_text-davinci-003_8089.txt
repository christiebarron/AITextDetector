The Empire State Building was a groundbreaking construction project, and its developers wanted to make sure the building could accommodate all types of air travelers. One of these forms of air-travel was dirigible docking, an idea that some viewed with both excitement and trepidation. While allowing dirigible docking on the Empire State Building certainly presented some unique challenges, the builders of the building were determined to make it happen. 

Due to the high winds that the building would be subjected to, the developers of the project determined that the structure would need to withstand greater forces than had previously been designed. In order to do this, the builders engineered stronger steel and reinforced the columns and beams of the building with steel diagonals. Additionally, the engineers increased the size of the braces that connected the steel to the concrete. This provided the much needed extra strength and stability necessary to ensure the building could handle the extra force from the dirigible.

The next obstacle to be tackled was the actual attachment of the docking mooring. For the Empire State Building to be able to securely attach the dirigible, they needed an extremely secure and stable mooring mast. This was accomplished through the use of special steel cages that were sunk three stories into the ground. These steel cages were connected to vertical rails that provided added stability for the docking mast. Additionally, these cages provided an anchor point from which the actual mooring attachment points could be cantilevered. 

Finally, it was
