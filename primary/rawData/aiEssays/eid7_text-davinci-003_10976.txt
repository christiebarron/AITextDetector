I'm terrible with computers, so when I started a new job a few weeks ago I knew I'd need some extra patience to get up to speed. My manager was incredibly patient with me and walked me through every step of the onboarding process. He didn't get frustrated or rush me, even when I asked a lot of questions. It took longer than expected to complete the task, but I was able to understand the process and it felt great to feel like I was making progress. My manager was an amazing help and his patience made me feel more comfortable starting this new job.
