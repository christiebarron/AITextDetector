When I was little, I used to hate sitting in my dad's car for long car rides. I remember my dad and I took a road trip to visit my grandparents who lived an eight hour ride away. I had dreaded the long drive and complained the whole way there. I was a typical kid who was short on patience and wanted to get to our destination as soon as possible. 

My dad, however, remained calm and patient through it all. He didn't yell at me or complain once. He instead sang along to the radio or simply chatted with me about what we were seeing along the drive - the rolling hills, the old abandoned buildings - and helped the time go by quickly. 

Even though I still get impatient from time to time, I'm thankful to have a dad who is so patient and understanding in tough situations.
