The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. For one thing, the space elevator was too cramped to fit a single, full-size air conditioner. And although the design included space for four, the building itself might have looked much smoother had the design been simplified and made to accommodate four, an advantage they claim is a bonus and one of the few things a real estate company won't charge anyone to use.

But for the most part, it's not that far apart. They also say the new elevators are only as good as the original plan, and that they will do what they're meant to do.

What makes their solution even better, however, is the fact that the architects who made the plans say that having four vertical walls is a sure bet that at some point there is going to be something there where a big piece of steel really does come down in to the ceiling. The building's plans, which have been approved by the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors and filed with the City Council in February, allow for that.

They say they've got $2M in the bank, which is enough to continue building for the next 40 years, though it may not be enough to meet the needs of the average developer just yet.
