The builders of the Empire State Building faced an incredible challenge when they decided to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the tower. They needed to find a suitable design for the docking platform, create a mechanical system to safely secure the airships, and figure out a means to provide the necessary supplies to crew. Additionally, they needed to do all this in the wide open air of the New York skyline, a task that was further complicated by the limitations of the 1930s technology.

The first obstacle for the builders of the Empire State Building was to find a suitable design for the docking station. To support the sheer weight and size of the dirigibles, they needed a platform that was strong enough to handle them and occupied the minimum amount of space. To meet this need, the engineers of the Empire State Building created a mast made of steel beams with a flat platform at the top and a framework of metal braces. Furthermore, the mast had to be tall enough to allow the airships to dock higher than the tallest buildings of the city. 

The second obstacle was to create a mechanical system to safely secure the airships. The engineers were concerned with the powerful force of the wind and how to tie down the dirigible without damaging the tower or the airship. To do so, they designed an angled landing mast that had three sets of steel cables that hung from the dock to secure the dirigibleâ€™s moorings, a feature that allowed for a
