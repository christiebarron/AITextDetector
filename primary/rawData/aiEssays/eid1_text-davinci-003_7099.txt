The issue of censorship in libraries is a highly contentious one. On one hand, some argue that books, music, movies and other materials that contain explicit or offensive content should be removed from the shelves to protect the public from material that could be damaging to young readers and viewers. On the other hand, censorship can rob library patrons of knowledge and insight into social issues. 

In my opinion, censorship in libraries should be employed with caution. It is the responsibility of library personnel to ensure that all patrons are provided with access to the educational and informational resources they need to form informed opinions. For this reason, it is important to exercise sensitivity when choosing library materials. 

That said, libraries should not be the site of censorship debates. Libraries should be a safe haven for all patrons, providing an environment of respect and inclusion without judgment. This means that we must accept that our library collections include books, music, movies and other materials that have controversial or offensive content. This in turn allows us to foster thoughtful conversations about complex issues. 

Finally, by providing our patrons with access to such materials, we allow them to come to their own conclusions regarding any potential biases or perspectives they may have encountered. With so much of the public discourse on social issues centered on a specific point of view, it is critical that we afford library patrons the opportunity to explore both sides of any argument without prejudice.
