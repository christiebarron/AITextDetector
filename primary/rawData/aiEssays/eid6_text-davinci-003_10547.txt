The building of the Empire State Building in New York City was an incredible feat of engineering and design, and despite contemporary advances in technology, one aspect of the vision for the building never came to fruition - the allowance of dirigibles to dock. The obstacles that the builders faced with allowing dirigibles to dock were ultimately too great to overcome. 

The proposal to build a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building came in 1929 from the famous buildingâ€™s developers. This mooring mast would have featured turntables, elevators, a storage area, and most importantly, an area to moor a dirigible. The difficulty of creating the windproof mast was immense. Dirigibles, larger than even the largest airplanes of the time, required a stable landing area, something tall and secure that could withstand high winds. The engineers also had to account for the nature of dirigibles, which moved slowly and had difficulty maneuvering.

In order to make the mooring mast secure, the engineers needed to build the structure's steel as strong and heavy as possible. This posed a problem as the windy apex of the Empire State Building was exposed to even more powerful winds than on the ground. To overcome this obstacle the engineers had to come up with a stronger material that could withstand such conditions. They decided to build a telescopic mast, designed to move away from the wind. They tested the mast successfully in a wind tunnel
