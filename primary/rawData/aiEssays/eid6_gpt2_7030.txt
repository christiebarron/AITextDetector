The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

According to the architects on the building's groundbreaking:

"The government has come in and said: 'This tower is going to be a great building that will change the world.' People say: 'What if I put a dirigible to the bridge and the power went out?' "

But in a 2010 interview with NPR, C.J. P. Kiley, the former U.S. Transportation Secretary, said the project will bring a lot more jobs.

That's because, C.J. P. Kiley revealed in the interview that he and his wife, Linda, were both building jobs on the bridge in the early 1980s.

When he moved to Philadelphia to work up the power, he was forced to install new parts that required many years to fully complete the job. He got his first chance when he saw a photo of the building. "It was the only thing I ever used to own on the building's side. I knew it was a great product.

"So I told my family and family that we had to get it done and it worked and it was time to give it some life," Kiley says.

Many of the workers, too, say that they are thrilled with the bridge.

"It looks good, sounds good to us and, yes," says Mike Wiegand, another engineer who
