Joe Kurmaski chose to set the story on a dark, rainy nighttime, with the road slick with rainwater and a sense of gloom and danger lurking in the mist. In addition, the unfamiliar surroundings and pervasive darkness add to the ominousness and opens the door for unknown events to occur.

The darkness of the night affects the cyclist in multiple ways. First, the limited visibility not only makes it difficult for him to identify any potential dangers in his surroundings, but also increases his feeling of vulnerability. Without being able to distinguish any threats, the cyclist can only rely on his instincts and the knowledge that something is not right.
