The features of the setting have a major effect on the cyclist in Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead." Of prime importance are the geographical features of the terrain and roads. The particular route chosen by the cyclist is hilly, with sharp turns that make for a difficult ride. The elevation increases and falls combine for an exhausting journey, significantly eroding the cyclist's energy. Along the way, there are narrow roads that require special attention to traverse safely. 

In addition, the weather conditions contribute to the difficulty the cyclist faces. It is cold and wet, requiring the cyclist to bear the discomfort of the elements. This further takes away from the cyclist's energy and desire to continue. Other environmental obstacles include wind, rain, and fog that make the ride more difficult. 

The cyclist also has to contend with non-natural obstacles, chief among them being the presence of other vehicles on the road. The fact that the cyclist does not have a vehicle of his own to contend with the vehicles that pass by or ones that are parked along the route creates challenges for the cyclist. The narrowness of the road and sight lines that the cyclist has to contend with make it even more difficult. 

The combination of the geographical features of the area, the weather, and the non-natural obstacles make for a particularly difficult journey for the cyclist in "Rough Road Ahead." The cyclist must contend with all of these factors in order to complete their journey.
