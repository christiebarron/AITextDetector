The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because I like this book. A lot of my reviews for the paperback were wrong, but in the end I enjoyed the book for what it is: a short-lived, uninteresting, poorly constructed and poorly written tale of love. And I can't wait to hear where it goes. But for now, if you like your love story well thought out, and make the decision to start a book with a good plot, the book will be for you.

Winter Hibiscus is the last of the Summer novels. My final review was originally published on May 25 (but was revised in the next issue!).

Thanks to reader John D. for the original review!
