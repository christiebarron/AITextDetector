The construction of the Empire State Building enabled dirigibles to dock atop the building, which was a unique feature at the time. Initially, this idea seemed impossibleâ€”yet, after a tremendous amount of work, the builders managed to make the dream a reality. One of the main obstacles they faced was the extreme challenges posed by the winds of New York City. The winds made it incredibly difficult to secure the dirigible to the mooring mast, a large metal pole that protruded from the top of the building. Strong winds also drastically shifted the direction the dirigible was heading, making it more difficult for passengers to disembark safely.

Another major obstacle was the structural constraints that the new idea presented. The mooring mast, which was designed to allow dirigibles to dock, had to be built with an extremely strong foundation while also being lightweight enough to not seriously impact the weight of the building. Furthermore, the mast had to withstand the extreme vibrations caused by the ships as they docked, without damaging the rest of the building. Fortunately, the designers managed to create a mooring mast that supported the structure and was able to weather monsoons of strong winds.

The final obstacle the builders of the Empire state Building had to manage was ensuring that the area around the mooring mast was large enough to accommodate multiple dirigibles. This required them to create large enough an area for the ships to safely dock, while avoiding including too much area that would
