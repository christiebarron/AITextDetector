It all started with one silly joke, one that I knew my dad would find funny. My dad and I had a complex relationship, so I was nervous to tell him the joke—but I went for it anyway.

"Dad, why did the chicken cross the playground?" I asked.

He just looked at me, not sure what to expect.

"To get to the other slide!" I said, barely managing to get it out before erupting in laughter.

At first, my dad only looked at me, confused. But slowly, I could see his mouth slowly tugging up into a smirk and his eyes sparkle with amusement. 

Before I knew it, both of us were laughing hysterically, and I felt something between us shift in that moment. We hadn't laughed like that in years. 

Now, whenever we're together, we make sure to keep each moment light-hearted and joke around as much as we can. Laughter has become a part of our relationship, and it's been a great way for us to stay connected. 

That joke may have been silly, but it was worth the laughter—it showed us a different way of approaching each other that I don't think we had before.
