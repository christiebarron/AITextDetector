The protagonist of Winter Hibiscus is a young girl taking an important test, but she becomes distracted by remembering her grandmother's stories about how she used to tend her hibiscus plants that she had to leave behind in China before coming to America. This reminder of her heritage makes the protagonist feel calm and gives her the strength to continue on her journey to take the test. 

The ending serves to bring the story full circle by showing that regardless of the outcome of her test, the protagonist still has hope for the future and the strength to persevere despite any obstacles in her path. By ending with the hopeful thought of the hibiscus plant blossoming when the geese return in the spring, it symbolically reflects the protagonist's growth and appreciation of her heritage, and the courage she has amassed to take her test.
