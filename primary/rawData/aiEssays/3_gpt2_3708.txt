Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. But how do these differences shape how we approach urban planning and design, as well as make city work better?

There will always be challenges to the use of the right of way when we plan roads based on urban areas. A wide sense of right of way is one of the hallmarks of urban planning. A wide sense of right of way, both in places where you live and all over the world, is in the right place to make decisions about how the road is going and use it. If it's the right way to drive, why not use it also?

In 'Methinks Roadways', the authors outline three sets of laws that govern the choices that we make about road use. They define "rules" for 'laws' that make traffic decisions. For example, there's an important distinction between driving without restrictions and driving a car when in a traffic zone. But there's also a crucial difference between driving a car in a park and driving under heavy traffic lights. In a car park, all lights (except for red light and siren signals) turn red when the traffic is lighted. Conversely, driving in an enclosed space with no traffic means that there's no lighting as the car is travelling. This is not an argument for restricting, but for allowing an outside view of the road. In fact, as the authors explain, drivers should expect that there's an
