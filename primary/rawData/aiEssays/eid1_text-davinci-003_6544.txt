Dear Editor,

I am writing this letter to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Over the years, technology has had a big influence on the lives of people and the way things get done. The most obvious example of this is the companies that have switched to a paperless office, where computers are the primary form of communication.

In my view, computers can have both positive and negative effects. On the one hand, they make our lives easier by allowing us to communicate quickly and efficiently, store and access data, and perform a variety of tasks. On the other hand, they can disconnect us from reality and cause us to lose sight of our real relationships.

I firmly believe that spending too much time in front of the computer can cause problems like isolation and lack of exercise. Studies show that sitting in front of a computer for extended periods of time can lead to increased stress and even depression. Furthermore, too much time in front of the computer can cause us to lose our social skills and can lead to addiction.

In conclusion, computers have a lot of positive impacts on our lives, but we must maintain a balance in our lives and not let it consume us. We need to be mindful of the risks, and take precautions to ensure our mental and physical health. 

I hope that readers will take this into consideration and strive for a balanced lifestyle that includes time away from the computer. 

Sincerely, 
[
