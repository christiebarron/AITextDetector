I was at the grocery store the other day and the line was really long. People were getting really frustrated, but I was determined to stay calm and composed. I was patient and accepted the fact that it takes time to get through the checkout line. I even offered help to people who were having trouble with their bags and groceries. Even though it was taking a while, I wasn't going to get mad and not allow it to affect me. There's no point in having a negative attitude when the situation is out of my control. Additionally, being patient and understanding allowed me to think clearly and make decisions that weren't rushed.
