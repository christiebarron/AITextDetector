I recently had to move to a new city for my job, which was both exciting and nerve wracking. On top of the stress of moving and starting a new job, I had to find a place to live.

After a long weekend of searching for apartments, I finally found one that I liked. I met with the landlord and he explained that the place wasn't available for another two months. I was frustrated and wanted to move in right away, so I begged him to let me move in as soon as possible. 

The landlord was kind, but said he couldn't do that. He asked if there was anything else that could make up for the wait, and I got angry. I was determined to get my own place right away, regardless of the wait. But then I remembered to be patient and realized that it was better to wait a few weeks and get a good place than rush and end up in an apartment I wouldn't be happy with. 

I thanked the landlord for his time and apologized for getting angry. He was understanding and offered to show me some other places he had available later that week. After I took my time to look around, I went back to the first place I had seen and decided to take it.

The landlord was so patient with me and allowed me to take my time to make my decision. In the end, I got the perfect place and had a great experience with the landlord.
