The advent of computers has revolutionized how people communicate, work, and entertain themselves. This newfound power has changed the way people work, learn, and live. Despite this immense influence, computers have had mixed effects in the lives of many people.

For many of us, the work we do is arguably made more efficient with the help of computers. These powerful machines have enabled us to store and access vast amounts of data, perform complex calculations in just seconds and collaborate with colleagues remotely. However, computers have also led to a sedentary lifestyle due to increased reliance on technologies, with decreased physical activity. There is also research that suggests that extended computer use can lead to poor mental health, with increased stress, and anxiety.

What we should keep in mind, however, is that computers, like any other form of technology, can be beneficial or detrimental depending on how it is used. If used in moderation, computers can facilitate more collaboration, productivity, and education, while reducing social isolation. Computers can also be a great source of entertainment and relaxation if not abused.

However, if not used responsibly, computers can be a huge distraction that negatively affects our health, both mental and physical. Responsible computing would involve ensuring that we are engaged in tasks and activities that provide both physical and mental stimulation.

In conclusion, the effects of computers on people can be positive or negative depending on how it is used. It is our responsibility to use
