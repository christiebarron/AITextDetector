When I think back on my high school days, one of the fondest memories I have is when I first met my best friends. I was pretty new to the school and was feeling a bit overwhelmed, until I ran into three other girls who were just as scared as I was. 

We were all sort of laughing nervously at each other, trying to ease the tension when one of them said something completely ridiculous and that set us all off into an unstoppable fit of laughter. We all just looked at each other and it was like we already knew we were going to be friends.

Eventually, the laughter died down and it somehow felt more comfortable to talk to each other. We went on to have plenty of laughs together over the years, but I never forgot that first moment of shared laughter. It felt like the bridge that solidified our friendship and I'll always cherish it.
