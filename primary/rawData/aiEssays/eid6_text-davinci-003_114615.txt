The Empire State Building is a staple of New York City, both literally and figuratively, and it was once intended to be part of a grand plan for the city to become a hub for dirigible travel. However, the dream of allowing them to dock atop the iconic structure came up against countless obstacles that ultimately halted its progress. These obstacles were myriad and varied, and can be explored through Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s essay ‘The Mooring Mast.’

The first major obstacle for those attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was the fact that a structural extension would have to be made in order for a mast to be added to the building. This was a significant and costly task, and one that the builders of the Empire State Building had to consider carefully. The design of the mast was also an issue that had to be taken into account; engineers had to calculate the size and shape of the mast’s cables to ensure that it was strong enough to bear the weight of the dirigibles, and lead-anchored cables were placed in the surrounding Great Lawn to further secure the mast.

In addition to the financial cost and engineering concerns, the docking of dirigibles atop the Empire State Building had to account for the practical matters of noise and air pollution. These practical issues, ranging from the intensity of the exhaust engines of the dirigibles and the overall noise they might create to the possible disruption
