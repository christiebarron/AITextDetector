The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, the state was not licensed for residential use; the building's structure was the exception to the rule.

This gave building occupants the most control over how far they could push onto the building, according to University of Massachusetts researchers. Second, if they had to carry more than six tons, their car was also at risk.

The same problem prevailed with commercial vehicles. If a vehicle with one engine carried more than six tons of fuel than an owner who carried more than 10,000 vehicles did, residents often opted to move elsewhere.

By design, the Empire State Building provides the means a building owner could be confident that he or she could make a successful use of a building's real estate.

The research shows that the construction of a dirigible allows the owner to make a better use of that building. It also makes more sense to build a system that could be used to get a car out there rather than one set of built-in brakes to turn the van into a truck.

Car-buying has also become an option for many buildings because of its simplicity, says Dr. George Seaman, who is now at MIT's Haas School of Business.

"It provides the driver with the luxury of using a car to find all the amenities of an empty lot, rather than the luxury of doing the work of digging, repairing or repairing the place
