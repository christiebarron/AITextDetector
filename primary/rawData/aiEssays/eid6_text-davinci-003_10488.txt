The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when allowing dirigibles to dock high atop the historic building. Built in 1931, the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building was an ambitious engineering feat, and an unprecedented attempt at allowing airships to dock safely high above the ground. 

One of the main objections to the mooring mast was its location. Although the Empire State Building was one of the tallest buildings of its day, experts questioned how safe it would be for large airships filled with combustible tanks of hydrogen to be hovering close to the building. Fire safety concerns led to one of the main obstacles for docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building – establishing an adequate means of escape for the passengers and crew in the event of a disaster. Engineers overcame this problem by designing a “banana-shaped” slide off the building, a full 200 feet long. This allowed for a quick and safe exit in the event of a catastrophe. 

In addition to the concerns of safety, the mooring mast had to be designed to handle the considerable weight and stress of mooring and balancing the large airships. Initially, the mast was only designed to handle airships up to 371 feet in length; to accommodate the 690-foot hydrogen-filled Hindenburg, it had to be completely redesigned. 

The most technological obstacle of all was landing the dirigibles in the first place. To allow
