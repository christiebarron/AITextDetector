I remember the time when I was on a first date and we decided to have lunch at a local cafe. We were both feeling a bit nervous, as it was the first time we had met each other. The waiter was so slow that we just started enjoying each otherâ€™s company and making silly jokes, despite the awkwardness. 

At one point, I must have made a particularly funny comment, because my date started laughing uncontrollably. I couldn't help joining in with her and before I knew it, the whole cafe was echoing with our laughters. Even the waiter couldn't help but smile and join in. We were the loudest people in the cafe!

The laughter and shared moment brought us much closer than I could have anticipated and I will never forget that day. It was the start of an amazing relationship, filled with joy and laughter.
