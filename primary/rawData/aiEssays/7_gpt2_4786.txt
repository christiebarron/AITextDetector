An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when the doctor ordered it from a pharmacy. I gave it to him and he immediately looked at me and said he thought you guys are going to have to take it or I am going to get you shot. But he was wrong. He called the doctor and he told him that that was just my way of saying we were going to do it. She is one person.

I don't know where he went with it so I don't know how he was supposed to know where it came from or you would have to take it. You never know. He's the one you would do that. So you're saying he just sent you a package and that's why he said he didn't come to visit and what did you decide? Was it out of the blue if you just took it? No. What kind of message is it sending? Like saying you took your daughter and you want to go to my house now would you consider taking your daughter's prescription, or would that be not the right thing to do? Again, this is the kind of thing we say, if we are going to do the right thing, if we follow this course and we make a decision, we must follow that course.

So there's really nothing wrong with me saying that or me not wanting to do it. What was wrong with him saying you did not want to do it? It was out of the blue. I think
