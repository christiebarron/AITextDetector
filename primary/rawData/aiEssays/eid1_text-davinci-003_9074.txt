To The Editor,

In the past decade, computers have made an enormous impact on people’s lives. From businesses to households, it seems like everyone is getting hooked on the latest technology. But is it really a good thing?

Based on my experience, I firmly believe that computers can be beneficial in moderate doses. Not only do they make day-to-day tasks much easier, they also offer endless opportunities for entertainment. With the help of the web, you can watch movies, play games, and even build lasting connections with people all over the world.

That being said, computers are not entirely harmless. Too much time devoted to technology can take away from valuable face-to-face interaction. It can also lead to a decrease in people’s physical and mental health. One simple way to reduce the risk? Limiting computer use to a few hours a day!

The truth is, computers have the potential to positively contribute to our lives. However, it is up to us to use them wisely. Take it from me: staying in control of technology is the key to success.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
