The ambition to build a mooring mast atop the iconic Empire State Building was nothing short of staggering. It was 1928, and the world’s tallest building had been recently completed and was constantly looking for ways to become ever more impressive in the public eye. The plan was to construct a mast that would allow dirigibles to dock there – the first of its kind in the world. However, the project was met with numerous obstacles which needed to be surmounted if the mast was to become a reality.

The first and most obvious challenge was taking on the herculean task of building the mast itself. The soaring spire of the Empire State Building stood at 86 stories high, and at the time, mast of such size had never been constructed before and engineers were uncertain as to how it would be built. Also, safely maneuvering the large vessels was a further worry, and it seemed a daunting task for an airship filled with passengers.

From a structural standpoint, the tricks used to support the dirigible by the Empire State Building ranged from an elevated perch for the vessel to rest on while docked to a heavy tie down cable system attached to the mast which provided a secure holding point. The constant wind currents that blew over the sides of the building presented a further problem that had to be taken into account, but the engineers managed to solve this with the incorporation of a series of additional cables that could suspend the dirigible in mid-air.
