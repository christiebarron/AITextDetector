The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' was so positive that the book sold more than 1 million copies.

The book featured a colourful narrative with the characters of the past and their hopes for the future.

One of Ms Bickman's primary aims during her writing phase was to help people to discover and understand each story. But she is also keen to explore stories which may resonate with people in their 80s or younger, often with more negative aspects of their situation.

Ms Bickman told The Mirror: 'I started to realise that there was a lot about our society that was negative.'

She says the characters were not necessarily stories about someone falling in love, or someone who is looking for a future.

And for many characters in the book, that was their story as they felt betrayed or confused.

In particular, one character who is particularly critical of his father was the one who says he can't find his mother again.

In other stories she told readers she has lost her faith, and that she has no children if she does not get to their side.

Her mother, who was a teacher, asked her to stay with her child until she can't find him again on her own.

Ms Bickman also had to overcome fears about how she was meant to share the story with others.

She had to write about her struggles and triumphs to help others.
