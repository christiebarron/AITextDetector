The builders of the Empire State Building faced a major engineering challenge upon completion of the iconic skyscraper in 1931: how to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the structure. This seemingly impossible task was made even more challenging by the need to keep up with the changing regulations and safety standards in the aviation industry. Marcia Amidon Lüsted explains the degree of difficulty in “The Mooring Mast” when she writes, “The 92nd floor—or perhaps one of the floors above—had to be designed to support the thousand-pound force of a dirigible’s mooring line.”

The engineering team charged with this project had to come up with a way to provide the necessary support for the mooring cables, and had to ensure that the structure could withstand winds of up to 60 miles per hour. In addition to properly designing the structure of the dock, the entryway had to be designed so that the dirigible’s tail fin could fit through it. The walls had to be constructed of a heavy metal that could withstand the 1,000-pound force of the mooring line when it was pulled tight.

Obtaining the necessary permits was another major obstacle the engineers faced. Because the Empire State Building was located in the heart of New York City, the team needed to adhere to strict safety regulations regarding the use of airships. These regulations included provisions such as having a control tower that could
