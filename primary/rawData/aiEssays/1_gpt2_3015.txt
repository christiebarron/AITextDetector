In fact, many children and adults have trouble recognizing those effects, because they don't have language to begin with.

When a child or adult says something to a robot a little before it has its eyes downcast, it's not just because of its cognitive difficulties. It's also because it's really, really, really, really, really, really, really scared…

Just like children (and adults in general), we're in a different place (and need to learn more about it). We've no technology to help us. We can't see the world, we're not even in control. We can't communicate with humans or robots… so our minds have literally no control whatsoever.

The first two are often related in some ways, but the third is generally pretty minor, so we still don't really understand it. It's not like we're actually able to say anything (without making the robot do anything) by ourselves or to a computer.
