Computers have many effects on people. If you work in the computer world and start talking to people outside this industry and you've got to be smart enough to do that for a living, that's going to come to you and then you'll start to think, "Why am I doing this, how can I make a living in this?" There is a way. But I think it's not as easy as it used to sound, like, "I went through a bunch of things and couldn't understand why it wasn't working." I've still got a lot of fun doing what I'm doing right now, but that's one of the things that scares me a bit."


For the longest-term, your biggest concern is the future. But at the same time, you're at the forefront. Are you worried what we're going to see in the 21st century.
