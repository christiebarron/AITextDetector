Computers have many effects on people. They help you feel better, even over time, and are vital for certain areas of your life.

Awareness of these effects can be difficult, so let's look at an interesting and common one: anxiety disorders.

The condition is a genetic condition causing an imbalance between a strong urge to move and the urge to move away from a person, often due to the changes in the brain's neural circuitry that cause certain behaviors. Anxiety disorders often have side effects. In autism, the amygdala has a major inhibitory and sensory role. People with anxious situations experience changes in these areas.

The amygdala (or the amygdala nucleus), has some important roles in the functioning of our brain. As a neural network of neurons, this can be considered part of the human nervous system. The amygdala regulates emotional experience and behavior. This includes the expression of emotions, which we call fear. According to the brain science, certain emotions are able to produce changes in the response of the amygdala.

But there is also evidence showing that there are different levels of the brain involved in the development and maintenance of anxiety disorders and people with anxiety disorder experience changes in this area, sometimes not noticed by our own immune system. This may mean we experience more of these changes in the human nervous system, but there are different types of anxiety disorders.


Here's the relevant part of the article. Most people with anxiety disorder only experience changes in the amygdala, but
