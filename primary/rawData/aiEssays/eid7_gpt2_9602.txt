An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the story behind our trip to the University of Florida where I was a student.

And they said there were two of us, one of them and we were taken. That was really sad, they didn't know where we were going. I found out a year later [on the trip] that I got caught red-handed and I didn't even know where I was going. Like, you got caught in Florida, this was 20+ years ago, where we were going. You know how some kids get caught in California? They're caught red-handed.

That happened because the first year of your freshman year you got caught in Florida, you were playing in college. In fact, this was the fourth time in as many years where you'd see a school drop you. And they were taking out the big money and they couldn't find you. So, that's where we were taken, and it turns out that people like me who like going to college are actually very proud of coming to San Jose.

What other great examples come out of these trips like this one that you're seeing for sure?

For me, my first trip and that's my first appearance as a student was a time you went to the Museum Museum of Fine Arts in St. Louis in January of 2003, and at that time it's a show-piece piece of art, and it's almost like in the 1930
