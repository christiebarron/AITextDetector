The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is often portrayed as a little bit like the previous "You are the most beautiful woman in the world?" or "You've been born to be a girl and now you're single," or "You'll do anything you want in life to succeed."


However, the book features many positive stories and stories from other women. A former partner of my partner, Mary Lynn Mccauley (see the interview), has said that she had gone on to be the "first girl with a successful career," having started her own fashion design company after an affair.


The book provides a lot of examples from different perspectives. First, Mary Lynn and David (who have not been officially identified but are apparently related in some way) took time to tell stories of how they were raised, their parents, their relationships with different and sometimes conflicting fathers, their struggles to get support, and what they want out of it.


I also asked Mary Lynn as a young woman to tell me some of her best personal life experiences. If there is one element that makes one feel that I am being unfair, it is to describe the emotions I feel and the feelings I wish to feel. Some emotions: I felt that I was going to have trouble getting the job I wanted to do, my mother would be worried I was looking too much like my ex, and not having a sense of self that I wanted.
