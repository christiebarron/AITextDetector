I was out at dinner with my best friend, Sheila, the other night. We had a great time laughing the night away and sharing stories of the past. 

Despite the fact that we were out at a nice restaurant, nothing seemed to be humorless or dull. We were laughing so hard at one point that we started to get funny looks from the other patrons. The waiters were starting to get concerned that we were being too loud.

But that made our laughter even funnier, and we started to become kind of giddy as we kept going on about our own misfortunes and misadventures. After a while, we started to get teary-eyed from laughing so much, which made us even more combustible.

Finally, when the night was ending, I had to take a moment to catch my breath. But it didnâ€™t last long as one of our last conversations and jokes sent us into another fit of laughter. 

It was a true reminder that laughter can really connect two people in the most beautiful way. That night was just one of many when Sheila and I can make each other laugh until our sides hurt. It's a bond that can never be broken, and one that I will cherish forever.
