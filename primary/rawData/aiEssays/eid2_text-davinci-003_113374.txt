As citizens, we should all have the right to access educational and informational resources without censorship in our public libraries. Censorship of materials in libraries undermines our right to free and open access to information and therefore should not be enforced.

While the need to protect citizens from potentially offensive material is understandable, the solution is not to censor certain materials in public libraries. Rather, libraries should adopt a comprehensive approach that educates members of the community about understanding the impact of materials on themselves and on those around them, while also providing guidance on where to obtain information that is appropriate for them. This approach ensures that library customers across all age groups are able to access appropriate materials, while also protecting them from potentially offensive material.

Furthermore, censorship in libraries is a violation of intellectual freedom. Libraries should promote free and open access to information that is based on principles of intellectual freedom, allowing patrons to explore and learn from diverse sources of information without fear of censorship or judgement. This is particularly important for marginalized communities that may not otherwise access these resources without protection from censorship or barriers to academic expression.

Ultimately, censorship in libraries serves to limit our access to important educational and informational resources, and thereby undermines our right to knowledge and free expression. We should reject any attempt to limit the free flow of information at our public libraries and instead promote comprehensive approaches that ensure everyone is able to explore materials responsibly.
