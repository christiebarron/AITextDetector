The author's father, William Rippey, became an RAF generalIER after his father's death in 1942 and became an RAF commander after his father was promoted. In the book, Rippey recounts his life as a pilot. "My father went home with the boys and I got my head back. My dad was never out of the picture buteventually he came back home to write. So I remember flying through the air, taking them to a school, taking my mother and her children, and when I got there I wrote my diary which we left behind and said it would be over by the end of year six when he was gone. It was only a few years ago that I thought it was about four. It's something I'm very proud of."
