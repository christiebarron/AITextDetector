I was in line at the grocery store the other day and the woman ahead of me had quite a few items that she was trying to buy. The cashier was trying to be as efficient as possible when she suddenly realized that she had not scanned one of the items. She apologized for the mistake and began looking for the item again in the cart. I could tell the woman was getting frustrated but instead of getting angry, she took a deep breath and reassured the cashier that it was ok. “It’s alright” she said with a smile, “We all make mistakes. It’s no big deal”. Everyone in line was so impressed with her patience and understanding, myself included. I couldn’t help but admire her for staying so composed and sailing through the situation with grace.
