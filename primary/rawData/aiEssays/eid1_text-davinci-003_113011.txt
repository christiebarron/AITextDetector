Dear Editor, 

I write to you today with an opinion on the effects computers can have on people. While computers can have numerous positive uses, I believe the effects on people can become overwhelmingly negative if not done in moderation. 

It is no surprise that computers play a vital role in our lives. They are used for many important tasks, such as work, communication, research, and entertainment. But the reliance of computers in these areas puts peopleâ€™s mental and physical health at risk, as well as productivity.

From screens damaging our vision to sitting in the same position for extended periods, it is no wonder that having computer use become our primary form of communication and entertainment leaves us feeling exhausted and, often, unproductive. Studies have demonstrated that spending more than two hours on a computer can lead to various health, emotional, and sleep issues.

The need to stay connected can become overwhelming when our entire lives are conducted through the internet and devices, as well as social media addictions. These illnesses can take a toll on our relationships and overall well-being.

That being said, I urge readers to take the time to practice moderation when using computers. We should take measures to step away from our screens and be mindful of how much time we spend on them. This will ultimately lead to healthier habits and physical and mental
