Dear Editor, 

I'm writing to express my opinion on the effects of computers on people. As technology advances, we are becoming increasingly reliant on computers for everyday tasks. But how have these changes affected us?

Many believe that the development of computers has had a wide range of effects on people. Some argue that it has had a negative effect on people, leading to social isolation, increased stress, and mental health issues. My opinion, however, is that computers have been beneficial to people, in terms of productivity, efficiency, and improved communication.

Computers have streamlined many aspects of our lives, including checking emails, shopping, online banking, and even gaming. This has resulted in a notable increase in productivity, and it allows us to achieve more important tasks in less time. It also streamlines our communication, enabling us to quickly and easily connect with people from different parts of the world.

As one can see, computers have had a great impact on people. Therefore, I believe that negative effects of computers are outweighed by its benefits. If used sensibly, computers can make life a whole lot easier. So, I hope that readers will recognize the role computers have played in our lives and not
