An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was at Disneyland, and I was asked to help her raise her head and put her back on one leg, so that she could see on the other. Her left ear was so badly messed up that when she was in the front seat, the car was driving her, so she was able to help me, but when she was in the backseat, the car drove her and she couldn't see, so I couldn't get back on the wheel. It was like a miracle. I'm still mad at the pain and suffering of her, but this was the first time I saw her back in person. When she was in the cockpit after I went to the hospital, she had a huge smile on her face, which I never see on TV. Her mother called and said, "So she is OK." I'm lucky in that I was able to help her, as many people have had her back because of my advocacy. That's what it means to be an advocate for a patient.

I got the job back in April of 2016. I'm glad we took care of each other, there's still so much work and I still have an active disability.

If I would have been able to see my son from about five years ago, he would have been able to talk to me, talk to nurses and to be able to find his doctor, to speak.
