Dear Editor, 

I am writing to offer my opinion on the effects computer technology has had on people. My argument is that computers have had a largely positive impact on our lives. 

Computer technology has made many tasks more efficient and easier to complete. For example, computing has enabled us to access accurate information quickly and to communicate with people all over the world almost instantly. We are able to access a breadth of knowledge that was not available to us before computer technology. Working from home, online shopping, and participating in online courses are all additional examples of how computer technology has positively impacted our lives.

Moreover, computers have enabled us to engage in data-driven decision-making. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is now being used to identify trends, help optimize processes, and analyze vast amounts of data faster and more accurately than any human can. With this data-driven approach, businesses can achieve more efficient and effective outcomes.

Overall, computers have been a great source of convenience and efficiency, enabling us to do what would take far more time on our own. I believe the benefits of computers far outweigh any potential downfalls, and I am sure many readers will agree with me.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
