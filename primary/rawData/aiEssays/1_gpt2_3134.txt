Computers have many effects on people. They affect their thinking, cognition, and decision making. Scientists have found that people who have been subjected to computer virus infections report less emotional distress and worse mental health.

As a result, certain people have been blamed.

Some of these people are now facing legal action to prevent them from using computer viruses and viruses designed to spread malware, including on computers and hard drives that were recently discovered.

iceh's website has been flagged as a potential health care scam for people who suffer from low immune systems, he said.

"In my opinion, these viruses are highly unappealing, malicious and dangerous to many infected by viruses in the past. You wouldn't want to come across an infected computer without a vaccination system."

The company said in a statement that people will be charged a fee for a vaccine that is free to them, but should not contain a virus.

"This is not going to kill you," said Chris Kupzner, president of Iceh's Vaccine & Immunization Clinic. "You should buy the vaccine before you even know it was available."

In many cases a person with low immune systems could be infected by a virus. But those infected by viruses can be very susceptible, says James Lea, a professor of microbiology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who has studied viruses.

"It's not always the same person," Lea says.
