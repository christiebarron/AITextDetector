I remember it like it was yesterday. It was a Wednesday, and my friend and I had been sitting in the library studying for a few hours. We had been working diligently, but the strain was beginning to get to us, and we decided to take a break. I had a joke in mind that I had been waiting to tell her, so I decided this was the perfect moment. I started to tell her the joke, but I started to laugh before I could even finish it, and before I knew it, laughter was overtaking both of us. It felt like it lasted for hours, even though it was only a couple of minutes. 

We were sitting there in the middle of the library with heads turning, but it didnâ€™t matter, because in that moment, nothing else existed besides the joy we were sharing. Even though we had only known each other for a few months, this shared moment had brought us closer, showing us that we could always rely on laughter to bridge the distance between us.
