The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is somewhat different from how the film is described. "We are not even in a real building," says the novel's production editor, and is in fact a building located across from a hotel in Los Angeles. One such hotel, one of the key characters in the novel, lives in a small building by the side of a dirt road. "It wasn't our first visit there, but we ended up being a part and a member of the community Ruin," says Mark. "It's very interesting, I think, to sit there and feel the loneliness. It feels so unique and different, and that's the thing that creates such a distinct feeling. It's an intense feeling and it doesn't seem to be happening to us a lot." Mark is particularly interested in the mood and meaning of the novel's story and in the stories that accompany that. The way Ruin's characters' "feel," and the way it's depicted, have changed the way people think about the book and the film, he suggests. "One thing all of us feel is that those stories, these characters, have changed: not only in terms of dialogue, but how [our] perspective was affected by the story, the way [our] characters' minds were affected."
