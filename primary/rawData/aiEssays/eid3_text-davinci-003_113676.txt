 

The features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski’s ‘Rough Road Ahead’ heavily influence the cyclist’s experience and thus presents many challenges. The setting of a long, curvy, hilly road surrounded by woods and trees creates a sense of isolation and seclusion which makes the cyclist feel alone. This seclusion can create a sense of fear and anxiety as well as an intense focus on the bike and its performance, with any sounds or movements from the woods being amplified in the cyclist’s mind. The cyclist also must maneuver the curves and hills of the road which presents a physical challenge in addition to the psychological one. As the poem progresses the cyclist must summon increased focus and determination to stay on the winding path, and is thus faced with the challenge of rising above the daunting task set before him. The physical and psychological demand presented by the rough road adds to the intensity of the cyclist’s experience; thus he is required to exercise extreme courage and mental strength to reach the top. The setting sets the stage for the cyclist’s battle with himself, and the mountains, bends, trees and isolation of the road are essential to this experience.
