I believe that censorship of materials in libraries can be done through an Internet service provider (ISP).

The following document clearly clarifies that censorship of books and records online is unlawful under the law in France and also bans the distribution of books, documents, magazines and other materials that contain material deemed harmful to minors and that are subject to the right of freedom of expression," said Jean-Christophe Rege, deputy director of freedom of press in France.

French government does not permit "all expression of ideas on an Internet," Le France 1 reported. "A book can not be published, a pamphlet can not be published without the authorization of a prosecutor."

Critics said it would go against the wishes of the left of the country and the social reforms of former leftist President Nicolas Sarkozy, who has called for internet services to be banned and the ban is for publishing.

In 2011, a bill was proposed to ban websites from offering "offensive content" online. The government had promised not to impose it under existing law, but last month the bill was put on hold.

The country has some 800,000 internet subscribers, but those are fewer than 10% of the population.

A number of politicians have opposed the measure, which would have made information available online more easily. In March, former President Francois Hollande told France 3 that he would not accept such freedom of speech.
