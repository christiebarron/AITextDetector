I had finally gotten a chance to visit my grandparents’ house for the first time, and I was eager to get to know them better.

We were sitting in the living room chatting after dinner, when we started to talk about some funny memories from our past. My grandfather was telling a story about a mischievous neighborhood dog that we all chuckled at. My grandmother then followed up with her own story about an especially funny incident involving her and my grandfather when they were on vacation.

At one point, my grandma started talking about how incredibly unusual it was that they could still laugh and make jokes after all these years together. As she said that, my grandpa couldn’t help but take it one step further, and he made a joke about how that was the secret to their long-lasting relationship.

That was it. We were all in hysterics from laughter by the end of it. Even though each of our stories was different, the joy that came from hearing each one and sharing a good laugh was undeniable.

I’ll always remember that night and the way laughter helped us all connect in an incredible way.
