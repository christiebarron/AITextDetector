The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One of the most difficult was the use of solar power. The Empire State's current photovoltaic system allows only about 5 percent of the power to go to the panels; the building's power needs and the number of panels needed add up quickly. The building needed about 13.5 MW of power in 2015 for its own panels, versus the current power supply provided by the state, and for power on the rooftop.

Even though the building had solar panels on, the building was in poor conditionâ€”they were leaking on the floor and it couldn't be easily brought out of the building. In addition, the building had no electricity, just two refrigerators (and maybe some water). Also, it wasn't designed to be used as an air-conditioning station for helicopters or helicopters. The buildings cost about $2 million (plus utilities for its roof). One potential solution was to replace the building with a single-family home or even a single-unit flat in a community center.

The building and the rooftop

In 2015, the building's tower reached a peak capacity of 8.5 million square feet, which took up 1.8 square miles. The building was already quite large, with a total length of more than two acres. It could withstand more storms than anything the Empire State has built in the last 75 years.
