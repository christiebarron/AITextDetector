The issue of censorship in libraries is one that has been debated for a long time. While some believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, should be removed if they are found offensive, I believe that these materials should be kept on the shelves for the betterment of the public. 

First and foremost, the general public needs access to information, and censorship in libraries would limit the materials available. Removing certain materials based on people's individual opinions or values would ultimately limit the publicâ€™s right to know and create a public of information-deprived citizens. Furthermore, the decision of which materials to remove could become arbitrary and subjective, with no clear line between what should and should not be removed. 

In addition, librarians, library patrons, and administrators should be responsible for determining which materials should and should not be available in the library. When librarians receive complaints regarding a particular item or piece of material, they should have the right to decide if it should be removed. Having these decisions made on an individual basis by people who understand the range of patrons that might have access to these materials is the responsible way to handle the situation.

Finally, public libraries exist to provide individuals with access to a variety of materials, and censoring some materials might put the library at odds with its fundamental purpose. Instead, materials that are deemed inappropriate should be marked or placed in certain areas of the library while still allowing access
