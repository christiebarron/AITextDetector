The Empire State Building in New York City was the first tall skyscraper to feature a docking station for dirigibles and it presented many challenges to the builders. Despite a lack of technology and resources, the building's architects managed to overcome significant obstacles to complete the project successfully. 

One of the major obstacles the builders faced was dealing with the strong prevailing winds at the top of the building. The building was designed to be the world’s highest mooring mast, meaning it had to be strong enough to withstand the forces of wind without compromising the structure’s overall integrity. The architects solved this problem by creating a platform on the 102nd floor with a causeway that allowed the dirigible to pass safely in or out, but this solution required strength and stability, which could only be achieved through structural features such as stress reinforcements and thicker walls. 

A second issue facing the builders was the difficulty in maneuvering large, difficulty to control airships through the very tight parameters of the building. The original plan was to use a vertical, single gateway, however this posed a problem with the potential for unexpected currents or insufficient time for a dirigible to safely come in for a landing. To solve this problem, the architects came up with a new plan, which featured two gateways placed on the 86th and 104th floors. This design allowed for the possibility of a slower, more gentle approach and the extra space allowed the dirigible to make a smooth and
