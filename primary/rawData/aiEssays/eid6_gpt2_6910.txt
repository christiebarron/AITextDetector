The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. These included a major construction bottleneck affecting both the public's desire to have a good view of the building and the construction of an elevator shaft or underground tunnel. The government's engineering team worked to complete a tunnel under the ground and make sure the shaft to be elevated to the ground was used for both vehicular and pedestrian traffic when no access was available. This forced many companies from using elevated elevators for vehicular and pedestrian use at great expense.

The government had proposed and passed numerous regulations governing how and where new tunnels should be constructed. For example, the National Highway Administration approved the following standard tunnel width for the Empire State building, which allowed both vehicular and pedestrian traffic to travel between a "high-speed" tunnel and a tunnel that would be shorter than the length of existing elevators on the former building. At first, it seemed these regulations had a long standing, as evidenced by the large volume of construction announcements, often called "diamond and diamond trusses" that were issued when new and existing elevators were introduced. The government later revised these regulations to more closely reflect the actual construction that occurred during the time when elevated elevators were being used as well as the time from where they came into operation.

As was the case during the "Grand Canyon" era, the government used many alternate routes to reach various facilities. For example, the government began by launching an automated
