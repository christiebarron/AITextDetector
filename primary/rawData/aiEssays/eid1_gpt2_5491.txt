Computers have many effects on people. Sometimes their minds will be made much smarter just as we are, and sometimes they will learn a great deal just by their hard work. At the same time, computers can also have a serious effect on education, whether education is given to the young, their parents, their teachers, the school board, or the state government. A good example of these things could be our computer system. An interesting experiment was in Germany in 2009. We found that the kids of the middle school who were told they need to take a maths course during the middle school year were able to increase their maths scores by 20 percent. When the kids were then in elementary class, their maths scores increased by 13 percent, and if they were on grade break they also achieved a 20 percent increase, and at high school graduation their scores were then increased by 22 percent. Some research has been conducted using the same thing. Another important study found that although a certain set of grades was given, if the parents wanted their children to go to an appropriate class at the same time, their kids were significantly easier to complete and the result was better scores, if the parents were given an extra high school diploma. Another interesting thing that can happen with computers is that they give rise by some kind of cognitive enhancement, so some kids may simply lose more of the cognitive skills they need to be effective in education, and others may become more creative, so the children are better able to think and express their ideas and
