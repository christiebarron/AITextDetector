The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. These obstacles were many, and the Imperialist constructionists had to deal with it, too.

The Empire State Building was actually in a more dangerous place than most, with two massive bridges spanning the river from where one of the bridge slabs was built. It had long since been reduced to the ground level and had been built using the same materials, but this time, the Empire State Building lacked the materials required to accommodate the height of multiple high rise skyscrapers.

An engineer had to cut the bridge to the right size so that the main trunk could pass, but this had to be done through the use of a crane once the building collapsed, thereby allowing one of the tallest buildings to fall through the collapsing debris. As a result, the Empire State Building's height was cut by 10 m. It was supposed to be about a 10-feet sloping section, but it also needed its own structure to withstand these high-rise construction projects. The Empire State Building was built using solid brass and metal, but instead of its being a solid structure, this led to the building's "cambered" style, where the building collapsed on itself to create a strong force field. When the first of the skyscrapers went down, the structure collapsed as well.

At one point in time, the Empire State Building was at the center of the entire Imperialist invasion. However
