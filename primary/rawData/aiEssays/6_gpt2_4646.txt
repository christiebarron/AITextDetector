The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. "If you make the stairs to the top of the building, then they will move the left side," said Gee. "If you make the first one into the ground, that is an advantage. If you make it into a room, they won't move they won't hit the ground, so the elevator will move the room to the top of the building." While this might make some people uncomfortable, other architects, by this time, considered the project too difficult. They believed that this was a "non-issue" until they were informed that the staircase was not built and no stairs attached, that they were just going to be able to have a few extra spaces for staircases as needed (to make room for a second staircase, which was also too large for the building).

The designers also wanted the staircase to be very light, so the architects would move all the equipment in to the elevator shaft, or all the gear. Because the "lift system," to use two dimensional units of measurement called the "grip," was not only hard to construct and maintain, but also the quickest option to scale up and down to their final level and provide maximum efficiency with little or no interference from the ceiling; for some, this was too challenging and required extreme amounts of detail. Yet for those who chose to construct the stairs, there is a story to tell: The stairs themselves did not become
