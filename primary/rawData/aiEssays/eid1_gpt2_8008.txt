Computers have many effects on people.

One of them is that children can go from being bullied by their parents to being bullied by classmates…and that's actually what is causing social problems and psychological damage.

One of that's what we're seeing now is where we are at today. Even as an infant, children have not been able to see our body. They've been not able to touch our hands. We are simply not able to learn and understand the way that we communicate.

And when a child learns, we actually have to act and make a choice, and when we don't we have to look around – and to make some choice. And they want to do something. They want to be strong, they want to be intelligent, they want to succeed at something. And I think it's important that we talk about that – that there are things that we can do and do in order to ensure that at the age of four and five, boys can learn, boys can understand…they can learn and understand their body, their facial expressions…we can provide them with what they want. And I think that, not only does that mean more in terms of children learning, but it means that parents are not going to get it.

Do we have the ability to turn that into a lifelong aspiration for parents that we feel there's a need for from a young age to build into a career in sports and in life that will support you and your family
