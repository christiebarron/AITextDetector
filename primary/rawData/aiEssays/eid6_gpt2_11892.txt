The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The problem wasn't that dirigibles were slow to come off; the problem was that many of them were stuck with too little space to dock at, and too much work involved. It may also have been that a high-energy laser might be required to capture the picture, if it could.

There was more time and effort put into creating the laser from a small, high-energy laser. However, the design of the laser would also have taken many years to perfect, and this was probably not on the scale of what the Empire State Building would have been at the time.

What Happened?

In the 1970s, the Empire State Building was completed in 1978, and it was scheduled for use by the end of 2000. However, the cost of construction dropped dramatically in the mid-1980s, with high volume of construction projects, and the cost of the building being over $5 billion per year. The building now sits on an island off the coast of New protective island in the Pacific, and remains one of the most visited and highly coveted buildings of the US and New Zealand. The entire building is located in a small, rural neighborhood in the suburbs of Manhattan.

It could be argued that the building's early history is most likely to inspire some sort of an urban renewal, or, as the architects put it, "a more vibrant and vibrant and urban
