Dear Editor,

As we continue to progress in the digital age, computers have become integral to our lives. From the professional world to our personal lives, from our phones to our laptops, computers have a profound effect on us. But what are the implications of computers on our health?

For one, computers have been linked to an increase in tension and stress. In our work lives, our increasing reliance on computers has created a never-ending demand for information. People are expected to answer emails in the middle of the night and keep up with activities taking place abroad. The level of stress that a computer can create is remarkable.

Outside of work, computer usage can interfere with sleep and cause eyestrain. The bright lights of computer monitors can make it difficult to fall asleep, and the screens can cause a great deal of eyestrain. Evidence suggests that computer usage can even lead to depression in some cases.

It is easy to see why computers have such a significant effect on our lives. We spend more and more time with them every day. We need to be aware of the potential drawbacks of computer use and take action to mitigate these risks. If we donâ€™t, we risk severe health complications
