The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. If there were any obstacles to such a design, it would have to Objectives 2 and 3.

A third problem that would occur with the dirigible design is that it required pilots to be flying over the objects to get the landing equipment working properly. This requires more work or would not be feasible, as well as the risk that they might fly over the objects rather than the object itself. However, it would be possible to do so.

The concept of "solar panels" and "super-solar panels" can also be found in this article on the subject. These have existed for many, Many Years but are now retired. We will have a look at that during Chapter 9 of this series.

Propulsion with the Solar Panel

Because of limitations, the solar panel was used extensively to make solar power for many years, but only in conjunction with ships and planes. In the late 80s or early 90s, electric propulsion was added to all models of aircraft, but was very limited. This added several costs as well.

The new super-solar panels had to be designed by two pilots and by the manufacturer. The pilot has to be able to navigate the surface of the planet with the solar panels while the plane is in flight. In the case of all other sub-models, the solar panels were not used.
