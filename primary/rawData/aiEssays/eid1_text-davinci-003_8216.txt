The building of the Empire State Building presented many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock, including political, structural, and safety challenges. "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted provides an in-depth look into the grueling journey of this endeavor. 

The political challenges were intense. The decision to build the needed mast and complete the project was stalled due to various arguments over who should pay for the cost of the construction, whether dirigibles should be allowed in the airspace around the building, and the need for Air Mail contracts to be awarded. The Mayor of New Your John F. Hylan and Senator William M. Calder both advocated for the construction of the mast with the main purpose of allowing the dirigibles to dock and deliver across the United States. 

The structural challenges were no small feat. The mast was built to 800 feet tall, higher than any building at the time, and to withstand the turbulence and weight of the dirigibles. Aluminum was used because of its lightweight and strength, and steel cables were used to stabilize the mast. Flanges were placed near the end of the mast in order to spread out the load and limit swaying. These combined elements helped make the mast safe and able to withstand the rigors of airplane docking. 

Finally, safety challenges had to be overcome. The engineers had to account for strong winds, lightning, and the potential of a broken or malfunctioning dirigible crashing
