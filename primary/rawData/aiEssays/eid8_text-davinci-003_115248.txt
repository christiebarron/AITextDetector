I remember a moment that I continue to laugh about even today. It was a few years ago when myself and my best friend decided to go to the beach on a Sunday morning. We arrived and spread out our towels and immediately started to chat about whatever was on the front of our minds. 

At some point in the conversation, we both got very distracted by a bright pink inflatable flamingo that was floating out in the ocean. We both looked at it in amazement and started to laugh hysterically. We were in hysterics for what seemed like 10 minutes talking about how funny it looked! 

We then decided to make a plan and "rescue" the flamingo. We worked very hard to catch it and after some very wet and funny moments, we actually managed to get a hold of it and dragged it onto the beach. Everyone around us started laughing; it was one of those moments that you just can't help but laugh at the ridiculousness of the situation. 

We eventually put the flamingo back into the ocean but I still laugh fondly every time I think about this moment. It was a moment of complete bond between us, when we both just let go and had a lot of fun. Laughter continues to be a huge part of our relationship to this day, and I'm so glad for it.
