An example of a time someone in my life was patient was trying to figure out how to get by without spending money and she was too busy trying to sell herself in her own personal life. A year went by when she had two great boyfriends and this was itâ€¦.and they found that love, respect, honesty, compassion, happiness, and finally having fun is what I am all about!!! This is our family. I was happy to find out they loved me and was really appreciative and helpful and supportive. We have made so much friends over the years. It's not like the family is getting anything. They know we're special and are in very personal contact with each others and are grateful for all people in our life. It is just that much better than not seeing them as brothers when we are together. I still like to ask what we have been through in the past 2 years that we can learn from, to improve and take things away from this family.
