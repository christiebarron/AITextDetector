Dear [Newspaper],

I am writing today to share my opinion on the effects that computers have had on people. In my view, computers have revolutionised our lives and taken us far beyond what was possible before.

To begin, the internet has changed the way in which we communicate with each other. Email, messaging apps, and social media platforms mean that we can keep in touch with loved ones and colleagues anywhere in the world. This has opened up opportunities that were simply not available before, such as job opportunities and access to higher education.

The development of artificial intelligence has been especially groundbreaking. Computers can now solve complex problems in ways that would require a computer in the past. This is leading to a future of automation and efficient decision-making.

Finally, computers have enabled us to make great scientific advancements. For example, they have been used to simulate the effects of climate change and develop more accurate medical treatments.

In conclusion, the impact that computers have had on our lives has been immense and far-reaching. I believe that readers should agree that computers have allowed us to live better lives.

Sincerely, 
[Your name]
