An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I asked him to describe his love that had caused him physical disability," he says. "I was really devastated and was very sorry. I thought it was so kind of him and how I've suffered a lot."

The story is now being reported in The Guardian but has so far been omitted from the national press release.

He says that his daughter, now 26, told him privately about his pain, and his grief, and what she felt when she learned of his death. "I would say I was a little bit devastated but also a little bit emotional and she wanted me to remember what had happened.

"My daughter told me, 'I want you to know how much you miss me'."

The family travelled to Edinburgh and visited several hospitals and clinics, offering a number of other benefits. Some took a chance on a man who had just been diagnosed with fibromyalgia but he has been getting better over the last year. It has made a real difference.

His daughter now asks some of his friends he was a little like they were his real family. "He had never seen himself as a child so he's not the person I had imagined him to be," he says. "I feel a lot like him."
