Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people, and to persuade your readers to agree with me.

In the 21st century, computers have significantly impacted our daily lives. By providing us with time-saving capabilities and tools to solve complex problems, computers allow us to work more efficiently and effectively. As a result, people have become more productive and have been able to accomplish more in less time. Studies have even found that improved efficiency has helped to reduce stress levels, which can also improve people’s mental health.

However, computers can have negative effects as well. Increased use of computers can lead to decreased physical activity, eyestrain, and an increased risk of repetitive strain injuries. Furthermore, an over-reliance on computers can cause people to become more dependent on technology and less able to make decisions on their own.

I believe that computers can be a great asset – but we must learn to use them responsibly and in moderation. With appropriate use, we can reap the rewards of increased productivity and enhanced mental health, while avoiding the potential pitfalls of over-dependence.

I urge your readers to keep these effects in mind as they use computers every day.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
