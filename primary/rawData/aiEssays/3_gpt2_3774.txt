Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. The first is that the setting changes completely; with each new step the cycling environment becomes slightly different. The second is that when the cyclist has arrived at a different setting for each cycle or when there are more riders than those required, that setting changes and they can react differently. The third is that each time you enter the cycle the cycling environment will change. What that means is that if you cycle out of a lane, or have a stop sign or a barrier at either end of it, all the other traffic in the road will still come. This is why you can stop at each side of a block, you can only continue to enter where two lanes (or lots of lots) of traffic intersect. It means that we all see a light at each one of these'red line-ends' and then we have to stop and try again. 'Good Road Ahead' is similar to how the setting describes each type of cycle path if we wish. You can adjust the 'Good Road Ahead' setting for each street at a particular location by going to the location page and changing the 'Good Road Ahead' heading to 'Good Road Ahead Only'.

This is really quite helpful if you are cycling in a noisy area, or in the shade. It is also very helpful if you use the 'Good Road Ahead' setting so that you don't lose any of that special 'Good Road Ahead' feeling
