The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' was not only refreshing, but also in many respects positive. The story was a glimpse into a world that existed not only in real life but in a fictional world. This gave our protagonists a real world to explore.

Many characters were inspired by stories about war, love, or both. They grew up in countries where violence, exploitation and exploitation were not tolerated, yet not unheard of. "From Home is more than a good piece of advice to help you develop a healthy lifestyle, and you can learn it from your best friend in prison." But in this novel, the author uses humor to bring it to life, and for a long time it was the one you'd see every day.

"From Home is a good book for people who are working in this world of violence, exploitation and oppression. It has an eye on what makes it the right place to stay," Michael Farias, the author of 'Living' told Rolling Stone. "I think we need to start thinking of it as a kind of postmodern kind of book, one that's full of great ideas for how to make a sense of life in a place that doesn't really exist."
