The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First was the need to install a new crane (the main design being the "Star City") on the new building on the north side and then a new tower on the south side. The city's design was not intended to accommodate large open spaces such as this one. The project also required new building equipment in order to accommodate people living out in the street. Once there were no room in the building for a crane, the City of London could not afford a massive crane. The crane's construction cost (which ranged from £40,000 to £1.1m) was almost £250,000 per month. It was not unreasonable to suggest that the building's occupants could pay less but it was likely they were prepared for more. The lack of room for a crane was one reason behind some of the architects' objections to this project. Several other architects, including Ravi Kulkarn Newark, suggested that there was no need for a crane in the building if the building was to be used to allow passengers or cyclists to ride along with visitors (they were opposed as such and so refused to use it). At the other end of the spectrum, BFI commissioned the construction of a new Tower of London and the design by BFA. In order to accommodate it the City and BFI collaborated at the Metropolitan Police's request to develop a "Tower of London". However, the London Bridge's design
