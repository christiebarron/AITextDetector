The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' has now sparked a new round of outrage after a New York Times op-ed, published on May 17, said women were still seen to be "sexually capable" after a spate of female suicide attempts took place.

The article read: "Many women have been diagnosed with sexual dysfunction before, or recently. This is how it has turned out for many women in recent years, when a new generation suddenly found themselves in the middle class of a declining economy".

It urged women to focus on "positive" messages in the workplace, suggesting young women were being taught that they "didn't want to get into the business of acting".

"This is the way it is not true," said the columnist, whose piece had been published online. "It's almost as if the'man's a man' idea has no substance without a substance."
