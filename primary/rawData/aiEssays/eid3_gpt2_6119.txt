Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. It is a concept that has been proposed for cycling by several groups of writers who call for a rethinking of some of the driving restrictions surrounding cycling in urban settings and the potential for increased driving efficiency among cycling users. It is one of many suggestions to address the need for a more flexible and convenient system for the driving system of roads and the need for a balance between the needs of urban users and those of cyclists.

The idea has faced challenges in a number of areas, particularly those that have never been addressed in the public realm: The introduction of the Road Traffic Act 2012, to which the Government introduced the revised Road Network Act 2010, as well as other initiatives, have also made significant gains. There has also been some good planning and consultation efforts on how roads in the area will be constructed. These developments have led to significant reductions in vehicle kilometres travelled by road users. These are the first significant reductions in road network capacity for the Government since 2008. There really are substantial road improvements, which are already being takenchant around many of the road systems being developed now. If these improvements have been completed, it is likely that the number of road users under-represented in a region will decrease, as we move through the transition stages of road use, and as new technologies such as electric vehicles will give consumers more confidence when choosing to cycle through roads.

The proposal is on the basis of a number
