I remember a gathering I had back in college. I had invited a few of my closest friends for a relaxing evening and we ended up having a lot of fun. We were laughing and sharing stories, talking about our classes and all the craziness that came with college life.

After awhile, one of my friends came up with a great joke and all of us had to laugh. We kept on going, to the point of tears streaming down our faces. We were all so silly, but we were all enjoying ourselves so much.

At one point, I noticed one of my friend’s mouths twitching as she laughed and suddenly she burst out in a really contagious laugh. Her laugh was so powerful that no one could help but laugh with her. We were all laughing so hard, we couldn’t breathe.

The laughter filled the whole room and we all felt so close in that moment. We connected through laughter and reflected how much we meant to each other in that moment. We all felt alive and joyful. 

Laughter has been an integral part of our friendship ever since. Whenever we get together, no matter how crazy the situation gets, we always end up laughing. It’s like a healthy dose of medicine that keeps our bond strong.
