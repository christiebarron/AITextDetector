Computers have many effects on people. First of all, the more they learn, the more likely they are to get involved. Second of all, the more people think about computer science they learn. Then there have come some people who were once quite skeptical of computers. Now, at least some of them think computers need a name.

One of the problems with computers is that they're not very well understood. Let me say you've been to a computer lab and you've got a computer program written over there. You've got these kinds of people working on this particular set of programs and you have a program. And they're at the end of it, at the end of it, and they've got this whole mess of a computer program. It's not very hard to find a replacement that people are really eager -- they're eager to see what their machine is like but that they can't bring back to the lab or to the program.

There are those people and they probably never get to that point. It's not so much to say that's not the case, but to say it's much more so. There's a certain sort of thing, in the business world of computer science, where it's pretty easy to do a very difficult thing that really nobody wants, and do it for quite a long stretch, so if you can do it really well it doesn't need to be difficult at all. You can do a very hard problem and you can learn very
