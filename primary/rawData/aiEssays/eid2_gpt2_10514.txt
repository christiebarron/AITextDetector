I believe that censorship of materials in libraries and the publishing of works by a leading literary outlet can create, in my opinion, good public relations."

In a statement to Wired, the New York Times said of the criticism: "The Internet has become a magnet for people sharing ideas, new insights, and insights, and making new friends from people who may come their way or who share the same philosophy. That's why it's critical for us to ensure this never happens again. We cannot allow this to happen again."

The site defended the censorship as "the first major step in an effort to put the public at ease," and said it would do so in part by taking responsibility for the future of its own work. "We're dedicated to making history, as it were, with the creation of the first library-and-retail website in the history of New York's intellectual life," it said.

But the criticism still has a long way to go, and the Times is working hard to get it right so its critics don't start to lose sight of the irony and power of censoring the books they read.
