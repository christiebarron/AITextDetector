An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the doctor when she gave me the order to carry her needle after it was too early for me, and a very few days later, when I didn't care, she gave out her needle as a gift for my daughter. At that point in my life I was afraid I was going to be raped or murdered and yet I didn't take itigrant-san and gave my daughter back the needle.

It also made me so unhappy when I'd seen a lot of them. Now I feel like I'm the only one who had to keep giving them the needle but if this makes me a victim of someone else, how could it make me a victim of any other person? I just can't explain how I felt.

Suffering, the shame of wanting to kill others, fear to kill and fear of being raped are in general something I can live with today. Although I try to keep an optimistic outlook on life, sometimes I can't quite put it into words.

When I find myself feeling overwhelmed with a lot of pain and fear and fear about the future, I often do things like wake up feeling stressed, scared, frustrated, angry and I'm really sad when I don't think about my future and I miss many of those who were murdered and many more who had their lives saved.

It gets very physical and it's very hard not to feel sad, even to feel so scared.
