The setting in “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski affects the cyclist’s experience on his journey significantly. The windy, desolate road serves as an obstacle for the cyclist throughout his journey. The open land, mountains, and trees are beautiful and vast yet intimidating and isolating. The cycle is biking along an unfamiliar route, and with the vast emptiness of the open road, the cyclist feels a sort of uncertainty and unease.

The features of the setting can make cycling difficult and challenging. The wind, especially when it's strong and unforgiving, is a force that the cyclist has to fight against. The lack of city lights causes an ever-increasing sense of fear and vulnerability as darkness encroaches on him. Furthermore, the sharp curves, hills, and ditches on the rough terrain add to the difficulty of traveling this road. Each of these features of the setting serves to challenge the cyclist psychologically as he continues on his journey.

The setting also has its peaceful and calming aspects. The cyclist can appreciate the beauty of the scenery, from the vibrant colors of the sky to the peacefulness of nightfall. This complements the cyclist’s sense of accomplishment, as he realizes he has made it further than he thought he could. By having the cyclist experience these two sides of the setting, he learns a valuable lesson of physical and mental strength, and how it's possible to overcome even the toughest of obstacles.
