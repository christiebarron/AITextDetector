The memoir 'From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives' by Narciso Rodriguez is a powerful piece of literature that creates a complicated and deep mood of duality. On one hand, the memoir details the struggles and pain of being a gay Latin American living in the United States during the 1980’s. It's a story of being suspended between two worlds – the one of his Puerto Rican family providing the ties or origin south of the Rio Grande and the present-day American culture that may have accepted his presence, but never truly welcomed him as a member..

At the same time, the memoir is filled with narrative of beauty, family, love, and dedication to a creative passion. Throughout its pages, Rodriguez is able to capture a simultaneous sense of empowerment and gratitude among his loved ones. His stories brim with an appreciation for the countless, quiet moments that come with learning from and looking after one another. This intimate connection between the narrator and his family is highlighted in the frequent references to music, food, culture, and the comforts of home.

All of this creates a vivid atmosphere of nostalgia, one that goes beyond the usual "one foot in two cultures" narrative. An ever-present appreciation for family and the happy moments spent with them provides a profound sense of joy even in the midst of the difficulties that come with living in a new environment. A rich and complex mood of acceptance, respect, and love washes through every page of Rodriguez’
