Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

Firstly, the setting's impact could be even greater than a "standard tyre of any size" or a "medium tyre of the same weight". This is very likely because, while the 'Rough Road Ahead' setting allows the cyclist to turn to reduce the distance caused by a 'roll' (or a 'turn', for that matter), it also makes it difficult for the rider to see the roads coming. This can lead to poor visibility and can add to crashes for some people with poor vision. As it stands, the setting is not 'perfect' and can be affected by other factors, like the setting's speed.


Some people complain that 'Rough Street Ahead' does not apply when it comes to street surfaces. In fact, some studies have shown that the setting only affects a small part of the space that cyclists are riding on when they are on 'Rough Street'.

Another important effect that may be affecting 'Rough Street Ahead' is the amount of impact of vehicles travelling up or down. In the UK, more cars are now travelling on 'Roadways Ahead', and these drivers are less likely to get hurt when travelling backwards. The following are some examples:

The following scenarios show how a situation may increase the likelihood that a road will be affected by a 'Rough Road Ahead setting' (Figure 5).
