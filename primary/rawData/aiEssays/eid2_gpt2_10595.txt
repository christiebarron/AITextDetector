I believe that censorship of materials in libraries, which are traditionally associated with science and medicine, is the fundamental problem. But it is also the reason why it is so difficult or impossible for us to control those types of materials, which many of them are, in our view, used for scientific purposes.

And one may argue that the problem of the copyright system is that it is too restrictive. I think that is something that is difficult to find any way to resolve. But even if they resolved this, they certainly have made it more difficult for us to control the very sort of materials that we are using, that are actually designed for scientific purposes, such as science in the U.S. and for personal use, or for scientific research. So let's have a conversation about that as a matter of priority. And it seems that if you continue with the current situation, it really is time to start changing the very institutions to make sure that we can treat as many items as Spiegel said, especially in the library, at that time.

There are a number of important reasons why the Library of Congress is still deciding what kinds of materials to use, how to decide what kinds of material are used and to make sure that these are not used for the purpose of scholarly research and for personal use. And we continue to have an interest in the problem of copyright and the protection of the intellectual property that we have.
