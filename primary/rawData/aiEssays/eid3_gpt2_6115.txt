Roadside Bicycle

A rough road ahead scenario has the following elements, with certain exceptions:

• the rider is at a risk or risk of crossing too slowly at an angle of less than 5 mm

• the rider is likely to encounter many obstacles along the road ahead

• a high level of visibility has been observed at or near the junction, along which cyclist is moving at greater risk

• the rider is likely to be crossing the junction at a speed of more than 35 km/h (55 m/s)

• the cyclist has been spotted on a road ahead of them

The cyclist is most at risk from both front and rear veers, whilst he or she is more likely to be able to move over the junction and avoid being trampled.

Cyclists can be aware by using their headlamps when they are crossing a road ahead. The cyclist's headlamps will help them see the cyclist and tell the cyclist that the road ahead is safe, while also helping them to keep their headlight on.

A road ahead scenario will vary slightly depending on individual conditions and characteristics
