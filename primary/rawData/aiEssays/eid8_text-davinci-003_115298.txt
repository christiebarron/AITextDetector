I had just moved into my new house, and the movers had just left. I was feeling a bit overwhelmed and exhausted after the long weekend of packing, unpacking, and rearranging furniture. It was Sunday night and I was lying on the floor in my new living room trying to take a nap. That's when my old roommate showed up with her two kids in tow. 

She had come over to help me unpack, but the kids were just too full of energy. They were running around going from room to room, not paying attention to me. I was feeling a bit neglected until my roommate started tickling them both! 

It was a sight to see! They were running around like wild animals and laughing hysterically. I could not contain my laughter - it was contagious. We all ended up rolling on the floor, laughing so hard our cheeks were turning red. 

When the scene finally settled, we all fell to the ground in exhaustion. It was then that I realized how powerful laughter can be. In those few moments, a connection was made between us - one that could not be achieved through conversation or shared experiences. 

That moment of laughter was our shared get-together and served to strengthen the bond we had between us.
