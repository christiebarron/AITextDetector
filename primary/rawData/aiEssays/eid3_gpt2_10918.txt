Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. One important difference between the bike track and the road is that you need a 'Rough Road Ahead' that you can easily find on your own. Other than that though, there is a lot going on around the city. The road is known as 'Rough Road Ahead' because every time you come to it, there is a certain amount of action as the road changes. There has been speculation that, due to an increase in the number of cars in the city, the streets will become overcrowded. All you need to do is to look for the 'road ahead' signage, look for the white line, then use that map. If there is something missing from the map, it means the road is still going.
