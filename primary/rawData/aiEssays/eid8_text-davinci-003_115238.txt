I was out to dinner with my friend last week at our favorite restaurant. We were catching up on the events of our lives when we both began to laugh uncontrollably. It all began when I recounted to her that my poor date last Saturday had asked to move the date to his house because the restaurant was too crowded. The hilarity must have been contagious because we just couldn't stop laughing.

People around us were starting to join in too. After a few minutes of laughter, we decided to take a break and have some food. We kept making jokes and telling funny stories throughout dinner. We both couldn't remember the last time we laughed so hard.

The best part was that it wasn't just us laughing; people at the table next to us had also joined in. It felt nice to be so connected and it was amazing how laughter brought us all closer together. I've never felt so in sync with complete strangers in my life before.

After we finished our meal and said goodbye to our newfound friends, my friend and I split our sides from laughing so much on the way home. I will most definitely remember that night as a great reminder of the power of laughter and its ability to bring people together.
