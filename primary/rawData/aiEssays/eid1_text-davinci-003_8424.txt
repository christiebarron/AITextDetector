When I recently visited my parentsâ€™ house, I noticed that my dad was a lot grumpier than usual. He was usually very easy going but his mood definitely changed. After trying to figure out what was wrong, he confided that he was going through a difficult time. He recently had to quit his job and was feeling embarrassed and disappointed in himself.

Fortunately, I was in a position to be very patient with him and show him the support he needed. I reassured him it wasn't his fault and that it wasn't the end of the world. I was understanding and listened to all of his worries, and I encouraged him to refocus and look for a new job. Over the next few weeks, I continued to be patient with him and I supported him through the tough times.

Although it was hard at times, I was glad to be able to be there for my dad and help him in a difficult time. Knowing that I could be patient and understanding was one of the most rewarding experiences I have ever had.
