The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because one wonders why so many in the medical community have written an anti-abortion column.

The author didn't even want to discuss the subject at a recent conference, for fear of being ostracized by the conservative community, but she didn't make any effort to point fingers at the right or the wrong side of this issue.

Her book isn't the first time she has written anti-choice and pro-lifers posts in which she has said the right to life "must be as simple as possible":

The truth is, most people are unable or unwilling (but never willing) to be honest about one of the most compelling factors most likely to influence us: the right to life in particular. I am a pro-life, pro-life and pro-life man. So there are many truths to being pro-life that need to be told. So if there were to be a right for any "right", it would be against natural law. A right that the Right should not be compelled to take with it, especially on the first amendment â€“ of which life is one of the most basic rights of people to be able to bear with their natural feelings even when facing a painful pain."

However, despite her views she seems rather sympathetic to the pro-life movement since she's on the left of the anti-abortion brigade while the right wing is also "anti-abortion."
