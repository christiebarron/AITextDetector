I remember the day when my husband and I had our first child — our baby boy. We were filled with so much excitement and joy! We had spent hours in the delivery room and, when finally we met our little one, we just couldn't believe our eyes.

At that moment, we both looked at each other and started laughing. It was a mix of emotion - happiness, disbelief, excitement, and awe. We couldn't be anything but grateful and filled with love.

The doctor noticed our contagious laughter and asked what was so funny. We paused for a moment and then said, “We’re just so happy to meet our little miracle!”

The laughter continued and it felt like it would never stop. It was one of the happiest days of our lives and that moment still stands out all these years later. It was a special moment, a magical one that we will never forget.
