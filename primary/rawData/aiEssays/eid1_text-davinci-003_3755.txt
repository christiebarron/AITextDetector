Dear Editor, 

As the use of computers have become increasingly prevalent in our society, I wanted to take some time to express my opinion on the effects of computers on people. Throughout my life, I have seen how drastically computers have changed the way we think and interact. 

For starters, computers have created an efficiency and ease with which we can communicate and stay connected with one another. Through the internet, it is now possible to share and access information from around the world. I think this is beneficial to modern living. 

However, I worry about the amount of time that young people are spending on computers. While computers offer many advantanges, an over-reliance on technology can lead to less creativity and the inability to think critically. I think it is important to strike a balance between computer use and other activities. 

I also think that there is a danger of becoming too reliant on computers, in both our education and our jobs. We must ensure that computers remain a tool, not a substitute for original thinking and creativity. 

In conclusion, I believe that computers can be beneficial when used as an aid, but that reliance on technology can have adverse effects. If used in moderation, computers can open up a world of new opportunities, but over-dependency can have a range of negative effects. 

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
