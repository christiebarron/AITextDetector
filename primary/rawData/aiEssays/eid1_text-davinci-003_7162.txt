In the poem "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski, the setting is an instrumental part of the story and impacts the cyclist in many ways. The setting of the poem is an open highway, through a desolate desert interstate in the Southwest, as night falls around seven o'clock. The cyclist's vulnerability in this environment is highlighted by the low visibility due to the darkness setting in, emphasizing him as an exposed figure pushed forward by the wind.

The expanse of the desert creates the feeling of isolation that follows the cyclist. As his bike struggles against the ceaseless winds, he is left with his own thoughts, which only serve to further reflect this sense of helplessness and disconnection from the world. He is left to battle his own struggles against the wind, a metaphor for his inner conflicts that he must face despite the challenging conditions of his environment.

The weather also plays a factor in the narrative; the wind provides resistance to the cyclist's journey and produces a type of suffering that mirrors his mental endurance. The wind is a representation of external negativity and pressure that intensify his internal struggles and magnify his sense of isolation.

The cyclist rides through the setting, determined to persevere and traverse the challenging terrain, highlighting his resilience. The poem ends with the cyclist picking up speed. This serves to symbolize his progress on the journey, representing his internal strength and resolve to face the unknown, even if his destination may come at a cost.
