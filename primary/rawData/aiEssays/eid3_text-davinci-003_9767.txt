The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski affect the cyclist in a few different ways. First, the environment is extremely hilly and mountainous, with sharp curves and dangerous drops. This creates an atmosphere of challenge and danger for the cyclist, as they have to navigate these treacherous terrain. 

The cyclist is also faced with wineries, vegetable farms, and vineyards; this indicates that the rider is in an area that is often rural and has many hidden dangers that are difficult to detect. For example, gravel and debris can lie unseen until they become a hazard, and the cyclist must remain alert and prepared for the unexpected.

The narrow roads and sharp curves of these winding countryside make it difficult for the cyclist to navigate and increases their risk of peril. These features of the setting also give the cyclist a sense of adventure as they cycle through successfully negotiating these roads.

Finally, the cyclist has to manage their route and work hard to assess and plan around the constantly changing landscape. Small features of the road and environment can make a huge difference and the cyclist must constantly recognize and anticipate situations and act quickly.

Overall, the features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead” affect the cyclist in multiple ways. From the sense of challenge and adventure, to the dangers they must weave their way around; it is clear that the cyclist has their work cut out for them.
