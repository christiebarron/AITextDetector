The ending of "Winter Hibiscus" by Minfong Ho is intended to provide a sense of hope and resolution to the story. The protagonist, Ting, has worked hard studying for a language test throughout the winter in order to join the families at the lunch table. The ending suggests that she will try again in the spring when the snows melt and the geese have returned. This imagery suggests a renewal of the natural world, along with a renewed determination from Ting to again take the language test. Furthermore, the revival of the winter hibiscus flower is a symbol of the growth, change, and optimism of Ting's circumstances. Ultimately, the ending serves to remind the reader that there can be hope for better circumstances and possibilities in the future.
