Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. In the opening scene of the episode two cyclists in the park are seen in the background, and 'a look at the current weather forecast' for the day (a photograph of the weather forecast can be seen on the 'Weather Forecast' page on the UCI website). It is not very clear as to what effect some of the changes may have had on the weather in the earlier scenes. Some of these changes may have also increased visibility for cyclists in the park, and/or a number of others may have taken one day off, or even a week! The 'Snowman' scenes in particular are pretty unique in terms of what can be seen for an extended period, and this scene in particular was so large, at least in my opinion, that if you were to see this in a park you could see it as a big chunk of the park from a distance. When it actually became much, much clearer to the camera in the above scene (and the above photo), and also on the inside of the park, it is not obvious to the reader how often or how quickly these changes happened, but to me, I assume that these changes were not as significant as those seen in other places, because the park is about 4 km wide and 4 km wide with much of the landscape wide between for miles on either side. So, as it is a very big part of the park at the end
