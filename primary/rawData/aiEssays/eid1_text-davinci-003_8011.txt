The Empire State Building was a remarkable feat of engineering upon its completion in 1931, and its main feature was a 200-foot steel mast at the top that was designed to act as an anchoring station for dirigibles. Although it seemed like a logical idea at the time, the attempt to allow the airships to dock at the Empire State Building was met with numerous obstacles.

The first challenge the builders of this structure faced was the limited space that was available at the top of the building. While airships were large enough to accommodate passenger and cargo loads, they still needed to be able to turn and maneuver on the landing mast, leaving little room for them to approach or maneuver about. This issue was compounded by the fact that the building was built in the bustling city of New York, where air space was already crowded due to the number of aircraft that flew around the city.

In addition to the lack of space, safety was a major concern for the engineers attempting to accommodate dirigibles. Not only was it a risk to include large and potentially combustible airships in an already crowded airspace, but these ships also had the potential to cause damage to the building if they ever failed to dock correctly. Furthermore, the building itself was incredibly tall, meaning that the airships would have to ascend to high altitudes in order to reach the building's mooring mast. This presented additional safety concerns, as the airships would be barely visible while flying around the city
