Dear Editor,

In a world that often feels chaotic and unpredictable, computers provide solace to many people. With the dawn of the digital age, computers and technology have become integral parts of our lives. While some view this as an unwelcome change, with today’s increased reliance on computers, we must answer this question – what are the effects of computers on people?

By providing a remarkable level of convenience and efficiency, computers have enhanced the daily lives of millions of individuals. People now have unprecedented access to an infinite amount of invaluable information, enabling them to better educate themselves, stay organized, and stay connected with friends and family. Additionally, businesses now have the ability to automate tedious tasks, and store mountains of data securely at scale.

On the other hand, computers can become an addiction. Excessive use interjects itself between people and the physical world. People must be careful not to become too cozy in the clutches of technology, allowing it to control their lives or take over their personal relationships. Computers have also had a negative impact on peoples' physical health. Sitting at a computer for extended periods of time increases the risk of various health problems.

Overall, computers bring great benefits to our lives. They allow us to better connect with the world and access a plethora of limitless information. But, the effects of computers must be managed so that we do not become overly dependent on them.

Best regards,

[Your name]
