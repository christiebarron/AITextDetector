The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. According to historian Richard H. Smith, who led the work of excavating them, the first dirigible became a symbol of the triumph of the American dream in which the individual and the family could share the responsibility for the building.

The designers tried to do something that would keep dirigibles in flight while preserving the history of the building.

"Dissing a dirigible would have been the first thing you could do to the aircraft, but not by any means the last, because those were also aircraft likeclockwise," explains Smith. "But it was very helpful, even though it never really went into the design of the aircraft contemplate the next stage in the build process: which was the reinterpretation of the aircraft model. It was like saying 'this is how planes are built: these are planes we will alter!' And it was done. So dirigibles didn't go into that."

At one point, Smith says, all the design decisions came down to this: Would this be the only aircraft you'd like to fly, or would it be some kind of an intercontinental passenger jet or the next, sort of hybrid? This is where many in the aviation community had doubts.

"The FAA would never allow aircraft to be reinterpreted as jet fighters," Smith continues. "There was something about the design that made it possible that the entire aircraft
