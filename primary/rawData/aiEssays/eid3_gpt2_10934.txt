It can occur in the form of a simple cycle-change zone, or it can occur as an automatic transition from a road to a new one with a more specific design – an approach that most cyclists can take with some degree of confidence – but it just isn't there yet.

In fact, the setting is quite unbalanced, as far as you can tell. While it might seem hard to go wrong with a cycling setting, particularly on a cold winter day, one should never allow things like this to slip through your fingers. The setting is much more than just a simple bike-path that moves in a fixed direction around all fours.

So much of this is a bit random. The number of cycle changes is a bit odd. It's not the most random number, but it's a good indicator that the cycle-changing cycle-out is going ahead.
