The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it brings back those memories of the time that most Americans were still reeling from the year of the storm.

And as readers return to the new book in the summer of 2015, Winter Hibiscus has one very important tidbit to tell about those last days at the helm of a mighty and most important corporation.

The story goes back to the early days of the company where the last time a lot of power was wasted is.

It seems the entire company went wrong. It was never only in the wrong places. The same companies who had failed the world once again went the bad way again.

So the company has to start up again now without the help of a lot's help.
