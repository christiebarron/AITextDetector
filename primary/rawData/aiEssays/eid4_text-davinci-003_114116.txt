The narrator of the story, an immigrant girl from Thailand named Nok, has immigrated to the United States. She is struggling to adapt to her new culture and learn English in school. She is so determined to learn English and fit in that she takes a test twice in order to prove her abilities. The ending of the story poetically ties this journey of learning and discovery to the natural symbol of the hibiscus flower. The hibiscus, like Nok, is able to survive harsh winter conditions and bloom again in the spring. This connection is used to reinforce the idea that perseverance in learning can be rewarding. By ending the story with this symbolic imagery,Minfong Ho suggests that when the protagonist, Nok, comes back in the spring, her hard work and dedication to learning will be rewarded, and she will pass her tests.
