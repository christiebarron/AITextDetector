Dear Editor, 

I am writing to discuss the effect computers have on people today. As technology continually evolves in our world, the number of people using computers only seems to be increasing. The positives and negatives associated with this technology range greatly. 

As a proponent of computer technology, I believe that computers are beneficial. They provide people with access to information, increase efficiency, and allow for quicker communication. To add, computers offer an outlet, such as the internet, for people to connect with one another. 

Despite these positives, there is an undeniable downside when it comes to computers. Peopleâ€™s reliance on computers can lead to a lack of in-person communication, issues with privacy, and an unhealthy overuse of technology. 

Therefore, I believe that it is important for us to assess the effects of computers carefully. We must strike a balance between their benefits and the potential risks of relying on technology too heavily. Computers have changed the way we operate and communicate, but it is our job to ensure that this change is for the better. 

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
