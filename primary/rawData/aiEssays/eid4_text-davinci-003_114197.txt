Minfong Ho ends Winter Hibiscus with this hopeful message, emphasizing the importance of education and perseverance. Spring often symbolizes a new beginning or rebirth, and the phrase “when the snows melt and the geese return” further reinforces this idea. The hope is that, through the cycle of seasons and the promise of new beginnings, the protagonist will be able to “take that test again” and achieve greater success. It speaks to the timelessness of hope, and encourages the reader to have faith that ultimately, hard work and perseverance are often rewarded.
