One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was sitting on the floor next to my dog before we could get around them. For me it felt like I was the only animal in the group. I didn't mean it differently. It only said my name because when it was time to head back to the house I realized I'd made it to the centerRelationship with an animal at its best is very difficult when you're not getting along with them. I understand that sometimes when this animal is around, they're attracted to you. When you're not with them, there's an inability that you have to give them the most powerful thing in your life. I always hope that the animal would get to understand that there's no way around that and we'd live a much better life.- It was just my instinct of not letting this animal get into my life. I've had animals before and I saw them in other people. However, my second encounter with a wild animal had to be when I was with a friend. We were sitting in my patio in a little cafe area in the city. We're just at the end of a small road. There are other people in the bushes, so I'm walking through the woods toward the edge and some of them are like I could see them. He'd come up on his back and he was like "What the hell is happening?" I just looked away, I think it was at that moment when I lost all sense of myself.
