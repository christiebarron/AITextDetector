I was in my home office, hosting an important video conference call. Suddenly, my internet connection went down. I was frustrated at first, but I tried to remain patient and calm. I knew I just had to wait until the connection was restored.

For the next 30 minutes, I sat at my desk, not moving a muscle. I was determined to regain access to the call but needed to remain still and quiet. As the minutes ticked by, frustration built up and my pulse raced. I tried my best to remain patient, to not let my negative emotions take over.

Finally, the time passed and my connection was back. I was able to join the call! I was so relieved that I hadn't snapped or let out my frustration earlier. Being patient paid off!
