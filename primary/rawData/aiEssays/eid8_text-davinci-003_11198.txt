I remember the first time I met my best friend. We had just moved to the same city and found ourselves in the same class in seventh grade. We were both trying to make friends, but we kept to ourselves for the first few weeks. 

One day, during a long period of silence, I noticed that she was wearing the most interesting pair of shoes. They were old sneakers with sparkly laces. She must have noticed my eyes wandering because she pointed down and said “Do you like these? I found them at a thrift shop and couldn’t resist!” 

We both started to laugh, and I realized that was the first time either of us had laughed since we’d been in the class. Laughter was all it took for us to become best friends – we clicked instantly, and we’ve been together ever since!
