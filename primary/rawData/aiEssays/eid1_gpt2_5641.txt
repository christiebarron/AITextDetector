Why do we tend to make mistakes as we get older, as our brain loses track of our life processes? Let's look at the life cycle to be born.

Life Cycle The main process being the maintenance of our body and our consciousness. The body's energy, energy and consciousness are constantly increasing (and in some things increasing!) while you and us have smaller brains. These tiny parts that are responsible for all of our activity will gradually die down.

While we have bigger brain sizes in each stage of life we also have smaller brain capacity in stages, because these stages don't always affect our body and consciousness. When we were young, we lost about 50kg as a result of lack of any energy, including those around us. At this young age, we developed the ability to regulate things (we tend to be smarter and feel more well equipped).

If we were all able to manage these small changes with our brains, our consciousness would grow (like normal people). If we were able to manage these big
