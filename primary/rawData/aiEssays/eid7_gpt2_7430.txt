An example of a time someone in my life was patient was seeing my husband getting his own prescription for a different medication. His prescription for it was very high, he was sick for hours every day. Then the next day he got another prescription, and the wife was all over him, and it just wasn't easy to care for him, I'm so sorry for him. This time I said I did that, he was right. I have to ask you for my advice. It's not easy, but it's a life and death decision, you can't afford medication for yourself. And I mean that in an important way, I'm sorry I didn't want to take your advice. I'm so sorry, I said no one can take it for themselves. But I'm sorry for the husband who had his life destroyed. He was one of those people who would come and take it from me, to me, but the one he would get, wasn't his wife. I'm sorry for him and would do it again. And at the same time my wife is so devastated that I haven't thought about that much since that point, and she is devastated that I'm not seeing her more often. I'm devastated because there is no way of keeping her.

AMY GOODMAN: So what can you say for us, the father of a child who is still an active young man and I see him with his face in that movie?
