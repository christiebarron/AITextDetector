Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. As advancements in technology continue to progress, computers have become a part of our daily lives. Therefore, it is important to consider the potential effects that computers have on people.

In my opinion, computers can have both positive and negative impacts on people. On the plus side, computers can provide people with access to vast amounts of information and knowledge, allowing them to stay informed and make progress in their fields of study. They can also offer a variety of activities to keep people connected, entertained, and engaged. At the same time, however, computers can become a source of distraction, potentially resulting in a lack of focus and inefficient time management.

The extent of these effects can depend on how people use their computers and the amount of control they exert over their use of computers. For instance, people who take the time to create and follow a schedule may experience more of the positive benefits of computer use than those who spend most of their time browsing the web or playing games.

Ultimately, computers can have both positive and negative impacts on people depending on how they are used. This highlights the importance of self-control and moderation when it comes to computer use. I am confident that most readers can agree with me on this point. 

Sincerely, 
[Your name]
