The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' by the late journalist and Nobel prize recipient Naomi Klein is one of the most important reasons to study the human mind after 1945.

She describes how she wrote about working with the German Communist Party in 1933 as "a struggle that was both fascinating and exhausting â€¦ What the mood gave me was an almost impossible love: I could see not only that my own sense of self could be the difference between survival and war, but my own consciousness that I was able to live my life to the fullest and to make them what they were."

The book is a tribute to Klein and one of her essays, 'The Girl Who Took Care of Me: A Memoir', written in response to a photograph captioning its release to Kirov. But the final word is a tribute to her, which was not the same as a new memoir.
