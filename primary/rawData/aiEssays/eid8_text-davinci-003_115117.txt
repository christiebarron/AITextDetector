 

I remember the first time I met my future husband. We were both attending a friend’s BBQ and had been introduced through mutual acquaintances. It was quite the intimidating affair, as I felt I was being studied by what felt like a jury. I remember feeling like all eyes were on us, and I had never been more aware of the awkward silence between us.

Thankfully, I spotted a nearby table filled with a variety of humorous items: silly hats, joke books, party games, and the like. I nervously grabbed something, and before I knew it, we were both laughing and having an incredibly pleasant conversation. Nearly all the awkwardness of the evening was overshadowed by the sense of humor and playfulness that we had discovered.

The laughter was infectious, and soon everyone around us was joining in. It was a hilarious yet beautiful moment. We shared anecdotes, made jokes, and just enjoyed each other’s company in an environment that was far from intimidating.

We ended up talking for hours, and it was because of the shared laughter that our relationship began to bloom. From that day forward, we knew that the depth of our relationship was going to run much deeper than our first meeting.

That night, laughs brought us together. They were our biggest ally and, in the end, really allowed us to open up to each other. Laughter has truly been the bridge that has brought us closer all these years later.
