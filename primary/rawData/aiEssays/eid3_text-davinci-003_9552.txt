In Joe Kurmaski's short story "Rough Road Ahead," the cyclist is greatly impacted by the setting around him. The cyclist begins his journey on a typical country road surrounded by cornfields, an environment of "warmth and softness." Though the road is even and mild at first, it soon changes drastically, as if the backdrop has suddenly shifted.

The cyclist soon finds himself on a sharp, winding road, filled with unexpected turns and steep inclines. The road has become so dangerous that the cyclist can feel the vibration of the bumpy surface through his arms as he navigates the track. This is a stark contrast to the earlier soothing environment he encountered. 

The cyclist must contend with the unique properties of the road: the uneven terrain, the obstacles, and the limited visibility. As he progresses up the hill, his body is pushed to its physical limits and, yet, he must keep his composure to stay in control of his bike. 

The cyclist's limitations are further magnified by the oppressive nature of the mountainsâ€”the darkened sky, the imposing trees, and the dense fog. All of these factors serve to heighten the cyclist's sense of uncertainty and danger. By the end of the story, the cyclist has gone through a life-changing experience, and his battle with the terrain of the mountains reflects the psychological struggles of the protagonist against the seemingly insurmountable obstacles before him.
