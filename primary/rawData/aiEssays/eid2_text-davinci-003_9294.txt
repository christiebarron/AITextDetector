The debate over censorship in libraries has been ongoing since the existence of literature, and it is not a conversation that should be taken lightly. Libraries are centers of learning and freedom of expression, and no person or force of authority should have the right to control or dictate what one reads and listens to.

Every person has their own opinion of what is appropriate and what is offensive in literature, music, movies, and magazines, and libraries should honor that fact. Censoring materials not only violates this right of the general public, but can also prevent important multi-cultural representations and knowledge from being disseminated. If materials are removed from library shelves, people are denied the right to make up their own minds about the content. 

Not only does censorship violate the publicâ€™s personal privacy, it also hinders intellectual freedom. Anyone has the right to gain access to diverse, impartial resources, and this process should not be altered because of personal or social beliefs. It is important to respect the diverse opinions and values that are associated with a variety of materials, and censoring them is not the answer.  

We are in the 21st century, and it is important to keep up with the times. In the spirit of free democracy, libraries need to provide access to a variety of information. To limit access to materials goes against the core of what makes a library a public institution, and it would be a slippery slope to start censoring materials.
