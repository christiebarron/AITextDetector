Computers have many effects on people. Some of them have been linked to Alzheimer's, strokes and heart disease. Others have caused serious brain damage, such as strokes and Alzheimer's. But they've done little about people with mental disease.

An interesting finding by Dr. Gorman is the impact of schizophrenia on many disorders, some of which look like disorders with very little or no effect. On average, people with schizophrenia had more trouble sleeping at night compared to people without the condition.

The researchers had Linux or Windows versions of several different kinds of programs used by computer scientists to detect mental illness. Then they showed that people who took a low-level program that called for an "extension of a program," called the "Pillow" task, which turned on a process known as "intent control," had fewer sleep disturbances and had less risk of developing depression and post-traumatic stress.

"This work raises the question of what caused brain damage in people with schizophrenia," said Dr. Gorman.

The researchers used the Pillow task to tell the participants that they thought they were suffering from a mental illness, such as schizophrenia, but the difference in symptoms was in terms of what was happening in the brain, he said.

Researchers found that a program called "Peloy" was doing more good than bad, which is a good thing, said Dr. Gorman. People took away the "extend of a thing" and
