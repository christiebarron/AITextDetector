The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

According to the FAA, there was a requirement that the owners of the tower should have the full range of their equipment so they could dock with a set amount of altitude for a maximum of 2.8 minutes on each side of the building. The FAA also determined that the maximum docking time required on an exterior or interior surface was 7 to 9 minutes.

Airport officials took several steps to rectify the conditions of the situation to allow the owners of the tower to dock without being allowed to dock more than 15 minutes on each side of the building. The owners of the tower were initially supposed to serve as the anchors to carry the planes back from the city limits, but they were pulled back as early as March 31, 2014 after city officials said a lack of adequate information to identify the aircraft and which airports it was bound on led the owners to turn the aircraft around while in tow.

The FAA did not address the pilot/diverter dispute, but they did find some of the planes to be safe, according to FAA Administrator Charles S. Marietta. Marietta added that this pilot/diverter dispute resulted from the pilot failing to provide his "full safety information." He said, however, that a pilot would have been able to have the required information available to him before he was scheduled to dock the plane without being allowed to dock more than 8 minutes on each
