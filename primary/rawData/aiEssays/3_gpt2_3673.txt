Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. With less than a fifth of the space being occupied by motorists (a small number of the remaining 5% are used by motorists and not cyclists), there are fewer restrictions and there is a much more sensible use of the roadway. A cyclist should have no impediments to their approach to the other side. However, if the road becomes too narrow and a cyclist enters the other side for a short moment, their chances of reaching the other side can be greatly reduced and a wider car lane would be created.

A new approach to reducing the number of obstructions would involve the use of an additional lane of four or more to allow more cars to pass, while cyclists would have their lane re-arranged to be narrower.

The New Road Guidelines

The new guidelines come into force on 1st May. They are designed to make bicycle access easier for a community living along the London Underground.
