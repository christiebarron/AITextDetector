The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because of what some in the Christian world see as a change in the way we worship our God. It's this recognition that a change in our thinking can alter our own. They will accept our belief in God and our need for the grace to repent and take responsibility for life. But the change is always a bit of a stretch to say that we now have a new set of values, with the change to acknowledge and embrace our own faith-based principles.

The book does a fantastic job of telling these new values, which we will be happy to discuss within the book and what the future holds for us.
