Dear Editor, 

I'm writing to share my opinion about the increasingly widespread use of computers today. Specifically, I think the effects of computers are overwhelmingly positive. 

Computers allow people to have unprecedented access to information. With a few clicks, you can get facts and figures from around the globe. And with the widespread availability of the internet, people have unparalleled access to a range of education, research and entertainment. With the internet, anything is possibleâ€”it is, quite literally, a world of knowledge at our fingertips.

Computers also facilitate communication and collaboration. It is now easier than ever to keep in touch with friends and family, even if separated by thousands of miles. Likewise, businesses and other organizations can more effectively share knowledge and ideas across time and space.

Finally, computers bring us entertainment. With so many websites, videos, and games available, there's something for everyone. Whether you're an aspiring artist or a sports fan, there's an outlet for your passion. 

Ultimately, computers offer tremendous potential, and their effects on people are overwhelmingly positive. I'm urging everyone to harness the power of the internet, participate in online communities, and use computers to their potential.
