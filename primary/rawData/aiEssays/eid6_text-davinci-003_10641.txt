The Empire State Building was built in 1931 as a skyscraper in the heart of Manhattan, New York City. At the time, many believed that it would become a hub for dirigibles, the large airships of the time. Although the Empire State Building claimed to be fit to house dirigibles, the task of allowing them to dock proved to be highly challenging due to many obstacles along the way.

First, the plan to build a suitable and secure docking platform that could fit the size of the dirigibles posed a significant challenge. To facilitate dirigibles docking, a “mooring mast” was constructed on the roof of the building at the height of 1,050 feet, making it the world’s tallest mooring station. As articulated in Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s book ‘The Mooring Mast’, the mooring mast was built and designed for the Hindenburg, the largest dirigible of its time. Despite this, the Hindenburg was unable to dock due to a strong gust of wind that was too great for the mooring mast.

The second challenge faced by the builders of the Empire State Building was ensuring that the airships would be able to dock and takeoff safely at the station. At that time, there was no proven technology that would allow such a feat. To address this, numerous safety precautions were taken, such as the introduction of “brake lines
