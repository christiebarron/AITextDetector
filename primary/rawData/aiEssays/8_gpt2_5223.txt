One time I experienced laughter in my life was when there was something at school that I didn't know was there - to be called 'one bit'.

How did a young girl who was so much loved in her family be able to share her love of music and be made an open book for that person?

I was a child when my first love was the music. A band called 'Keeper' came to Europe and put out albums. It was about love. I didn't know what kind of music I wanted to get into, I didn't know how to play it and I wasn't even able to play it very well. Now I've played a lot more with my parents and all my friends. They are all great and all beautiful! I want to be a musician now and I think it's the love I deserve because once I have found it, it will be my new life.

There's nothing, really, good about being a musician. I've never been one who listened to songs and tried to write songs myself but there was always something. I've never heard good music but this stuff always changed my life.

When I was a kid, what I had to do was play the drums and try to put it out there. I loved what I did but I didn't know anything about rhythm or drumming or anything. Jos√© was the only guitar-playing kid I knew who was a pro with a full instrumentation and a guitar.
