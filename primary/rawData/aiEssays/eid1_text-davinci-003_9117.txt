Dear Editor,

As computer technology continues to become more prevalent in our lives, it is important for people to consider the long-term effects they may have on our lives and society. 

Computers are often hailed as a tool, and this is certainly true. They allow us to do more work in shorter timespans and provide us with valuable resources. But all tools have downsides, and computers come with a number of potentially negative impacts. These include everything from social isolation to physical health risks due to increased sitting time. As such, it is wise to question whether our increasing reliance on computers is really a good thing.

The physical health risks linked to excessive computer use are well-known. Spending large amounts of time sitting at a computer carries with it a number of potential health problems. Some of these include obesity, posture issues, and even carpal tunnel syndrome. With extended computer use, we also open ourselves up to potential eye strain and headaches. 

There is also the potential for social isolation, as individuals can easily become disconnected from friends and family in favor of the virtual world. Computers can also encourage a warped lifestyle as users cycle between work and gaming with little else in between. This can lead to a decrease in physical movement, loss of motivation, and a lack of meaningful interaction with other people.

For these reasons, I believe it's important to consider the potential impacts of computers carefully and consider how we can best leverage their
