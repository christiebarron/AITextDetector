I was working at my job when I noticed one of my coworkers was having a hard day. She was making mistakes that were leading to confusion and more work for everyone on the team. I could tell she was getting frustrated, but I decided to stay patient and understanding. 

I approached her and offered to help her make corrections where possible and offered to take on some of her tasks. I didn't say anything about her mistakes or yell at her-- I just calmly helped her out and tried to put her at ease. My patience seemed to make her feel more comfortable and she was eventually able to get her work done without making any more mistakes. 

In the end, my patience and understanding of the situation was able to help her get through a difficult moment. I'm proud of myself for staying patient and not getting angry or frustrated.
