Computers have many effects on people. I started out with nothing; in fact, I think I know a bit more about Computers than I ever did before. My computer skills were quite good in high school after some of the lectures I had at the University of Minnesota and some of my university friends after I had taken it online and was told by our students that our computers are computer science. I did my first computer science courses where, for a long while, we did not know much about computers; then one day at Harvard Business School I got a job teaching the computer science course at MIT.

I came back to college and was invited back to the area that I had already been studying at. Then I got a job at CERN. We all worked hard trying to do our best. By 2003, before my computer science career in the business world even started, I had started working for CERN but the job was much more important than the Computer Science. For many decades, the program was very important to my future success. This led me to come across G.M.I., the University of Vienna in Vienna. G.M.I. was an enormous success in my field of physics. Before I got my job there, my work was completely ignored, I was never asked about it, it was never even mentioned to anybody, it was not even mentioned to any of my colleagues. Even today, when some of my colleagues go to see me to ask about it,
