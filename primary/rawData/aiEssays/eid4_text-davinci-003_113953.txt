At the end of the poem, the poet acknowledges the cyclical nature of seasons and of life. The last line is a reflection of this circular process, in which the hibiscus will bloom again in the spring, and the narrator will take the test again, signifying that they will have a second chance at success. The poet also calls to mind the interdependence between nature and humanity; the geese and the snow's melting signals that it is the time of year for the hibiscus to bloom and, subsequently, for the narrator to take the test again. In this way, the last line serves as a reminder of nature's power and the possibility of new beginnings.
