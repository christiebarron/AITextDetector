I remember the day I met my best friend like it was yesterday. We were both freshmen in college and had been randomly assigned adjacent dorm rooms. We soon became inseparable and could be found together constantly, from studying in the library to endless laughter in the caf.

One particular evening, we decided to head to the theater down the street to catch a movie. We were deep in one of our trademark belly laughs halfway through the previews, and it only got louder as the movie progressed. After one particularly funny scene, I snorted so loudly that I snorted popcorn out of my nose. Everyone in the theater turned to give us a death stare, but my friend and I just laughed even harder at my misfortune. We couldn't stop until the tears streaming down our cheeks won out and we stumbled out of the theater in near hysterics.

It was then that I knew she and I would be best friends for life. We had been through a lot together, but it was the moment when we truly connected over laughter that I knew we had something special.
