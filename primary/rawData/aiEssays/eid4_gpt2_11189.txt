The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because the original story told in this story will be an essential to the main story - that's my guess. I don't think this story will ever get rewritten.

So that's where I stand from here right now: the reason I am playing the game and the story is this: the more I write it the more I think I can write without messing up the things that lead up to it. It's about being an interesting person and trying to find that balance between what's going on with the characters and what they will do in the stories they tell.

I'm no expert on this subject, but the point is that after I wrote it I don't really feel like writing a story with my name involved. I don't want to think about what may or may not be there but I have plenty of ways of making sense of them. And the point is: this way I don't need to write it for "getting into that stuff." I need to write it for myself, but I know I can write this for people in a different time period, and that's where it ends when I get to the climax, "Oh, I didn't really see the ending, there is a long way to go. It wasn't that bad. I just wanted to get back into those sorts of things." It's a difficult and often confusing story to write but I'm willing to accept that
