One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my friend came to the house, told me why he was there, and I said he was joking. A lot of people were joking to me at the time, but there were a few more laughing. I was about to say something bad about the guy, but it only was because I was trying to keep my composure and not do any harm. I thought I was joking but he was laughing. It wasn't until the next evening that I got sick on TV as well."

Dorrien says she got out of work in May 2006 and started to tell her family about the incident. By the time of that, Dorrien says she was pregnant with twins, which helped her take a different attitude and approach to working with the boys. But the experience was not all that positive. She was very angry but was working with her family, helping those who were struggling with their own health. Dorrien says she also needed "a lot of therapy" to bring the boy to her own mental state. The mother of the girl who reported her husband in a similar way to Dorrien, says her child is now "like a kid's, living in an old house."

The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, has offered to give Dorrien advice, in return for her release from prison.
