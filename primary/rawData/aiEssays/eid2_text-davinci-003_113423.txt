In recent years, debates about censorship in libraries have become more prominent. Some people argue that libraries should be able to act as gatekeepers, vetting all of the content they make available on their shelves. They propose that certain offensive materials should be removed from circulation to protect the innocence of younger library-goers. However, I strongly oppose censorship in libraries for a variety of reasons.

First and foremost, censorship in libraries is an abhorrent infringement of people’s freedom of expression and right to access information. Taking certain materials off the shelves restricts people’s ability to access a wide variety of experiences, opinions, and perspectives that books, music, movies, and magazines often provide. As such, censorship acts as a barrier to the fundamental rights of all library patrons.

In addition to this, censorship in libraries is also often motivated by a subjective set of moral criteria that are specific to the perspectives of certain library officials. It is a form of censorship that even the most moralistic group would be uncomfortable overestimating. Whilst one person’s opinion of what remains as acceptable content, another may take offense to and want it removed. As such, it is impractical to rely on one’s moral standards as a means of determining acceptable content in a library.

Finally, while some suggest that the tools of censorship are necessary to protect the innocence of children, this argument fails to take into account the fact that libraries are not always frequented by minors. Rem
