The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

"I'm so surprised by the amount of attention put out," said Daniel Blagel, who was recently named CEO and the project's chief architectural engineering officer. "The building has been doing fine, but there are no incentives and no guarantees. So if someone wants to put a car dogs out there, or a building owner does that, there is no incentive to do that on behalf of all New Yorkers."

Blagel said there was a little bit of debate about how to integrate dirigibles into the buildings while making a statement about the quality. Some argued it would be more convenient for dirigibles to dock in their own backyards and while others held that it would create a problem where there were no public parking.

And other critics claimed it would be necessary to design and build more shelters for owners who saw the need to reduce the number of people per car to avoid overcrowding and increase capacity.

The proposal was quickly rejected by the Bronx Department of Planning on the grounds that the project violated the city's "emotional well-being principle" and was not "just for the sake of convenience," officials said. "The government had a public interest in confirring that, but this was an effort to make it so the city would see a difference in the community but the need was no longer there," said a Department of Planning official in an interview recently
