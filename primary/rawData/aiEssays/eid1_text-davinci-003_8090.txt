The construction of the Empire State Building in New York provided an incredible opportunity for travelers and businesses. When the building opened in 1931, it became the world’s tallest building, and the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the building was quickly explored. Despite the potential for success, there were many obstacles that the builders had to overcome in order to make the idea of docking dirigibles a reality. These obstacles included weather, complicated logistics, and economic hardship.

First, there was the difficult challenge of weather. Due to the lighter-than-air ship, wind and temperature could potentially make a dirigible docking at the Empire State Building difficult due to the turbulent air flow and instability it could potentially bring. In order to make docking feasible, infrastructure would have to be built to steel the ship and provide a way for it to remain secure at the structure.

Second, there was the complexity of logistics. Dr. Raymond Orteig was one of the main figures who championed the idea of the mooring mast, and he knew it would require extensive planning and engineering to make the project possible. The mast that would’ve risen up from the top of the Empire State Building was estimated to be 360 feet tall, and the airship that would be using it would need to be large enough to carry at least 20 passengers. Furthermore, the airship had to be engineered to dock safely and securely, and had to be able to take off again without
