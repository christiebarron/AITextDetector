The Empire State Building was a marvel of engineering and ambition. When the building was first proposed, its owners had a lofty vision: they wanted it to be the tallest building in the world and also one of the first that could accommodate dirigibles – large airships – docking at its roof. However, these ideals were far more challenging than anyone had anticipated.

The sheer magnitude of the project meant that the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building were immense and complex. The architects knew that building a tower strong enough to support a dirigible docking at the roof was a herculean task. Not only was the tower top area extremely lightweight, the design also required an aircraft runway that the dirigibles could use safely to land on and dock. To support the lake of power and machinery needed for such a large dirigible, the base of the building had to be reinforced and strengthened far beyond what was needed for a standard building.

On top of the challenge of building a docking facility that could accommodate a dirigible, the owners and builder of the Empire State Building faced an even more daunting challenge: gaining approval from various government departments to install the necessary infrastructure. According to Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s ‘The Mooring Mast’, the founders had to convince the New York City Building and Zoning Department that the docking mast would not be a potential hazard, as well as the Civil Aviation Authority, the Port of New York,
