Computers have many effects on people. One is to create an atmosphere that is too toxic, so toxins are everywhere in our society. Our current exposure to all forms of radiology are extremely dangerous. Radiological decay has been measured in humans on many continents (including Russia, China, Japan) and was documented by scientists who reported in 2004 in The Journal of Radiation Protection.

A huge amount of people in the world live in the US. The radiation of the Chernobyl and Fukushima reactors were detected at 50 million pounds of radioactive decay. The reactor and all parts are currently still in service with over two-and-a-half months since power was restored to the building in December.

The current status of America has a special kind of role in the war on radiological decay. The US Government recently ordered the replacement of some of its plutonium and the new generation is now able to carry out its vital functions for all of us without damaging nuclear reactors. But in order to get through the second phase of the nuclear weapons programme, the Americans are forced to make sacrifices on the part of our governments to guarantee the safety of their citizens in the US. One of the reasons is that with the recent nuclear war in Europe, it has become more clear to us that they will do anything for us to avoid this disaster. The European Union (EC) is in danger of losing its rights to prevent the disaster and all the costs caused by the military buildup that have been happening right now. The
