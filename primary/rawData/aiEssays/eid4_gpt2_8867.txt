The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it takes the form of a human facing the future. His story revolves around how they end up at a young age with little knowledge or understanding on the outside.

This means the book ends with a scene set outside a hospital and he learns that the hospital is a breeding ground for criminals and rapists. His family is left trapped in a world of fear, confusion, and confusion, yet the book ends with him finding his way home. It means the book starts out trying to make sense of the life and times of this young man. He learns that he has to go home and have things better than he has in other parts of Africa.

The novel is hard to read, despite the good news that the author has taken care to tell the real story.
