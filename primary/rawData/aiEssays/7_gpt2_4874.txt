An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was hospitalized in 2009. We got home a few days later and my doctors told me that my body was in pain. We felt pain in some places or the side of my face, so I had to get my prescription for that. I didn't see any pain, but I was in fact feeling very happy. My doctor asked me to go to the bathroom so I could get a look at myself. He was kind of surprised, because I didn't even have any eyes. It looked like all I was looking at was my reflection in the mirror. He said 'Don't be scared of this person. Don't be afraid if you look at yourself. They will tell you that you are in pain. It's your life and it's going to take time and it's up to you.' I said, 'It's not fair.' The doctor had said I was lucky because I was getting treated well. That was an example of aGame of Thrones moment.

You do have some of rebellions in Westeros, which are sometimes you just have to stand up and say shit. A little rebellion is part of the culture you grow up into, to stand up and say, 'I'm really sorry.' And when you do, people start to realize that it's OK to say things like, 'I should have just said it. I'm sure I'm a bad person and I'm just being sarcastic.'
