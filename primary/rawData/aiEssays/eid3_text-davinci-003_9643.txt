In the short story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, the features of the setting have a significant impact on the protagonist, the cyclist. The setting is described as being hilly and remote, two factors which influence the cyclist’s journey. 

The hilly terrain of the setting makes it difficult for the cyclist. The cyclist must traverse up and down steep inclines, using a great deal of physical exertion to traverse the hills, and the hilly environment forces him to use up more energy than is typical for such a journey, reducing his speed. The cyclist’s experience of fatigue and exhaustion is also accentuated by the steepness of the inclines, as it takes a great deal of effort for him to climb them. The physical challenges of the hilly terrain add difficulty to the cyclist’s journey and create tension for the reader.

The setting is also described as being remote. The cyclist is described as being “out of touch with civilization”, which suggests that he is alone in a desolate location, far from anyone who can help him if he runs into any problems. This isolation makes the cyclist vulnerable as he has no access to assistance in the event of an accident or mechanical issue.
