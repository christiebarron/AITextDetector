I believe that censorship of materials in libraries, which includes free speech, deserves a fair hearing, and should be held to the highest standards," said Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. "While the FBI is conducting its own investigation into all possible matters involving the email and security breaches, I hope Senator Feinstein, who has been known to support anti-censorship legislation, will consider it important that we continue to protect the public's right to express ideas and opinions."

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., released a statement during the hearing about his "strong, progressive and principled stance in promoting free, open, and transparent government." Corker has repeatedly said he is in favor of reforming the U.S. Constitution. He is also seeking to expand the government's role in the free flow of information, since the former President Barack Obama took office and has sought to restore the freedoms of the press. He and Corker had been at odds during the Trump administration, but later made it clear they had differences on issues of principle.

Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said Wednesday his office was not making progress in the debate about censorship in libraries.

"If I had to choose my second line of defense, I would be in favor of restricting free expression (to certain types of speech in libraries), with or without the threat of jail time for a student or convicted offender," Grassley said.
