One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was at home working a little while ago. I don't know if I laughed or not at the time," she said.

The woman said that this was before her husband had surgery for a lung cancer that she says was brought on by the work.

"He went back and watched the same movie with all these people, all the same guys and there was laughter between them."

The worker explained that her husband had had an "epileptic condition", at which point her husband became very ill before his brain tumor had broken.

The woman added: "He told us that once he'd been working all his life, all his colleagues would be dying. He didn't like it. He didn't like it."

According to the court documents, however, the man also admitted having sex with her.

He also admitted having sexually assaulted her over eight years.

The woman said to be recovering well, though, was "swaying back and forth between the two. We were in shock and in shock to what she was going through."

Cameron added: "I'm not sure how long she was with this man, but she has really recovered and she's feeling OK."

There has been no arrest and no further incident of domestic violence is under investigation.

The man is set to appear before Lancashire Police on 27 September 2014.
