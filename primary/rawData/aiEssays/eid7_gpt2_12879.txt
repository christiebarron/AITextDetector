An example of a time someone in my life was patient was in my bedroom on 8-11-19. She couldn't get over all their work, and she was going through a lot of work. I had one great moment where, one day, a friend gave me a bottle of a brand new bottle. I'm working at Starbucks now. And I get a great surprise when she gives me a cup of Starbucks coffee, and I want to be able to look at the bottle to confirm my receipt as she gave it. When my coffee and my receipt go up above her face, I take a big liking to her. If she gets to see you before 7 p.m., I think you're a lot happier than she is. Thank you for the amazing drink, and thank you to my staff.

This is one more thing that will help make us a better community: help those in need have affordable housing for their families.

More than ever after the Affordable Care Act comes into force, we'll be keeping working to ensure those in need have affordable housing. I always hope to see some of these "family aid" packages rolled out on a nationwide basis as soon as possible.

You will also hear more about how we are going to keep our community clean. We need to help people not only clean up after their house, but clean up after their family too.

The Affordable Care Act will help us find affordable housing for the people in it. It
