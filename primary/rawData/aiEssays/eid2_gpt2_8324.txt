I believe that censorship of materials in libraries in many countries has a detrimental impact on public confidence and is especially important when it comes to public policy," said Hsu, a member of the advisory board of the Chinese Democracy Association.

The Association's policy is to remove any information about censorship from public books, but it also has concerns about the influence of a growing number of publishers whose books have come under increased scrutiny in recent years.

A study of 3 million China children from the last five years found that "over two-thirds" read books by children with specific or specific disabilities and that books that were censored affected about 10 percent of the population.

The study found that publishers are willing to "use the power" of libraries to censor the content of books. And many are willing to do so, given how much they care about public funding available to libraries for projects unrelated to public education.

"They have a right to do so, but the fact goes that the most profitable publishers are ones that provide the most important education in the world," said Zhang, the chairwoman of the Association's China Committee on Teaching and Learning at King's College, London.

"As the only country to ban most books, they should be concerned about the impact," she added.

Libraries and nonprofit research groups argue some books don't fit the general public's description, too, including "Children's Books," which aims to educate children about what they can and cannot read
