The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because, even though it deals with a number of serious problems, I think you'll find the book quite worthwhile. There is nothing particularly magical about that one, but it does feel like the kind of book that is often a part of a book that you'd never hope to know something about. It certainly has some of the weirdest characters in the world, but this isn't just my take on a horror novel. It's a story that takes place in California, and this is one of the first things that I love. So, this is one that really speaks for itself.

So which of those other novels you'd like to see reviewed here â€“ I'll try to get those out there as soon as possible! I'll tell you where to find these books in stores from now on, which ones I expect to get an in-coming review when my review is out, and which of those are from your review of Winter Hibiscus. We'll see you there!
