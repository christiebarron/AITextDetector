The memoir "From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives" by Narciso Rodriguez is a journey through the emotional trials and tribulations of growing up in a Spanish-Dominican family. Through his words and vivid descriptions, Rodriguez captures the mood of a place, a home, and a culture. 

Rodriguez's childhood was filled with joy, sadness, illness, and hope. Through his tender recollections, a quiet sense of introspection is conveyed. Despite the poverty and hardships his family faced, there was still a strong sense of warmth and love in their home. Rodriguez paints a vivid picture of the diverse neighborhoods, churches, and stores in his hometown of Hoboken, NJ. The experiences, sounds, smells, and tactile sensations of the place he refers to as home all come alive and remind readers of their own home farthest away.

Perhaps the greatest atmosphere created in the memoir is that of nostalgia. Rodriguez details the unique dynamics of family gatherings and his relationships with both parents, giving readers a glimpse into his inner world. His grandmothers' homes serve as sanctuaries of spiritual refuge, and his vivid descriptions of childhood moments bring a sense of nostalgia. 

As Rodriguez writes, the mood of the memoir is that of gratefulness. His parents sacrificed much to give Rodriguez the life he has today, and he is forever grateful. Both his parents emphasized the importance of education and enriched his life with culture and tradition. From Home: The Blue
