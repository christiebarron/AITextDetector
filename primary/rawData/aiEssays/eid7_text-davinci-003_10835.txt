I recently had the privilege of witnessing an incredible example of patience in action. I was sitting in the waiting room of a busy medical clinic when an elderly man was sitting down near me. He seemed to be in a lot of pain, and I could tell he was getting increasingly frustrated with the long wait times. After a while, a nurse came into the waiting room, and explained to the elderly man that the doctor was running late and would not be able to meet him for a while. 

Instead of getting angry or yelling, the elderly man simply nodded in understanding. He didn't express any frustration or anger at the nurse. He reminded me of a wise old sage, calmly accepting the situation and continuing to wait. Despite his obvious discomfort and pain, he remained patient and positive. It really was a powerful lesson in navigating situations with grace.
