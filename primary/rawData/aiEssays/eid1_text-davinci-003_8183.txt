The Empire State Building was the world’s tallest building when it was completed in 1931. Designed and built by a group of visionary architects and builders, one of its more unique features was the plan to include an airship mooring mast, to allow the giant dirigibles of the day to dock and refuel. However, the builders faced some formidable obstacles in attempting to make this ambition a reality. 

The first major obstacle was the lack of an adequate mooring mast. The type of mast that would be required for the Empire State Building posed a unique set of problems – it would need to be powerful enough to hold a massive airship, but also light enough to fit on top of what was then the world’s tallest building. It was also necessary that the mooring mast not interfere with the building’s silhouette, and thus the engineers devised a unique hydraulic system to raise it from the roofline when not in use.

The second challenge that the builders faced was how to ensure the safety of those inside the building. Even with a hydraulic mast, it was difficult to predict the effects of docking such a large moving object, and special caution had to be taken to make sure the building did not suffer any structural damage. The engineers consulted top naval experts during this process, and eventually a solution was created that minimized any risk of damage.

Lastly, the builders encountered difficulty in finding a private airship company that was willing to
