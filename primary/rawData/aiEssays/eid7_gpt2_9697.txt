An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was diagnosed by my mother that I was bipolar. In that conversation, I was told, 'Do you worry about my bipolar.' So, I was like, 'Yes, I do.' If someone came up to you on an afternoon and said, 'I am bipolar,' I couldn't believe somebody looked up and said, 'Have you ever considered getting the other person to see you this way?' I was like, 'That's insane! I want to live life without seeing my bipolar.' It was like that. And then one day, my mother told me not to worry. She said if you don't care, don't worry about the other person's bipolar, which could go against your family."

Penny Robinson, a psychologist at the University of Minnesota Medical Center who specializes in diagnosing people with psychiatric disorders said that in some people, people who are not bipolar develop manic symptoms in childhood.

She stressed that it can be difficult to remember how many manic episodes and mood swings you have, because that can make that difficult to take.

"That's a thing people with bipolar are, they're anxious, they're afraid, and they can start acting out in a lot of different ways. And when they get there it can very quickly turn into violent behavior," said Robinson, who worked with the state Department of Mental Health in the 1990s to figure out how to treat bipolar disorder in children
