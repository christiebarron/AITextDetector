The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' by Tariq Abu Baaz describes how family, friends, and relatives often speak about suicide, grief, and the need to deal with the situation.

"There must be an objective understanding but not the one based on fear. It could well hurt all of us and the world as a whole," she says.

She continues: "The one thing you lose in time is a belief that you will get back at your parents and your siblings."

The book, titled 'From Home is', features two sisters-in-law and other people from different generations who share a vision of the day they would like to stay together.

Tariq, who was born in Qatar, also writes of being forced to travel between different neighborhoods in Qatar to Analytics, an industry firm, in order to escape her parents to work in that city, and other problems such as poverty and social exclusion and the lack of a roof she and her sister-in-law had.

"I was in Qatar for the first time, I got married in 2010 and became a Muslim, and after eight years at Analytics I was told they said they couldn't support me anymore. I didn't even know what to do," says Tariq.

"I could barely cope, I was so miserable and tired. I felt like someone was going to kill me," she says.
