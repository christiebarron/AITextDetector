Computers have many effects on people. And they change the world as we live. No matter how important they may be to you, there can never be everything!

I have some personal advice. Most of you readers will know the problem, but if any of you are interested in trying something different, then a really good source for that is my online blog, or my podcast, or my e-book, or my book on all things cognitive science. Because it's all about making fun of people and trying to tell yourself "hey, this is a good idea, let me share it with you!"

People who start this blog or podcast have a lot to learn from it, something simple like that. Some people just need a little history, the information from your life, and some of what is known about your brain. The reason they have to do this is that most cognitive scientists believe that there is a strong genetic basis for the ability to process information. When we start to get this in our heads that a certain kind of information is produced, that's when we experience cognitive change. So it's like, if I give this information to a young person with autism, he will learn that his hearing is normal, that he no longer hears in all right tones, but he hears in a different tone. And what was the initial process for him?

And it turned out that this specific process was quite rapid. And that wasn't just the sound of that noise.
