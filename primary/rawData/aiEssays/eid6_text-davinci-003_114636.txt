The construction of the Empire State Building was a feat of engineering and design that enabled many modern development opportunities, particularly with regards to its architectural ambitions. One such ambition was to facilitate the docking of dirigibles or large airships at the top of the building. However, there were several obstacles that needed to be overcome before this goal was realized.

To begin with, several engineering challenges needed to be addressed. These included the wind speeds that an airship would experience while docking, the cable winch system that needed to be constructed and maintained to assist dirigibles in entering the building, and the protective measures that had to be in place to keep the airships from colliding into the building while docking and taking off. Furthermore, the architects had to find a way to reduce the wind pressures at the top of the building to make it possible for the docking process to take place.

For several decades, the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was just a dream. In the late 1930s, however, Marcia Amidon Lüsted wrote a book called “The Mooring Mast” which laid out an effective and safe plan for corporate America to accomplish this task. She suggested that a mooring mast be erected atop the building to provide a stationary target for the airships to aim for during their docking maneuvers. This would need to be reinforced with metal cables and an additional netting system to protect the dirigibles from
