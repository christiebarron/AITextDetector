The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it tells what happens when we go into the woods from a much bigger perspective. Winter Hibiscus focuses on the journey each individual character takes to make a home and a living, and what they do is more important than what they do through this book.

For more about Hibiscus, or for a preview of why there is so much writing on each person, see the book Fulmarion I on that page. And, for a limited time, I will have your call at that time to discuss this one book at the New Books Association.
