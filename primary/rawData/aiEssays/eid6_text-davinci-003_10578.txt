The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the 86th floor. Despite the idea initially being highly praised by the public, the reality ended up being far more difficult and complex than first imagined.

The most immediate obstacle that presented itself was the issue of weight. Airships were much larger and heavier than any other aircraft, weighed down by a combination of helium and other gasses. On top of this, the thought of passenger dirigibles docking meant that the dirigible would be bearing far heavier weights as it carried passengers and cargo. This meant that the building had to be built much sturdier than originally planned, which came with significant additional cost to the builders.

The second obstacle was the fact that the atmosphere on the 86th floor would be much different than what is found in the more standard “ground” atmosphere. This discrepancy could present a lot of problems for the dirigibles as they were designed to fly at and live mostly within the “ground” atmosphere. As such, the air pressure and the temperature of the atmosphere would have to be heavily adjusted to make it suitable for dirigibles. This involved a lot of time to research and the use of further costly technologies.

The third obstacle was the infrastructure itself. Building a station on the 86th floor of the Empire State Building was undoubtedly going to be a difficult task. The sheer size of the dirigibles,
