Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects that computers have had on the lives of people around the world. I believe that computers have had both positive and negative effects.

On the positive side, computers have made our lives easier by providing us with ways to store and share information quickly, and giving us access to a wealth of information that would have otherwise been inaccessible. Computers have also allowed creative people to develop and utilize digital technology to create beautiful works of art.

On the negative side, computers have also been linked to a rise in sedentary activities. In a world where people often sit in front of their computers for hours, physical activity is being reduced, leading to a decline in physical health. Furthermore, computer technology has also provided distractions that can lead to lower levels of productivity.

Overall, computers have had both beneficial and detrimental effects. We should ensure that we practice balance in our computer usage, utilizing the benefits and minimizing the detrimental effects.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
