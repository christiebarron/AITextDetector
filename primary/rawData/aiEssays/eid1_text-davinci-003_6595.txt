To the Editor:

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. As technology advances, computers have become an integral part of our lives, with people using them to stay connected, to work, and to entertain themselves. But I believe that the effects of computers on people should not be overlooked.

I believe that computers have changed peopleâ€™s lives in both positive and negative ways. On the one hand, computers have made it easier to stay connected with friends and family, to work from home, and to access vast amounts of information quickly and easily. At the same time, however, computers can cause stress, distraction, and fatigue. People can become overly dependent on them, and spend too much time on their computers instead of engaging in healthy activities.

It is important to note that the effects of computers on people can be both advantageous and detrimental. It is up to each individual to limit their computer usage to achieve a healthy balance. I urge everyone to consider how much time they are spending on computers, and to seek out other activities that bring a sense of satisfaction and fulfilment.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
