The conclusion of the poem reflects the speaker's acceptance of their inability to make things happen in the way they desire. The speaker recognizes that life and the world often move at its own pace and events do not necessarily occur in the sequence they desire. By ending with the hope that the winter hibiscus will one day be in bloom, the speaker is expressing their acceptance of life and nature's unpredictable and mysterious ways. The poem also serves to remind readers that sometimes in life, things can change and eventually come out better than expected.
