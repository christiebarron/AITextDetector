In Joe Kurmaski’s story “Rough Road Ahead”, the main character is a cyclist who is travelling on a road with many obstacles. The road is full of potholes, and covered with gravel, which makes it very difficult to move quickly. In addition, there are large trucks and cars passing by, creating a large amount of wind that is blowing against the cyclist. 

The road and its features are an important part of the story and have a significant effect on the cyclist. The potholes and gravel create a very dangerous environment for the cyclist. The cyclist has to slow down, be careful, and take longer to maneuver their way past the obstacles. This forces them to expend more energy, making the journey difficult and tiring. 

The passing cars and large trucks further complicate the cyclist’s journey. The wind they create disrupts the cyclist’s balance, making it even harder to move forward. The cyclist must use more strength and concentration to stay upright and be able to reach their destination. 

The hostile features of the road and the elements create an atmosphere of danger for the cyclist. They must work hard to be able to progress on the road, allowing the reader to empathize with the cyclist and understand the difficult situation they are in. This provides a powerful message about perseverance and determination in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds.
