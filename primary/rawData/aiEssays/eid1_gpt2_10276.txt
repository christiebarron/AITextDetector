Computers have many effects on people. First and foremost, people with a poor life sense can become violent, which can lead me to believe that I am, in fact, very violent. And by that, I mean the fact that I use violence by proxy. The things I do, I'm more open to that. I like to feel very comfortable with that. I think people are often aware of the violence that I experience. And so I'm often more afraid of that than I am of anyone else's. And so maybe I should write a book or a book about things like that. But it certainly goes back a bit further.
