The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it is a philosophical tract. The book can be divided into a series of different genres, but in these books are taken into account the principles that make up the principles in every discipline. I recommend both books for those who have not yet decided that they are ready for the world and those who have to wait a little longer to catch up.
