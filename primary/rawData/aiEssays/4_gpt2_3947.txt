The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it takes a great deal of work to get it to finish. I just wanted to make sure I had some kind of finishing touches on the way it went and that it didn't look like a book that went back and forth between them, which I couldn't.

And then I thought "well, now this is going to be kind of an impossible journey, right?" And so it ends up having a very wonderful story as long as it stays consistent.
