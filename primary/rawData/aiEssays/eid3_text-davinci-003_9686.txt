In “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, the cyclist faces some serious challenges posed by the features of the setting. The cyclist must tackle the mountainous terrain with its steep ascents and treacherous rock-filled descents. The constant ups and downs take their toll on the cyclist's energy and concentration, forcing the cyclist to find the strength to keep pushing forward.

The hot and dry conditions add to the difficulty of the journey, as the cyclist has to work harder to combat fatigue on the long climbs. The lack of wind creates a sense of total isolation, heightening the cyclist's awareness of the perils of the road. With the sun beating down and no shade in sight, dehydration is a real threat as the cyclist continues the journey.

The deserted and remote nature of the setting also creates an extra challenge. The cyclist is completely exposed to the hazardous conditions of the terrain and, without any sign of civilisation, the cyclist must rely on their own skills and determination to get to the end.

It is clear that the features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski's “Rough Road Ahead” put the cyclist through an immense physical and psychological test. The climatic conditions, the arduous terrain, and the remoteness all force the cyclist to draw upon their inner strength and resilience to continue on despite the odds.
