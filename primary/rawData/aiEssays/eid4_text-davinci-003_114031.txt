The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho is used to provide a hopeful resolution. By ending the story with the line, "When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again," the protagonist finds closure and a sense of comfort. The line symbolizes a cycle where no matter how bad a situation gets, there is always an opportunity to begin again. The spring, with its new growth and second chances, serves as a reminder that the protagonist has the strength and courage to face her future.
