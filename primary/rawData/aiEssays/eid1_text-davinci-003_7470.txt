The ending of this story symbolically answers the protagonist's biggest question: will she be able to overcome the adversity of her new and alien environment and pass the tests in the "new tongue" (English)? The protagonist's answer is that she will take the test again in the future, when a noticeable change in the season has taken place to represent her own transformation. The hibiscus being budded is a metaphor for the protagonist's own eventual growth and blooming. The ending of the story is a hopeful one: that one day, the protagonist will pass the test and bloom in the new environment, just like the winter hibiscus will bloom in the spring.
