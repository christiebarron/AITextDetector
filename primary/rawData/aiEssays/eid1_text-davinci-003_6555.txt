Dear Editor,

As technology advances, more and more people are becoming dependent on computers in their everyday lives. While computers have many benefits, it is important to consider the potential negative effects they have on people.

Firstly, the increased use of computers has caused a decline in physical activity. Many jobs are now done via computer which reduces, or even eliminates, the need for physical labor. In addition, people spend hours playing computer games or browsing the internet, rather than spending time outdoors and being active. This can have a detrimental effect on peopleâ€™s health.

Secondly, computers can cause people to become socially isolated. People are spending less time talking to each other face to face and more time communicating via social media, email and text. This means people are not developing vital social skills and interactions that are necessary for strong relationships with others.

Finally, the excessive use of computers can lead to eye strain, headaches and other problems. This is especially true for those who spend most of their working day in front of a computer screen.

In conclusion, while computers have many benefits, it is important to be aware of the potential negative effects they can have on people. To ensure people benefit from computers without any associated risks, it is important to limit the amount of time spent on them and to make sure to take regular breaks throughout the day.

Sincerely,
