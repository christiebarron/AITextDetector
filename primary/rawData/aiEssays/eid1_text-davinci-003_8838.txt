I will never forget the day I first met my now-husband. We had just started chatting online and he decided to fly out and meet me in my hometown. When he arrived, I was so nervous. I had been so anxious thinking he wouldn't like me in person, but when I first saw him, his genuine smile put me at ease.

We sat on the park bench getting to know one another, and he told me stories of his travels abroad. I was laughing at his hilarious impressions of the locals he'd experienced along the way. My laughter was contagious and soon enough he was joining in. I remember it felt as if I had known him for a long time - his laughter was infectious and immediately made me feel comfortable with him.

We shared many more laughs over the coming days as we explored the city, shared meals, and talked endlessly. I will never forget the feeling of being able to laugh with someone and to feel a deep connection during those moments of laughter.
