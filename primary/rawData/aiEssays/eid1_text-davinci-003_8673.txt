The other day, I was at the grocery store with my husband of 30 years. We had a couple of dried goods in our cart and were getting ready to check out when a girl of no more than 5 years old started walking down the aisle, wiggling her hips in the air and singing the song to herself. It was quite adorable, I have to admit.

My husband caught my eye and said with a smirk on his face, "Looks like she's trying to compete with Shakira." All of sudden, laughter started bubbling up in my throat and I couldn't help but laugh. He caught it and soon started laughing too. We were both in tears from the belly laughs that were erupting from our mouths.

It felt so good to be laughing with my husband like that and to feel so connected and lighthearted. In that moment, nothing else mattered. We had shared a wonderful moment of laughter that will stay with us for a long time.
