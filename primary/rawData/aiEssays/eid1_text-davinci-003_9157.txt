Dear Editor,

The increasing presence of computers in our day to day lives has had a dramatic effect on us. Those of us who have grown up with computers and the internet surrounding us since childhood carry a drastically different set of skills from our predecessors. We are more adept at navigating digital technologies and harnessing them to our advantage.

However, increasingly, people are being exposed to the ill-effects of computer overuse as well. Spending large amounts of time on the internet in the form of social networks, gaming sites, and online streaming, can lead to digital addiction and it’s bestial effects, such as hindrance in academic and professional progress, socializing problems, and insomnia.

The consequences of computer addiction is very real and should not be taken lightly. It does not only affect individuals, but families and societies in general. People must be educated on the need to practice routine digital detox, reducing their computer usage to manageable limits and ensuring that the means of technology are used for productive means. We should also ensure that our friends and family are made aware of the risk of addiction and help them if they are going through difficult times.

At present, strategies to reduce and manage computer addiction are being developed, such as setting strict limits on computer usage,s, and parents ensuring that children don’t engage in computer activities past their bedtimes. It is our responsibility to use digital technologies for our benefit and not as a substitute for human interaction
