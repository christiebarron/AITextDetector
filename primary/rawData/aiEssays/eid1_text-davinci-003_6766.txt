To the Editor:

As a resident of this local community, I feel strongly about the effects of computers on people and I hope to persuade the readers of this paper to share in my opinion. 

In today's world, computers enable people to communicate and access information around the world. They have become an integral part of our lives and are used for everyday tasks such as shopping, banking, and working. They provide an immense amount of convenience by allowing us to do things much quicker and more efficiently than ever before. 

However, while computers do offer a vast number of benefits, it is important to recognize the potential negative effects they can have on people as well. For example, increased time spent on computers can lead to physical health problems like neck and back pain, increased stress, and mental health problems such as insomnia and depression. It is also very easy for people, especially children and teenagers, to become addicted to computer games and other online activities. 

It is clear that, while computers are incredibly helpful, they must be used in moderation. By limiting the amount of time spent on computers, we can enjoy all the benefits they have to offer while minimizing the harm they can cause to our physical and mental health.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I hope the readers of this paper will agree with my thoughts and understand the importance of using computers with caution. 

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
