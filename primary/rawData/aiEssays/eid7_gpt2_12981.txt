An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was playing against this man after his wife hit a child for a second. He just let me stay away and I could have been a better player. He just wanted to leave and I started looking at him and his reaction was kind of sickening and I just walked back up to him. He was just absolutely loving me and I'm thankful we got the last game!"

In an interview with the Sun Online last week, Smith said: "From my point of view, I was always at home with my girlfriend, her daughter, and then went off to school to just spend my time with my children.

"People have said that I didn't do good things on my own. I was only too happy to play and play with kids. But I was a very good player and this was the first time that my family ever showed up to watch me play hockey.

"And the last time they showed up was this summer. They got some very good publicity and this was a real deal.

"Well I'm going to get it over with and hope for the best."
