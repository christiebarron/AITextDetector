The setting of "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski has a strong impact on the cyclist, as the physical landscape of the environment influences every move he makes. At the beginning of the story, the narrator notes that the road is "unpaved, the kind that can turn into mud when it rains." This presents both a challenge and a danger to the cyclist, as the uneven terrain creates a much rougher ride than if he were on a smoother, paved road. This makes it more difficult to maintain balance and control, and he is forced to use more energy as he navigates the course.

Moreover, the desolate environment of the countryside affects the cyclistâ€™s emotional state. He is aware that the road is "not the safest place to be," and this strengthens his sense of vulnerability and caution. This impacts his perception of the terrain, making any unexpected dips, bumps, or potholes more threatening than they would be in a more populated area.

The cyclist's experience of the environment is further shaped by the time of day. As he cycles down the "endless" road, the sun gradually begins to set, and the descending darkness increases his sense of solitude and isolation. As he continues, the road starts to become a much less tangible entity, fading into the night. His vision of the landscape is reduced to that of an ethereal presence, and this is reflected in his experience of the environment.
