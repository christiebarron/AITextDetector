The construction of the Empire State Building presented numerous challenges to the builders, not least of which was finding a place to dock dirigibles. The idea of an airship anchoring on the skyscraper first arose in 1925 when Clarence Chambers launched a dirigible company in the city. The inaugural airship, named the Pilgrim, came to the Empire State building with the intention of mooring at the mast atop the building.

The innovative idea of hosting airships on skyscrapers was a daring and daringly impractical venture. Many observers were skeptical of the ability of the mooring mast to hold the massive airships in the high winds of the city. Engineers soon found it to be a difficult task to build a mast capable of withstanding the strong gusts of wind and the weight of the airships. Adding to the difficulty of the undertaking was the 1931 6.2 magnitude earthquake that severely damaged the mast. Despite these obstacles, the team worked ardently to build a stronger mooring mast that could withstand the combination of wind and weight.

The combination of ever-changing wind currents and deceptively strong gusts once again presented a major obstacle to the engineers of the Empire State Building. New calculations had to be drawn to determine the precise weight and height of the mast necessary to hold larger airships. After a lengthy period of trial and error, the engineers eventually settled on an allocated wind speed of seventy miles per hour for the length of the moor
