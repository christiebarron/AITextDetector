The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' shows us that "my mother, who was a good English mother - she never got up at morning hour to read a book". Now she spends the night in a quiet basement, in the living room with Mrs Thatcher, who has a few of her own children, and who has put out her home-made dinner plates at all times for us to eat. Her books have made her an expert at what we read, when we say things, when we say things like 'what a wonderful book!'


The writer has had a long career in the field of art. His most recent novel, 'The Ladykillers', about a Scottish artist and her son, tells the story of her life and career as the writer of some of the most famous works of the eighteenth century. In that book, it can be said that her books were the first-class books ever made by a woman.
