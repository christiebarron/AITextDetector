An example of a time someone in my life was patient was with another patient. He was dying, and he never saw him again – or didn't even know that he died. I was very happy when he would be able to see me again and tell me about his life. We could communicate with like-minded people of Creation. It was very special.

"It's important to remember that in these difficult times, we live in constant opposition. We can't be complacent. We can still be concerned, even when things are bleak. But in these extreme times, there are many reasons to be optimistic about the future but also because we must work on the future, even if it is as bleak as it could be. It's not that our hearts were broken, but it's that that optimism has become an outgroup. It should not be tolerated. We know the suffering is growing because so many people know and love us, but that belief has no place in us or in a society that values such things as our life."
