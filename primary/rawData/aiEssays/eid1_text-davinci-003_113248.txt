To the Editor, 

In recent years, computers have had a large impact on our lives. From entertainment to communication to financial transactions, computers are becoming increasingly ubiquitous. Despite the many benefits computers have to offer, their potential harms must be considered in order to ensure that people remain safe and healthy when using them. 

The very nature of computers enables people to be more productive. However, they can have a detrimental effect on physical and mental health. Spending hours in front of a computer screen can lead to bad posture, aching eyes, and fatigue. Constant exposure to blue light from screens can disrupt sleep cycles, causing insomnia and other sleep disorders. On the mental side, obsessive use of computers can lead to depression and anxiety. Furthermore, addiction can be a major problem for some individuals, distracting them from important personal and work responsibilities. 

Therefore, it is important to recognize the risks associated with computers, and take action to address them. On the physical side, it is important to take regular breaks from using computers. On the mental side, individuals should be aware of the potential risks and feelings which can be associated with over-use of computers. 

By being more aware of these potential issues, we can ensure that our computers continue to be a valuable part of our lives, without causing too many problems. 

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
