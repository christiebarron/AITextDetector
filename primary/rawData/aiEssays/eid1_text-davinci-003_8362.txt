I remember one time when I was waiting in line at the grocery store and the person in front of me had a lot of items. It was taking awhile and some of the items needed to be weighed and checked. I was getting a bit impatient, but then I remembered to be patient. I reminded myself to be understanding and tolerant. I kept my cool and waited until they finished checking out. The clerk was also being understanding and tolerant and was helping the customer. It wasn't a quick process, but in the end the customer was thankful and I was proud of myself for being patient.
