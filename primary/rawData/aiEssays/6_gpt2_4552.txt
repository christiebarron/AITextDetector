The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, a recent public outcry over a planned ban on using electric vehicles against state employees may have pushed the idea to the forefront.

The National Association of Manufacturers recently issued an expert declaration on dirigibles and its use. This decision, a reaction to the Federal Aviation Administration's guidance, called into question the ability of the company to regulate the materials. "The current guidance by the FAA on dirigical devices, and subsequent decisions on which vehicles and vehicles to use to carry such devices, may lead to additional regulation of the construction industry and lead to an increased and increased risk of accidents and fatalities," the statement explained.

The proposed rule is to limit cars being carried in a hangar and the use of electric vehicles. It also bans large trucks from allowing them inside. It also says that dirigibles do not actually need a pilot license even if they're supposed to.

"If I had a big tractor and couldn't use it, that would be allowed even though he could have a driver's license," says Bruce Miller, a local car rental company contractor and former executive VP of public affairs for AT&T Mobile.

In November, AT&T said it would implement a pilot program for dirigibles only if its pilot program allows for using them in airports, which would make them more of a nuisance to airport workers and passengers than the traditional trucks, trailers,
