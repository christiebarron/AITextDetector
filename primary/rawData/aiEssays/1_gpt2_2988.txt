Computers have many effects on people. Some people thinkChallenge is a great idea and should be tried and done. But more than that, Challenge is a self-destruct tool. That's how it works, if you have no friends and some people get angry and some people can't handle it. What you'll see here - which I'm quite good at - is that people with challenges have been able to work with themselves in situations that they were already going through. That helped to get the message out about why we need social challenge in this new world we live in at all. Challenge is for people who want to use their strength and ability, but they've come a long way. They've overcome things, or suffered, which can sometimes backfire at times. There's something about Challenge that gives us hope when it's brought something out of our darkness. In contrast to my early attempts to do any of the others, Challenge is not about the numbers, it's about the journey. It's the way you approach things. You work with other people and get together and talk. It's a lot of mental and spirit work, really."

"The way that Challenge went was really incredible to us. The way that we approached it and the way we got involved with it was incredibly special. But then we were faced with a very difficult task - we had to leave.
