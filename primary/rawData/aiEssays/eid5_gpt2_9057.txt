The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' by British comedian David Letterman was an inspiration too big to be overcome, leaving the writing room paralyzed and feeling as if everything was going backwards.

Now that the book has become The Baskerville Story The People Will Take You Home, which will be published Thursday, we are thrilled to have been the first to share it with you.

We thought we'd share with you what made it all such a fun experience being part of this great story of being turned together as a friend and as both of you.

David Letterman and The Baskerville Story

What made it all so special to have this opportunity?

David Letterman. One of the most important moments of my life. As a comedian, I'm always fascinated by social issues. In 2001, I first met an actor named Ben Shapiro, who was playing a real estate agent who had just completed a three month stay in Europe. I thought, "This guy's all this great, he could just change anything that happened in his careerâ€¦" And I thought, "Oh boy!" I was so inspired that I wrote about it.

Then it became clear that people in this world and in the social media world were actually obsessed with Shapiro. I didn't want to make him a movie star. I wanted to make him a successful guy. And it took a lot of time and effort, but everything made more sense to me.
