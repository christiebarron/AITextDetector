I was in line at the grocery store one day waiting to check out and there was a person in front of me with a huge order. I watched her take out eaches of several items, from jars of pickles, to nuts to small bags of candies. She spent at least 15 minutes trying to get everything scanned, sorted and bagged up.

The line behind her was growing and people started to get restless but I just stayed put and waited patiently. I was in no rush and it seemed my turn would come when it came so I made a point of not getting antsy.

When the cashier was done ringing up the woman's order, she handed her a long list of coupons but the cashier said she couldn't accept all of them and the woman had to look through and decide which ones she wanted to use. I could tell the woman was getting frustrated but she was still patient, kind and courteous to the cashier.

By the time she left, the line had gone down significantly and it was finally my turn. I learned from that experience that doing the right thing and being patient is always the best way to go.
