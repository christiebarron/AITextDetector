Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. In short the 'Rough Road Ahead' setting affects the cyclist. It affects the cyclist in a different way than just walking across the road, driving a car. It causes the cyclist to stop at some point in the road. If the cycle is longer for someone, then the cyclist will do something. If they do it it has to be for recreation purposes. If they don't stop, then there is no reason to stop.

'Rough Road Ahead' is the 'official' setting for the road. This is the only setting ever chosen. It is the only setting where the cyclist is allowed to stop within a certain radius of the road. If this is chosen it means the cyclist will go past other cyclists and will have the right to stop and walk to the other end of the road.

Rough Road Ahead means that cyclists will be able to go past other people in the opposite direction of the cyclist. This has been described as a 'friction-reinforcement''safe zone' in cyclist laws.

Consequences and benefits

The most important issue we have in our society right now, is the environment. We have been driving cars very close to each other, making roads even less safe but keeping roads safe for the thousands of motorists who depend on them. So it takes more to create the safest road on the roads of these cities.
