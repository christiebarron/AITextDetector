Narciso Rodriguez’s memoir From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives invites readers to take a unique and intimate look into his journey in the world of fashion. Although the memoir details his struggles and successes, the author captures a feeling of warmth, gratitude and reflection throughout.

The themes of family, faith and home are woven throughout, conveying a feeling of nostalgia and appreciation for where his story began. Despite accomplishments and connections he’s made throughout his career, the memories and ties Rodriguez has to his family, hometown and culture are furthest from his heart.

Rodriguez paints an incredibly bright and vivid portrait of his childhood in Jersey City, rich with references to his Latino background, and the comfort it provided him in the moments of difficulty. From describing the self-confidence passed down from his mother and the awe-filled admiration he held for his grandmother to the “cacophony of click-clack of low latino heels and conversational snatches in Spanish” that filled the street, he brought the reader along with him during his return visits. It was experiences like these that left him constantly amazed and reassured by the resilience, awe and beauty of his origins and community regardless of the struggles he encountered.

Whilst the memoir contains moments of heartache and uncertainly as his career had its setbacks, Rodriguez’s resilience and positivity shines through. His story allows us to tap into a feeling of hopefulness
