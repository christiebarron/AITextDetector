The builders of the Empire State Building faced a unique challenge in trying to accommodate dirigibles in the construction process. The ideas and physics behind allowing dirigibles to dock posed significant obstacles. 

The most pressing issue when it came to designing a mooring mast was structural integrity. To ensure the mast could safely dock the dirigible, the building needed to be strong enough to handle the weight of the dirigible and the pull of the wind generated by its passage. The designers had to ensure the mast was built from materials durable enough to withstand the weight of the aircraft and keep it safe while it was being moored. Additionally, the mast needed to be tall enough to accommodate the airships, and the structure needed to have the ability to flex and sway in a controlled manner so that it would not break if a large gust of wind shook the airship. 

Due to the extreme speed of the dirigible and its immense size, the challenge of securely and safely accommodating it was significant. This made the idea of a mooring mast something that had to be carefully crafted to the exact specifications of the airship it was intended to allow to dock. To accommodate the safe docking of dirigibles, the mast had to be equipped with a braking system for the those times when the wind was too strong to allow normal mooring.

The location of the mooring mast was also a vital piece of design since it had to be built high enough
