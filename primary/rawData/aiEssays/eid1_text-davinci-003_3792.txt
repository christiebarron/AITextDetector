Dear Editor:

As a concerned member of the community, I am writing to share my opinion on the effects computers have had on people's lives.

It is no secret that computers play an increasingly prominent role in our everyday lives. They are used to perform a multitude of tasks, from keeping us connected to family and friends to providing us with entertainment. But I believe that there are certain perils that come with our reliance on computers, and that these perils should not be overlooked.

First of all, too much time spent on the computer can lead to problems like physical inactivity. People, particularly children, can become so absorbed in their computer activities that they begin to neglect proper physical activity. This not only affects physical health, but mental health as well.

In addition, the sedentariness of the computer-using lifestyle can lead to a decrease in creativity. Without utilizing different forms of thinking and problem solving, people can become too reliant on the inflexible structure of computers, leading to one-dimensional thinking.

Finally, the surge in computer usage can have serious impacts on social relationships. People may become so focused on their online presence that they neglect to make meaningful connections with people in their everyday lives.

We must recognize the potential risks associated with computers. By doing so, we can make sure that technology enhances our lives, not weakens them.

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
