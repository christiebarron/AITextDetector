In Joe Kurmaski's poem, "Rough Road Ahead," the features of the setting play a crucial role in deepening the sense of difficulty and challenge that the cyclist is facing.

The poem begins with the words, "I see the sun setting," which evokes an image of nightfall, the hour when travelling on roads can be even more treacherous. Already, the scene has been made a little harder for the cyclist. This challenge is further heightened by what comes next, as the cyclist notices that the road ahead is "ill-lit, winding," with no markers or signs of any sort. A lack of visibility and security in the road ahead is a sure sign of trouble for any cyclist.

These challenging conditions in the setting are further compounded by weather. As the cyclist embarks on the journey, intense wind gusts come, blowing away dust and dirt from the path. These wind gusts make the road even less welcoming, pushing the cyclist away from the journey. The combination of low visibility in the dark and the strong winds make the cyclist feel small and insignificant against the daunting odds of the journey.

The physical setting of the poem thus has a huge effect on the cyclist. The darkness and strong winds represent the various forms of difficulty and troubles that the cyclist will face. It is a metaphor for the troubles and obstacles that one must face in life. The poem, in a way, offers encouragement to stay strong in the face of such difficulties.
