Censorship in libraries is an important and widely debated issue. Libraries are sources of education and repositories for knowledge, yet many libraries choose to remove certain materials based on their content. Some believe that books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed if they contain elements that may be found offensive. However, I believe that libraries should not remove materials of any kind on the basis of their content. 

Perhaps the best argument against censorship is the simple right to information. Libraries exist in part to provide information and ideas to those who ask for them. To censor materials on the basis of their content implies that certain information is not suitable for public consumption. This is not only backwards, but an unacceptable stance in a free and open society. Open access to materials of all kinds is an essential part of a true education.

Furthermore, censorship in libraries stems from a misunderstanding of what libraries stand for. Good libraries provide access to all kinds of information, not just information which is deemed ‘acceptable’. By censoring what they offer, libraries fail to fulfill their function in serving all members of the public. In the end, those who are able to decide what is ‘appropriate’ or ‘unacceptable’ hold a great deal of power and influence.

Another argument against censorship is the fact that it often reflects a clear bias. Books, music, movies, and magazines are all forms of expression with many nuances. What may appear on the surface
