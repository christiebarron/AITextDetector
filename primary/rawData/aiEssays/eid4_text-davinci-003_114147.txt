The author ends the story with this phrase to emphasize the main idea of the poem, which is that the main character's parents are both going away for a while. The hibiscus serves as a symbol of hope, of the future, and of a possible reunion. By ending the poem with the main character's thoughts of achieving a specific goal (i.e. passing a test) when they come back, the author is emphasizing the idea that there can be joy in the future when this separation is over. Additionally, the imagery of snow melting and geese returning highlights the idea of a new beginning and a chance to focus on the future.
