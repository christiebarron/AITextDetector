The issue of censorship in libraries has been a topic of debate for years. On one side of the argument are those who believe that libraries should not censor materials based on their content and should instead serve as an unbiased resource for all. On the other side are those who argue that certain materials - books, music, movies, and magazines - should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. 

It is understandable that censoring materials in libraries may attempt to protect innocent individuals from offensive language and ideas that could be damaging to their mental wellbeing. However, I believe that censorship of library materials should not be allowed due to a few main reasons.

For starters, libraries should serve as sources of information that are freely available to everyone without restriction. If certain materials were to be banned or removed from shelves, the right to access information would be impaired. Additionally, it could lead to further differentiation and create an environment in which certain individuals are not allowed to search for knowledge or express themselves. 

Secondly, censorship in libraries does not suit one rigid standard of morality. It is impossible to draft a set of rules that everyone agrees upon and moral attitudes about what is offensive to people can vary greatly from one person to the next.
