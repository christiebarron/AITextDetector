Computers have many effects on people. They've changed their attitudes and behaviors, and are used to seeing things differently. They're more likely to accept what they perceive as their bias."

When it comes to race, there isn't a clear way to measure how many people are racist, "but it's very hard to measure because there is no standardized test to compare race or ethnic groups," he says. "And there's no correlation between the levels of cognitive ability and the level of racism."

What is even more interesting, says Dr. Ayer, is that there were two specific groups that were studied - the more educated whites of the south and the blacks of the north, who had different levels of cognitive ability. Some of these groups weren't analyzed - some of them don't have standardized data, so we didn't see them. Dr. Ayer also notes that there are many other effects. But his team found that racial attitudes are more correlated for people with higher educational skills - for example, those who have a higher degree of racial or cultural competency.

"Some more recent studies have found that being more racially diverse is correlated with having higher economic success," Dr. Ayer says, "so the idea is... that blacks have more economic and educational success. That may be true, but the real thing is that the racial and ethnic segregation of the United States still isn't as strong as we first suggested."
