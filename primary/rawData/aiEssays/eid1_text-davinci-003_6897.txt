Censorship has long been a contentious issue in libraries, with those on either side of the argument putting forth strong points of view. Although it is important to consider the viewpoint of those who wish to censor material they deem “offensive”, it is critical to remember the role of libraries in preserving the free exchange of ideas and promoting civil discourse. Quantity of material is not the only factor to take into account – quality is equally important.

Government censorship in libraries could have a severe impact on the right of access to information. Books, magazines, movies, and other materials that contain controversial ideas and sensitive topics should not be removed from library shelves simply because some may find them offensive. Libraries should be accessible to everyone—young and old, and regardless of background, beliefs or beliefs.

Aside from the issue of free speech, censorship could have a greater impact on the academic success of students. In addition to the obvious academic benefits, studies demonstrate that limited censorship in libraries can help improve the imagination, encourage critical thinking, and foster connections among students. By removing books that contain controversial or sensitive topics, libraries risk denying children and teens the resources they need to gain important insight into the world around them. 

When properly enacted, library censorship policies can still give patrons access to a wide variety of materials without causing an undue burden or chilling effect. Materials can still be marked with strong content warnings when necessary, and resources should be available to facilitate thoughtful discussions of relevant topics.
