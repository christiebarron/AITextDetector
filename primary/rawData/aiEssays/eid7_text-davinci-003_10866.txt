I was recently at the grocery store when an elderly woman in front of me was trying to check out. She had difficulty understanding the cashier when the cashier was attempting to explain that she wasn't scanning one of her items correctly. The cashier was trying her best to be patient, but I could see her frustration growing. 

I stepped in and offered to help the woman. She thanked me and I gently explained to her how the scanner worked. She was so grateful for my help and after a few moments, she was able to complete her purchase.

I admired the cashier's patience in this situation and the kindness that I was able to show the woman. I strive to embody patience in all of my actions and it's nice to know when I've made a difference.
