The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it brings the reader into the cold world of the novel. I found the ending a little too long in too many ways and it's still very much a piece of work. The main thing about this book to me is that it's all well written – it's really short – but when read at its best from Amplify's point of view it gives a sense of a really big and important story.

It's an adaptation of the famous book of Shakespeare which actually ran for 10 years in England in the early 90s. It's about a man and wife. You want to have relationships and get married, that's the kind of novel you want – a really large one. It's also a story about being a good father, but a bad father, and then having a family. So if we really want to see that happening and understand that in the world it's quite clear, it's going to be hard to say goodbye to. I'm excited and I'm really trying to play it now.
