I remember the first time I heard my future wife's laugh. I was a student at the University and I was walking through the student union when I heard this beautiful laughter coming from a nearby table. I stopped dead in my tracks and stared in awe for I had never heard this melodious sound before. I instantly knew that it was coming from the most beautiful girl I had ever seen and I knew that I was in trouble. 

I was too shy to approach her so I pretended to be looking for someone and kept walking. As luck would have it, I was able to hear her laugh a few more times over the next few weeks as we passed each other oncampus occasionally. I finally got the courage to approach her and ask her out. After a few dates, I quickly realized that her laugh was the most magical thing in the world.

We ended up getting married a few years later and her laughter still makes my heart sing to this day. Whenever we have a disagreement, a joke, or just some silly banter, I know that there is still something special about us because of her laughter. Even when I'm feeling down, the warmth and joy that her laughter brings to my soul lifts my spirits. I'm truly blessed to share a life with someone whose laughter brings me so much joy.
