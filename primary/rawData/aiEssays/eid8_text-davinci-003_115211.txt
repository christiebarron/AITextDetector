I was in high school, and it seemed like everybody had a good friend except me. I felt so left out, and it was hard not to get discouraged. I decided to take a chance and asked the cutest girl in school to hang out. She said yes, and I couldn't believe it!

We ended up being great friends, but we still didn't have many things in common. We would usually just sit in her room and talk about school and other random things. On one particular day we were talking about something, and I just started to laugh. I couldn't help myself. And then she started to laugh too.

We laughed for what felt like hours! We were both in hysterics, barely able to talk. Whenever one of us tried to compose ourselves, the other would start laughing again. Eventually, we calmed down and went back to our conversation, but it didn't feel so awkward anymore.

That experience became a defining moment in our friendship. We realized that laughter could be the superpower that brought us together. Whenever either of us was feeling down or frustrated, we just had to look at each other and laugh. Laughter has been the bridge that allows us to stay close all these years.
