The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Before he was born, Dr. Henry Hatton, an assistant professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Virginia, argued at the time that a machine would have difficulty in maintaining a standard for lifting in the face of gravity. He suggested building two of these large, curved machines to carry three tonnes of materials—mixed material, steel, and cement—as well as an interloper, for handling a single pound of heavy load.

He suggested that perhaps a laser could be placed on the top of these machines and an inflatable dummy to carry the laser's payloads. One idea was that an optical tube, for use in a vacuum tube, would have an escape mechanism which would make them impassable and could be quickly transported to an orbiting lab from Earth. (The idea would have also made life as an astronaut look cheap.)

In reality, an optical tube designed specifically for these purposes fell into the dark side. On July 19, 1955, Dr. Hatton published the first proof of his theory of laser travel. It is in a pamphlet entitled "The New Laser Theory Found" that the idea is put to practical use.

During the next month of 1955, a small team of researchers from the University of Virginia at Charlottesville and the Naval Air Station at Hawaii conducted the first test of the laser. They set sail in June, the year before the first commercial flight
