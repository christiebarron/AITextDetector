Censorship in libraries has, in recent years, become a serious topic of debate. Should books, music, movies, and magazines be removed from library shelves if they are deemed offensive? I strongly believe materials should not be censored.

It is the duty of librarians to provide patrons with access to a wide range of resources. An open and uncensored library collection allows people to broaden their views, research topics, and gain the knowledge needed to make informed and educated decisions. It also promotes intellectual freedom and encourages the exchange of ideas.

Free access to materials can also be beneficial for those who may find themselves in the minority. Opinions that are not commonly represented in society are important. Libraries should not be allowed to restrict access to materials that some members of society may find objectionable. Those who do not wish to access a certain material can easily ignore it.

Another important point to consider is that libraries often contain a variety of materials â€“ some of which may be offensive to a certain group. The library should not attempt to censor any material. Such actions can be seen as discrimination and can create a hostile environment. 

At the same time, libraries should make appropriate resources available to protect people from extreme content. This could include providing age-appropriate books, CDs, and DVDs. Parents, teachers, and librarians should draw the line when it comes to materials with explicit content, but it is not up to them to lock away any material
