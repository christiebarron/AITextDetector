Dear Editor, 

I am writing to share my opinion on the effects computers have had on the people of our community. Computers have allowed us to enter a new age where information is readily available and work can be done at a much faster rate without sacrificing quality. This technology has created a plethora of opportunities for us, and it can be argued that it has greatly improved many aspects of our life.

Modern computers have allowed us to streamline communication, productivity, and overall organization. For numerous individuals, tasks can be accomplished online, making it easier to keep track of documents, share data quickly, and get our jobs done faster. Additionally, computers provide us with access to unlimited knowledge from around the globe. It is now possible to find information or communicate with people on any subject from anywhere in the world with the click of a button.

At the same time, computers can become a major distraction. Many people are finding that they are spending too much time online browsing social media, playing video games, and more. The time spent on our digital devices can easily become excessive and this time could have otherwise been used for studying, working on projects, or engaging in physical activities.

I firmly believe that computers have provided us with many benefits but that they should be used in moderation. The internet and digital tools have enabled us to work more efficiently and gain knowledge quickly, however we should make sure to give ourselves a break every once in a while and spend our time
