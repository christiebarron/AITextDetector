The Empire State Building was an extraordinary engineering feat that ushered in a new era for skyscraper architecture. The building was equipped with a state-of-the-art system for mooring airships, or dirigibles, making it possible for them to dock right at the building’s crown. However, the idea of accommodating airships created a number of unique obstacles that the engineering teams had to overcome.

The first step was making sure the airships had a safe and stable landing area. To do this, the Empire State Building was equipped with a sixty-five foot steel mast that extended seventy-five feet above the roof. This mast was surrounded by a large flagpole, four large stainless steel cables, and four steel ladders. The mast was connected to a set of anchors that allowed it to stably and securely hold the dirigibles in place.

Next, the team had to come up with a way to sync the airships’ movements with the building’s movements. This meant anticipating the airship’s speed and allowing it to make corrections to its course so that it would arrive at the building and brake in time. To solve this problem, the team created an arresting mechanism that worked in tandem with an automatic “Tug-o-Meter.” This device monitored the airship’s speed and notified the team when it was time to arrest its motion, so that the dirigible would
