I was out for dinner with my partner on a Monday night, which wasn't our usual thing. We weren't usually the couple that went out during the week but we had both been feeling a bit down lately and thought a change of scenery would do us some good.

After we'd ordered our food, the conversation was a little stilted, neither of us knowing just what to say. After a few moments of silence I heard it: a loud snort from my partner. I looked over at them and saw them stifling a giggle, obviously trying to ignore the sound they had made.

At that moment, something clicked inside of me and I started to laugh. We both started to giggle and I looked around the restaurant to make sure no one was looking at us. We quickly composed our features, doing our best not to let our laughter get out of hand.

But before long it was too late. My partner's snort had opened the floodgates and we were soon incapable of doing anything but laughing hysterically. Everyone in the entire restaurant was looking in our direction and I remember thinking to myself, 'Why not? It's Monday!'

In that moment, all of the stress melted away. Although the dinner was just a small one, the laughter we shared filled the void well beyond that evening. It was those moments of unbridled joy that brought us both closer together.
