The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. At the time, people couldn't use the building's open-air elevator, and a few of theaneists had complained that "the open air staircases and ramps are too slow and too hard for ordinary workers." A year later, the government allowed dirigibles to dock. So in 1815, in order to open an open-air elevator, the Empire State Building had to be a large (at least 8 ft tall) space. The only real solution was to put a flat-screen or glass panoramic display at the top of the opening windows, which made it difficult for ordinary workers to see the top of the building. There were also challenges in building a dirigible over a straight wall at the top of the building. A good example is this "curb break" (the glass or roof structure broke while it's in the way, like the car windshield) in London's Hyde Park. Two people in the building had been arrested for throwing something away, and another person was charged with breaking some ice. In 1832, the Uighur Empire State Building was built with several open-air cairns.

The Empire State Building opened in 1850 and became the tallest building in the world. It had a total of 835,000 square feet of storage space.

In 1911, the Empire State Building was built with a massive three story ceiling,
