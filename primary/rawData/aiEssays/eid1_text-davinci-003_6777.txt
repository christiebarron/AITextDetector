Dear [Newspaper Editor], 

I am writing to express my opinion about the effects computers have on people. Computers are integral parts of our lives, as they provide an efficient way for us to communicate, work, and keep up with current events. However, there are more subtle effects of computer usage that are often overlooked. 

First, overusing computers can lead to physical health problems such as carpal tunnel syndrome, eyestrain, and a poor posture. As such, it is important to practice healthy habits when using computers, such as taking frequent breaks, using an ergonomic chair, and adjusting the lighting situation regularly.

On the mental health side of things, computers can cause issues such as mental fatigue, anxiety, and even depression. This is because computers often limit communication with others, as conversations happen from behind a screen. To combat this, it is important to have meaningful conversations with family and friends, as well as activities that take you away from the computer.

All in all, computers are an invaluable tool in our everyday lives. However, it is essential to pay attention to the effects they have on us, both physical and mental. By taking steps to minimize potential negative side-effects and engaging in activities away from the computer, we can make the most of the conveniences they provide. 

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
