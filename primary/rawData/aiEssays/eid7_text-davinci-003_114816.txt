I was recently at the grocery store, waiting in line to check out. I had been waiting for about 20 minutes, and had noticed the cashier had been helping a woman for quite some time. The woman was having difficulties understanding how to use the store's loyalty program and was struggling to figure out how to get a good deal. I could sense the cashier's frustration as the woman wasn't understanding the instructions, yet the cashier remained patient and kind. Finally, after 45 minutes, the woman finished her transaction and the cashier thanked her for her patience. As I watched the whole exchange, I was so impressed by the cashier's patience and willingness to help the woman throughout the process.
