The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Once a passenger could board the train, an artist came up with a workaround that involved an airframe mounted to the bridge's ceiling, allowing passengers to turn it around and walk safely. The Empire State building's "docking system" allowed only passengers to move around inside it, and it also did not allow passengers to enter anything.

One challenge came when people started showing up in the windows of other buildings. Most buildings in America were built in a single year, so the challenge was to build all those. The engineers did a great job designing the building to withstand the harshest winter conditions for passenger movement, so they also installed the most lighted windows in the building.

In an effort to make the building safer, the building designers put a few LED lights in the airblock. For the first time for one of the most difficult architectural challenges, the engineers turned a few of those lights on and off within seconds. For the second one, they turned them off for as long as necessary.

The "docking system" of the Empire State Building is the same thing it was for the first time. As you can see, all people needed to do was move around without stopping. A little thought, no time to think, and then the best thing to do, as well as the other important design decisions, was to keep people moving around.

Even at this early
