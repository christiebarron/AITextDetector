The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it is not, to put it lightly, a work of fiction on the side. In fact, its conclusion is simply that there exists a kind of fairy tale of redemption: when the devil is cast out of heaven, he is just as much the object of fear as God is, and just as much the subject of love. There is nothing supernatural Duskwood can do to reverse that result; there is simply the simple fact that to do that you must overcome the devil's drive of self-interest. As a result, as with the novels of the Middle Ages, this would be a very real-life story with the same spirit-filled characters and settings, but with a different twist: the "witches of the kingdom" who will not let the devils escape from here.

A very clever book that makes even the most sceptical of critics look rather bad, as if the original story was somehow a hoax. If that's the case, then as with every attempt to make up it the author had little choice but to change or to continue to pretend in that new way.
