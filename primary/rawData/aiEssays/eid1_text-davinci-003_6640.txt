Dear Editor,

Recently, technology has advanced more and more each day, and many people now rely on computers for their everyday activities. While computers are a necessary part of our lives, it is also important to keep in mind the potential effects that they can have on people.

To begin with, computers can encourage people to be less active and lead a more sedentary lifestyle. Long hours spent sitting, tapping away at a desk can lead to health problems, such as obesity and back and neck pain. It is essential that the amount of time spent sitting at a computer be moderate and balanced with activities such as exercise and outdoor activities.

Furthermore, computers can also facilitate procrastination. With technology at our fingertips, it can be easy to become distracted or put off tasks for a later time. To prevent this, it is important to limit the amount of time you spend on the computer each day and to have a clear goal in mind before sitting down to use it.

On a more positive note, computers can also open up new opportunities that may not have been available without them. People can now communicate with others all around the world, access educational resources, and participate in positive activities that promote learning and creativity.

In conclusion, computers have both positive and negative effects on people, and it is essential to be aware of both. I urge readers to keep these effects in mind when deciding how to use computers, in order to live a healthy and productive lifestyle
