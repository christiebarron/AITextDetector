The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first was a simple design problem, but ultimately came to a solution through a process of joint construction. In the end, each party in the Empire State Building was awarded over 80,000 dirigibles, but was never able to make the bridge up. In the end, it wasn't done until about 20 years after the first project completed.

Today, the Empire State Building provides access to this historic and innovative form of transportation because it is completely open to the public. Since 2007 the building has been managed by the California Government Accountability Office (CAGO). And while the building can be found in other cities of California, including L.A., San Bernardino County, and Riverside County, in the United States, it's not allowed in the California state capitol â€” this has led to several protests and a lack of permits for them. This project may be a landmark moment, but not one that brings us to an end.

The Empire State Building

The Empire State Building was completed in 1867 and is a world-famous landmark on its own. It also has numerous memorial stones to its design and to its founder King George VI. But its current architecture is based on architecture with a contemporary flair. The Empire State Building was named "The Temple of Her Majesty" because there are so many of its features703 unique on-site, in part due to its original name.
