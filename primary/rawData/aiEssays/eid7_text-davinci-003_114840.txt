I was recently helping my little sister with a math problem that she had been struggling with for hours. At first, I was getting frustrated with her because she wasn’t understanding the concept, and I was beginning to lose my patience. However, I decided to take a step back and be patient with her.

I took a deep breath and slowly went through the problem step by step with her. I was patient, and I did my best to explain the concept in more detail than I had before.

After a few more minutes, my sister finally understood the problem and was able to finish it off. Although it took longer than I had hoped, I was proud of myself for being patient with her and not getting frustrated. Seeing the look of accomplishment on my sister’s face made the extra effort worth it.
