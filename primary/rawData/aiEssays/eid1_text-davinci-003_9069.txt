Dear Editor, 

As technology dramatically advances, we canâ€™t help but contemplate the effects of computers on people's lives. While computers positively serve as an innovative tool for creativity and expression, they can also be damaging to individuals' mental health, productivity, and interpersonal relationships.

When it comes to our mental health, spending excessive hours in front of a computer can lead to feelings of worthlessness, dependency, and depression. Too much time in a virtual world of your own making can diminish your sense of self and lead to unhealthy withdrawal from the real world. While computers offer a convenient way to stay connected to loved ones through social media, studies show that excessive hours spent on the devices can reduce empathy and emotional connection. Increased computer usage also leads to a decrease in productivity levels when work and leisure become intertwined.

Ultimately, when used in moderation, computers can be a great asset in advancing our lives and allowing us to explore. We must be mindful, however, to not let our technology usage take over our lives. Let us find balance between the virtual reality and the reality that exists around us.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
