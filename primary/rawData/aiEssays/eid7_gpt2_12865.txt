An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was at my house. I was living in a house which I owned in a family, and I didn't ask my family for $50 a week, I let my husband go and pay for all of it to care for somebody else. I was able to, and I paid for. There were times, on weekends for a year or so, where I was so grateful for having my money, we would do things like I was doing, like I would run off to go wash her. And then I would go home and I would work there, I would go back to work and I was able to pay for everything.
