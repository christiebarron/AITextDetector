An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a woman who I am very close to. She had a child (we had just met, 3 weeks earlier). She was only 26 when she got married, which caused stress, and she was in her early 20s. She went on to get a masters' degree and became a certified nurse.

There was a bit she had to say to my son, "We could make it into the NHS and get to where we are now. I need time to work and play, but we have this to live for. Is there a way I can make it into the NHS?" And she said no.

And so, when we met Dr. Brown, he says, "Hey, this guy is going to take care of me well. He has a good idea of what he needs to do. Would you like to talk about it?"

And the nurses who helped me develop Septic were so impressed with this idea that we would work together to turn it into part of our mission and to improve our hospitals.
