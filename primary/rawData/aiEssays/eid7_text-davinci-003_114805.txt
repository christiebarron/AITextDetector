I was at the grocery store when I noticed a very long line to check out. Everyone seemed to be in a hurry, pacing back and forth and grumbling about the long wait. Instead of joining in on the complaining, I decided to remain patient. I took the extra time to read a book I had with me instead. 

I noticed that the people around me started to pick up on my patience and calm demeanor and some even approached me to strike up a conversation. Because of my patience, I was able to meet some wonderful people that I otherwise would not have had the opportunity to meet. 

Before I knew it, the line began to move and soon I was at the front. To my surprise, the cashier at the register noticed my positive attitude and gave me a discount on my purchase. It was a nice ending to a pleasant experience. I felt grateful for my patience and the rewards that it provided.
