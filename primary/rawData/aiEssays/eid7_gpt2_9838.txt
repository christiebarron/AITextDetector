An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the time on Saturday when I was with my daughter and one hour later I was on Saturday again. She was with her daughter on Friday and that day I saw my daughter on Saturday and I thought that was her great first day of school so I went to her and helped her make school the most fun they had ever had," she said.

In their second meeting on Friday, the woman who said she had witnessed the alleged rapes said it was "an awful experience".

"She was in front of the CCTV camera with her daughter, very scared, the security of other people was very poor and very concerned, and she could not see what was going on," she said.

On June 21, while walking towards our hotel on the way home from meeting my daughter, the driver told me she had been raped while parked next to a petrol station. She was screaming and there was a loud sound. I told her what had happened to me.
 Ulster Unionist MP Michael Gove said that although it was not necessarily a case of rape but a sexual assault he had seen on mobile phones, the matter of sexual assault at night was an issue of "every day lives on".

Gove said that "every day lives on", but that it was important for people to be aware that on some occasions it can happen to them. "It's important that children always remember that it is a wrong," he said
