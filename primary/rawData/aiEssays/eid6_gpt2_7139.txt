The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They had to sell the material as they had only used it for building the two main towers, which the government had built on top of each other in the 1920s, as they sold it to private parties for hundreds of millions of dollars. The new buildings were designed to keep the building's occupants from drifting into the middle of the city.

But for several decades the Empire State Building still refused to accept dirigibles from architects like Otto Hockney, who had built two World Trade Center towers in New York. Despite a series of requests by the New York City Council for dirigibles, the builder refused even to give certificates for the construction of the single tower. In 1956, when the first dirigibles were unveiled in New York City, city officials were so stunned that they ordered them taken off the show.

Then, on January 7, 1957, two days later, the Empire State Building was moved to the West Side of Manhattan.

By the time a new wave of dirigibles arrived from the West Coast, many of the same people had begun to call for an end to the building. On April 11, 1958, the Federal Aviation Administration had set up an emergency task force, tasked with making sure the city did not become a nation of dirigibles. After flying to Cairo and visiting a Chinese embassy, they went there.
