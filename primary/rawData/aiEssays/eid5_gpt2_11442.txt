The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' (written by Kirito Nishiki, who went on to write Kirito's biography) was one of optimism.

"I am happy because I feel that the people of Japan are not going to have a problem with what they are not doing," Kirito said. "It is possible that the people of Japan will actually have problems, but I was afraid that if you go about it according to what the situation is there that you are going to be afraid."

In the book, Kirito wrote, "It's true that many men are unhappy when in Japan it's the women's work, and many women simply are satisfied."

Kirito said she also felt a strong sense of "that the Japanese are a society that is very conservative," but also wanted to write the book without changing the attitude that the Japanese are "still a very conservative society."

The book, Kirito said, will be told from Japan's perspective and not as an argument against the Japanese people's prone behavior.

"We have seen Japan is much more tolerant than I was in Japan," she said. "It is more of a society that has been in decline over the past several decades."
