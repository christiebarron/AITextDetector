The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' follows a girl who wanders between two cities for a romantic encounter. As the novel is a cautionary tale, the protagonist tries not to think about the future while traveling in the future, but to act as an observer between the two worlds of the current novel and future. The book takes place in our present, and it takes place only occasionally, which is typical when it comes to an American literary project, in particular "The Adventures of Rachael," although it's probably better known as "A Christmas Story in Texas."
