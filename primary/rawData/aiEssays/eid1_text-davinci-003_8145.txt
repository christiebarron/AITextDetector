They had to take into account the safety of the airships and those who might be on board, as well as the potential damage to the immense building and its occupants.

This posed serious safety risks for mast builders and potential airship passengers. In addition, ensuring that the mast was securely mounted was a complex process, with the builders needing to use metal and cables that could withstand the strong winds, as well as large anchors to keep the mast from being ripped away from its moorings. 

Despite the numerous obstacles, the
