The building of the Empire State Building was seen as a great feat of engineering and architecture, with a plan to install a mooring mast at the top for dirigibles to dock. However, there were numerous technical and economic obstacles in its way.

First of all, the elevator system is what was primarily utilized at the Empire State Building, thus making the mooring idea of dirigibles impractical for its customers. Also, it would necessitate highly expensive modifications to the existing infrastructure. In addition, incorporating the technology to safely move passengers and crew between the tower and the airship would remain a significant challenge. This aspect was particularly tricky given the large size and non-standard shape of the airships, making docking particularly difficult. 

From the economic side of the equation, the cost to build the mooring mast is already steep. Compounding that, it would be costly to maintain it. Not only would specialized staff be needed, but the high-altitude hangar would require constant repairs. Further, the cost and complexity of the hydraulic system, needed to lift tons of airships to the top, was never seen such before. 

There was also the challenge of air safety. According to a report by Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted, safety was an important issue, particularly when it came to the people boarding and disembarking at the top of the building. Furthermore, the need to maintain the airships themselves, which are particularly vulnerable
