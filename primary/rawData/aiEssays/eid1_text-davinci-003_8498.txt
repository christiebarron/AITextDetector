I was in line at the grocery store and the person in front of me was having difficulty getting her credit card to work. She must have tried it at least five times and the cashier was getting frustrated. I could tell she was embarrassed and apologetic. Instead of losing my patience and getting frustrated too, I wanted to be supportive and encouraging.

So I took a step back and gave her some space, saying "It's okay, take your time." After a few more failed attempts I gently offered to help her out. She was so thankful and the cashier offered me a free dessert for being so understanding and patient. It made a difficult situation better and I was glad I was able to help out.
