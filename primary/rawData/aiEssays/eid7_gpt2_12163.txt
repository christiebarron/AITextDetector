An example of a time someone in my life was patient was me. It was a small part of my life right at this early age and it kept asking to be held up as a hero…and to be a hero. It kept asking, "Did you see the movie? I saw the movie, did you see me on a TV show? I saw the character. I read some of the movies the moment you watch them. And I'm sure you saw the character…I'm sure you saw the character to the point of the character being a great hero." (laughs)

– What was your time for him as a kid?

JW: He got me to read the comics for a while. It was during the late teens and he wasn't just reading and going, "If I didn't have that, a thousand years later, I wouldn't be here today!" I was in his back pocket trying to get my mom to get out of college…it was a whole different story. So that just drove him crazy, because it was so much different. It was that crazy kid as a kid. This is what my grandparents looked into when they learned of how many books he could read. It scared his mom and dad. A lot of kids would have gotten out of school a lot and had their mom or dad read them.

– You also say that you would have been a lawyer if he had been more famous.

JW: No
