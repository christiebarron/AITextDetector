I believe that censorship of materials in libraries to harass and discourage readers cannot and should not be tolerated. This includes, but is not limited to:

(1) The content of the books or websites that are intended to be distributed or sold to students and their parents so as not to promote hatred or oppression of any other group, religious, racial, or ethnic group or persons, including, but not limited to, gay or transgender people, or homosexual and lesbian couples, or with respect to groups of people who are unable or unwilling to identify themselves, their families or other people they fear, or other groups of persons.

(2) Certain publications that "harass, intimidate, threaten" or otherwise constitute "propaganda" that the public generally does not support, including but not limited to, "gay propaganda." [15 U.S.C. Sec. ยง 1681(v).]

(3) Unapproved, inappropriate expression in any material that may be read or read on the Internet. [15 U.S.C. Sec. 1681(v), 639 A].

(4) Any material used to advance political or religious views or political or governmental goals, including, without limitation, or expressly disclaimers of, any such views, views or policies.

(5) Any publications, videos, images, graphics, and other material that encourages a particular group's participation in any political or religious exercise, political or governmental action,
