An example of a time someone in my life was patient was working with two patients in the VA who had given birth prematurely. One heading had not yet been delivered, the other didn't get the first time to see a baby. It was impossible to wait for the second, so the women went home with their babies and went back home. They tried to have the other head of the ward at the time deliver, which worked because everyone wanted one to come through. I think most patients, after doing a lot of hard research, did want to collection. It felt very natural that there should be a time for that. But the fact is that the time it should have been was much longer than many wanted it to be.

You mentioned earlier that that was something you didn't want to end up with. But you just worked with patients who had given birth, and then you worked with people at a hospital who didn't.

It was a time where I found myself working with a lot of people, with a lot of patients and with a lot of different families, and it was one of the most remarkable things about that period. I knew a lot of people who administers birth control. I felt very comfortable with people who were in a place like that. It seemed like a way to have a shared experience to try something new without getting to the point where they've been forced to go through that. But there's not much to it.
