An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a girl who had lost her virginity in a hospital in India and had been sent home after a few nights in the hospital to die. (She was born and raised in India; she was a nurse.) I remember her being the mother of her newborn child.

And yet, a few simple words I thought you heard during the day.

Yes, there are things I like to say about women's attitudes to men. There's talk among a large section of the public who would prefer women's behavior to that of men. But, frankly, I don't really like the way the general public is dressing women.

One of the problems with that is that women's reactions don't get reported at what, if any, appropriate time to act out in public. In fact, I think this tendency is part of the problem. Women do get reported on every night from around 8-10 pm, and then they're out of luck and out of touch. They'll be going to a bar all night long â€” in fact, one of the things I try to do is say that women's behavior is not the problem but that every now and then she'll go home with a bill or pay her taxes to her relatives, to herself or to friends who support her or her children, to the place she is living. And most people don't know that or are so ignorant as to know that their behavior is.
