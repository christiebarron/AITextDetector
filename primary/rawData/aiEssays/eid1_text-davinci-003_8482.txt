I remember being a college student living with a roommate for the first time. At times, he could be difficult to live with as he was always messy, making it hard to find the things I needed. He also liked to stay up late into the night and ignore our agreement to keep the noise level down. 

Rather than getting into arguments every week, I decided to be patient. I was determined to remain understanding even when it was hard. Whenever I felt myself growing frustrated, I stopped and counted to ten â€“ taking a deep breath and allowing myself to relax before speaking my mind.

Over time, this approach began to pay off. My roommate not only appreciated my patience, he started to match it by taking better efforts to keep our living space cleaner and respect my need for quiet. Naturally, our relationship improved and our living arrangement became much more positive and enjoyable.
