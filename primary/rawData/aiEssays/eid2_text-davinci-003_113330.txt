Censorship in libraries is an ongoing debate, and one that I wholeheartedly believe should have a limit. I find it necessary to voice my opinion on the matter as libraries serve both as an educational and recreational resource for the members of our community. 

Books, music, movies, and magazines in libraries provide an unlimited source of information and entertainment for all kinds of people of all ages. Materials should not be removed from public libraries simply because they are found offensive. Instead, it is important for librarians to ensure that the items on the shelves are appropriate for certain age groups. Furthermore, libraries should offer access to a wide range of materials, including those often viewed as “controversial.” This creates an open dialogue within the community and helps to encourage knowledge-based decision making, critical thinking, and unbiased knowledge. 

Removing materials can be seen as suppressing free speech—a basic cornerstone of Democracy. Furthermore, singling certain materials out for removal sets a dangerous precedent. If books, music, movies, and magazines can be censored, what other types of materials and information could be considered offensive and censored? The freedom of speech outlined in the United States Constitution is an invaluable part of the nation, and should not be treaded upon lightly. 

Ultimately, censorship should have a limit. Libraries are an invaluable resource for members of the community, and should remain a beacon of knowledge and education, unencumbered by restrictions.
