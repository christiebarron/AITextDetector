 

I was sitting in my local coffee shop, enjoying the background chatter of people discussing their favourite topics. My phone vibrated. It was a text message from an old friend. She asked if I could meet up later that evening. I messaged her back saying that I could, and she sent me the address of the bar where we should meet. 

I nervously made my way there, unsure what to expect. As I entered, my friend was already sitting at a table waiting for me. We greeted each other with a tight hug, both of us feeling a little awkward. I took the seat opposite her, and asked how she had been. 

Before she could answer, my friend's face suddenly lit up with an infectious smile, and the atmosphere changed. It became light-hearted and I couldn't help but join in her joy. She burst into a fit of laughter and I soon found myself in stitches too. We continued to joke and laugh with one another, enjoying each others company, until we finally stopped to take a breath.

It was in that moment that I realized how much I'd missed my friend, and for the first time in what felt like forever, I started to feel a genuine connection with another person. It felt like the laughter had bridged the gap between us, and suddenly I felt more at ease, like I was home.
