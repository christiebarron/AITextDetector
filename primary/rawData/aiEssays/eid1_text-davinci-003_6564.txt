Dear Editor,

These days, it seems like everyone has a computer. While computers have become part of modern life, their effects on people are worth careful consideration. 

Of course, computers can be beneficial in many ways. They provide unprecedented opportunity for communication and education, and the practical applications are seemingly endless. The ease and speed in which information can be found is unmatched, allowing people to stay connected to each other and the world around them.

However, I believe there have also been unexpected and detrimental consequences from the increased presence of computers. The constant exposure to digital screens can be tiring and adversely affect our vision. In addition, while computers can offer useful information, it also serves as a platform for viruses to spread and can contain many harmful elements, such as malicious software. 

Not to mention, many people find themselves spending too much time on computers. There are always distractions on screen, and it’s easy to get lost in them to a dangerous degree. It’s important to know when to take a break and step away from the computer. 

Computers certainly have their place in our lives, but it’s important to remain aware of their potential negative impacts. We should be mindful of our own well-being and recognize when it’s time to get away from the screen for a while.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
