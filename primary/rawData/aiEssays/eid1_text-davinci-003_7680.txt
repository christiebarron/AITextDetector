The narrator of the story, a Chinese-American girl named Jun, has been struggling with the challenges that come with being an immigrant trying to assimilate into a new culture. By the end of the story, Jun is talking to a wilting hibiscus in her family's backyard, which not only serves as a symbol of her family's memories, but also symbolizes her determination to never give up. She also reflects on the difficulties she has experienced in adapting to her new environment, and the need to continue to strive for success. Jun ends the story with a promise to the hibiscus that she will take the same test again in the spring, when the snows are melted and the geese return. It serves as a symbol of her determination to never quit, no matter how difficult things may get.
