The mood created in the memoir 'From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives' by Narciso Rodriguez is one of both melancholy and nostalgia. As Rodriguez recounts his childhood and his formative years growing up, we learn of a young man facing adversity but who ultimately succeeds. 

Throughout Rodriguez’s narrative, we can feel a sense of determination and grand ambition. Though his upbringing was a struggle, he never cedes to defeat and instead looks toward the future with hope and optimism. He speaks of his belief in the power of hard work and the relentless pursuit of his dreams. 

At the same time, we feel a nostalgia in his past, rooted in his expression of breaking away from the familiar and being moved by the beauty of nature, which inspired Rodriguez to become the fashion designer he is today. He speaks of the Connecticut landscape as “changes in nature, moods, and spirit,” evoking an emotional connection between Rodriguez and his past.

However, in spite of his ambition and drive, Rodriguez is conscious of the sacrifices he made in pursuit of success. He speaks of the “emotional upheaval” that accompanies his work and how his family relationships suffered as a result. This contradiction creates a poignant sense of melancholy, as we can sense both pain but also pride in the life he has built for himself.
