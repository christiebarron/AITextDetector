Dear Editor,

With technologyâ€™s modern advancements in the past few decades, computers have become a common part of people's lives. From the daily use of these machines for entertainment, communication, and even work, they have infiltrated and had a great influence in our society.

As with any great advancement, comes both advantages and disadvantages. On one hand, the unrestricted access to information has provided numerous benefits. An individual can access information from any part of the world which helps in gaining knowledge and understanding of various cultures and lifestyles. It also enables people to easily communicate with others and increases transparency and efficiency in many aspects of life such as the workplace.

However, on the other hand, an over-dependence on computers and technology can lead to a multitude of issues. Computer use has been linked to posture problems, eyestrain, headaches and bad overall health. Alongside this, people tend to turn to the digital world for satisfaction, disconnecting oneself from the happenings of the physical world. This has caused people to stay socially isolated and has caused negative effects on relationships with others.

Although technology has caused issues, we should not forget that it has enabled us to achieve great deals and progress through the years. Proper use of computers and technology can make our everyday life that much easier and better. People must strive to use computers and technology in a manner so that it increases work efficiency and reduces the associated risks caused by the over-dependence on it
