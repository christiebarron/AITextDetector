One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was watching my first sitcom. I was watching someone write to me and thank me for having a great day at work and I didn't have much time to go into detail. But in that regard he said, "I'm really sorry. I've got an hour of work to do and you guys can sit down and figure out what to do." Then one day when you are at work, people ask you to come to them and tell them your story. So those two words are very common at certain times and it is really a good thing to think about and then when we're in the middle of the day, people come in and give us the best of what we are giving.
