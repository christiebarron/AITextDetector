Dear Editor, 

As technology continues to improve, computers have become an essential part of our daily lives. With the rapid advancement of technology, many have argued that computers can prove to be harmful, both mentally and physically, to the modern consumer. 

With spending extended amounts of time sitting in front of a computer and depending on it for work or leisure, body aches in the neck, shoulders, and back are a common result. The long-term effects of this “computer neck” can lead to permanent medical conditions. Research shows that spending extended amounts of time engaging with technology can also cause thinning of the retina, which reduces contrast sensitivity in the eyes.

But more importantly, computers can cause a number of psychological effects when overused. Individuals addicted to the Internet are more likely to experience irritability, agitation, social isolation, and depression. Prolonged computer use can result in a decrease in physical activity and can also cause or aggravate social anxiety. 

Although we must acknowledge the conveniences that come with using computers, it is also important to recognize that too much use of computers can have negative impacts on our health and well-being. We should all strive to be aware of our computer use and strive to maintain balance in our lives.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
