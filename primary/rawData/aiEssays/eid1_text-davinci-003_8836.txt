I have never laughed as much as I did with my best friend. We had been friends for a while but it was only recently that we were able to share those moments of true joy.

One afternoon, she had come to visit me while my parents were out. Before long, we were laughing uncontrollably about the silliest things. We kept going until our stomachs hurt from trying to stifle our laughter and our eyes were nearly streaming with tears.

It felt like no matter what we said, we could not help but laugh. We would start off shaking with laughter about an unimportant remark and quickly fall back into an uncontrollable fit of giggles at the slightest provocation. Some of our laughs came out of nowhere and we had no idea why we were laughing so much.

It was that same laughter that changed our friendship. We were no longer just friends, for those laughs had strengthened our bond and connected us more deeply as we realized that we both shared this rare kind of joy. 

Laughter is truly an invaluable connection that I am thankful to share with my closest friend.
