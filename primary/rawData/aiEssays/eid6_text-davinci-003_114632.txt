The Empire State Building has a fascinating history, particularly with regards to the attempted utilization of the mooring mast atop the building. The Mast was intended to be used to dock dirigibles and act as a terminal for passengers, allowing them to disembark and travel to the city below. Unfortunately, the ambitious undertaking of the project faced a number of obstacles and the dream of a dirigible dock atop the building was never realized.

The structural engineering of the mast posed the first challenge for the builders of the Empire State Building. With no lights, radio direction finder, or wind indicator, the design was ambitious due to a lack of supporting technology. Despite attempting to compensate for this with large steel cables and anchors, the mast was still at great risk of snapping in the wind or from the combined mooring force of a dirigible. As such, this was a major obstacle in allowing dirigibles to dock.

Additionally, the height of the mooring mast posed a serious problem for the builders, as the air around the building was far too turbulent for the dirigibles to dock safely. The winds could easily have caused the airships to bump into the building or be pushed off course. Furthermore, the lack of tethering and stabilizing technology made the whole process of docking even more dangerous. This could have had catastrophic results if the dirigible were to come into contact with the building.

Lastly, there was the issue of public opinion from the people
