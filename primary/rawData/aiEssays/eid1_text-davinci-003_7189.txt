In Joe Kurmaski’s ‘Rough Road Ahead’ the cyclist’s journey is one filled with physical and mental challenges that arise from the features of the setting. One of the most significant features is the terrain. As the cyclist cycles through a winding dirt road and climbs steep rocky hills, his or her body is put through extraordinary physical exertion. The combination of high altitude and extreme temperatures places great demands on the cyclist’s ability to excel in such demanding conditions. As the cyclist transitions from flat surfaces to difficult uphill climbs, their breathing becomes labored as they strive to make the journey. The sudden changes in temperature, such as rainstorms or the burning of a hot sun, add to the difficulty of the journey and the demands on the cyclist. 

At the same time, the scenery of the setting creates both a mental and physical obstacle for the cyclist. The scenic beauty of the terrain provides peace and solace but also serves as a reminder of the long, winding road ahead. The beauty of the setting can serve as a motivator as the cyclist is filled with a sense of awe and accomplishment as they traverse a variety of landscapes.
