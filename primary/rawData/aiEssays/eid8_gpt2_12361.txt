One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I found one out-of-the-box moment that I really enjoyed. The other, however, is when the music struck the heart. While I can't help but hear it by heart, I am going to say that all my best and brightest.

What's the best news? I am so proud of you and your band at this historic milestone in my career.

Thank you so much!

-Paul P.

I hope you will continue your journey with the Grateful Dead, the legendary band you have been lucky enough to make. You've inspired me, and the fans.

Thank you again,
