Computers have many effects on people. If a machine produces more power or better performance, then it's able to achieve even better results.

This means that computers that are capable of producing more power or use less horsepower aren't necessarily more efficient than those that are idle machines. For example, they're more effective at improving performance to be able to run less code or perform more tasks. But these factors are less important than their performance at idle.
