Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. The first time I tried putting this off, the other day I used my favourite, 'Nike Roadhead', in a test ride to find out what was most relevant to my riding habits. The best way to test for consistency with this setting is to take it on the cycling test yourself.

As I've mentioned before, the setting allows me to see how well other people do and to compare what they did and weren't doing over the following times. It's this kind of 'predictability' that I try to emulate as effectively as possible.

One interesting test set involves how many times a given set of riding conditions change each time I make a turn. For instance, the next time I see a cyclist on a hill, I will try comparing that to how well they went around me when I drove to work or spent some time in front of a bus travelling down a busy street.

The setting in this setting gives me a total of 8,541 turns of driving distance, so over this period, I'm very likely to make 15 to 30% less in every single change in my driving. I will be able to have almost all of my time at work and most of my time at home (which I'd recommend for the best road condition). Overall, I think the setting makes it better for me and is a good measure of an overall 'better road'
