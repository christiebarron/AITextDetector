Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, creates a mood of nostalgia and sentimentality that captures the beauty and complexity of family and relationships. Rodriguez's reflections on his upbringing and childhood provides readers with a deeper understanding of the complexities of family dynamics and the importance of companionship in our lives.

The tranquil scenes he recreates in the memoir capture the essence of the slow and steady relationships built in the small towns of his childhood and draw attention to the simple pleasures of being home. Through vivid visual and sensory descriptions, Rodriguez paints a vivid, emotional picture of the towns he visits and the family memories associated with them. Each recollection brings the reader one step closer to the family he was raised in and how it shaped the person he is today. 

The memoir's tone of nostalgia is further illustrated through the inherent themes of family, connection, and joy in the small things that are vital to our inner lives. In the chapter “Unlocking Time,” Rodriguez paints a poetic picture of how things change yet remain the same when he visits his childhood town. He describes the sights, sounds, and smells of the place as being “etched” on his memory that will, unlike temporal objects, never fade. This connection to past life creates a beautiful contrast to the modern world and allows the reader to contemplate the importance of slowing down and appreciating the simple moments that make up life.
