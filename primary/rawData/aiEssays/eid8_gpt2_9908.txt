One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was on a bus with other guys while we were waiting for our pick. We were in an alleyway between restaurants and cars lined a street where they wanted to check in their next shift. They were holding up their phones to their windows with paper receipts and then getting on their cars. One of them had a sign on his phone that read "Hey! Check out my newurchish shirt!". As they were checking a bag containing their ID they ran down the street that they had searched and just as they opened the bag of mail came up a message saying "This is my address. Come on in!"

This was the first time that I actually saw my dad for some reason. He was so happy that we were all alone. He said to me "Dad, this is the last time you've ever seen your dad". He told me he had learned from my experience that no matter what your family looks like it's going to be different if you're always around the same person.

I'm usually the girl doing the first check in the line. I go down the street searching for my ID for my parents so that I can check in. I ask my mom if it was even possible, and if not, I go back home. I feel safe. I can see my friends all the way down the line. Then I reach the store that I buy my birthday cookies with, get out the ID and walk back down
