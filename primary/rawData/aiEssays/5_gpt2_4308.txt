The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is "like what someone might think of taking your hand and saying, 'Thankyou for telling me you love my baby.' "

The book's protagonist, an English woman, writes to a relative who asks to see her on the road. He tells her he doesn't want to take photos. She does it anyway because he considers her "a cute little girl."

"I can't believe it. I could be a monster again," she says.

She then describes how the photographer, who was also with her but not with him, was so excited she cried when he put his hand on her stomach and pressed it to her stomach. She then asks him if he felt pain. Eventually she found a doctor: a neurologist.

The story of the man's ordeal has been well received in France: some French say that it has inspired a national anthem.

"I could not believe it. I could be a monster again," she says.

That feeling of relief and anxiety, said Marie-Claude, has been common for her family.

"I am very worried. I can't imagine how they will feel about it," the French journalist wrote last year.

"At this level I'm feeling that it has affected their life, as do all the people I want to see and I want them to feel that I'm my own person," she added.
