To the Editor:

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. While computers have made many aspects of life easier and more efficient, there are also potential downsides to their pervasive presence in the modern world.

The use of computers has created an “always-on” culture, and individuals may find it difficult to dial back their reliance on technology and allow for the necessary personal downtime to foster their mental, emotional, and social wellbeing. In addition, people often take an addiction of sorts to their technology, where they allow an inordinate amount of time to be spent playing games, messaging with friends, and shopping online.

The physical effects of computers can also be harmful to health, with eyesight, neck, and back issues becoming more prevalent, especially since computer work is typically associated with long hours and lack of adequate breaks.

To truly embrace the benefits of computers while avoiding the potential dangers, users must exercise responsibility. Limiting screen time, ensuring the workplace is set up in ergonomic ways, and engaging in mindfulness techniques can all contribute to a positive computer experience.

I invite the readers of this paper to be mindful of the perspectives we just discussed. Ultimately, computers bring both good and bad, and understanding these potential changes can go a long way to help us make conscious decisions about how we interact with our technology. 

Sincerely,
