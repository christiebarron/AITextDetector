The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because its setting of Middle-earth gives it some unique aspects (and sometimes challenges) from that source. It's a perfect place for a historical book to start to write an awesome novel, and it's also definitely an excellent place for a novel, too. It doesn't feel like an unfinished sequel for many reasons, but it's a well thought out adaptation, even if it gets a bit of tweaking for some fans. What is important here for me and many others, is not just the tone and structure of the Book of Winter Hibiscus, but also its style. What is important here is that everything is fully explored in a way that appeals to the audience, and that makes it difficult to forget what the author has written.

The key to this is that, despite what our audience might think, this book is not about the Book of Winter Hibiscus as described here, but rather about my own personal experience. Some might say that there are few things more important for a historical novel than the fact that it covers the year of the great conflict between the High Realm against Middle-earth for the first time. And, despite the book being full of amazing characters in their midst, the central theme is that even after the events of the Book of Winter Hibiscus, the people of Middle-earth still fight for the High Realm even when they face different enemies. Those characters are no longer just one piece of fiction,
