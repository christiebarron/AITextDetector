The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first was the fact that the aircraft could only be launched from the left of the tower rather than from above. By the summer of 1917, the building had become so large that a large air tank had to be erected for it; but if it was too crowded that it would overflow, an anti-ship missile shield could be built to protect the building. Another problem was whether to allow pilots to operate within the airship. The fact that the Empire State Building consisted of three aircraft meant that a bomber or a heavy plane could be launched from a low-altitude position only under certain conditions; however, many planes of war are relatively small, and some may even be very effective. In order to protect the Empire State Building, the war was divided into two phases: 1) the first one consisted of a small group of high-altitude landings between the towers and between the two sides of the building, and 2) the second phase was more complicated. A new line of aircraft was developed from four small units, a single cockpit and a small aircraft on its side. The pilots had to rely on the engines of the aircraft to operate against the enemy's attacks. On the second, the aircraft carried an engine, not a propeller, to operate against a target. During this action, the pilots were not necessarily commanded by an officer with a good knowledge of the aerodynamics of the aircraft.
