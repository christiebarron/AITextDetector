Dear Editor,

I’m writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have had on people.

In today’s increasingly digital world, it’s difficult to imagine life without computers. However, as the recent rise in cyber addiction has demonstrated, too much reliance on computers can have negative consequences. Overspending online or becoming too entrenched in online gaming can be both mentally and financially draining.

On the other hand, computers have become an essential tool in our everyday lives. They help us communicate with others quickly and efficiently, search for important information, stay up-to-date on world news, and entertain ourselves in our free time.

I believe that computers can be beneficial when used properly, but they cannot replace the importance of real-world interactions and activities. Rather, they should be used as supplements to enhance our lives, not as a total replacement.

I urge readers to recognize the potential issues that come with overindulging in our digital lifestyles, and to be mindful of their own usage of computers. With a bit of balance, everyone can take full advantage of technology without allowing it to take control over our lives.

Sincerely, 

[Name]
