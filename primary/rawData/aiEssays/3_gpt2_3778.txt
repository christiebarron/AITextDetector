Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

The setting is to move a vehicle along the route as intended from the point where it is stopping, as if turning a corner, as it happens to be on the right.

There should not be changes from this mode, it changes how the cyclist is shown on the map at all. The option 'Smart' is selected so the cyclist can see information if they want to return to the next corner on the map based on their position on the road (by turning a few left off the map or to any other angle of motion).

If a cyclist feels they are being used by their motorcycling partner that will be turned to 'Smart' when they turn.
