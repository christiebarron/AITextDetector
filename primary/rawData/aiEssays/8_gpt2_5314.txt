One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my friends on college football asked me if I was a'monster in class' or it was 'tactically insane,'" he says. "And the answer was no. I thought in that moment of being an athlete that wasn't always about being athletic, and the answer might not have been right â€¦ but in my mind, it was the answer to my heart." "I think this is not what it was. I took a lot of pride in being a man of integrity," he adds. "I think I've matured. And hopefully this way shows in the real world that people in their life can learn from what's coming along."

It's hard for some to imagine if the Steelers or other franchises on this list take more pride in their young players' ability to come together as a group, at the expense of their team's reputation. But if they think their young players have more upside, they're wrong.
