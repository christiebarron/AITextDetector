The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it gives us a lot of insights into the role that we're taking in the creation of a kind of 'virtual reality' system."

"Hibiscus is a great example of the use of software to enable people to interact with others of all ages and cultures," said Mark Wilson, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of California, Berkeley. "They can be taught to talk to anybody online, but the software has a huge, enormous advantage over the real world. I do think that this is a very important question that needs to be addressed."

The software is called Aevaluate, and as I wrote in an article about it in The Wall Street Journal, it's an algorithm that can measure both physical attributes of an animal and, more importantly, the human mind's ability to do certain functions. To date, the algorithm has produced hundreds to thousands of results across more than 20 countries, but Aevaluate has created so much "virtual reality" so quickly that it's often just a matter of tweaking the software over and over.

But Aevaluate can't determine when or where an animal is. And in fact, researchers have had to go back and re-design it as a virtual reality system, by testing the animal's physical traits.

"A new approach can be applied to try to tell when to place an animal to take a pill or place something in front of us," said Wilson
