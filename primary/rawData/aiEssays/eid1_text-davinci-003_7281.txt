The features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead" have a significant impact on the cyclist's journey. The road is steep and difficult to navigate, with sharp rocks and roots jutting out from the dirt. This makes it difficult for the cyclist to find the right line and make progress on their route. Furthermore, the heat of the sun and the sparse shade makes it difficult to cool down and rest, as the sun is relentless in its intensity. 

The cyclist is also facing a rocky and uneven terrain. This makes it difficult to ride swiftly, as the cyclist is constantly dodging obstacles, such as large rocks, roots, and ruts in the road. The terrain also makes it difficult to focus and stay on the line they need to take in order to make progress. 

The cyclist is also susceptable to the threats of nature while on this road. The cyclist is at the mercy of the unpredictable weather, as rain storms, wind storms, and other natural occurrences can severely affect their progress. Additionally, wild animals, such as bears and coyotes, could interfere with the cyclist's journey, and the cyclist is entirely at their mercy.
