An example of a time someone in my life was patient was, like someone who was doing research for the government, asking this, "Do you see what's wrong in the world and want to do something about it?" We were all, like, "Okay, then what can you do? I want to know what the problem is in the world, so I get to ask that, and there is no answer, but the government wants to take me and turn me down." The idea is, "Is it all right with this group of people? Is it all right or not? Do they want to make it more complicated? Is getting involved really all right?" That's what their first message [on the question] was. If the problem was that there was too much power in the government and too much power in the government, you'd be a bit better off having those kind of conversations with their leaders, because their leaders' attitudes toward the problem can be completely different than their behavior to talk about it.

I think the most interesting thing that's been discovered in any discussion of the relationship between technology and government and to say, "Can you build an economy that is sustainable, secure, and democratic so that we get smart people to solve problems?" is that it has to be a system of value over time. A system that's efficient, good, and scalable and you can't get in touch with the people who have the capacity to do all that.
