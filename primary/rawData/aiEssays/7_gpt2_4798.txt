An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was on the cusp. When I walked out in a bad mood, that really hurt. It was just a bad breakup. I really needed to take a break and get better. A good breakup is one that shows that there is power and can do things to change your life.

I remember the first time I went out for that first weekend on Sunday Night Live. I was working two nights in a row for the show. We had two very great parties. I went up to a friend's bed and her (wife) asked me if I wanted to do a dance party. We danced a lot and I said no.

We had a lot of drinks at that party. It was one of the great parties I've had. One friend started dancing and I said to her: "I'm glad you're doing that dance party." They both laughed and were dancing.

Our little girl started dancing. It was super good â€” that was the first time I saw that. Because she started dancing, I was ready to jump to her. I was like, "Wow!" That's a special moment when I know all about my life. I feel really special right now and that's all I know about it and I feel so lost. I don't even know what I did next because I was trying to just let everything go. I'm like, "Where did you get that dance party?"
