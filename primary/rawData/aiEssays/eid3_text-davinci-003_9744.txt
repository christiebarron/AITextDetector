The setting of Joe Kurmaski’s short story “Rough Road Ahead” has significant implications for the protagonist, the cyclist. This setting involves a rural mountain road that winds its way along the sides of a valley cutting through rugged mountain terrain. This environment imposes numerous limitations on the cyclist’s journey, with the narrowness of the road making it difficult and dangerous for him and his companion to pass oncoming vehicles. The steepness of the mountain climb provides a constant physical challenge, making the cyclist’s progress slow and exhausting. Furthermore, the remoteness of the mountain road increases the cyclist’s vulnerability to potential danger or harm, such as being exposed to sudden changes in the weather or coming into contact with wild animals. 

The cyclist further has limited vision, as he is hampered by the winding roads that frequently take him into tunnels or areas providing limited line-of-sight for him. This lack of visibility is a hindrance that makes any adaptation to obstacles and navigational concerns difficult. Finally, the cyclist is further limited in his progress due to the winding turns and hair-pin bends which reduce his maximum velocity and often require him to come to abrupt stops.

In summary, the features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead” provide a challenging environment for the cyclist as he struggles to make his journey. The mountainous terrain is physically difficult and dangerous, while the narrowness of the road,
