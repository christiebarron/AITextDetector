Dear Editor:

In today's world, computers are an integral part of our lives. As technology advances, more and more of our daily lives become automated or at least easier by computers. There is no doubt that computers have had a positive effect in many aspects of our lives, from communication to accounting. However, as with any technology, there can be risks associated with heavy use.

From online bullying to unsupervised use of computers by children, there are many risks that arise from the overuse of computers. Studies have shown that computer use can increase a personâ€™s risk of depression, anxiety and social isolation. This is especially true in children and adolescents, who may not understand the risks associated with computer use or realize the potential harm that can occur via online interactions.

It is important for us to take the time to ensure that our children are educated about the dangers of excess computer use, and that they are being supervised when using computers. We must also be mindful of our own computer usage and make sure that it does not interfere with our interpersonal relationships.

We must all consider the potential harm caused by overuse of computers in order to protect ourselves and our loved ones from the dangers that can arise.

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
