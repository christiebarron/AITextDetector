Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people in our society. In a world that is increasingly becoming more and more reliant on technology, it is important that we have an open and honest discussion about the potential implications of this shift.

From my personal experience, I have seen the positive impacts of technology in my life. Computers have allowed me to increase my productivity, stay connected with my friends and family, and even access educational materials online. As the technology has advanced, I have been able to keep up with the times and reap the many benefits of the digital revolution.

But there is a flipside to it all. If not used responsibly, computers can be a major source of distraction and stress. Oftentimes, our lives can become centered around the screens, leading to increased isolation and decreased physical activity. We must remember to use our devices wisely and be mindful of our usage patterns, or else we can fall into the trap of tech addiction. 

That being said, I believe that computers can be a great asset if used correctly. As energy and resources are poured into the tech industry, the potential for good is undeniable. New connections can be made, barriers can be broken, and opportunities can meet possibilities. Nonetheless, we must be conscientious of the tasks that require us to be present in the moment and unplug for our own mental wellbeing.

I invite you and your readers to think deeply about
