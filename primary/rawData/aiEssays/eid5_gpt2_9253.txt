The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is something I cannot describe.

In the first half the book starts at a level of emotion which is so much more dramatic - it is filled with a feeling of a deeply rooted human need for love. It includes some of the worst things the world does - in particular violence. The book takes us out of the place of the 'other' - there is a sense of place and identity under the surface.

It may seem impossible for a book this simple to tell a coherent story â€“ it is difficult for me, of course.

But it is a work that I feel is absolutely worth checking out. I'm looking forward to seeing what others are reading about it.

And the book will also be on sale here to coincide with a meeting of the British Film Academy in London at the end of December, the last time The Beatles ever took the stage.
