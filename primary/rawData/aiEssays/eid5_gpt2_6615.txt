The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is extremely personal and that is perhaps the reason for the abrupt departure of the film 'From Home'. After many weeks and months, the final film was finished and I was back on my feet. My mind was still in order a few weeks later at the start of 2014. I am able to give a very close account of it and of the things that happened to me after I lost the love of my life on the film. For the first time I found comfort in the light of my actions and my story. I am very satisfied with every step I took, from the emotional moment where I lost the hope in this film to the acceptance of the film I am about to make.

What is your impression of the film itself?

It is a very dark film. Allusions to the past or of the future. It is very personal. I wanted to make a film where I am telling a story as personal as I should be but I am sure I was wrong about the way I wanted to make it. But to be honest, I am pleased that 'From Home' has not lost its connection to me. It has a very good sense of humour and a great range of possible endings. I am grateful for my success in the form, for the film, for its good performances and for its great story.

What is his philosophy with the film? Was it to do good things for one person at a time
