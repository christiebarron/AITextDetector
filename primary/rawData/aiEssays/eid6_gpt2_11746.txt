The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The majority of those in favor of dirigibles had to resort to the most extreme forms of force, including the use of nuclear weapons. A U.S. government report from 1971 reported that "the U.S. did not need to establish an aerial strike or engage in combat against military planes to do the planning." It was then that the Eisenhower administration decided that the Empire State Building would not be used as a staging location, and that the builders of the building needed to create a new type of aircraft.

Some of the early prototypes for aircraft were found off U.S. soil. One of these aircraft was an HGV-5K called the Aeroman. In 1972 when the Pentagon was under attack U.S. planes flew into the sky and crashed. The government did not have aircraft ready for use, or were willing to work with an aircraft manufacturer to develop them. A few of these planes, the X-20, the F-15 and the F-16 were available. In 1973 another model called the X-11 was commissioned. The X-11 was not part of the Empire State Buildings plan. It was commissioned from a contractor, which was not a good thing.

Despite the risks and drawbacks of launching a new type of aircraft, the American government agreed that a small plane would be a better starting place. There are several reasons that this was the right
