Dear Editor:

As technology advances, more and more of us are relying on computers to manage our lives. But are computers really helping us or are they actually having a negative effect on us?

It’s easy to say that computers are having a positive impact, as we can now perform tasks quicker and more efficiently than before. We can communicate with others around the globe, research almost any topic imaginable, and store valuable information more easily. But, at the same time, computers are weakening our bodies and minds.

For starters, exposure to the blue light emitted by computer screens, can cause headaches, fatigue, and even eye damage. This can lead to long-term problems for those who spend a lot of time looking at a monitor. Furthermore, sitting in front of a computer for hours on end can cause neck and back pain.

Most importantly, computers are having an adverse effect on our minds. Many kids, teens, and even adults are now spending more time in the virtual world than in the physical, leading to them become less sociable and more disconnected from reality. This could lead to poorer mental health and lower academic achievement. 

In conclusion, it’s clear that computers can be both beneficial and detrimental. We should be aware of the risks and strive to use our computers in moderation, so we can reap the rewards without suffering the consequences.

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
