When I was younger, my mom would always take me to the library. It became a cherished weekly tradition. However, one day, I noticed that my mom was running late. Instead of getting mad, I decided to be patient. I waited patiently in front of the library, without complaining. Sure enough, eventually, my mom showed up, apologizing for the delay. We had a wonderful afternoon together in the library, and afterwards, my mom thanked me for being so patient.
