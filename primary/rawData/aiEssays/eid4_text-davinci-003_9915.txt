At the end of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho, the narrator reflects on the importance of understanding the cultural values of different countries. She acknowledges that she cannot pass a language competency test without understanding these cultural values, and so she expresses her hope that she will pass this test when she tries it again in the spring. In doing so, she conveys her determination to learn more about different cultures and become culturally competent. The ending of the poem symbolizes the narratorâ€™s commitment to learning and growing, particularly in regards to other cultures and ways of life.
