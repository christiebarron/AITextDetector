I was walking through the park one day, feeling particularly glum and defeated. I had just finished a difficult week at work and I was feeling drained and discouraged. As I walked, an elderly couple crossed my path and, without saying a word, the woman burst into a deep, throaty laugh. It was unexpected, and I suddenly felt my frown slipping away as I couldn't help but be enchanted by their joy.

The couple turned to me and asked if I'd like to join them for a cup of tea and some biscuits. I was so delighted by the invitation that I found myself agreeing before I'd had a chance to think better of it.

We sat and chatted for hours about everything from what had been going on in my life to the couple's incredible 60 year love story - which was fascinating, charming and incredibly moving. There was laughter throughout, whether it was in response to embarrassing teenage stories, silly mishaps in the kitchen or one of the old man's corny jokes. Their laughter was infectious, and suddenly I felt my worries starting to evaporate.

Sharing a cup of tea and enjoying the company of these two sweet strangers was possibly the most healing and rewarding thing I'd experienced all week. As I made my way home, I smiled to myself, grateful for the laughter and eventually, a new outlook on the situation I had been struggling with.
