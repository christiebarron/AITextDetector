An example of a time someone in my life was patient was at work, she was working in the IT department, she was always worried about her colleagues because they might be a little too impatient. And I am a woman, I have to face that at some cost to me.

That is what the question came up. And it was like every day someone comes and asks if I have had a problem, and I said I have not or something is wrong. And I came to her my office at home and I said to her, what's wrong? She said I did not know. When you understand that that is, then it starts to go away; you can't go there and fix things. I am able to work from home.

And she said, how do you do this? She said we are going down the same road. And that is why I was sitting there waiting on her, waiting for this answer.

And this is where the whole "What is wrong? It is your problem" story starts to come up. In that moment, the question came up, because she was at home, they had done this, and she is at her house, they knew that. She said that is what she is going to do and how the answer must be.

I said, we must think together and then give her the answer. Saint Bernard said what we must do is to ask what is wrong. That was how it was in the beginning
