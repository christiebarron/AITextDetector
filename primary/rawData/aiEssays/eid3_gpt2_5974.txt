Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

The 'Rumble On' is the most important setting. It contains the most important things, such as the direction of travel in every direction, the rate of acceleration, the speed of an engine turning, what the rider should wear to get to their destination.

The setting's importance also changes significantly when the 'Rough Road Ahead' is enabled via the 'Use a bike map' option â€“ it adds an extra layer of information for cyclists to know about.

The setting has no effect on any particular part of the cycle, and for many a cycle is no longer a 'bike or buggy'.

There are many bikes in the running, but it is a good idea to be aware of who you are riding to because these are the most important variables in all of cycling.

In our tests the setting is very straightforward and works great all the time, but in practice the only people with very specific needs are those with different bikes, and it will take time, money and experience to determine the 'needs of my people'.

To determine how much you need this information it can help you to decide what to wear
