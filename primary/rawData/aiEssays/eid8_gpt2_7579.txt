One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was playing with my friends. You can't say I'm happy.

You may be a bit overanalyzed, but that wasn't my first memory of going on an after-school trip. I had recently been in California getting a couple of beers, and I was not happy with myself. I said to myself, "I'll go out and get some, maybe, an o-line at a bar, and I think I'll get lucky if we can find someone.

I never expected to go at all. I knew it would be a long night, I would have a few pints at the time, and I would leave, go buy a bunch of beers, and at the end I'd be gone.

You can imagine my excitement. I was actually planning on finishing all my homework at the end of the year. There was no real goal. I thought I had something to do at the time, and I was planning on doing this one for years to come, and I actually had to ask for the whole summer back.

It didn't take me long to realize that my day jobs were on hold. If there were any breaks that I worked out with, I would be back at work the next morning. I started looking down at my computer, looking for jobs. But there was no job. After working my way through high school and college, there wasn't one.
