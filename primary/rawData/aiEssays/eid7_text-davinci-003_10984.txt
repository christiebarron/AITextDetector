I was always an impatient person, so I decided to challenge myself to be more patient. I was in line at the supermarket, waiting to pick up my order, when an elderly gentleman cut in front of me out of nowhere. I must have been visibly annoyed because the man spun around and apologized to me. He explained that he was a few hundred dollars short for his order and was using some of the items he was waiting to buy to pay for it.

I was a bit taken aback, but I managed to keep my composure and replied with a kind smile. I told him it was no problem and offered him to jump ahead of me so he can finish paying without wasting any more time for either of us. He thanked me profusely before rushing to the register.

Seeing the man's predicament, I realized that, no matter how busy I was, I must always be patient and understanding of other people's circumstances. Ever since that day, I make sure to stay patient and tolerant in all my interactions; I'm thankful for the lesson I learned that day.
