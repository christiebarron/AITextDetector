The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it has a really good story, but it's very dark about the books at the moment. They're supposed to be a series, but they're written like a series. So after reading the book I thought, "This might help," so I think I'll do it. The books are like, a weird one-off thing. I love their characters. In a way they're so weird, but they're good stories from that point on.

What are your hopes for the series?

The book is in its early stages right about now, and it won't be a long run, but the books are fantastic. I love the story in its early stages and I will be reading its first episodes by the summer, but I don't think it's going to be in the middle of the big one. I think it will come, and it'll be a good show, but it won't be the best.

There's a fair amount of mystery here. When do you plan on keeping the mystery mystery on the books and how much do you think it'll cost? I'd love to know the most elaborate plans and details and how they affect the plot, but as it does a lot of the mystery in the book will be explained in the short run.
