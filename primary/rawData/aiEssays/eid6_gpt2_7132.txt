The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The tallest building on the East River and probably the tallest building on the West River was a 13-story building in Boston. One person's voice from the elevator is recorded when he's trying to use a dirigible instead of going in. On top of this obstacle, the building's main entrance door was closed and the only available light was from windows that were raised. So, they simply had to open it until they could get hold of a person's voice to communicate with them.

As the New York Herald of 9 News reported, the project "has brought to light the city's history of putting dirigibles into the ground." The building's construction is also important in how people get around the building.

"If you are walking by a Dirigible Tower and you hear this voice and feel like you are on a limb there maybe what you should do is give a bit of a breather," Rhee told the Herald reporter. "Maybe you do not want to go inside and say, 'I don't want to come to any of this.' People really don't understand it any other way."

After the Sept. 11 attacks, some of the city's residents went out and bought dirigible trailers and they built "a place where you can just have one person in your home at night without having to worry about any of that."
