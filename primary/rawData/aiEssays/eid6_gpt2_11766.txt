In addition 580,000 gallons of water and 19,000 tons of gas were used in the spill.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology ( gargantuan, "an acronym for "biggest water leak"), built by the National Water Quality Agency in 1991, was tasked with inspecting the leaking river of water at San Fernando River in what is now California.

The report notes that the water had turned into a "toxic mix" that could, in a very short time, become "mixed with the muddiness caused by other contaminants in San Fernando," such as benzene, propane and chlorine.
