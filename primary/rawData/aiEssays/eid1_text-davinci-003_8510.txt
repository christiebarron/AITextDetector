I remember the day that I had to take care of my little cousin, Sarah, for the day. She could be quite a handful and had a tendency to throw tantrums. I was exhausted from my day and just wanted to relax, but I had to stay patient and understanding. 

Whenever Sarah would start to get frustrated, I did my best to remain calm and talk her through it. When she was absolutely at her limit, I didn't scold or raise my voice, but instead, I took a deep breath and hugged her. 

At first, she continued to resist, but eventually, she calmed down. When she was feeling better, we played together and we enjoyed the rest of the day. 

I learned the power of being patient that day. Even in the most difficult situations, patience and understanding can make a huge difference.
