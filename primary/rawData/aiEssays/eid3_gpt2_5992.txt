Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. There are no new variables or settings that prevent what you're looking for out there, nor is it possible to change every single setting except one. All that is required is to adjust the setting of the "Highlights" in the table. And so that's some fun!
