As a technology enthusiast, I am writing this letter to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people.

In a world where technology is rapidly expanding, computers have quickly become an integral part of our lives. There is no denying that computers have numerous benefits. As most of us are working remotely, there has been a tremendous increase in online collaboration tools that allow us to connect with colleagues in real-time. Additionally, the ability to access information at the click of a button has, undoubtedly, streamlined our work flow and increased productivity. 

While computers provide many advantages, their use has some drawbacks as well. Increased exposure to computers can have a significant impact on the health and wellbeing of people. Excessive use of computers can lead to physical discomfort such as neck pain, eye strain, and headaches. It can also lead to mental health issues, such as depression, as people become increasingly isolated and lacks interpersonal connection with others.

Ultimately, it is important to be cognizant of the effects computers have on our health, and how we can mitigate them. It is recommended to take frequent breaks from our computer devices, as well as to engage in physical activities. Moreover, it is important to stay connected with our loved ones despite the physical distance, by scheduling regular video calls or other forms of digital communication. 

In conclusion, computers can be beneficial to us when used in moderation. I urge the readers to
