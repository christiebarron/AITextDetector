Itâ€™s an age-old dilemma that persists in libraries across the nation: should librarians censor certain materials? The issue of censorship in libraries is a highly contested issue that creates a deep philosophical divide between those who believe that offensive materials should be removed from public libraries and those who staunchly defend the freedom of expression. 

The counter argument is clear: people have the right to access all forms of information, even if that means library patrons may be exposed to materials they find objectionable. Should it be the job of librarians to decide what is and isn't offensive? Shouldn't it be up to the individual library patron to decide what is appropriate or not?

In my opinion, libraries should not be forced to remove some forms of literature, music, and films simply because they are deemed vulgar or immoral. Libraries serve an important role in our society by providing access to knowledge and information. By attempting to censor certain materials, libraries would be taking away this right to access information. Censorship could also be seen as a form of censorship of ideas and expression, a violation of the constitutional right to free speech.

Furthermore, libraries are about more than just access to books and materials. Libraries also foster communities and safe havens. By censoring certain materials, libraries would stifle the opportunities for members of these communities to express themselves, as well as the opportunity for different ideas to be shared and discussed. Libraries should be places of inclusivity,
