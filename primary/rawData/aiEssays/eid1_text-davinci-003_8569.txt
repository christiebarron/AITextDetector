I was telling my friend about a recent problem I was having with my car, when the phone suddenly rang. It was my brother calling to ask for a favor. He needed some help with his kids, since his wife was away that evening. I wanted to help, but I didn't want to leave my friend hanging.

So, I asked her if she would mind waiting a few minutes for me to answer the call. She said it was no problem at all and assured me that she would wait.

I thanked her for being so patient, and she smiled and said she understood. We ended up talking for about an hour before I ended the call and apologized again for holding her up.

The whole situation reminded me that even if we can't always control what happens around us, we can remain patient and understanding when others need us.

My friendâ€™s patience and understanding were truly appreciated that night.
