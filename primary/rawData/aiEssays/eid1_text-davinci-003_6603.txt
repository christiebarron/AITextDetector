Dear Editor,

As technology advances, computers have become an integral part of our lives. It is hard to imagine how our lives would be without them. While they can certainly be useful tools, I believe that the effects of computers on people can also be very damaging.

From a physical perspective, computers have increased the amount of time that people spend sitting down, leading to health issues such as obesity, poor posture, and pain in the wrists, arms, and neck. Research has also shown that long hours of computer use can cause eye strain or even permanent vision damage.

From a mental perspective, computers can have a negative impact as well. Spending long hours staring at a computer screen affects attention spans as well as overall cognitive performance. Additionally, spending too much time on computers can lead to issues such as depression, anxiety, and difficulty controlling emotions.

It is important to recognize the risks that computers can pose to our physical and mental health. We must stay mindful of the amount of time we spend on computers and keep ourselves physically and mentally active. We should make an effort to use computers as tools instead of allowing them to dominate our lives.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
