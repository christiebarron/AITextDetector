An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I got married. When I got divorced, we went from being great families of 2 people to the worst that we were ever going to be.

My husband and I used to spend a lot of time talking about the challenges of living on a $20/hr, $60 a month diet. My husband was so proud that I had never used the word "lack" in his name. He even admitted that he was the only one of his family who was able to afford it and his best friends were not. We used to spend an all-day day on the phone with other friends and get all of our friends back. "It's a $10 meal, why do you still get a $10 dish all days?" We would have a nice place to stay with our loved ones and we wanted to get there. We knew we had a lot of people wanting to get back together but we were unable to do it and our lives never would have been the same.
