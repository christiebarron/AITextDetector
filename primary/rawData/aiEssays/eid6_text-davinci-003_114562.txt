The Empire State Building has become a symbol of American ingenuity and ambition, attracting visitors from around the world to marvels from its remarkably modern architecture in New York City. Despite this, its construction brought a number of challenges, especially in relation to the unique feature of permitting dirigibles to dock. In her book ‘The Mooring Mast’, Marcia Amidon Lüsted shares this story of the obstacle builders faced in allowing these airships — or blimps — to visit the building. 

The idea to accommodate dirigibles docking at the building was first proposed by its chief designer, William F. Lamb. Although advanced for the time, the idea brought common concerns such as building stability, wind resistance, and safety. Thus the first obstacle faced by the builders was to address these concerns. To ensure the structural integrity of the building, Lamb suggested a system designed to reduce the weight of mooring. The mast would be installed up the middle of the tower, which would hold and move the dirigibles and signal aircrafts. The mast also included a number of guidance beams, providing the pilot with information about its location and distance from the building.

Although this was met with favourable opinions, the largest obstacle was the public’s response. The idea of dirigibles docking at a land-based structure was unprecedented and largely untested, meaning that their safety was unknown. To assuage public concerns, tests were conducted to evaluate
