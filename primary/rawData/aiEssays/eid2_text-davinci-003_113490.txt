Censorship in libraries has become a divisive topic, one that invites varying opinions and perspectives. Libraries should not be engaging in book censorship because the concept of what offends an individual or group is highly subjective and cannot be used as an effective criteria for determining content inclusion.

When it comes to censorship in libraries, the guiding principal must always be access to information. Libraries exist for the sake of knowledge, and restricting the availability of material deemed offensive limits its availability. This means that library visitors are denied information and opportunities to explore and form their own opinions regarding the material in question, thus denying them autonomy and freedom.

Moreover, censorship can shut down conversations about difficult topics and meaningful dialogue about literature's capacity to explore and represent diverse perspectives. Rather than censoring certain materials, libraries should be promoting reading material to a varied audience, encouraging controversial conversations, and educating individuals of all ages on the principles of open access to information.

Ultimately, the importance of free access to information should be prioritized by libraries. It is essential that library visitors are able to find a variety of material and develop their own opinions on the matter. Libraries should not be engaging in book censorship, as doing so is detrimental to freedom of expression and open access to information.
