The Empire State Building, one of the tallest man-made structures in the world, stands as witness to the capabilities of the modern age. Constructed from 1930 to 1931, the building was designed with the powerful idea of incorporating a mooring mast for dirigibles. Unfortuntely, the dream of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building would never become a reality. This essay will discuss the obstacles faced by the architects making the dream of a mooring mast a reality. 

The idea of the mooring mast was conceived by the owner of the Empire State Building, John Jakob Raskob. Raskob wanted the building to be the pinnacle of progress in the modern age and as such, saw the implementation of a mooring mast for dirigibles as a way to both facilitate air travel and to stand as a symbol of a bold new world. However, even at the time of its conception, there were issues that stood in the way of the dream becoming reality.

First, and perhaps most importantly, was the issue of laws and regulations. Dirigibles were seen as incredibly unstable by the governing bodies and as such, any attempt to create a point of mooring for these vessels was seen as potentially hazardous. This presented a major obstacle to the designers of the Empire State Building, as mooring mast concept was seen as potentially dangerous and thus had to be carefully reviewed. Furthermore, dirig
