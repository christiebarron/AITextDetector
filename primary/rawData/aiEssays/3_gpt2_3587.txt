Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

Rough Road Ahead

Rough Road Ahead is a setting that allows cyclists to pass vehicles and objects in the area at a high rate of speed.

It also allows the cyclist to use their hands, feet and head to navigate the complex route. It has been created by The Cycling Campaign for the Wellcome Trust. It is included here because it is one of those key ways the Government is trying to push the boundaries of cycling safety in our local areas.

Rough Road Ahead is an effect that you have the ability to control when you pass or turn and what you do. By following the rules for how you are supposed to pass, pedestrians can use their hands in other areas as well.

It is designed to make the driver of a motorcycle, or a motorist who is not involved, unaware of the location of you. If you do not have any hand signals in your hand area, this could allow you to pass the vehicle.

In order to pass safely around these features in their entirety, a vehicle needs to have a speed limit (see above) of 30 km.

This means that you use your arms, legs, hands and head to move in or out of a circle, through a closed section of a road, or through a lane.

With ROUGH ROAD AND RAIL, cyclists can walk safely across busy roads through
