Dear Editor, 

I am writing to share my opinion on the effects of computers on people and to persuade your readers to agree with me.

In this day and age, computers are a staple of everyday life. From work to leisure, computers make it easier for us to partake in most activities. However, as valuable as they are, it is important to recognize the risks that come with an overreliance on technology. 

The most important effect computers have on people is the potential for psychological harm. Time spent on computers has been found to be linked to impaired mental health. Social media, for example, can lead to reduced esteem, feelings of loneliness, depression, and decreased self-confidence. Additionally, depending on how people use their computers, some may become addicted to technology and have their sleeping and working habits disrupted. In extreme cases, withdrawal from technology can cause severe psychological issues. 

Therefore, as much as we may rely on our computers, itâ€™s important to recognize the harmful potential they have on us. Computers must be used responsibly to ensure our health and well-being. It is encouraged that people limit the time they spend on their computers and take regular breaks. Additionally, limiting the time spent on social media and engaging in other activities that do not involve screens is beneficial.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
