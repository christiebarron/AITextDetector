The idea of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building has been a long and winding journey with many obstacles in its path. In Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s “The Mooring Mast” we see how, even after numerous attempts, the idea of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building was unable to be realized.

One of the main obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the size of the mast itself. The mooring mast was initially planned to be 800 feet high, about half the length of the building itself. However, the cost of constructing a mast of such a height became too costly, and so the mast was shortened to only half the height of the building. This was simply too short for the dirigibles to dock with the building’s upper floors.

Another obstacle was the weight of the structure itself. Dirigibles are large, floating vessels filled with helium and hydrogen gas. To ensure the safety of such a large vessel, the mooring mast must be of a sturdy design. However, the weight required to construct such a sturdy mast was simply too great for the Empire State Building’s frame to bear.

A third obstacle was the increasing height of the building itself. Originally the Empire State Building was planned to be only 800 feet tall. However, as time passed and the building’s design was refined, the height was incrementally increased to
