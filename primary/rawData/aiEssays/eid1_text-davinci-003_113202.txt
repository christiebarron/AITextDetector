Dear Editor,

I'm writing to share my opinion on the effects computers have had on people in today's society. The use of computers helps enable us to achieve remarkable feats of productivity and efficiency, but its full extent has yet to be reached. 

At its core, computers aid people in accomplishing tasks quickly and accurately. Its speed and accuracy are two features that have become invaluable in the workplace and education. In the workplace, computers allow us to carry out complex calculations in seconds, streamline communication and data storing, and make it easier for people to collaborate on projects. In education, they give students access to a broad range of resources and open opportunities for further exploration and studying.

But computers have also had some adverse effects. The rapid development of technology has caused many people to become addicted to computers and computer games. This has led to an increase in health-related issues, such as strained eyesight, poor posture, and distractions from learning and work.

Overall, computers have and will continue to make our lives easier and more productive. However, it is essential that we take steps to address its potential negative impacts. We need to be aware of how computers can influence our lives and use them responsibly.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
