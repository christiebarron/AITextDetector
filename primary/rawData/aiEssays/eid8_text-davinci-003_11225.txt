I will never forget the sound of my mother's laughter. She had the most wonderful bell-like laugh that could light up any room the moment it filled the air. 

I was only five years old when my parents had their first major argument. Though I cannot remember why they had been fighting, I will never forget the way my mom's laughter brought an abrupt yet welcome end to it. 

My dad had been shouting and my mom had been trying to keep her composure and explain her side of the story when she suddenly just began to laugh. It started out as a small chuckle, but gradually became louder as her eyes lit up with mischievous delight. She had a twinkle in her eye as she started to tell a story about an incident that had happened at the supermarket the other day.

My dad was taken aback at first, but soon his face filled with amusement and the two of them burst into a fit of laughter together. The fight was forgotten as they laughed and I felt the tension leave the room, like a heavy fog. 

From then on, I could always count on my mom's laughter to break the tension and remind us of what was really important. It was like a warm blanket that wrapped my whole family in happiness and tranquillity. Whether it was over a silly joke or a sweet memory, her laughter served as a reminder of the ingridients that kept our family strong and connected.
