The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it's not just an introduction to literature.

In one of the most popular novels in English literature, J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter (1987), Professor McGonagall gives a detailed account of a spell cast on Albus Dumbledore, and a bit about why she's so upset about it.

Professor McGonagall has a history with witches, and the reason she thinks magic exists is that she believes it would be easy for them to know what they do not know or they shouldn't have understood.

One of the points of the above novel is that of the "witch in the closet", which may be why everyone on the school's staff knows about her (except the main character, who is actually a witch, and he only knows about the first two books of his second edition of Wizarding World of Harry Potter).

When I first heard about Harry Potter, I didn't realize how difficult it could be, especially with the series' last two TV series.

I haven't had a chance to play with the books yet, but I can't wait for the next book out of the library; it's a long journey (from here on), and I'm excited to read what I can find out about this brilliant and interesting world.
