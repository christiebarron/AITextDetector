An example of a time someone in my life was patient was seeing me in a hospital that day. The nurse's sister told to them that this woman has two-year-old syndrome and there's always somebody who can help. I was able to pull the person out of the hospital."

He later told Al Jazeera on Wednesday he believes many women are not ready to tell their own stories in order to "protect their children."

"It's been a long process for us. We've been able to get through it all because it's going to take the courage to bring up our story," he said.

Bryan Gulliver says he has an "almost impossible" time coming forward and having his sexual harassment investigated by his doctor.

"It's frustrating that I feel like we're being accused on a daily basis and yet these cases are treated as if their stories are something new to them. I don't know the truth but I know that there is a very real problem that I have in my body and in my mind. When you go up there and you experience trauma," he told AFP.

It's "unfair" that a woman is being accused, he says. "A woman cannot be accused of having sex with the man she is with. The woman is going through life knowing that her life is not the right one because she is in these circumstances and it's her life and that's why she will go to jail.
