One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was 13, so I didn't know much about children of color. My first reaction was to think that I'd never heard of black children. I felt like I did not belong in this group of people. And I don't know how to put that in myself, though I feel like it was worth mentioning at some point. My only feelings about this group of people are that I didn't know what they wanted to do, or who they were; and so I didn't even have an idea of who they were. I didn't know how to understand the people they were with, nor did I know how to teach them how to live life. This was not a typical life I'd experienced in life.

Then I went into social-work. I wasn't a social worker; my goal was to help the kids and help them learn to live without shame and stress. So, as I read a book that dealt with kids in the '90s that's about to be adapted for television, I got a kick out of knowing that it was hard for a lot of people to be white, or I was not white and thus didn't have any black friends at all. And so I felt really bad about it all and then I went into depression. It was quite early on and it lasted until later.

The book was a lot darker because I couldn't understand more. I didn't have any kids of color
