The idea of dirigible travel seemed glamorous and innovative in the late 1920s, so the construction of the Empire State Building included plans for it to accommodate airship docking. However, the builders soon realized that fulfilling this vision for the building presented a range of obstacles and difficulties.

The most pressing and obvious hurdle the builders faced was finding a suitable mooring point, or mast, to attach the airship's anchor to. The Empire State Building needed to reach a height suitable for large airships to dock, yet the fixed height of the building posed its own challenge. A number of alternatives for constructing an artificial mast were considered, such as attaching it to the side of the building or creating a mast to stand on its own, but none of them were deemed viable. 

The potential danger of airships docking on the Empire State Building was also a concern for the builders. It was important to make sure the airship was securely fastened, as any movement could set it adrift and cause it to crash into the building itself or surrounding neighborhoods. To try and mitigate this risk, they chose to design the mooring mast out of steel and include collet-type holders at the top in order to attach the airshipâ€™s anchor cable. 

The Empire State Building builders also had to account for the harsh weather conditions of New York City. Airships themselves were prone to damage in strong winds, so the mooring mast needed to be
