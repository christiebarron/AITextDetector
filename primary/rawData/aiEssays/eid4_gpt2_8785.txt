The other is that of Katayama (Kazuhiro Yamaguchi).

The world-building here will make you question why this book isn't better than the last few in terms of plot, structure and action. There are a number of plot holes here (more on them below), but the one that sticks out most on my mind is that Katayama has a little trouble believing he is actually a detective after learning his name, and to prove it Katayama simply turns into a very odd girl from another part of the world.

I did love and love this book, and I will miss the rest of it. But Winter Hibiscus is good!
