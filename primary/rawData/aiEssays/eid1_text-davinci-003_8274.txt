The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. When architects William F. Lamb and Starrett & Eken designed the building in 1930, they included a 200-foot tall mooring mast on the 103rd floor specifically for dirigibles. However, the mooring mast fell short of the needed height for airship docking, as ships of the era required a minimum of 1,000 foot masts for secure berths. This obstacle was further compounded by the design of the docked dirigibles, which were much bulkier and top-heavy than modern aircraft of the twenty-first century. Without proper precaution, such an aircraft would risk toppling into the city streets below due to excessive gusting winds and strong thermal updrafts.

In addition, the Nazi Party had become increasingly successful in their development of rigid airships during the 1930s, leading to concerns about whether any dirigibles would create a security issue for the city. Therefore, the mooring mast was equipped with an advanced cable-pulley system which would allow moving dirigibles to slowly and safely dock at the mast. Interestingly, in a testament to the strength of the architectâ€™s steel frame, it was found that the entire tower was able to sway less than two inches in the wind disturbances caused by heavy airships such as the Hindenburg.

Despite the obstacles of proper design and safe docking, the
