Dear [Editor],

As technology advances, the effects of computers on peopleâ€™s lives are becoming increasingly apparent. While computers undoubtedly bring convenience and greater efficiency to our daily lives, I believe that their use should be balanced in order to avoid potential negative effects on our physical and mental health.

On the one hand, computers can be invaluable tools for organizing time, researching information and enhancing communication - all of which are essential components of modern life. However, too much time spent on computers can lead to sedentary behaviors, poor nutrition and an overall decrease in physical health. In addition, extended computer use can lead to isolation, depression and a weaker sense of presence in physical environments.

These potential negatives underscore the importance of finding a balance between the use of computers and more traditional means of communication. I would suggest spending limited time on the computer and dedicating more of it to engaging with real people and actively participating in the physical world. Additionally, it is important to set realistic goals for activities such as online entertainment, research or communication.

Therefore, I believe that moderating the amount of time spent on computers is essential in order for modern society to maintain physical and mental wellbeing.

Thank you for your time and attention.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
