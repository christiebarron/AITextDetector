The Empire State Building was an ambitious feat of engineering when it was completed in 1931. Although the building was created with the purpose of providing a safe passage for elevator cabs, the visionaries behind the project saw an opportunity to expand its function through the installation of docking masts for dirigibles. Unfortunately, the installation of these masts was not without its challenges.

The first obstacle faced by the builders of the Empire State Building was the weight of the docking masts themselves. Dirigibles were very large and heavy, and with their unpredictable breeze patterns, a permanent mast needed to be strong and robust enough to withstand them. Secondly, a safe system needed to be devised in order to secure the dirigibles safely should they become airborne again. Lastly, the builders needed to ensure that the masts were situated in just the right spot so as to ensure that the dirigibles would be able to safely access the building's windows.

Another key obstacle facing the builders of the Empire State Building was the cost associated with such a major endeavor. Although a number of plans had already been proposed and accepted in the early years of the project, the sheer complexity of the task proved too expensive for anyone to implement. As a result, the development was stalled until further financial resources could be secured. 

Unfortunately, just as financial support began to be found, the Great Depression hit, and with it, the issues of reduced resources and labor. Despite these challenges, the
