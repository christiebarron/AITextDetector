The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One of the main challenges is the design of the main escalators. Both are designed with elevators at intersections to create an area that is not designed to accommodate the vehicle. The second major issue was the length of the escalator and how easily it could fall to the ground. However, many builders, in order not to damage the building, chose to build the stairs in which passengers will be able to ride. As a result the building still suffers from a problem of standing stilts.

One of the major issues with the Empire State Building was air conditioning, and if wind is not to blame it often causes the building to sit on windy days and raindrops. Also, the building was built in 1913.

The Empire State Building was built as an experiment that had all but failed over the last century. The result, being that the building took several years to complete, was a series of delays and design changes that would ultimately fail to make an impact Vizco would soon realize on behalf of the nation.
