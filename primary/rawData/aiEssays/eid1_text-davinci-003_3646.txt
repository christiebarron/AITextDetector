Dear Editor, 

I am writing this letter to share my opinion on the effects that computers have on people in this day and age. Computers have undeniably had a significant impact on society, both positively and negatively. On the one hand, computers have improved productivity and efficiency, providing people with new and better ways to communicate and access information. 

However, I want to draw attention to the potential negative effects computers can have on people, primarily because of addiction. With digital technology pervading our lives, it has become easier for people to be glued to their computers or mobile devices, rather than interacting with each other. Undoubtedly, this has a detrimental effect on people’s social lives. 

When people become increasingly dependent on computers, they may begin to experience signs of burn out and depression. We need to be mindful of these issues and recognise the potential risks of overusing technology. There are many things people can do to reduce their dependence on computers, such as going outdoors, indulging in activities which don’t involve screens, and moderating the time they spend on computers. 

In conclusion, computers have both positive and negative effects on people and it is important that we are aware of this. We should use computers responsibly and make sure we keep our technology usage balanced.

Yours Faithfully,
