I was on my lunch break in the park one day. It was a peaceful, sunny day and I was sitting on a bench enjoying my sandwich. Suddenly, an elderly woman stumbled over the bench and almost tripped.

I instinctively jumped up to help her, but she apologized and said she was okay. To my surprise, she then asked me if I could help her find her lost cat which had gone missing earlier. Even though I was running out of time on my lunch break, I couldnâ€™t say no.

The woman was very slow and sometimes needed to take a break, and I kept having to remind myself to be patient. After what felt like hours, we eventually found her little cat curled up against a tree. The woman was in a state of pure gratitude and thanked me for helping her.

I was so relieved that the woman had found her cat, but was also proud of myself for having been so patient during our search. It felt rewarding to help someone in need and I felt lucky to have been able to do it.
