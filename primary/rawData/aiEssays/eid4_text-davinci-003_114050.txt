The narrator of the poem is likely reflecting on their own life and the struggles of trying to understand and navigate their identity in a world that can at times be oppressive and unkind. They are looking to the coming spring as a symbol of renewal and hope, that with the returning geese and the blooming hibiscus plant they will find the strength to take that test again â€“ whatever that test may represent. The poem is ultimately about resilience and hope, that while life may seem difficult and confusing at times, the narrator will come back stronger and determined to find their own truth.
