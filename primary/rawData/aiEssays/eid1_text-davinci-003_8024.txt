However, an unexpected challenge came with the building in its incorporation of docking spots for dirigibles, also known as airships. While certain aspects of the building could be planned and calculated, the building’s ability to safely dock a dirigible posed a unique and troublesome task. The following essay will describe the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock.

The building already had offices, shopping centers, and an observation deck, so the designers decided to add docking slots so that dirigibles could also have the opportunity to dock.

The designers soon realized that there were certain mechanical issues they needed to take into account in order to make the docking of the dirigibles safe and efficient. Lüsted explains that the decision was made to attach a 600-foot steel mooring mast to the building with hundreds of steel guy wires for the dir
