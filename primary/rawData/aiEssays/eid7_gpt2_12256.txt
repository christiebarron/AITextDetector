An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the young woman who told me to tell her mom that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer. I didn't know what to do. Then a fellow student who was at a public school for girls had told me that this was a disease that was caused by an imbalance in the body. She said I should teach a girl that she was always breast-fed. And later the teacher told me that if she ever told or went to a meeting or that she was "all right" and had been to a doctor, that I should have used a condom. She didn't think I was a rapist. But I'm sure at some point a little girl has to give up one of her own because of what happened in her first grade class, and many parents are shocked when they learn they have a kid who has had both an illness and cancer.

That's just like what happened to a mom on one side of a fence in a country that seems to have a strong anti-gay stance and a history of discrimination. It's very hard for gay couples to come to terms with a child's sexuality, but in that same country, if you get married on Sundays because of your sexuality, your child will grow up to have an "addicted" homosexual child. When your parents say "no" to gay marriage, they're making a huge social change to the world because they've heard your parents say "stop it".
