Censorship in libraries is a controversial topic that continues to raise heated debates on both sides of the continuum. Most argue that itâ€™s a crucial way of protecting our children from inappropriate materials. However, some groups claim that censorship goes against the free speech of a democracy and limits the right of access to information. It is in this spirit of discussion that I present my argument in this persuasive essay in favor of censorship in libraries.

In many ways, libraries are a reflection of society and what is deemed acceptable. As such, it is important for libraries to control the materials their patrons can access. It can be dangerous to allow certain kinds of books, music, movies, and magazines to be widely available due to the messages they communicate or the potential impacts on kids. For instance, books containing explicit language or topics, such as sexuality or violence, can be damaging to younger readers and should only be made available to mature audience.

Limiting access to potentially offensive materials is just as important as having books, music, movies, and magazines available. Parents want to be confident that their kids are safe in library and know that their librarians are held to a higher standard. An effective way to ensure only appropriate resources are available to patrons is to implement a policy that requires libraries to censor certain materials and remove them from their shelves if they are judged to be inappropriate. 

It is my belief that maintaining censorship in libraries is critical for achieving a safe and educational environment
