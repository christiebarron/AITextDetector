The Empire State Building was built in the early 1930s with the ambitious goal of becoming the first building to have a truly functioning mooring mast to accommodate dirigibles. The sight of a large airship hovering above the Manhattan skyline was truly a marvel of modern engineering, and the potential for aviation had never felt so near. Unfortunately, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in achieving this feat, all of which must be taken into account to understand why the mooring mast never achieved its intended purpose. 

The biggest challenge the builders faced when coming up with their plan for the Empire State Building was the lack of space for a proper mooring mast. The building itself provided a tall, prominent structure upon which to build a mooring mast, but the summit was a mere tenth of an acre in size. This meant that for a large dirigible to dock, a complex maneuver would have to be performed taking into account the weight of the ship, the forces of the wind, and the size of the mooring mast. This was no easy feat, and there were also concerns over the potential damage to the building if a mishap occurred. 

Another major obstacle that stumped the engineers was the fact that the mooring mast had to be built on the low-rise roof of the Empire State Building, as the windows of the building's higher levels could not support the additional weight. This meant that the mooring mast
