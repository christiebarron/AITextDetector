The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first obstacle was that most of the bridges in those two towns had already begun to be replaced with solid steel lines. The new bridges and new structures made it difficult for locals to use dirigibles at any point, especially when they traveled by public roads. On September 19, the New York City Department of Transportation put those efforts behind the Empire State Building to move dirig studies down to the West Side attackers' apartment blocks in West Heights, a city close to the New York City skyline. The tower was still being constructed and no building was ready to become the Empire State Building after one day.

The first attempt to use dirigibles was made by building owner J.B. Jemisin in 1969. Building manager William Stapel built a small dome and an aluminum elevator to use in the building. J.B. worked with the New York Department of Buildings and a local contractor to design and build a new dome. The dome gave the Empire State Building a slight advantage when moving at much faster speeds than usual. The other major obstacle was a lack of maintenance on the building on September 25, when a fire broke out, and the building was temporarily evacuated.

Birds were sent from the Empire State Building two hours before the fire and were given a special security guard and a police escort after entering the building. It was only after the fire extinguished that the Department of Buildings began
