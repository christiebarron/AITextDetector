When construction of the Empire State Building was completed in 1931, builders hoped the building would become a world-renowned docking station for dirigibles, giving travelers an exciting new way to visit New York City. However, due to a variety of factors, the dream of mooring dirigibles to the Empire State Building never materialized.

One obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock was the unsuitable structure of the building itself. While it may have been possible for smaller experimental dirigibles to securely connect to the building, the Empire State Building lacked the wide, sturdy landing platform that was necessary for the heavier, commercial vessels. Additionally, the building was not designed to accommodate the safest way for passengers to disembark from the airship onto the building, which could have led to uncomfortable and potentially dangerous conditions.

Another obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building had to contend with was the unpredictable New York City weather, which did not provide the kind of clear skies necessary for dirigible passage. In addition to cloudy days and rainy weather, the Empire State Building is surrounded by high buildings, making entering and exiting the docking station daunting, if not impossible. Passengers onboard dirigibles would need to trust their captain to maneuver through the necessary airspace without incident.

The instability of the dirigible airship itself posed a third obstacle to the builders of the Empire State Building. These vessels are notoriously slow and cumbersome, even in
