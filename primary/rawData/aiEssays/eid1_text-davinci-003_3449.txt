Dear Editor:

I am writing to express my opinion about the impact computers have had on our society. In the last few decades, technology has taken over, and computers now play a vital role in everything we do. 

The advent of computers has had both positive and negative effects. On one hand, computers have benefited people in many ways. For example, they have made life more convenient, as we can now get more work done with less effort. They have also increased our access to information, enabling us to be informed and stay up-to-date with the latest news and events.

On the other hand, computers can also have negative effects on people. Excessive use can lead to health issues such as carpal tunnel syndrome, neck and back pain, and even headaches. Additionally, people who rely on computers for almost everything can become unproductive and lack the creativity or initiative to solve problems on their own.

Ultimately, I believe that computers have been beneficial to our society as they have provided us with great conveniences and increased our access to information. However, it is important to find a balance in our use of computers and to keep an eye on the potential hazards that can come from overuse
