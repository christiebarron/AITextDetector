I was on a long drive with my family to visit relatives. We had been in the car for hours, and the kids were getting restless. We were making a lot of stops along the way for food, restroom breaks, and sight-seeing. At one point, we pulled off the highway to get dinner, and I realized that I had left my wallet at the gas station we had stopped at earlier. 

At first, I was really frustrated and worried that the drive was going to take a lot longer now, but I tried to stay patient and calm. I had my family wait in the car while I walked back to the station to retrieve my wallet. On the walk back, I noticed there was a beautiful vista that I hadn't noticed before. Taking a deep breath, I reminded myself that this might be an opportunity to appreciate something during the journey and to stay patient.

When I finally returned to the car, my family was more than happy to wait for me and they gave me a round of applause. We continued our drive, and I was able to stay calm even under the stressful circumstances. Being patient had enabled me to take in the sights and sounds of the journey instead of worrying about getting to our destination as quickly as possible.
