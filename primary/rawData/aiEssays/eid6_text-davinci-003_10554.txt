Building the Empire State Building was a laborious and monumental task. Its construction began in 1930 and was completed in 1931, representing a marvel of engineering and an impressive steel and masonry structure. But designers had more than just the building itself to consider. To truly make the Empire State Building an iconic structure, the architects had an idea to incorporate mooring at the top of the building for dirigibles. After researching this idea, the group determined that the mooring mast would have to be 300 feet long, to ensure the safety of the airship.

The challenges of designing and building the mooring mast were considerable. For starters, the mast was to be made out of steel and anchored in reinforced concrete. This factor, coupled with the mast’s enormous length, made the mooring instructions and materials incredibly expensive. There was also the challenge of properly installing the mast. The instructions had to be specific enough to ensure the mast had the required strength and stability. Additionally, the mooring mast had to extend high enough to be securely anchored in the building’s steel skeleton, at the same time not protruding too much and obstructing the view of the New York City skyline.

Finally, core project engineers were not sure how well the reinforced concrete would adhere to the building’s steel skeleton. To make sure the mast wouldn’t be a hazard, further structuring improvements were made around the mast to strengthen the building
