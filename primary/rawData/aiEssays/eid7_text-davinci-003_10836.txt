I remember a time when I was running late to work. I had taken an extra 30 minutes getting ready that morning, and now I was scrambling to get out the door in time. As I pulled up to the train station, I realized that the train had already passed and I had missed it. I was frustrated and a little angry with myself, so I took a few deep breaths to calm down. 

I looked around and saw that two of the workers who ran the trains were nearby. I gathered my strength and approached them with a smile. I told them the situation and they kindly said that they could work it out. It turned out that they could stop the next train and have it let me out a few stops ahead of my usual stop.

I thanked them often for their patience and understanding. I was so relieved that I didn't have to take a detour and brave the city's public transportation. With their help, I made it to work on time.

That situation taught me that being patient and understanding, even during the most difficult times, can pay off. Instead of getting angry or frustrated in the moment, I was able to stay composed and approach the situation with calmness. It was a lesson I won't forget.
