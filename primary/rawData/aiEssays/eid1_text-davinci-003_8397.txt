 

I was having a very difficult morning. I had just lost my job and was trying to stay positive, but it was really hard. I went to the grocery store to get the ingredients I needed to make dinner. I was standing in line and the person in front of me seemed to be having a difficult time deciding what they wanted to purchase. 

I could tell they were a bit overwhelmed and I wanted to give them the space they needed to figure out what they wanted without adding any pressure on them. I waited patiently in line while they took their time. Finally, after about five minutes, they completed their purchase and I stepped up to the cashier.

Being patient in that moment was difficult but I'm glad I was able to give them the space and time they needed. It's moments like these where I try to remember that we each have our own struggles and it's important to be patient and understanding with those around us.
