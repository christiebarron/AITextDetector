Minfong Ho ends the poem with this line as a reminder that hope and renewal are always possible. The hibiscus will come back in the spring and bloom, and this symbolizes a new beginning for the narrator's future. The narrator will have the opportunity to retake the test that had caused them so much stress and anxiety. Though the narrator had previously been unable to face taking this test due to the harsh winter season, the new season brings new hope and future possibilities. Thus, Ho's poetic ending serves to encourage the reader to seize new opportunities and move forward with the optimism of new beginnings.
