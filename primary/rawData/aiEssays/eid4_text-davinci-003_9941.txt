At the end of the poem Winter Hibiscus, Minfong Ho is suggesting that the narrator will eventually take a test - presumably the test mentioned in the prior stanzas - when the seasons change and the snow has melted. The narrator associates taking the test with a certain time of year - the return of the geese, and when the hibiscus buds in the spring. Ho offers the narrator a way to look at the situation more positively, ending on an uplifting note and offering hope for the future. Ho is expressing that no matter the hardships that one faces, there will always be a time of change and renewal.
