I recently spent a weekend with an old school friend, catching up after just managing to set up a long-awaited catch up after several busy years. We spent most of the weekend laughing, reminiscing over funny memories and sharing stories of our lives since we were last in touch. 

In particular, I loved the moment when we were driving to the restaurant for dinner, and my friend suddenly burst out laughing after remembering something from when we were teenagers. The memory was so specific and vivid that it brought us both to fits of laughter. Despite covering our faces and pleading for a few moments of composure, neither of us could stop until the tears had cleared.

As we arrived at the restaurant, wiping away happy tears, it was clear that our laughter was infectious; other people in the restaurant were now looking at us and smiling. It was so magical to be able to make strangers smile just with a shared moment of laughter, and to realise the true power of a giggle to bring two people together. 

That moment of shared laughter brought us closer than I ever thought possible. As we feasted on delicious food and toasted to long-lasting friendship, it was all the confirmation I needed that laughter really is the shortest distance between two people.
