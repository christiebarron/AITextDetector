Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. It increases safety. It protects the cyclist, the driver who may be involved, and for the cyclist to keep going.

The "bad guy" and all the other bad guys are created by the driver's 'troublesome' experience. With all the "gaps," you will need to adapt.

In this video, I explain how to get your 'good' car up and running, because it also includes some tips for the long road ahead.

For more information and to get on the subject of how to adapt, check out Robert Z. Anderson's excellent article in the Cycling Weekly, The Changing Lives of Car Owners

The idea is for cyclists to go ahead and follow some rules that other road users have already understood: the right side of the lane will not be in any way unsafe. If a cyclist continues to follow those rules, he and the car will continue to cross, even if the car will not use the normal lane to go out.

The road ahead, at a minimum, doesn't need to be really difficult or dangerous, but it does need to keep you in front of the road, so I will not mention any rules in this article about changing the road ahead, unless you want to make some changes in your life for a while.

Bicycle traffic will also continue to make mistakes, which increases the risk of injury.
