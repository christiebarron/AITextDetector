The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it shows how people are used to the idea on the floor of the church. There is some overlap between the various events happening here and Winter Hibiscus. In addition it shows the power of a number of different religious traditions. In both cases it is done with the understanding that they are used equally well, and that the church doesn't just stay in place until certain events are reached. That allows it to do what it does, as in the case of the Winter Hibiscus. The fact that its story doesn't go into detail, or that the author couldn't find an English title that would help the reader to complete the story without sacrificing any of its historical structure is quite remarkable.
