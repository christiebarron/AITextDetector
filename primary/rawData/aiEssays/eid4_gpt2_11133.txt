The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because its world was filled with monsters. That's why this book is so well written and the story has so many twists. The setting is so well set up, the characters are well established, and the plot keeps to themselves. Also if I didn't get this book, it sounds like the plot might not have worked out as well as I would have loved. Still a good read, and I'm not going to say I won't have a repeat for this one.
