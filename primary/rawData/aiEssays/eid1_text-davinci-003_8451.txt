I was at the grocery store last weekend and the checkout line was incredibly long. I was starting to get a little annoyed because I was running late for my appointment. However, when I got up to the checkout, I noticed that the person in front of me had a complicated order. There were a lot of items and the cashier was having trouble scanning them. The person ahead of me didn't complain or get upset though, they just calmly waited as the cashier did her job. She kept apologizing to the person for the wait and they kept reassuring her that it was okay. After a while, the order was finished and the person walked away with a smile.

In that moment, I was so impressed by how patient they were. Life is so much easier if we're all a little bit more patient with each other.
