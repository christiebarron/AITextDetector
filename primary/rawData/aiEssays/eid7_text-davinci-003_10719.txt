I was volunteering at a homeless shelter when I encountered an elderly man who seemed reluctant to engage with anyone. He had a vacant look in his eyes and often appeared to be fighting off the interactions of strangers. As I worked to make conversation with him, I noticed he had clearly lived a full life and was anxious when completely unfamiliar people took an interest in him. 

I could sense his vulnerability and I lived it myself that sometimes I didn't want to be judged. I decided to take a more patient approach with him - one of quietly sitting with him and listening to whatever thoughts he wanted to share. I had the urge to bombard him with questions, but I chose patience and I was rewarded when he slowly began to open up about his life. 

It was a process - I had to spend several months visiting him, patiently waiting for the right moment for him to feel comfortable talking. In the meantime, I would sit with him, often in complete silence, and I could sense he was beginning to appreciate my presence. It was definitely worth it- he eventually opened up and shared so many meaningful stories about his life. I am so glad I had the patience to discover his treasured past.
