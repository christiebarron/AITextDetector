Dear Editor,

As someone who has seen firsthand the effects of computers on people, I feel compelled to voice my opinion on the matter.

Computers have become ubiquitous in our daily lives. Whether as a tool for work or a medium for entertainment, computers have changed how we live for the better. From touch of a button we can connect with people thousands of miles away. We can access a seemingly unlimited storehouse of information. We can accomplish things beyond our imaginings.

But with this power, the down side is that computers can often lead to isolation. Before computers, people were used to communicating with others through physical interaction. As computers become more and more available, we have become increasingly less likely to venture out of our homes and interact with others. This leads to further disconnection from the world around us, leading to feelings of depression and anxiety that can become overwhelming.

My suggestion is to limit the amount of time spent in front of your computer and get out into the world. Use it as the powerful tool it is meant to be, and leave room for the important things in life, such as connection with people.

Thank you for considering my opinion.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
