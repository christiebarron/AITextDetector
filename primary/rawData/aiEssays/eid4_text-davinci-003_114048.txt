This ending conveys a sense of hope that the narrator will have a better outcome when they retake the test. It creates a mental image of winter eventually turning into spring, which symbolizes the possibility of change and growth. The idea of the geese returning and the hibiscus budding also suggests that nature is moving forward as well; the narrator might take this as a sign of encouragement to move forward, too. This ending is optimistic and provides a sense of comfort and hope, which is fitting given the theme of the poem.
