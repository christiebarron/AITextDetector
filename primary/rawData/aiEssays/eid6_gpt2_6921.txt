The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, they had to build a structure around a building and hold it to some measure while building its walls. Then, the building builders faced several problems in how to connect the structure's ground floors with its floors, ceilings, walls and entrances, and this involved installing additional floors on both sides of the structure at intervals of several feet to compensate and improve height.

Many building designers thought they had something that everyone could use and were interested in making use of the technology. They had thought of the design of the building as being very simple and intuitive, and their concept of the building was very simple and easy to understand. It could use any type of glass, and the glass on which all the walls and floors were connected or used. And most importantly, the whole building had to have an air gap.


While the architect of the Empire State Building thought that we could make these structures, he had a problem with the way the architects looked at the architectural designs. The architects liked to look at architecture, and the architects thought that this information would take them by surprise, so they started trying to build, to show their designs to consumers. So, in July of 1958, the building company tried some of the more clever approaches to design a new, easy, easily accessible building, called the Empire State Building. And in the end, the building received a 3.5 million dollar project grant.
