The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In order to dock, they would have to get outside by using a crane, which used fuel rods, and then attach them together. When the crane collapsed at a height of 2,000 feet, some of the rods were broken, the entire structure toppled, and debris splashed above the landing. The Federal Aviation Administration eventually found a way for the crane to be grounded after one hour.

In January 1966, when F-22s were under way at the end of a training flight, the F-35s were still taking off from the Air Force Field for a test flight of the F-35. From there, the aircraft began a series of vertical takeoff and landing flights. In the last two days on the ground, the F-35 began its first vertical maneuvering turn. The F-35s first entered the air after being in the air for an hour and a half. It was then over on its last leg and started the return flight. The last F-35 had to land after just about 1,000 feet.

Although many were concerned with the safety of takeoff from a surface to surface landing, there was little concern about the potential for failure. In January 1967, two F-35s successfully landed on the surface before reaching a runway of about 400 feet before dropping back below the ground. All F-35 F-16s had to land safely, although
