An example of a time someone in my life was patient was after their dad was caught making the world the better place, that they would never forget what he'd done. There was a story told how he made me an album while I was away in the field for a field trip. He said, 'We're coming your way. You might have to make some money.' The record would be turned on, but he knew who he was and he'd make the album.'

Then the recording would come back so that he could take it home. He told me how it was done. I was working through that, so my friend, who had helped me when I was with New York magazine, had recorded a documentary about him. 'Then he wanted to make a song. He felt in love with the work and did a song about that.' And he made one and that was his last album. The one that was really good was a very unique song entitled, 'Equal Opportunity.' It wasn't his first album. We had worked with him a couple times. He loved this song and it was about the same thing. He got married last year [to his wife] Charlotte.

How did you feel about that story? You got involved, you met Charlotte.

There were a couple of guys that were interesteddeveloped on it, but they weren't ready. They didn't want a record. They didn't want to do anything. They wanted to get paid.
