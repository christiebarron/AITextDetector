These possibilities have been discussed at length in many papers from recent years. The question of who holds copyright in libraries is not that that should be up for debate. Even if the legal system was completely dismantled, then if the copyright system was abolished, it would still be possible to make a law regulating such a activity. For example, in the Netherlands, two individuals control or hold copyright on some books (e.g., Kjartan). In a separate case, another individual holds copyright for a publication in a foreign country (e.g., St. Vincent), and these books are now outed because of a mistake committed by Kjartan.
