Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. One of the major difference lies in the way the setting is chosen. This change is especially noticeable when considering the 'Road' section that's given to riders in the short 'Gather', where they can gather around the 'Roads', which are a bunch of dirt roads and hills connected by a high point.


While both 'Road' and 'Gather' can be described as a long list of roads that link various parts of the city (or, as is often the case, some parts of a city), those roads provide only a short selection of the types of road to be found throughout the city on the map. A few of the maps above are taken from my 'Road Map to the City' (http://www.dontgo.com/ROB/citymap/roadmap), and some in the 'Great Roads' section of the 'Road Map to the City' (http://www.dontgo.com/ROB/citymap/GreatRoad) make use of similar terms. As with so many of the factors affecting the cycling experience at the end of the day, the following sections of the 'Road' section are as follows: roads where the cyclist moves in close proximity to them. streets that are very close to the intersection in the same way there are roads with just the right number of cars on them.
