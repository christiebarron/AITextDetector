The construction of the Empire State Building and the introduction of dirigible docking marked a watershed moment in modern architecture and movement of people around the world. The project was ambitious, and the obstacles faced by those who wished to make it a reality were daunting. In the book “The Mooring Mast”, Marcia Amidon Lüsted recounts the struggles faced by the Empire State Building’s builders. 

For starters, the ambitious project needed a great amount of financial resources to be completed. The team of builders, led by Pierre Charles L’Enfant, went through numerous investors to eventually raise the necessary money. This alone was a tremendous challenge given the scale of the endeavor. However, the feat seemed mundane compared to the technical challenges they faced in allowing for dirigibles to dock at the building.

The biggest issue the builders faced was the fact that their original plans did not account for space for dirigibles. This meant that the team had to calculate how much space they needed to reserve for the dirigibles, how much additional load the building could support, and how much in taxes the building could sustain due to the presence of the dirigibles. All of these considerations had to be taken into account while also ensuring the engineering remained sound. 

The team then had to deal with the ever-present wind patterns that would affect the dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building. To aid with this, L’
