The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is so palpable that you think perhaps the novel ends up being an excuse for how important it is to get out of the box. The only reason we write this book is the love of a book.

While I'm sure that most of the books that have made the rounds since the success of Stranger Things have been novelists who are inspired by or in part inspired by the things they read, the novel of Stranger Things is as much an autobiography as a memoir. The novel, once written, is the catalyst between the book being written and the book being told.

And why don't I get to write about Stranger Things? Because, honestly, I think it would be fun!
