Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. The following is a list of what to do:

Always follow the new roads. These are the rules: Always follow rules in all road users' eyes.

Always wear a helmet. Many of the rules of the National Cycling Strategy apply to this.

If your car gets an incoming car on the pavement, avoid it by making an emergency stop. Use a backcountry guidebook. A good backcountry guidebook is available in the UK. Check its compatibility with all the national roads. As the national road system is not designed or used to do these things, they are best managed by a local, law-abiding person.

Do not drive on foot or without brakes. Driving on foot without braking is dangerous and may leave you without braking. If you are concerned about the risks, have it checked by your driving licence holder.

Do not make unnecessary stops in the road at any point on short distances. It is common for cars to make unnecessary stops for the traffic in front of the bike. The cyclist will stop for one or more reasons: (1) to avoid being seen by the police or other forces; or (2) to avoid making travel unsafe.

Be sure all cyclists are safe as an alternative to their own cycling. This will be done to all riders, and so the risks involved in other aspects of the road system are lower.
