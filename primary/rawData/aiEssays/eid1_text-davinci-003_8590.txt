I recently had an experience where I was forced to practice patience. I was waiting in line at the grocery store when the customer ahead of me was having trouble locating their card to pay. The cashier was being polite and patient with the customer while they searched through their wallet. I could sense the frustration in the air, but I was determined to stay patient and understanding.

The customer eventually found their card, but not before getting help from the customer service representative. Despite it taking longer than expected, I remained patient and didnâ€™t get frustrated or angry. I understand that simple things like looking for a card can be frustrating and I didn't want to add to the situation.

Although it was hard to remain patient, I am proud of myself for not taking my frustration out on the customer or the cashier. Instead, I just gritted my teeth and waited for my turn. At the end of the day, I was proud of my patience and levelheadedness in this stressful time.
