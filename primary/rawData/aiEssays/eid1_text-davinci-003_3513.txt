The topic of censorship in libraries is one that divides people on both sides of the argument. On one hand, there are those that believe books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from library shelves even if they are found offensive, as this is a violation of freedom of speech and the freedom to read what one chooses. On the other hand, there are those that believe that certain offensive materials should be removed from library shelves to protect the public. 

I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from library shelves if they are found offensive. This is because it is our right as citizens to have access to diverse expressions of culture and literature, even if that includes books which may be deemed offensive. Censorship deprives us of our right to think and speak freely and it denies readers the opportunity to make their own decisions about what materials they want to read and watch. 

Furthermore, censorship in libraries can also be a slippery slope. If we accept that libraries can censor materials that are deemed offensive, then who decides what materials are seen as offensive? It is impossible to draw an objective line between what is offensive and what is not. Laws and definitions
