The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. While they intended for them to move the tower closer to the crowd, they wanted to make it as small as possible so they could be able to see out into the open. Despite their design limitations, their decision to keep the Empire State Building as small opened up a plethora of designs with a variety of styles that helped make each piece fit. It was not until the 1920s that the tower became the highest tower in England and the earliest example of a dirigible on display at the State.

In 1920, the Empire State Building opened for the first time, where an elaborate 3,500-foot sculpture, which was part of the original Empire State of New York, was set up before visitors from around the world were let in. The Empire State Building was designed by the architect Norman Kornhaber and constructed on 3,000 acres of open earth and exposed ground, but as it went along, the towers moved. In a very short span of time, the building grew into an enormous tower that sat around 7,000 feet above sea level. In 1920, a 6,500-foot dome was added that would accommodate 7,000 people during the day. As these new tower developments came to live, the original Empire State was renamed as the City State Building and now sits in the Center City of North Greenwich.
