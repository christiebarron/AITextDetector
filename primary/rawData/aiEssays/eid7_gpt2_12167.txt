An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the one who decided to quit smoking, because he felt that smoking would get him out of trouble. That is the same person who told me that he was going to quit smoking after seeing a movie. He felt that he'd be able to quit without anyone hearing it. That is not what we are trying to help.

Why do we see this as the first step towards a smoking cessation program? There are still many avenues still under way. While abstinence is still a viable option for a vast variety of problems, abstinence should be taught on the job rather than being taught on a classroom floor.

For many people, the concept of abstinence is a very difficult concept for them to grasp. Most of us might think of it like a bad doctor who spends the day prescribing drugs, and then prescribes abstinence for a few days.

So, let me be clear:

There is no cure for cancer.

The best way to start a healthier lifestyle is to not consume more than you need.

Do what's right for your body.

Read the book. Do what's right for yourself.

Let her be your guide and help her make the right choices. Don't act like nothing's happening.

Now you might think that this is just a "no" to you unless you think very seriously about quitting smoking.

Not so. We must not just stop smoking.
