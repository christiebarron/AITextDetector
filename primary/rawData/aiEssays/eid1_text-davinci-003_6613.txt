Dear Editor,

I’m writing to share my opinion on the effects computers have on people. I believe computers have been a great asset to society and have done a lot to improve our standard of living. They have allowed us to do more with less time and effort, enabling us to be more productive.

However, the use of computers comes at a cost. Excessive use of computers can lead to physical ailments such as 'text neck', where the user spends prolonged periods hunched over a desktop or laptop, and 'computer vision syndrome', resulting from the strain placed on our eyes from spending too much time staring at a screen. Additionally, social isolation can be triggered by over-reliance on computers, as the use of social media can take away from time spent interacting with family and friends in-person.

On the contrary, when used in moderation, computers can aid one’s health. Improper posture while sitting for long periods of time can be remedied by the use of a chair with proper ergonomics. And the use of communication platforms like Skype helps people to stay in touch with each other and build stronger relationships despite geographic distance.

In conclusion, I believe that computers have both positive and negative effects on people. So, it is important that we use computers responsibly in order to reap the most benefit from them.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
