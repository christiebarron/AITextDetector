The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is one of dread, of confusion, of a sense of loss, of an end, of uncertainty. From a person's experience, it's an eerie and chilling experience.

A few months later, a little-known Norwegian blogger named Michael Koppe wrote a blog with the slogan, "Nah, this is normal. This is life." It's the start of the final stages of our collective collapse. The first part is complete; everything is set in motion, and the rest of the story is in full motion. No one wants to talk, and everybody should just stay together or perish.

What we do this time is very similar to what happened in our world. We die. All our bodies are dead. One day, the best of us, on a mountain by the seaside, will turn from sadness into despair; the other day, all our lives will follow. And finally, you do not die. You just leave, and you go on, in a happy state, looking for the future. Then there's one day when you will walk your best in your life again. At that moment, there is no turning back from everything that has happened, and it is time to face the reality of death.

If you want to know how to escape the real horrors of death, then "From Home" is a great book. But be smart, be patient. But do not leave it
