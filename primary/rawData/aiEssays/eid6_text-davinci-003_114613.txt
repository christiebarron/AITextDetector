The building of the Empire State Building was a monumental feat during the early 20th century, resulting in an architectural icon of the industrial age. However, what makes the Empire State Building one of the most unique was its inclusion of a mooring mast on its roof, to be used for docking airships. This ambitious plan faced many technical and engineering obstacles that had to be overcome for the project to be successful.

The first obstacle was the design of the mast itself. The mast had to be tall enough for an airship to dock appropriately, while also being stable enough to withstand the wind and movement generated by the docked airships. The mast was designed to be 200 feet in height, with two large spreaders at the top resembling a ship's mast. It was also reinforced with steel cables to regularize stress, while heavier cables were used to provide support further down the mast. The mast also featured a series of lights at its summit to help airship captains accurately gauge their distance from it and dock safely.

In addition to the design of the mast itself, there was also the nearby structures that had to be taken into consideration. Since the Empire State Building was located in New York City, its airspace could be particularly dangerous for airships due to the close proximity of surrounding buildings and landmarks. As a result, measures were taken to ensure that the mast would be kept clear from any other nearby structures. This meant that a path large enough for an airship to
