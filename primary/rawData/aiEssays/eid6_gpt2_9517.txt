The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. It would require that they are mounted with the main-mounted brake, meaning that the weight of each brake had to fall into the ground. Thus the builders must have used the hydraulic system with the brake mounted, rather than simply mount the brake wheels through the main-mounted brake, which would cause a lot of noise when the car was stopped and had to be rehoused by the wind and car power. The brake system was also not a smooth system, with a lot of noise and vibrations when the vehicle was stopped. Additionally, the brakes were not always stable and were subject to vibration or tainting when the vehicle was parked on the ground, which would cause the wheels to be much further apart from the control wheel area.

According to Dr. Gertzer, a new generation of rear-engined vehicles will need to be designed or engineered to meet all these issues. A new approach to the problem of wheel stiffness and high stiffness surfaces requires a completely new approach, according to Dr. Gertzer. To use our new techniques, a high-strength steel-fiber localized layer on the wheel is placed above and below the brake rim. This is used to absorb energy while rotating and to prevent that mass that can come to a close with each wheel movement. This process is accelerated by a strong, non-stick layer of steel to prevent any vibrations within the friction surfaces that might
