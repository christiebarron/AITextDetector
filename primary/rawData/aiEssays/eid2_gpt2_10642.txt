I believe that censorship of materials in libraries could encourage creativity and innovation (including in the areas of literature, art, science, and architecture)."

She added: "It is important for me to be clear - it is not true that censorship is a bad thing, it is good news, and should be welcomed. But we need to take seriously the fact that our media culture is becoming increasingly obsessed with the word 'censorship'. The word 'censorship' means it has been used more as a term at best and worst. It is not the intent, however, of our leaders, and we must fight against it. There is a sense that for all the news media, there is no truth that anyone cares about.

"... The word 'censorship', in itself, does not mean that the word will not be heard. There is something very sad about the way that the media is being run. We priggishly believe the most important part of the media environment is to remain free - and to make a decision on which media to publish."
