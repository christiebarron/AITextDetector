As far as the amount of time it takes cycling across these corners, it is a true 'good-for-you' thing, so this will definitely change. A good example from this example would be from the final lap of the round. We could imagine a cyclist cycling through the line like we see from an Olympic gold medal. But if such a cyclist was in the last lap, the cyclist has been hit a lot.
