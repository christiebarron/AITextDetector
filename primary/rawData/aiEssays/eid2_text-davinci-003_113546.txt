It is an age-old debate: to censor or not to censor library materials. Of course, no one wants to limit access to important information, and the library should provide a wide range of resources. However, as libraries have grown in response to the public’s need for knowledge, they have begun to offer materials that many consider inappropriate for a public institution. It is important to consider the wide range of patrons that a library serves, and to recognize that certain materials could be damaging to the sensibilities of some.

Many parents, for example, are concerned about the impact of vulgar books, movies, and magazines on their children. The library’s role in society is to provide educational resources, and therefore it is not appropriate to offer materials that contain sexually explicit or violent images and themes.

Further, libraries must ensure that the materials they offer reflect the principles of a mature and progressive society. Just as we do not allow hate speech on our streets, it is important to protect our library patrons from offensive materials that advocate racism, sexism, or religious or political ideologies.

Finally, it is important to consider the taxpayer’s money that is spent on the library, and how it is used. While libraries must provide educational resources, their focus should be on the benefit to the public. If taxpayers feel their money is being misspent on materials that are offensive and inappropriate, they should be able to express their concerns to the library.
