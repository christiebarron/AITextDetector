Censorship in libraries is a controversial subject that should be discussed more often. Although it can be argued that some materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines contain material which are offensive, it should not be the job of libraries to decide what is right or wrong. 

The primary purpose of libraries is to provide access to all types of information. If materials are found offensive or inappropriate, they should be labeled, not removed. By labeling materials and alerting patrons of potentially objectionable content, people can make an informed decision as to what they decide to check out.

Furthermore, removing books, music, movies, or magazines is essentially stifling free speech, something that is an integral part of a democracy and should not be restricted. If libraries are presented with a challenge to the presumed truth or appropriateness of a certain book, movie, magazine, or song, it should be addressed immediately. A library should foster an environment of open dialogue and allow patrons to be informed on a variety of topics.

Therefore, libraries should provide access to as many materials as possible but label those materials as controversial and potentially offensive. Libraries should not serve as the gatekeepers to societyâ€™s accepted norms and values. It should be up to the patron to make the decision as to what information is appropriate for them.
