The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' by Guggenheim and his friend Wolfgang Bergmann, and a decade's worth of interviews, interviews and essays on the lives of writers, is set to end after this year's Cannes Film Festival.

Guggenheim, who is director of the film-maker Faire du Film, also stars in the documentary 'The Film of the Year', alongside the German-born and Dutch-American filmmaker Hans Zimmer.

The film - in collaboration with his friends Wolfgang Bergmann, Karl Duesmann, Georg Jentzel, Paul Miercken and Kateryna Holguin - will be released on Tuesday, 20 June from Cannes.

The film will follow Kateryna, her mother and father in Sweden as they take part in the Cannes Festival on 2 April where a number of Oscar-winning actresses will take part for the first time. It will also be broadcast in English on a select European television broadcaster.

Film-maker Faire du Film will also broadcast a special feature film entitled 'All About The World With Women of Film, 2015'.
