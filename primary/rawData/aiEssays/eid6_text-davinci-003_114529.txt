The construction of the Empire State Building in New York City presented a unique challenge in its early days: how to allow dirigibles to dock on the building’s rooftop. While the building’s height and unique observation deck made it the perfect location for docking dirigibles, the builders of the Empire State Building needed important engineering achievements in order to make their daring plans a reality.

The height of the Empire State Building posed the most obvious challenge: at 1,454 feet tall, the building was nearly twice as high as any other in the world. Constructing a stable and reliable mast for dirigibles to dock on over such a great distance presented a major engineering feat, which the building’s designers and architects were able to achieve. In order to make the rooftop mooring mast strong enough to withstand the forces of a dirigible docking and undocking, they had to reinforce the entire structure of the building with steel and iron girders. Additionally, they had to develop a unique pulley system to allow the dirigible to latch onto the mast from up high.

The wind also presented an obstacle to dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building. In order to keep the dirigible from being blown around and off-course while it was docking, the builders equipped the mast with a system of weighted wires attached to the building’s steel framework. This “wind-sock” system was designed to counterbalance the
