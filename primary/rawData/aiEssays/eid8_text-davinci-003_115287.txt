I can still remember unmistakably the first time I ever saw my now best friend laugh. It was freshman year of college and although we were already good friends, the moment was one I will never forget. We had been walking to get dinner on the college green and were discussing some of the hilarious moments we had experienced going on around campus since the start of the school year. Apparently, I had said something that particularly struck a chord with her and she let out an uproarious laugh that, in the moment, seemed like it came from the bowels of the earth. I had never heard her laugh that way before.

We both instantly burst out into spontaneous laughter, and for that moment, nothing else mattered. We were so engrossed in our own merriment that we eventually stopped walking and just stood there, laughing. Before we knew it, we ended up getting some funny looks from the passing students, which only made us laugh even harder.

As I look back on that moment, I feel a sense of immense gratitude to have been able to connect with my friend the way we did that day. To me, it was completely empowering to not only cause laughter in another person, but to have it reciprocated and shared.

Sometimes the simplest things in life can bring us closer together, and that day I realized the power of laughter.
