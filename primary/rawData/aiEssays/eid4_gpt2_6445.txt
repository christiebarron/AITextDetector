The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because "one will become a true man" in the way he is able to "become the best" of the gods, which is to say, how to be a god-master. The book provides for a world where one is all he is, an even better idea than a fantasy book in order to develop character of this sort, for example, the one described in The Legend of Jor-Grom. But he also gives us an even better idea too, one which has been described many times in many different books of the past, and that is that all the gods as they are describe themselves in "good ways" and are "in an even better way."

There is also something very special about the way in which the Book of Mormon portrays Jesus Christ. In fact, the only thing Jesus could compare to other gods that we know of today is Satan, who he had to convince on his deathbed. One could argue that Jesus must have been very similar as Christians (and the only thing other than Satan that we know of is Satan), because Satan was told literally at the time of his death, and in this way, the only god they want us to know about is Jesus, who the Book of Mormon does not have to convince on his deathbed because he is so similar to Jesus. And Jesus is the only god, in some ways, the Book of Mormon has not to convince on his deathbed
