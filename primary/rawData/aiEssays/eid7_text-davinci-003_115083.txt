I had to be patient the other day when my friend and I went to the movies. We had arrived 15 minutes late, so we were unable to get the tickets for the movie we wanted to see. The ticket office was swamped with people, so we had to wait patiently in line for about an hour before we got our tickets. Despite the fact that we were running late, I was determined to stay patient and not lose my temper. I knew that the person at the ticket office was doing the best they could with the large numbers of people wanting tickets. 

When it was finally our turn, I kept a calm, friendly demeanor, using my courteousness to help ease the situation. To my surprise, the ticket office manager was so impressed with my attitude that he offered us complimentary tickets to the movie we wanted! As my friend and I left the theater, we felt relieved and satisfied that I had decided to be patient in a challenging situation.
