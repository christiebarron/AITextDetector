I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a major obstacle to understanding both the nature of human creativity and creativity. In particular, the ability for individuals to understand and draw upon the human creativity for creative destruction is limited to individuals who are creative at their very core. In addition, if the freedom of speech is to be protected, then there must be sufficient protection from what is essentially censorship to prevent harm to the individual from those who would be offended. To address the "problem of censorship" in a society to which any kind of free speech is possible, and in which political restrictions have nothing to do with individual expression on a particular issue, we have asked the question: Is censorship really necessary? At this point we believe that it is absolutely necessary and are not afraid to give people tools they are better equipped for learning and for doing what others do. To the extent that political restrictions have nothing to do with individual expression on an issue, that is also true only if they are necessary to keep them there in an organization whose purpose is to promote that individual's particular idea of the world or a particular belief by the group. In the same way, to provide tools for others to pursue their own ideas will necessarily be to make it so that they will have the tools necessary to carry out that action.
