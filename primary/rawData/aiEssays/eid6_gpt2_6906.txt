The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

One obstacle concerns a lack of space for the two main elevators, and could mean an opening at the south end. But the bridge design includes a one-way elevator, so it can be built even farther down the length of the building.

Another obstacle may be the removal of the first two elevators. In order to do this, the designers are hoping to install two additional elevators (known as girders) which will hold cargo, so the two elevators are not going anywhere. The company is considering building further to help ease the space and reduce stress on the building.

But there are still some obstacles, including the height of the two elevators, the opening mechanism on the building itself and the location of the top-floor garage that sits below the garage.

This would have been a major setback for the city of New London, and potentially a major blow to the property value of the Empire State Buildings in New York. As is the case in so many other developments, there would have had to be a way to change the building if that location were removed.

According to a report from the New York Times, the developer plans to place a building to replace one in the Queens borough. When completed, this would have given New London a more complete view of Manhattan.
