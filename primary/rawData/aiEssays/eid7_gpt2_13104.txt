An example of a time someone in my life was patient was watching him try to pass the ball on the first play (1st and 12 from 1 yard out). I just thought he just wasn't able to take anything off of me, and I didn't know what he was thinking. He saw half-steps, and I was like, 'this is so bad!.'

"Then he told me, `Why don't you give me the ball, and I'll pass the ball on the next play; and I'll be a good long ball!' He was one of those guys who had that kind or the passion to play basketball. I said, 'I can do that.' He was really passionate for basketball â€¦ so we started talking about it."

The Knicks still were playing without Paul, but the idea of being a part of something so special had to begin with.

"I think that's when we knew we were going to have to start doing something special," he said. "This is great to me for that, it's great to watch. It's an awesome environment just watching that. It's a great opportunity you can have and it's going to really help us get those five-pointers they were looking to get this year. I'm just so proud of that."
