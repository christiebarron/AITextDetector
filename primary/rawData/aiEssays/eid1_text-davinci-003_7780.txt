In From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso Rodriguez’s memoir paints a picture of his childhood and the qualities that make up his identity and life. Throughout the book, reactions to his heartbreaking upbringing take up a lot of the reader’s attention. He talks about a deep sense of loneliness and the need to explore creativity as an escape.

The mood created in the memoir is one of both somberness and joy. The author recounts his childhood struggles of being a first-generation immigrant in the US without a stable, secure home environment. He speaks of his mother’s absence, his father’s troubles, and the monetary challenges his family faced. These moments of sadness and hurt saturate the pages.

But, amidst the pain, there is also a sense of hope and possibility. Rodriguez narrates his success story and the determination that pushed him against hardship. He speaks of the influences of his family, friends, and passions — reminding the reader that although his plight was difficult, he was still surrounded with the loving support of others who helped him foster his identity and achievements.

To crown this mood, Rodriguez speaks of his appreciation for fashion and how it helped him express different facets of himself. He portrays his fashion journey with posts of his original designs and the stories of people who have worn or been inspired by his work. These parts of the memoir suggest that, through the depths of fragility, strength is possible.
