The ending line of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho serves to emphasize that life is an ongoing cycle, and no situation or test is ever completely conquered. Even at the end of winter and the death of the hibiscus, nature will begin again in the spring, and the narrator will have to face the same test, perhaps even more difficult. It is a reminder that life's tests never really end and a person must always strive to improve in order to meet the challenges life will bring.
