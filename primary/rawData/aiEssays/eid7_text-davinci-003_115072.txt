I was volunteering at a local soup kitchen during the holiday season when I noticed a family struggling to get through the line. They had quite a few kids in tow and it was clear that money was tight. As I watched the mother try to explain their situation, her patience began to wear thin as the volunteers insisted that they could only get the standard meal. 

I knew in my heart that it wasn't enough for a family of their size so I decided to step in and help. I talked to the volunteers and explained the situation. It took a lot of time but eventually they agreed to let the family have double portions for each of the children. 

Everyone was grateful, especially the mother who thanked me for understanding and being so patient. It was a simple act of kindness but I felt really good knowing I made a difference.
