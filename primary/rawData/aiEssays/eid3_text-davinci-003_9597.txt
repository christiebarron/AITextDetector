The setting of Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead" has a powerful effect on the cyclist's experience. The cyclist is most notably affected by the harshness of the terrain and the desolate, abandoned landscape. The rugged, mountainous terrain makes the road very difficult to traverse and the biker must make constant adjustments to navigate the hazardous road. The darkness of the night and the lack of visibility create a sense of danger and a great challenge for the cyclist.

The desolate landscape serves as an additional source of danger as the cyclist has no shelter from the elements and no help should he become injured. The absence of human interaction further heightens the sense of danger for the lone cyclist.

This bleak and rugged terrain also lends an air of despair to the biker's experience. This is further compounded by the fact that the cyclist's only companion is a bottle of beer. The lonely roads and lonely cyclist align with Kurmaski's themes ofisolation and self-discovery.

By creating a setting that is physically difficult and hostile, Kurmaski establishes a unique atmosphere for his cyclist. The perilousness of the route forces the cyclist to focus on his journey, and the loneliness of the setting increases the importance of the cyclist's inner struggles. Ultimately, the setting of "Rough Road Ahead" contributes to the cyclist's isolation and introspective journey.
