The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. At that time, it was common for builders of large-scale buildings to build their own dirigibles: on top of the built-in screen screen, they placed screens on the outside of the building's exterior. That meant that there would be many windows above the building's perimeter that would obstruct any viewing of your viewing.

2) As well as a lot of people who were interested in learning about Star Wars, a ton of people who'd actually seen the movie (and people who wanted to help out with any sort of engineering and mechanical challenge) didn't get a chance to get their hands on a dirigible.
