The ending of Minfong Ho's poem, "Winter Hibiscus," culminates in a statement of hope and resilience. The speaker's closing lines signify acceptance and a readiness to move forward with courage and strength, no matter the outcome. Through the metaphor of the Winter Hibiscus, the speaker suggests that she (or he) has found a way to accept, even embrace, the difficult journey before her: to attempt something that has been deemed impossible. The ending is a testament to the speaker's belief that the passage of time and the natural cycles of life will bring about healing and growth. The hope that she will be able to take the test again in the spring also serves as a declaration of her faith that the winter will pass and the spring will come, that her strength will not falter and her courage will remain unshaken.
