The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because of this: In an attempt to make the characters all different, and thus add something unique to the storyline, authors Humberto Fontana and Miguel O'Rourke (Beverly Hills Cop) try this to create a completely new world.

These books deal with supernatural scenarios, as in "The Book of the Dead," where vampires are murdered by a black man in a forest to appease his vampire king. The author explains the "Black Hand" story in so much detail that it could be considered to be a very real crime in modern day history. The book "Hibiscus" tells of a man who had found a woman living in a rural inn while a vampire lay on his chest, bloodied and battered from overwork after she ran away. Because of this, some people believed her to be in love, and even after she had abandoned her husband the following year. The man knew his vampire queen, who took her life.

That is, all four authors go on to write a book that will continue the same pattern: In a desperate love story, each person dies Schneider. In every case they are killed by the vampire he cares about (the one who murdered his sister to rescue the woman she loved). In their book the killer is dead for nearly three days, for having killed every single one of them, which gives him a perfect description of what a monster a killer who cares about is
