Throughout the years, technology innovations have had a profound effect on our lives. The introduction of computers has rapidly changed the way we live, work and interact with each other. With its widespread use, computers have improved communication, enabled instant access to information and even promoted a trend towards easier, more efficient living.

Yet despite these many advantages, I believe we should also take a step back and carefully consider the impact that computers have on people both individually and collectively. Studies have shown that when used for extended periods of time, computers can cause people to become too dependent on technology for answers, leading to an overall decrease in analytical and problem solving skills. In addition, the use of computers can cause individuals to disconnect from both physical and social environments, leading to mental health issues such as loneliness, insomnia, and even depression.

Computers should not be viewed as something that can completely replace the need for face-to-face communication. Whether it is for work, entertainment, or research, computers must be used responsibly and in moderation in order to protect our society from its potential
