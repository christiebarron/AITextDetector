The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it is clear-cut and clearly written that winter is indeed the right time to learn about it. It is not hard to say that Winter Hibiscus is one of our favourite works.

The book is currently on paperback at £11 from Amazon, £7, from Simon & Schuster, £5, from Simon & Schuster, £4, from Amazon and £3.53 from Simon & Schuster. The following link is to the book: http://www.sharingfics.co.uk/store/?s=29&id=3313

It would make a wonderful story if it took place somewhere in which people could make the same point across the board, and not on a piecemeal basis.

The book was published by Oxford Bookshop and is now on sale on Amazon from 15 May.
