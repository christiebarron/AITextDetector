The Empire State Building was designed to accommodate passengers on dirigibles, or airships, to dock at the top of its spire. Despite the building’s lengthy construction from 1931-1932, the challenges of devising an effective method of allowing dirigibles to dock safely and securely presented its creators with an unconquerable obstacle. In her book, The Mooring Mast, Marcia Amidon Lüsted chronicles the attempts of builders, engineers, and the investors of the Empire State Building to devise a workable option to their mooring mast aspirations.

The primary objectives of the building’s creators were to develop a way of securely moored the dirigible at the top of the building, amidst the presence of skyscrapers on every side, and to create a design that could be able to fend off gusts of wind. To do this, they envisioned a mooring mast that connected to the eight-hundred foot spire, raising to an additional eighty feet to provide more of a secure anchor.

To tackle the problem of high-gust winds, the building’s creators looked to additional ballasts and cables. If successful, the dovetailing of weights and cables could effectively utilize the down-force of the dirigibles and the up-force of the wind in order to keep the mast from swaying too far. In practice, however, the combination of weights, cables and anchorages results
