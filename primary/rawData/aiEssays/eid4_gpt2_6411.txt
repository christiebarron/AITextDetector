The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it brings us into the heart of a whole that has been lost. It takes a whole-hearted look at the ways the world that we have constructed was destroyed by the magic we sought. I hope you enjoyed the entire series and will see the ending soon.

In short: Please keep reading Winter Hibiscus!

So there you have it: Winter Hibiscus takes a break, has to go by the name of A.I., finds a new house, then lives out her life under the tutelage of his two brothers; to read this book means you won't have to read Winter Hibiscus and it will be nice to return.
