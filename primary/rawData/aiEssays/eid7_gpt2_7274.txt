An example of a time someone in my life was patient was at Work where we held all of our sessions. We always had a great atmosphere and always had our own staff of 20 or 20 people at the conference. So it was a good combination.

"The best part was that when there was a meeting with our staff members, they would hold the meeting and then say thank you. It made the whole conference very happy. It was an ideal time because you get to spend time with colleagues.

"For some of the attendees it was also a time to let their friends know what we think and what we think in general and everyone got used to the conference and that was great."
