I recently had the pleasure of witnessing someone demonstrate a remarkable level of patience. 

I was in a crowded restaurant waiting on food when a young family, a couple with two children, came in and sat down at a table next to us. 

The children were noisy - they were being so loud that it was difficult for the adults to have a conversation. Everyone in the restaurantâ€™s atmosphere was slowly being driven mad by the commotion. 

After around 10 minutes of uncomfortable banter, an elderly lady sitting at the table next to the family had had enough. She turned to the couple and commenced what could have been a very heated exchange had it happened in a different setting.

However, instead of rising to the bait, the couple responded with a level of calmness that was astonishing. They were obliged and understanding to the woman, thanking her for her concerns, but maintained their level of composure no matter what she said.

After a few minutes, the lady saw that she was able to do nothing to stir them and gave in, apologising for her outburst and admitting to the couple that it was perhaps her own frustrations that had made her lose her temper.

It was remarkable to witness such patience in such a highly charged atmosphere. The couple showed an exemplary level of restraint, even when it would have been easy for them to eventually lose their temper.

Seeing this made me realise the kind of patience we should all strive for
