I remember one time when I was having a conversation with my best friend Janet. We had been talking for a while, and the conversation was getting a bit intense; we were both getting a bit too serious. Suddenly, I made a joke about the situation, and my comment made Janet laugh uncontrollably. 

At first I was surprised, but soon I was laughing right along with her. Once the laughter died down a bit, I noticed that the tension in the conversation had been relieved. We were both in a better mood, and the conversation flowed more smoothly and naturally from there.

Laughter had helped to bridge the gap between us, and allowed us to connect on a deeper level. It made me realize just how powerful a few moments of laughter could be. Looking back, I'm grateful for that moment, and the realization I had then that laughter is such an important thing to share with others.
