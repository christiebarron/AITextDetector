Today was one of those days when nothing seemed to go right. My daughter's school had to be evacuated due to a power outage, so the entire class was suddenly freed from the school and running around the playground. As a parent, I was anxious to have her home and safe. 

As I waited in the school parking lot, all I wanted was for my daughter to come to me as soon as possible. I watched her running around, excitedly playing tag with her friends. But I recognized that it would take her time to calm down, and I was patient.

I refused to rush her or be impatient, knowing that this moment of freedom was probably the only opportunity she would have to play without the worries of studies or homework. So instead of worrying, I encouraged her to enjoy her moment of freedom and have fun.

Finally, after about an hour, she ran to me. I was so relieved to have her in my arms, and I felt deep appreciation for having been so understanding and patient. I was glad that I had taken the time to recognize that there was more to this moment than simply getting our daughter safely home.
