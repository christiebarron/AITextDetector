The construction of the Empire State Building in New York City in 1931 posed a unique challenge to engineers: incorporating a permanent docking station for dirigibles, or airships, into the design of the 102-story skyscraper. This feat of engineering was made possible by the development of the mooring mast, a sturdy structure standing at the top of the building.

The mooring mast, designed by Jack Reeves and Theodore Joslin, was originally intended to hold a silver dirigible almost the length of two football fields. While designing the mooring mast, engineers sought to ensure a safe docking for the airships despite the high winds and the tremendous weight it would be required to support. Constructed with a 12-inch reinforced steel frame and mounted on a platform system supported by a steel column, the mooring mast was designed to withstand winds up to 110 mph in addition to the weight of the airships. As a result, the mast remained firmly in place some fifty-eight stories above the 84th floor observation deck.

Despite the strength of the mooring mast, engineers faced numerous obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. The most concerning obstacle was the potential of heavy turbulence, called wind-shear, occurring at various heights above the building. Engineers were concerned that the sudden change in velocity of a strong gust of wind could cause the dirigible to be thrown off course, resulting in a crash. For this reason
