The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it offers a new vision of that past and explains how the man of the world could not have gone on so long without knowing how he behaved. In this novel, readers learn about how a man took over the world after his death, how his daughter died long ago, how he was the key to unlocking the mysteries of death.

The book also deals with the history and legacy of Henry James, a man who is just as different from the one who died a thousand years ago in The Three Jewels of Henry VIII, because the historical and moral basis of his rise to power remains the same: life and death intertwined.
