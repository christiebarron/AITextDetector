The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because there's a very big difference.

"It's difficult to believe that one of the biggest things we would have done during that last two-plus decades for the United States was to give the African Americans hope," said Charles R. Caldwell of the NATIONAL BUREAU of Scholars, who has worked on the manuscript. "It also represents a huge leap in understanding the role that racial discrimination played in a time of economic crises and the impact racial-minority stereotypes had on the world in general and African Americans as a whole in particular."

He continued, "We did what we had to do to avoid the kind of 'white savior' rhetoric we normally hear a lot from the rest of the media, but also on a far more personal level."

The book says that the idea of a world that was built with race is a far cry from the more sweeping and personal story of white heroism.

"In fact, the book makes very real some of the differences that emerged from the past, which really has to do with our current political landscape and the fact that our racial politics now reflect a culture in which white people are under attack," R. Caldwell explained. "It is very difficult to believe that one of the biggest things we would have done during that last two-plus decades for the United States was to give the African Americans hope."
