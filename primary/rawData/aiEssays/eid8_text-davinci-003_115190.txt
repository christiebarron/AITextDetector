I'll never forget the first time I saw my wife laugh. We were attending a comedy show, and she had been apprehensive about it. She had been saying that it sounded too silly and that we wouldn't both enjoy it. But, halfway through the show she let out this beautiful, uncontrollable laugh. It was like a switch flipped inside her â€“ it was the first time I'd seen her genuinely laughing in months.

Afterwards, we sat in the car for a few silent minutes before she broke the silence with the most cheerful voice I'd heard in a while. She looked happy, and I knew that everything was going to be okay.

We talked all night, and it was like the laughter served as a bridge between us that enabled us to connect that we hadn't had before. Every now and then, when I heard the faintest echo of that sound, I knew that everything was fine, and no matter what we were up against, we could get through it together. 

Laughter was the key that unlocked a bridge between us that night, and it's a bridge that still stands to this day.
