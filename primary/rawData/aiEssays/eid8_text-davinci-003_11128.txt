I hadn't seen my old college roommate in years, so I was anxious about how things would go when we finally met for coffee after all this time. It was slightly awkward at first, but then we both burst out laughing as we realized we were both wearing the same style of shoesâ€”bright yellow Converses! After that, it was like no time had passed and we were nineteen again. We joked around and reminisced about our old college days, laughing hard throughout the whole conversation. We talked about our current lives and jobs, which made us laugh even harder. Soon we had to get up to leave, and we realized that the time had flown. As we hugged goodbye, I couldn't help but be thankful that laughter had made it possible for us to reconnect.
