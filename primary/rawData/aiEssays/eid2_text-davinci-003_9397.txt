The debate about censorship in libraries is one that has been going on since libraries first began circulating books. Those opposed to censorship feel that imposing such limits is a violation of their freedom of speech and expression. They argue that censorship impedes on our ability to find information and form ideas that are important for learning and personal growth.

On the other hand, some individuals support censorship in libraries in order to promote an environment of respect and civility. They argue that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines can be offensive and should be removed from the shelves if they are found to be inappropriate. By censoring these materials, they contend, libraries can create a safe and inviting atmosphere for all members of the community.

Furthermore, the removal of certain materials could lead to censorship of unpopular opinions and ideas.
