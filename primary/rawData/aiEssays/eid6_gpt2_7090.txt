The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. It was a landmark building, yet it was already considered by many of the state's architects to be unfinished.

In 1937, the government decided to create a state of the art bridge. It was called the Bridge of the Republic, and featured a curved and elegant steel plan in its side. The state's engineers decided to use a high-frequency sound oscillator to create an oscillator which could vibrate and vibrate at will for up to 150Hz. They would eventually get around this limitation.

But the project took a toll on the state's economy. It cost money and destroyed almost all ailing housing, while the bridge itself would never be able to meet the required 60,000 feet of climbing.

Eventually, the new bridge was built, and it was officially known as the Empire State Building.

But then, in 1980, the state's architect, John Nibley, decided a very interesting idea. He wanted to make an underwater archway in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Mexico that did not need an actual bridge, because it would be able to reach the ocean. When a ship sailed from the Pacific Ocean into its own, it could land off the ocean's surface with the help of only one human boat â€“ the ocean has an active gravity.

The design was very successful. It opened up the future of the Empire State Building to the
