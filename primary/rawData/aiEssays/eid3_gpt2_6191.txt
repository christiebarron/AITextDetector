Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

Firstly, a number of things apply here. Some effects may have to be attributed to conditions like cold weather or hot weather, but there may also be other influences, such as lack of fuel. In other words, even in hot climates, the impact should be minimal with just a slight change.

When considering climate change, there might be one thing I want to look at.

To be able to set up the 'Rough Road Ahead' setting I need to enable any of the following features to a certain threshold:

When setting up and starting the car, the driver must ensure that everything is off by 1/3 of its intended power.

(This includes the electric generator if the driver prefers, plus whatever fuel will give tightened up after this one.

This is set to a set of 50% at first.)

In addition, this setting will always be on by any factor of 1% unless explicitly chosen. This is in good agreement with most other drivers who have decided to set it for a different threshold and have not yet had to go through the troubleshooting step yet. If not, one may have to disable the effect altogether.

On my phone the settings are slightly different. I have been told that they may need to be changed for this only to be able to be in the same setting for 1/3 of a second.
