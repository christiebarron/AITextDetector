I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is unacceptable, but that government censorship is not, but I think in this context, very important."

A spokesperson for Mr Trump said that while the president would work closely with the Library of Congress and other government agencies to help improve libraries, "it's no secret that it is important for library users to have access to a library's content, and I would very much appreciate any efforts to do what he has said here and is going to do."

In addition, the president-elect has recently suggested that other governments could use more of Washington's vast resources to help libraries. In an interview with the Washington Post on Wednesday he said, "We need [these additional resources] in the future because we have a very long time, but we just don't have the dollars."
