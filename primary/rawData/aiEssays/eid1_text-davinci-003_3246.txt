Dear Editor,

I am writing to discuss the unavoidable yet powerful effects of computers on people, and to urge readers to understand the impacts of this technology in their lives.

Computers have revolutionized almost every aspect of our daily activities in the modern era. From communication and leisure to work and school, computers add a new level of accessibility and convenience to our lives. With the rise of the internet, information is no longer a scarce or private resource. Admittedly, computers can improve productivity and allow us a greater degree of efficiency while accomplishing specific tasks.

At the same time, computers can have a considerable negative effect on individuals. Excessive usage of computers has been considered to be a major cause of physical inactivity, which can lead to health problems such as obesity, heart problems, and poor sleeping habits. Using computers can also lead to isolation from other people, as it could take away the traditional means of communicating and interacting with others. This can easily lead to a sense of loneliness and depression.

We cannot deny the role computers have in our lives. However, if used unwisely, they might take a toll on our physical and mental well-being. Therefore, I urge readers to take caution
