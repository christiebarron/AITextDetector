Narciso Rodriguez’s memoir ‘From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives’ can be characterized by a deep and reflective mood. This is created right away in the first section of the book, as Rodriguez contemplates his family’s history and his own place in it. He looks back on the struggles of his parents and their determination to move and build better lives for themselves in the United States. As he speaks of this, he conveys the kind of patience and determination which allowed him to achieve his dreams, but he also reflects on the sadness of watching his parents and the rest of the family he left behind in Cuba struggle. The memoir is built upon this kind of reflective reflection which veers between joy and sorrow.

In the subsequent sections of the book, Rodriguez expands out his reflections and looks at other aspects of his life such as his accomplishments and setbacks in the fashion industry, his exploration of his own sexuality, and the joy of watching his two daughters grow up. All of this is imbued with the same reflective and somber tone, sometimes in very interesting juxtapositions. For instance, when speaking of his success in the fashion world, he takes time to reflect on the disappointment of his grandfather and his father about the fact he’s chosen to work in what they would regard a frivolous field.

The overall effect of this mood creates a book which is both thoughtful and introspective, but also filled with warmth and hope
