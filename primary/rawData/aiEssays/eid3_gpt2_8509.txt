Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. It is not surprising that in 'Rough Road Ahead' there was a much less 'open' and'safe' setting for cyclists by contrast, but we were still concerned about how the setting would affect the actual performance on the road.

As such, we took into account both the cycling distance and road speed (and therefore average tyre pressure) before we used the 'Rough Road Ahead' setting. (See the graph above.) This was a much more accurate comparison, as we didn't use it extensively because it allowed us to compare performance on different roads and it meant that we were even easier to judge the performance of bikes in practice (see below). Unfortunately this was not the case for the 'Crane-Pedestrian' setting where we used the Cycling/Road Traffic Rating of 10 as a rough threshold â€“ there were some situations with the same situation where the 'Rough Road Ahead' setting was accurate which resulted in the rider being more likely to give the wrong 'road' performance.

Similarly on the bike-rider setting, we calculated the 'Rough Road Ahead' speed multiplier (ROD) using the same methods used. This has been proven to improve the rider's comfort rating and will make them less cautious of certain types of situations, but it is hard to know whether these adjustments are making a difference. For instance, most people have very little control over the
