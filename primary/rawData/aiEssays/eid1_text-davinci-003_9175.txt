Dear Editor, 

I am writing to share my opinion on the effects computers have on people, and to persuade your readers to view this issue from my perspective.

As we live in an increasingly digital age, it is undeniable that computers and digital devices have changed our lives drastically. They have helped to make our lives more productive, efficient, and have made information more accessible than ever. 

However, there are a few negatives that have arisen from this industry revolution. For example, computers have taken away from time spent outdoors, or interacting with people face to face. With computers replacing many jobs, it can be easy to feel isolated, lonely, and discouraged. 

I believe that the best way to combat this is to practice healthy computer usage. Allowing yourself some balance between digital activities and physical is key. Exercise, reading, and spending time with family are just a few activities that can be used to replace sedentary computer activities. 

I urge your readers to consider these points and make the effort to balance their computer activities with other, healthier activities. Such a move will benefit us all in the long run. 

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
