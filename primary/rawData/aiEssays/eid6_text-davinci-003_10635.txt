The Empire State Building is one of the world’s most iconic skyscrapers located in New York City and built from 1930-1931. It stands at 1,454 feet tall and was constructed to rival the Chrysler Building. One of its most unique features is its mooring mast, which was originally designed to be used by dirigibles. However, many obstacles had to be overcome in order to make this a reality.

The first obstacle was the winds of the city. New York City is located near the Atlantic Ocean, and as such, winds tend to be much stronger than other major cities. This made it difficult to ensure that a dirigible could successfully dock to the mooring mast. To address this, the builders of the Empire State Building had to make sure that the mast was strong enough to handle the strong winds, as well as increase its height to make it easier to moor a dirigible.

The second obstacle was the size of dirigibles. Many of them were quite large in size, so the mooring mast had to be high enough and wide enough in order to accommodate the dirigible. In order to overcome this, the builders had to make the mooring mast 226 feet tall and 10 feet wide. They also had to engineer a way to help with the dirigible’s descent, as the winds could make it difficult to control the speed at which it would approach the mast.
