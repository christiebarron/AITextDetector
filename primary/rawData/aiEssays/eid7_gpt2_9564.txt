An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a doctor who treated people with AIDS. He treated a couple who got pneumonia from the side effects of chemotherapy. He treated them like family. And he treated them with drugs that made life difficult and he helped them get healthy.

Then there is the case of a boy who was killed after doctors ordered him to perform an operation. He died from being injected with radioactive materials. Later he was taken back by the American Legion so did his parents and his other relatives, who then helped him get better. He had his organs taken and he was finally able to donate his organs to another family once he was 65.

This country has done something that I want to do. Do I not have the obligation as a nation to defend what is right? That's our moral responsibility. Our moral responsibility is to protect those who are most vulnerable.

It would be terrible to have more children who do not have the same rights to life, to say the American dream. And what about those childless Americans who cannot raise their babies on their own, or even go further and die every single day they are in the womb?

We will not let that happen. We will do everything in our power to help the most vulnerable. We will help those with the most need. Not only is the United States helping everyone with the best chance of survival, but we must help the sickest and most vulnerable people who can take care of
