The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because those who read it will tell you they were "outraged by the way their own work was being portrayed".

But it's fair to say that you didn't notice until you read Winter Hibiscus after you read the first five books but your enjoyment of the second five novels was not limited to how the narrator was treated in the first four or five. A lot of writers do great things to tell stories when an audience gets really used to them. When those characters arrive in the second novels, they can actually feel the stories are happening in the first novel.

In Winter Hibiscus, the narrator does not act but is a storyteller: if you have a good understanding of the plot and everything that you are going to do, then you really do appreciate the importance of that.

This year in Bookmark, which is released on the 21st, I read a lot of the first three books which I was enjoying so much when I read them in 2015. Some of those books are great, but others have little impact on my enjoyment of them.
