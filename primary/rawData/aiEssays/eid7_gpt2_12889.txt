In the absence of any medication, he went home and got himself a second dose of ibuprofen every 12 hours. That day he went to the hospital with his life on its taper. He died. So, as for that patient, his life on a daily basis was going well. I went to the doctor twice to make sure that the patient was OK, but my best intentions were not to interfere in any way. Finally, he died. It was all over for six months after that. He was very much in remission. But, of course, there's no doubt that he has the same problems. But, of course, his life on a monthly basis is going well.
