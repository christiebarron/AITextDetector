The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' also suggests a shift in the focus after the war. While the general population has seen a marked increase in support from people who had never experienced war and had no intention of fleeing, there is evidence that the military now has a bigger role to play.

Mr Walker, a former soldier with the National Liberation Army, said his book revealed what he said had been a growing dissatisfaction with the war.

"The generals and the military have now become masters of the war," he added.

"It also reveals that the generals have now had to make hard choices in terms of how they should approach the war because they are in control of their own resources. In many countries, there is an army that makes up more than 70 per cent of the population.

"The war itself has become a political football because the war is being run on the basis of a political code, which is a code of principle. Manywaves in the population have a right to understand this code and to understand the situation and to not accept defeat."

Mr Walker pointed out that the media often had the impression that the war had ended on July 29 with all those killed and wounded in the battle.

But, after the war's end, the population of more than half a million people - an amount equivalent to one third of the UK's population -- was in the majority, suggesting that the mood of the population was positive.
