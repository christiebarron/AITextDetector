The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

Brentford's state-owned railroad, the Michigan-based U-Carb, owned the building, which was converted during the 1950s. Because of this, the builder's plans were designed to accommodate more than one funeral service. After the train derailed in June 1968, a team of firefighters quickly brought the building to completion.

Brentford lost another major battle against the steel-framed building — one which ended in a three-car wreck, causing fire that killed one person.

On December 3, 1968, the steel-framed building was repaired with new plywood that matched the originals. Then, the crane truck carrying the building's massive crane was driven to where it crashed on Interstate 60 and left a giant mess in the process.

Two fire department trucks went in to help. But the workers weren't there to help rescue the damaged building.

So, in June, 1969, Brentford hired the help of several private citizens — the first fire department to use the lumber that was sourced from the steel-framed building. The citizens came together to help save the nearby downtown skyscraper.

It all comes down to their choice. Brentford has spent years trying to save the building, but their money hasn't been enough.
