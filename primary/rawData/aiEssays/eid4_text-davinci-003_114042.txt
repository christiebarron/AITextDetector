The narrator of the poem has been reflecting on the challenge of taking a test. He connects it to the winter hibiscus, a plant that will not bloom until the weather warms up in the spring. By ending with the hibiscus, the narrator implies that he will be ready to take the test when the spring arrives--when he is refreshed and more prepared for the challenge. By tying his preparation for the test to the bloom of the hibiscus, he is expressing his determination and confidence in his ability to succeed.
