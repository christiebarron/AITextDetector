Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my opinion on the effects of computers on people. Computers have redefined communication, opened entire worlds of possibility, and revolutionized daily life. They are integral parts of our lives â€” but the effects of computers on people cannot be overstated.

First, computers can revolutionize communication. According to a recent study, 93% of people under 35 increased their overall communication either through email, text messages, and the use of social media and messaging platforms. This means that computers can allow people to stay in touch with family and friends quickly and conveniently, as well as expand their social circles and build new relationships.

Second, computers have expanded possibility and created greater efficiency. Computers can be used to access vast stores of knowledge, connect with like-minded people, and utilize advanced tools for creating documents, presentations, and digitally-enhanced experiences for education and business. The potential for interactive learning and data collection has created new opportunities for students and employees alike.

Finally, computers can free up time and simplify many everyday activities. Online shopping, banking, and bill paying mean that people need not waste time driving to stores or offices or standing in line. Security features such as online passwords and pins ensure that financial information and banking needs are protected.

In conclusion, computers have enriched our lives and increased efficiency and connectedness. I believe that computers have had tremendous benefits for people.

Sincerely,
