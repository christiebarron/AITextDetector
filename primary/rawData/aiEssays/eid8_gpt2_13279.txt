One time I experienced laughter in my life was when this was my freshman year of college. After talking about our favorite movies, I couldn't find any funny-sounding films to tell in my life.

But my favorite books are always funny. And when it comes to the subject matter of this list, the best is probably reading The New York Times bestsellers to find the best books if they're about a specific subject.

So here's what I have collected here:

The best books on your shelf are the best for you in your area (especially the genres that matter) and for your next one. In other words, the book of the week should be your "best book" regardless of it's genre, quality, or subject matter.
