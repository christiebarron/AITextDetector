The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Among these was the fact that not all the Darling River in Seattle has such a low volume of water, making it difficult to control tides. As a result, the builders were forced to make room for more than one-third of the current. As a result, the existing low flow and high flow dams that they built were no longer effective.

The final barrier for the erection of the Empire State Building was the "green river" located at the end of the main roadway and the north end of the northbound bridge. It was only on this bridge that a large number of pedestrians began crossing as the yellow line approached. By this time the city had realized that the green line was not enough to prevent pedestrian traffic over the span. These yellow lines were not sufficient, and were cut to accommodate the traffic flowing underneath the bridge.

Construction continued. Between 1929 and 1931, traffic would be cut off from both the southbound bridge that was on the West Bridge and northbound bridge of the bridge that was on the east bank. A number of trees planted that grew rapidly down from the roadway.

The Empire State Building was finished in 1947 and demolished in 1987. The remaining land was used in a separate building on Washington Pike at the end of the West Bridge. Because the original plans were demolished, it is unclear whether the current plans had a significant impact on the structure. However, the building
