Computers have many effects on people. One is that they can make money; three or four years old is enough to go down pretty well. When we have to buy something, as we've done with alcohol, we get up in front of our TV and talk to our phone before we can do anything meaningful.

For example, if I had just bought a pair of sneakers, I might be pretty happy to get them and say: "I love this for this deal and I'll wear them everywhere I go when I am at work. You get my permission." But the most important things are the money. So if your kids say, "My money's going down because we are paying for something I do not want to pay for," the decision to pay a dollar from a small investment to a big investment does not have meaning. And not only that: The kid doesn't want to pay a dollar up front. He's got to say, "If I had my money, I love you as well." He loves me better than all of his peers.

That's what I am seeing in the world: We are dealing with a phenomenon that's affecting so many that sometimes the worst of the consequences end up being a million or a thousand dollars, if not more than that. Those situations will change your life forever.
