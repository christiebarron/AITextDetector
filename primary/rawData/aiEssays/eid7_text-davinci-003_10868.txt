When my daughter was two years old, I had to deal with a really difficult situation. We were going to the local park for a picnic and she was running ahead of me. All of a sudden, she stopped dead in her tracks and started to throw a major tantrum. She was screaming and demanding to go home immediately.

I knew if I gave in to her demands, she would get used to having tantrums and I would lose my parental authority. So, I took a deep breath and decided to be patient.

I took her into my arms, shushed her, and tried to calm her down. I told her it was alright and that I would take her wishes into consideration, but that we couldn't go home right now. I gently explained why it would be better for us to stay, and little by little, her tantrum began to die away.

She eventually stopped crying and we were able to finish our picnic and have fun at the park.

It was difficult not to succumb to her tantrum, but in the end, I was glad that I remained patient and kept my cool. It made the situation smoother, and I knew it would help me build a better relationship with my daughter.
