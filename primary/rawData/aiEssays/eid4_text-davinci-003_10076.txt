The narrator, a young girl from an immigrant family, opens the story mentioning a hibiscus bush she has been keeping alive over the winter. This bush is symbolic of her own struggle to adjust to her new environment, and by the end of the story, she has learned the lessons it has to teach her. By linking the hibiscus blossoming in the spring with her taking a test, the author is suggesting the idea that the narrator has grown mentally and emotionally over the winter, and is now ready to tackle her academic goals. The hibiscus, and the story itself, become a metaphor of resilience and growth in the face of adversity.
