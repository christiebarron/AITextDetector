The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. While some of these obstacles had been eased by early construction, other were too long to be overcome, either by using an antenna, the end of a rope or by requiring the pilot to sit up and rest his or her body against his or her head. However, the only real way in which the pilots were able to get the upper hand on either these technical problems is if something similar had been required of the workers on the bottom (notably the elevator).


With the rise of private jets and an increase in government funding, much of the attention paid to dirigibles on the ground was focused in Washington, D.C., by NASA. It provided the engineers with an avenue to make progress on their design while simultaneously finding another path to completion. In the late 1940s and '50s, NASA's program in aeronautics focused a lot on the design aspect, especially in space, so they would have some flexibility to design their own aircraft. This included space shuttles and various space elevators for the space missions of the time, but the space shuttle and the space shuttle-era intercontinental ballistic missile program of the 20th century allowed the shuttle concept a number of other options.


Although not the top priority, the project of flying space stations for commercial companies did appear very seriously during the Bush administration. NASA had set aside the first four hundred space stations for private companies
