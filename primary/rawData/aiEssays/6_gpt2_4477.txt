The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. It is likely that they had no plans of installing another version of the plane, auyer (which became known as the Yutsuki), on at least one of the first platforms of World War II. For the purpose of keeping flight logs for the new flight decks, their primary requirement was to show the planes' real-world avionics systems. With only two-thirds of the aircraft visible on the original designs (the aircraft was never officially announced until 1971), the designers decided to create the mainframe with a custom-made-out window for display. By this point, many flights in the Empire State of New York were already showing the aircraft's avionics screens.

According to aviation historian Christopher W. Sargent, the view of the new aeronautical system (at a time when both the cockpit and tail of an airplane used the original wings of a Boeing 737) is one of the greatest achievements of all time, and may be the oldest aircraft in American history. Sargent notes that in the early part of the 19th century, it was considered the greatest design design in history. And perhaps the only design known with a modern cockpit.

Walt Disney, in designing the A-class bomber that would become the first Boeing 777 after the 9/11 attacks, was known for playing with the idea that a Boeing 757 jet would somehow make it to
