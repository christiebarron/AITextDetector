I remember back in my days as a fifth grade teacher. One of my students, Susan, was a very bright individual, but she had difficulty with math and particularly with fractions. She was frustrated with not being able to understand the concepts I had been teaching the class while the other students had quickly grasped them.

I was patient with her, taking extra time to ensure she understood what I was teaching. Instead of teaching the lesson to the entire class like I usually did, I spent time talking with Susan one-on-one, slowly going over the concepts until she had a thorough understanding. By the end of the school year, Susan was able to understand and do equations with fractions.

I felt a great sense of accomplishment for myself, as well as for Susan, that we had been patient to ensure she fully understood the material. I had been able to stay calm in the face of her difficulty, and as a result, she was able to master something that had previously been a huge obstacle for her.
