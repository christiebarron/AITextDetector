The poem ends with this image to emphasize the message of resilience that is woven throughout the poem. The narrator has spoken of many struggles, including the expectations of their parents and their own fears, but despite these challenges, the narrator has hope that they can overcome and bloom in the spring just like the hibiscus. By ending in this way, the poem invites readers to take the same message: that with resilience and hope, even the most difficult of tests can be passed with grace.
