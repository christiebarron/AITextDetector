I had a job working as a cashier at a local grocery store. One slow afternoon, I was the only person on the registers. I was starting to get frustrated when an elderly lady stepped up to my line. I knew this was going to take a while as the customers who come in from the senior living apartment next to the store tend to forget their items, or they don't scan well so it takes time. I grumbled to myself and took a deep breath.

This lady was so sweet and kind. She was telling me stories about her life and asking questions about mine for over 30 minutes. I know what I could have done was roll my eyes and go on daydreaming about when could I be able to get off but I listened to her stories and answered her questions.

When I finally rung her up, she gave me a big smile and thanked me for being so patient. She even gave me a small tip for being so understanding. It was so unexpected and her kindness really touched me.

That sense of patience I felt that day taught me a lot. It showed me how being patient and having a kind heart can really go a long way and make somebody's day.
