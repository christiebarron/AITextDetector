I was recently in the grocery store and I was running late for my appointment. I was looking for the items I needed as quickly as I could. As I was hurriedly shopping, I noticed the woman in front of me was having trouble finding the exact items on her list. She was quite confused, and obviously an older woman. I could tell she was getting frustrated, but I decided to be patient and offer my help.

I walked up to her and asked if she needed assistance. She gratefully accepted and I took the time to thoroughly search through the aisles and help her find what she needed. Even though I was in a rush, I remained patient and helped her the best I could. She was so appreciative when she had the items she was looking for, and thanked me profusely for my help. 

It was a small gesture, but for me it was a reminder that it is important to be patient and understanding of those around us.
