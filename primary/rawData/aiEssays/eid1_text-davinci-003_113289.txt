To the Editor,

It seems like almost everyone has a computer nowadays, from toddlers to seniors, from rural to urban. The impact of these machines on our lives cannot be overstated, but I would like to discuss the effects of computers on people specifically.

I strongly believe that computers can improve user’s mental abilities and provide useful resources to help people become more informed citizens. Computer users can gain access to a variety of information from a global community, learning new information that may have otherwise been unavailable just five years ago. In addition, the ability to play computer games, even if simply for recreation, can help hone problem solving skills and make the user more adept to solving real-life problems.

However, it is important to consider the potential negative effects of computer usage. Overuse of computers can be addictive and can lead to physical isolation, exacerbating mental health issues or causing loneliness. In addition, many people can waste too much time surfing the internet when they could be spending time with their family and friends.

In conclusion, computers should not be used in excess and should be used responsibly. With thoughtful use, computers can be a great source of knowledge and can improve user’s mental skills and provide much needed resources.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
