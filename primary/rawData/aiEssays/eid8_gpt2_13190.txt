One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I met the legendary Dave Chappelle. He said he took pictures with me as a teenager. In fact, when he began getting up late at night, he used to take pictures with me whenever I wanted.

Then, he told me about the man he called "the Prince", who used to live with us on the island. "I was having a laugh when he said he was going to kill me," me said. "I couldn't believe it. This wasn't just another kid or what-could-be-the-Prince, he was a guy who actually knew what he was doing. But you can't just pretend that it's not you, you must know what you're doing."

When Chappelle asked me a million questions in his time on the mainland, I knew I wasn't quite ready for the truth. I was looking for other ways to tell my stories of poverty, racism, and sexual harassment that may have been a big part of my upbringing. So I took a day off, went to the beach and found out about a film that took place in wide release of my name at the time.

The film called For No More Tears, written by filmmaker Mark Hamill, was originally the result of a conversation with a friend of mine about what it means for someone to live a life of violence. His friend wanted me to film, but I wanted to put money on the table
