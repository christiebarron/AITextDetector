Dear Editor,

Over the past few decades, computers have become ubiquitous in our lives. Computers have changed the way people interact with one another, the way they find and access information, the manner in which they work, and the manner in which they play. There is no denying the impact of computers on people's lives.

While it is true that computers can save us time and make our lives easier in many ways, it needs to be acknowledged that there are serious issues associated with the use of computers. For example, computers can be highly addictive and lead to serious mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety. Too much dependence on computers means that people are disconnected from their physical environment, as well as their social relationships. This can lead to a feeling of isolation and dissatisfaction.

Furthermore, peopleâ€™s minds can become too fixated on computers and their abstract worlds, leading to an inability to learn, think, and function in real-world situations. This can lead to diminished career prospects and educational opportunities.

Ultimately, although computers have transformed and simplified our lives, the use of computers needs to be balanced and vigilant. We should all be aware of the potential harm of too much dependence on computers
