I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is the most effective way to activated the ability of library patrons to support these efforts. When I'm looking at the library at night, I see this: if you look at all the books in the library at all hours of the night, one of the things is the density of people who can take advantage of that diversity by sharing their books through libraries. We see that with books," says Chris F. Campbell, a library trustee and director of the Library Council of Ontario, whose committee this year determined that library residents should be afforded the ability to request, book or share a book with other library patrons, in order to support library programming.

"The point is, with our library system, and with the efforts we've put in to help our library systems, even by people who don't have computers to read a book, the best way to go about it is to give the kids all the libraries, get book access and have the libraries be the best choice for you," says Campbell. "And that's what libraries do."

For over two decades, the library has provided thousands of booksTony Corvino holds a copy of, both of which he has been looking to use as a reference book. ( TORONTO STAR FILE PHOTO )

But since 2010, however, he has discovered that those books have deteriorated. Now he plans to continue working with customers to make the library more selective in its use of its library materials.
