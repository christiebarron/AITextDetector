An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when she took me on a trip to the beach. He was kind and loving, but she took me on a tour of the Bahamas. It is not unusual to see him in the Bahamas in the 90s. Then, he had an incredibly difficult time getting through the Bahamas so when he finally did come to the island I got married and he had an amazing time of it. He met her in the Bahamas.

After the trip she went back to get a job and she met Tom in the restaurant. He was so relaxed in the restaurant. The first time I saw him was over at his place in the basement. Tom had just hit a wall and then suddenly it was so real. It felt real. This was before the advent of the internet. Everybody loved music more, especially old-timeies. Nowadays the Beatles were an amazing influence on many people.

We were going back to Chicago a couple years later and we made it to the East Coast where they were back in Chicago and playing until we were on the road and they gave us a great show. It was just fantastic and when they made us do it that was exactly what we were interested in. They were also really nice listeners. It was a really special show.
