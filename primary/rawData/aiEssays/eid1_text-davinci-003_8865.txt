It was the beginning of summer and my best friend and I had decided to spend a day at the beach together. We had nothing planned, so we just decided to sit in the sand and let the day unfold.

We started chatting about anything and everything, all while laughing and smiling together. I soon realized that no matter how serious the conversation we were having, we always managed to make each other laugh. We would be discussing our current relationship problems, but suddenly my friend would burst out laughing about some silly comment I made. 

Eventually I found myself in tears of laughter. We were getting strange looks from people around us, but we didnâ€™t care. We just kept laughing, finding joy in each other and in the moments we shared.

At the end of the day, we had spent hours talking and laughing. We had known each other for so long, but that moment had felt like the most special one of all. I felt closer to my best friend than ever before, knowing that no matter what, it was okay to laugh and truly be in the moment with her.
