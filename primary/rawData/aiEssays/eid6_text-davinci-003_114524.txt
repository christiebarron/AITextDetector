The construction of the Empire State Building in the early 1930s offered a new design possibility for building construction: a mooring mast. This mast could accommodate dirigibles, allowing for a direct transportation method to the building’s top floors. While the concept of an upper-level docking area was attractive, it presented a variety of obstacles in terms of design.

In order for the mooring mast to be a viable option, the structural integrity of the mast had to be able to handle the weight of the dirigible. The original design reflected this obstacle, with the mast being 600 feet tall and mounted upon four foot concrete blocks. The 1920s-era technology that was utilized to construct the mast also posed a challenge, as the structural steel at the time weighed much more than modern alternatives, and the mooring mast safety cables had no way to be adjusted from the ground. This made it difficult to keep the mast secure and stable as the dirigible moved around it.

The second obstacle was related to the actual docking of the dirigible. The mast itself was designed to be retractable so that the dirigible could move up and down easily, with the safety of the passengers and the building’s integrity in mind. To give dirigibles full access to the top of the building, an extension was added to the mooring mast after construction was complete. This extension had to securely latch onto the dirigibles, preventing the ship from
