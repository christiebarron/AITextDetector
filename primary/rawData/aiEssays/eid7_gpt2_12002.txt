An example of a time someone in my life was patient was in 2010 when a young woman from her home gave birth in the heart of the North Pole and made her way from her job in the airport to join the US Navy. The young woman had had a cold since her arrival, and her mom, who still lives with her, helped prepare for the birth.

Now, these doctors will say there is little or no evidence that this happened long before she even heard of the baby. But I can say with the best of my heart: the data in this data set points up that it was certainly very unusual. In 2005, in a scientific study entitled The Physical Basis of Medical Origins and Evolution, researchers found there were three major factors that played a role in the birth of the child: the mother's physiology, the mother's natural selection, and the environment.

For an example of how science has arrived at that conclusion, check out this video report.

In fact, the child is very different in a lot of ways since it arrived in the womb. The birth comes out of the stomach, and an umbilical cord is pulled out of the baby. Then, the umbilical cord begins to move across the baby to attach the umbilical cord. This process occurs a few times per year and can lead to unusual development.
