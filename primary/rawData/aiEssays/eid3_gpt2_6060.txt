Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. The difference when it comes to the bike being used in this context is less obvious.


As you may be aware, the use of a low end bike like the Leinster is one of those bikes which has an odd way in which it operates. Most riders like it because it's easy to adapt so you don't have to take the brakes. The same can be said about the sportbike.
