The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it provides the information we need to know about the different elements of ice and snow by using statistics from numerous books.

"The main benefit of our book is to take them together, take a small sample of what the people of Europe have to say about the different elements of ice-and-water by using them together," said lead author Dr Ian Kiefer, from the University of Bath.

Kiefer and his team used a computer model computerised by a team of mathematicians from New South Wales University of Technology to look for correlations between ice-and-water composition in ice-free regions around the world.

"The model was designed from several different data sources and uses simple mathematical modelling techniques, but we wanted to show that the data obtained from the different sources are similar to one another, so we went further, using very strong techniques in computer modelling, than we had on Earth.

"By showing us that the data obtained from Antarctica's ice-free regions are similar to those from the polar regions, it was clear that ice and water in each of the different regions is similar to each other, so if we can combine these samples - as with the others from South America and Antarctica - we can then provide our knowledge on the various different effects, including atmospheric, ocean and climate."

We already know that ice and water on a continent are very different under extreme conditions - when the
