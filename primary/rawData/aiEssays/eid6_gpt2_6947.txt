The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Their main concerns were that the tower itself was too short for a dirigible with no seats or an antenna. On July 1st, 1927, the Federal Aviation Commission awarded them $50,000 to replace the antenna with a new structure. The antenna, which featured five wings, was placed to assist with rotational navigation. It took a lot of work by pilots to mount the device without cutting over much of the fuselage and the pilot had to pull the end of the antenna to reach it from above and then cut the tail section of the car to free the seat section. It didn't look too great, though. According to the FAA, the "carriage" would break down and "would become extremely unstable or extremely difficult to move." The problem was that when they replaced the antenna, it would not be able to maintain rotation within the airplane. That fall in 1929, the FAA finally approved a new "parachute" for the antenna that placed a second antenna on the top of a car. In the meantime, the new plane continued to carry a great variety of aviation equipment. Eventually, the antenna was replaced with a new set of wings (which, although still small, could be used by a monoplane or a passenger airplane for flight), which also featured a great range of various flying techniques. (That would include the ability to descend and descend more easily if the vehicle was not covered
