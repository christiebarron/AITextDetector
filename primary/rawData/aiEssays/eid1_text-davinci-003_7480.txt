This powerful ending conveys the idea that when hard times have passed, life can become easier and more hopeful. It implies that the protagonist will be in a better mental state to retake the test she failed when the winter has passed and the springtime brings new beginnings. This hopeful message is tightly tied to the metaphor of the hibiscus, which can only bloom in the spring, corresponding to the protagonist's growth over the winter and her newfound confidence to try again.
