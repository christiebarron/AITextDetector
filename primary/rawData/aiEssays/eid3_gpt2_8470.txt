Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. The main aim was to make everything in the ride more stable and less bumpy. From 'Groomers' to 'Trees', the cyclist was trying to find the best combination of geometry and terrain to get the most out of his car.

Some of the most interesting details I found, including a'stiff neck','stiff legs' and 'trees with sharp bends'. The top of the car was a bit flat so the vehicle could fit with a small bit of grass from a flat area to its right or left. So it became more difficult to find an edge between the bends and the road, so we decided to do something that made this even more stable.

The tyre was then fitted – now we could keep the car from getting bogged or getting a little bit stuck in traffic.

This next part was quite different to the previous part, so it didn't look like a good idea for this part – we just had to wait until it was complete to figure out what the best combinations were.

In the image below, an early version of the 'Stiff Leg' tyres has shown up in a new high road, with a few subtle differences. The front tyre of the flat tyres is not flat, but rather thick, so it is much more suited to keeping from jumping from side to side like a normal car.
