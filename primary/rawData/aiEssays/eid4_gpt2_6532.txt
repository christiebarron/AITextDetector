The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it offers a detailed perspective on the role of time in society. He begins by listing the reasons why people have been conditioned to see time differently. In the following chapters, he discusses how these different factors have led to different social attitudes about time. He then describes what he would like to see happen in society by using historical research in understanding what changed. As always, I wanted to share in the book's appeal, as well as the book's value to non-fiction.
