I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a dangerous step because these materials are very useful and the Internet has opened our voices to public criticism on some issues."

The idea that censoring material online does not violate U.S.-Canada relations was a cornerstone of the Bill of Rights, which had passed Parliament. The Bill still seeks to define what is a "public domain."

For example, it would prohibit "public-domain publications" that may be available to read or "any computer program and application which does not or does not violate any provision of the Constitution or treaties, in the federal, provincial or territorial law, or the rules made applicable to a national government or a foreign power" from publishing.

However, U.S. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has voiced a desire to regulate the publication of "public-domain, non-commercial" writings, which are not necessarily legal sources but nonetheless can be used to promote specific political campaigns.

The law also would also outlaw "public-domain publications" from including books and pamphlets, including a handful of books that might be considered by Canadians to be political. The authors would also get to keep their royalties on books that don't have "perverse copyright statements or representations."

U.S.-Canadian law could face a legal hurdle gearing up for the day. The Canada Information and Information Technology Act allows the federal government to block access to websites without having to obtain a lawyer's permission.
