An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was 17 and my parents told me I needed to get out of the country. I told my parents, "Mommy, please see this. This is my money because I left the country at 16 and my life is over. I'm leaving tomorrow and this is when my wife gets her marriage license. She is from Ireland so I am leaving now." I went to a couple of friends and we talked for a couple of days and I told them I was leaving but then my agent went right to me and she said, "Mommy, you are supposed to leave so I am not leaving." I said to them "You aren't leaving when I am leaving. I want to give my children a better life." They said I didn't feel good. They said I thought they were going to turn this thing around.

Why do you want to leave?

I want to leave because I am in the future and I want to get back to my mommy's family so that she doesn't have to make mistakes. I want to leave because I feel guilty when my family has been destroyed by bad decisions. I want to leave so I can continue caring for the kids. There are so many things we can do to help the kids and we love each other so much that when I get back I will be able to make an impact on my family.
