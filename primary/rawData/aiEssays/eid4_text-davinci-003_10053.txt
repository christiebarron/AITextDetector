The final line of the poem is an important insight into the narrator's understanding of his life. It serves as a reminder that although life is full of hardships and uncertainties, there is still hope in even the most difficult of moments. By referencing the cyclical nature of the seasons, the narrator suggests that despite the setback he has faced, he has the opportunity to begin anew and work through his struggles. The return of the geese signifies a time for possibility and growth, and he is determined to use this opportunity to his advantage. Thus, the ending serves as an inspirational moment of renewal and a reminder that we all have the capacity to start fresh and (hopefully) succeed.
