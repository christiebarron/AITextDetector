The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One of the biggest challenges was the potential danger linked with such an endeavor. The Empire State Building was constructed in 1930, which was prior to the development of major safety standards relating to aviation and airships. As a result, the risk of mechanical failure or human error was a very real concern for the builders.

Second, the construction of the building incorporating a mooring mast presented structural difficulties. Building a structure strong enough to support a large airship posed a particular challenge. In her book “The Mooring Mast”, Marcia Amidon Lüsted noted that “a mooring mast needs to be robust enough to withstand large wind sheers and the violent lurches of a huge airship docking and departing.” This proved even more difficult as the Empire State Building already had to incorporate additional columns for stability.

Finally, while the mooring mast had been successfully built, the absence of a location able to facilitate the safe docking of a dirigible threatened to be a major issue. The original plans for the ground floors of the Empire State Building did not include docking facilities. Without an area engineered for the safe passage of airships, the builders risked potential disaster. Therefore, a netted dock had to be built by the engineers and architects.

In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of challenges in allowing
