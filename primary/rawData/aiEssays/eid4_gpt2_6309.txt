The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because this is the first major attempt the writer has to do a book in the style I think he could have done over his lifetime: it's a story about a band of renegades, but no less interesting, which are part of a group known as the Numbins and part of the Numbins' past, and their quest to end the Ice Age.

It's also probably the most interesting version of the actual book, with many twists and turns that make things more than a little confusing for me. I like it because it does a good job of setting up the tone for the book. I love the idea of an Ice Age, but I could never wrap my head around the fact that I probably shouldn't have, but I'm happy because it's definitely going to help me at times. I'm also proud of the book, too, as it gives me an opportunity for my own reflections on my favorite characters. For the rest, just in case this book was more familiar to you, check out the rest of my posts at the end of the post.

If you liked it, I think you probably liked (or at least liked enough) the second half of this one.
