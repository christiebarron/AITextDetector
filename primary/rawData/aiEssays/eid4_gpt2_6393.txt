The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because, once again, he makes many wrong choices. The character was written into the story and is just plain flawed. I feel bad for Hibiscus.

Also at the beginning one of the things I didn't enjoy was how "dumb" it is for my reading this way. You can read this much right now if you care about the character from the beginning. Instead of just being a fun story about being raised by a pretty girl, we now find ourselves looking at a rather awkward, dark, and somewhat flawed woman. I can't say a bad thing about it. I would suggest that I keep paying attention, as I have a lot of that "what-if" thinking happening in my head. I feel that Hibiscus, after all, should still be a book that takes place at the beginning of every story. His book is great but not that special.

I thought the next book in the series was actually a bit better but wasn't impressed with it so I'm sad when I see it come down to a one page version. It's very hard to read these books so I also like when the final volume is released, you just find that these books really were never meant for people with limited hands. It's not like you can get something like The Hunger Games for free online or anyone else out there. You can get a book, the book, but you don't get to read
