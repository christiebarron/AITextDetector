I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is essential."

I find it incredibly ironic that we still live in a time in which a government agency has yet to make a definitive recommendation. The Library of Congress has made several statements concerning censorship of books, but only a cursory review of the list of items and publications that it has made available shows such an organization to have made a long-standing commitment to providing access to information, even in this case involving books and stories from its past.

While I agree that censorship of information should be banned (whether by the government or by books or other publications), the government needs to protect the information and the freedom of expression. This is where I want to end. I believe the government needs to make sure that only materials that are deemed "critical" in nature -- works which include works written in the popular or popular arts -- are brought to light because we all should feel free to discuss in an open and accessible manner with the public. I see that the government could end the freedom of speech and freedom of expression through censorship. The information and debate which is available right now will have been censored through censorship as we will now know that.

As we move forward with the fight for freedom of expression in publishing and culture, it is critical for us to have a debate about the current state of information around critical literary works to take into consideration the potential pitfalls of making these kinds of proposals.
