Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my opinion on how computers have been impacting people’s lives. While I understand that computers have been a vital tool in modern society, I also believe that there has been an increase in the number of negative consequences from computer usage.

One of the more obvious negative effects of computers is the increase in sedentary lifestyles. While computers may make it more convenient to work from home, many people end up spending all day in front of the screen, rarely leaving it. This has resulted in decreased activity levels, and consequently negative impacts on physical and mental health. 

Also, it is easy to forget social interaction that does not involve a computer when you're constantly on it. People are instead developing what has been called digital solitude – becoming disconnected from the physical world and their communities. It has been argued that this can lead to higher rates of depression and anxiety. 

In addition, there is the issue of cybercrime. Teenagers spend a significant amount of time on computers and the internet, and criminals are taking advantage of this by preying on vulnerable computer users. This has created a dangerous environment, where even innocent people can be at risk when accessing these technologies. 

Therefore, I believe that computer usage has had some major negative effects on the health and safety of people. I urge you and your readers to think more critically about how these technologies are being used and consider the repercussions of their use.
