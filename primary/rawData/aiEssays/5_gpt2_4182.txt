The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' was palpable with an exuberant intensity. (Her life didn't work out for nearly as much as that, but the author found a way to get through it together.)

One area where there was little change for the story-telling of the novel was when we started to hear about the real-life, violent death of my daughter, who was a junior in high school. She had shot her sister at point-blank range in a home where he had bought fireworks and had set fire to a home he had constructed for her (she had gone to school with no security).

Her assailant and cousin were two brothers and an uncle. She had been kicked in the stomach when he shot his father and siblings-in-law (she also used a gun). His girlfriend had fallen to her death on her porch. There had been no drugs, and a friend had taken the gun she had given the young girl, who never left.
