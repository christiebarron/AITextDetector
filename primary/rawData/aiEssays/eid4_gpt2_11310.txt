The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it follows the story of a mother and daughter who face their darkest days, as their children are swept away by their own worst impulses. Their story of redemption and death, is told in the context of a story about childhood, about which the author does not care. But as we get to these days, there's more of the sameâ€”the sense of uncertainty, of fear, the sense of guilt, and especially of not loving those they love most.
