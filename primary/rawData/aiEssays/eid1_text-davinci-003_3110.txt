Dear Editor,

As our society becomes more and more digitized, it is important to examine the impacts computers have on the lives of individuals. My research into this subject has convinced me that computers generally have a positive effect on people.

From a practical standpoint, computers are incredibly useful instruments. With access to virtually any information, computers can save time, effort, and money. Additionally, they assist us in the accuracy of financial statements, client records, medical charts, and much more. This makes modern life easier, faster, and higher quality.

In addition to making our lives more convenient, computers also have the capability to help us maintain strong social connections. With video chat platforms, we can share and interact with people from all around the world. We can also connect on social media networks to find out what is happening in each other’s lives. In this way, computers will not make us more isolated, but rather, will give us the opportunity to grow closer to each other.

It is clear that computers are useful, efficient tools when used responsibly. Therefore, I urge your readers to recognize the positive effects computers can have on people’s lives as long as they are used in moderation and
