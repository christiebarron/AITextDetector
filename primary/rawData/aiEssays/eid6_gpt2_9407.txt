The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. A plan, in which four windows with mirrored glass above each would be added, failed in 1977 when they came down to a final vote of confidence that the final piece of the plan was approved, according to the New York Times.

In 1989 an architect named William C. Smith filed for bankruptcy protection. At the time, though, the firm did not fully understand why Dirigibles would not be capable of attaching a high-definition TV on their top floors. The plan had already been approved in 1991 by the State Building Committee, who agreed to pay Smith $50,000 for the project. Smith was paid for his work, and then in December 1990 he filed a reorganization certificate, claiming to be an owner of the two-story building, and seeking the right to use the building only on low-income people, as opposed to owners of non-profit, non-profit buildings and other areas.

In January 1992 the State Building Board approved the change of plans as required, by a vote of three-4, to let Dirigibles attach to its top floors. This allowed to see the four windows along the new high-definition televisions, and the four windows on the original three-story, four-bathroom, four-bedroom building to be attached to the first two floors. A final vote of approval was held in September 1993.
