In 1931, the building of the Empire State Building marked many exciting advances in construction and industry. One of the most extraordinary of these was the inclusion of a special mooring mast atop the building, designed to allow dirigible, or airship, air travel. However, the process of allowing dirigibles to dock produced numerous obstacles for the builders of the Empire State Building.

The first obstacle the builders faced was the sheer size and weight of the task. The mooring mast had to be four hundred feet tall and able to withstand wind forces up to 125 miles per hour, and the mast head had to be capable of withstanding the landing of an airship which could weigh up to 75 tons. The mast had to be held in place by a series of anchor rods and cables which were sunk 65 feet into the bedrock. Constructing such an intricate structure, and ensuring that it remain sturdy enough to anchor a dirigible, required some of the most advanced engineering of the era.

Another hurdle in allowing dirigibles to dock was obtaining funding. Because dirigibles were not yet widely used, some investors were wary of financing the entire project. Thankfully, important backers like Army Major General William E. “Billy” Mitchell stepped up to the plate to prepare the Empire State Building for air travel.

The final obstacle to a successful airship docking was the incorporation of new technology. The mooring mast had to be equipped with an innovative new
