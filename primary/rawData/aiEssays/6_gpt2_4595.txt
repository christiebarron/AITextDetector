The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Each of them faced challenges that required builders to build different methods of delivering their own product. There was a long-standing dispute at NASA concerning which method of delivering a vehicle to a customer was better, and at what cost â€” not to mention that the prices of the vehicles were competitively low. One solution was designed to keep cost competitive. The alternative was to have the same system built from scratch. By contrast, the design of the Empire State Building was made up of small modular panels similar in construction to the one used on the Federal building. The two were designed in such a way that only the most expensive panels would be delivered to a customer after the original, not the latest models. In 1957, the Department of Energy developed the idea of a new type of roof. This new design allowed the use of a smaller diameter roof if the product was particularly complex. It also allowed the builders of the Empire State Building to work with commercial space suppliers and the National Space Center. The large-scale use of the building proved to be a valuable source of income to state and national government departments who sought to improve the working conditions of the public while also maintaining the public in the belief that the building as a whole functioned as such. Many of the designs were more comprehensive than the Empire State, and in 1957 they made up for this weakness by adding high-efficiency glass and composite roofs. Building on these rooftops
