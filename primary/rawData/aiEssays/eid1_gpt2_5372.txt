The difference in these effects depends more on those who write the hardware: this is important if there is a problem to be solved and the machine tries to solve it in time.

Second, there are many different types of computers, which can play the parts. The computers we know have hardware. The computers we assume to be the right type of computer are not going to be right or there's no reason to care about them. There are machines that do more than just play the parts – these computers are not going to do all the things we like, nor will they provide us with all the features that we want.
