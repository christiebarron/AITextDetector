Minfong Ho ends Winter Hibiscus with this thought to show that there is still hope and that the hibiscus, and by extension the narrator and her family, will come back in the spring and take the test again. The return of the geese is a symbol of new beginnings, of hope for the future. The narrator is hopeful that, when the cold and dark winter months pass, a new semester will bring new opportunities that the family can take advantage of. The hibiscus' enduring toughness through the winter symbolizes this hope, and serves as a reminder that things can eventually become better and more hopeful.
