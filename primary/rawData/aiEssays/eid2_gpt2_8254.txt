I believe that censorship of materials in libraries that would encourage people to write about government subjects and people of faith to write about political matters (including pornography, child pornography, child abuse), is likely to become even more harmful under the new U.S. law," the authors wrote.

In an interview earlier this month with WND, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said that if other states follow through with their current proposals, federal agencies will take actions to prevent free expression on issues, including Internet pornography, with the federal government.

"The idea that you could regulate the Internet without any consequence is not a realistic solution," Meadows told WND.

Meadows also suggested the current laws, such as Title II of the Communications Decency Act, could be repealed altogether, noting that the "current legislation does not address every possible avenue to circumvent the law, such as the current government-provided search engines that are being used to track people's online activity," WND reported.

However, Meadows pointed out what he called "the fact â€“ that the government already has the power to censor information on a matter of government importance."

"We will not stop working on something we would want the government to continue to censor," Meadows told WND. "That's what I mean by having an open discussion about why we should be regulating what websites are being searched over the Internet."
