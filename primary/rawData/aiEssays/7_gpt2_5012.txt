An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a person I had met at the gym one day. They always knew what to expect from me and asked me about me. They would ask if I smoked pot, what I ate, on the beach, etc – I didn't answer. The most important thing they asked during the interview was that I had a high functioning brain. A high functioning person often didn't know what they wanted to ask me about, but they wanted to know what I wanted to hear.

I was always able to feel and do my best to keep them busy – I think we're all very happy. At some point, the interviewer began to ask about my fitness levels. I was always very self-focused and looking for the quickest way to get into shape, but these were times when I wanted to know why in a certain area or when I'd felt uncomfortable. I never thought it was important to be told that I was on the top of my game. After meeting my coaches I began to see them as people I needed to communicate with. They were amazing and I am so proud of them.

How far have you gained in health and fitness?

I've gained a lot in over a year. My health is better than ever and I'm able to do the things I love to do. And if I've lost the weight I've never done before, I'm stronger and better than I was when I first started.
