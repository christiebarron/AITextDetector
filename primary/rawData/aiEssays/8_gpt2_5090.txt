One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was working on a new blog that was called "A Christmas Carol". It had more than 120 comments. Most people did not like it and thought it was an uninspiring work. I gave it away like I was stealing it. I then gave it to a friend who is now working on a novel about a time when "funny things happen" and was not amused at the thought of being called a bigot.

Some posts were more or less funny, such as this, by my friend:
