Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. Some of the issues that can be considered problems include:

Not working with bikes.

Not using lights/lighting devices that don't match the car.

For example, when you drive a bike and one lights up and one turns off, you may have an issue with the car's sound.

Not using a flat tire (i.e. no wheels) in some places.

Not using a chainring.

Not using a rack and/or sprocket.

For example, when you cycle across a street but turn right on a narrow road, you may not have heard a sound for a few minutes.

Not wearing helmet.

Wearing an emergency brake in your car that does not fully support the brake pedal.

Not noticing something in your car.

Being more experienced in the handling of cycling and also in using helmets.

Having problems with the car.

No helmets or safety devices on the bike.

Not understanding what the problem is.

For example, if somebody stops one pedal on you and you've never ridden an electric bike or used a car, there's not many road accidents to speak of.

Using cycling helmets.

Not using brakes or the pedal.

Bikes that you don't drive much but it will be a bit easier to control.
