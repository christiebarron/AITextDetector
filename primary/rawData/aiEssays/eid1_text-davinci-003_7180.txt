In Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead”, the setting of a rural area in midwest America plays a crucial role in the story. This setting can be seen as the main antagonist in the story, as the terrain makes the cyclist’s journey uncomfortable and difficult.

The lack of modern roads, combined with the presence of rugged terrain, makes for a challenging climbing experience. This creates a sense of frustration in the protagonist, explored through the use of his inner monologue. He struggles against inclines, rocks and thick mud, feeling helpless as he slides backwards or suffers a fall. He realizes that without clear paths, reaching the finish line will be a test of his determination and skill.

The lack of civilization in this rural area places the cyclist out of his comfort zone, as he is surrounded by harsh nature and unfamiliar landscapes. This heightens the sense of danger and difficulty, while also giving him a sense of freedom as he makes his way across the terrain. He discovers that while the road ahead is uncertain and uncomfortable, he has the power to make it through. 

The natural elements in the setting also present an additional challenge, with rain, wind and even the lack of daylight in some cases making the journey even more difficult. As a result, the cyclist has to work and control his body and movements in ways that have not been possible for him before, furthering his sense of vulnerability and unease.
