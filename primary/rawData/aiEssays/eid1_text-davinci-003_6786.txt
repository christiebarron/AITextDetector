Dear [Name of Newspaper],

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people.

In the modern day, computers are used in almost every aspect of our lives, and our reliance on them has increased exponentially over the past several decades. From work and education to entertainment and communication, computers can provide a seemingly infinite range of services to us.

However, there are some negative effects that come along with relying on computers too heavily. For one, computers can make it difficult for people to take a break from their screens and become “unplugged” from time to time. This can lead to eye strain, sleep deprivation, and poor physical health overall. Additionally, extended use of computers can also contribute to mental health issues such as depression and anxiety. Finally, overuse of technology can interfere with social interaction and real-life relationships.

It’s important to recognize the potential downsides that come with the use of computers so that we can all take steps to limit their impact on our lives. This can include taking regular breaks from screens, engaging in meaningful physical and social activities, and setting strict limits on how much time can be spent using computers each day.

By adopting these measures, we can keep computers from taking too great of a toll on our mental and physical health. I encourage all of your readers to examine the effects of computers on their own lives, and I hope they will join me in taking steps
