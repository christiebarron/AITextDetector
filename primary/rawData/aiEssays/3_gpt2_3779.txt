Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

These are:

Road safety

Driving safety

Treatments

L pursuer safety

Road safety

The impact of various factors will vary with the setting (see Figure 6, lower left hand side).

As the driving and highway driving models have slightly different goals and different goals related to certain conditions, it would be wise to look at the effects of the setting for these areas.

However, there are many situations on which there is no clear difference in how the 'Driving' and 'Treatments' options affect the cyclist's road safety.

Some conditions which have no clear impact on traffic may affect the cyclist's speed. For example, some conditions which result in overtaking will not affect the cyclist. These conditions usually have no impact on pedestrian speeds, although it is possible that these situations could still be affected.

If you think that a road speed of 45cm or more (in this case 50 mph) does not affect your road safety, look at the following examples:

When the rider enters the street for the first time it is not clear how far ahead he or she is for the nearest lane of transport or a safe distance.

When a cyclist enters the road with the speed limit of 45mph and the cyclist's visibility is a little higher than that of a passenger, or on a safe
