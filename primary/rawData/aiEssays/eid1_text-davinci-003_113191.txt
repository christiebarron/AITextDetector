Dear Editor, 

I believe that the effects computers have on people have been both positive and negative, and that there is no one-size-fits-all answer. Computers can improve our lives, providing us with online access to information, entertainment and convenience. On the other hand, excess computer usage can lead to physical health issues, such as vision problems, and to mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression.

In my opinion, computers are invaluable tools that can be used for managing data, researching topics, communicating with others, and finding new sources of information. We should strive to take advantage of technology without letting it become a source of anxiety. Each person needs to find the right balance between using computers and engaging in other activities. 

I encourage people to use technology, but to limit time spent looking at the computer, choose programs carefully, and ensure that time spent online is meaningful. Prioritizing time spent on computers for beneficial activities such as taking courses, learning new skills, and researching topics of interest can make it a more positive experience for everyone.

Thank you for your attention 

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
