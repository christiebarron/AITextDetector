The author uses the resonance of natural cycles to illustrate the theme of resilience and hope. The hibiscus is symbolic of the main character in the story, Mei Lin, who must learn resilience in order to overcome the challenges she is facing. The metaphor of the hibiscus blooming in springtime, which comes after the snow melts and geese return, emphasizes the idea that while Mei Lin may struggle in the winter, if she can remain hopeful and resilient, she will persevere. By ending the story with this imagery, the author conveys the message that Mei Lin will be able to take the test again when springtime arrives because she will have grown from her struggles and learned to believe in herself.
