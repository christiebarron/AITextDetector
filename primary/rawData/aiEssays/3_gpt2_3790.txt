Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

First, the amount of time that you can spend cycling during the day is reduced, so the amount of time you spend running can be lower.

Second, the amount of time that you can travel from place to place (where a bicycle is currently parked or on the ground) is increased.

Third, the time that you spend walking (including cycling, walking up and down stairs) is reduced.

The final thing to consider is the distance you can travel on the road. The actual distance the cyclist will want to travel is the distance he will have to walk along at one-hour intervals of time to get to a destination, which is the distance people run down the road during their day.

It starts off as a good idea to think about the distance travelled as such: it's as if you were in the house. So, on average, it's around ten miles.

You can think of such a distance as having to stand over a ten-metre radius of snow (like 10 kilometres in a snow globe if that's what you're really looking for). (The distance would be something like ten metres and a hundred metres)

It might look too impressive, but it's really a good idea if we start measuring distances as such:

You can walk over a ten metre radius of snow with the same speed as a cyclist,
