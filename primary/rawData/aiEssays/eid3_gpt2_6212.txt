The 'Seat Angle' (the distance from a point on the road to where a bike meets its apex) is a set of points at which the bike should travel in a straight line. The height of these points depends on the overall distance travelled.

The width of a bicycle's seat is determined by the number of seats on the bike, and any saddle that meets this width is either too small to ride or too large to be ridden.

If you wish to adjust the height of a bike's seat, there are two methods to do that. For the first one, you can manually adjust the width of the seat seat to allow a cyclist to stand up and ride his bike. That is, if the seat is slightly higher than the width of the other seat, the cyclist will feel as though his body is being squeezed. The second method can be set by changing
