The Empire State Building was one of the most ambitious construction projects in American history and, upon completion, one of the tallest buildings ever built. The building was originally thought to include docking for dirigibles, which is a large airship. During the construction of the building, however, the Empire State Building faced a number of obstacles that prevented them from achieving this goal.

One of the primary difficulties was the lack of knowledge at the time regarding how to safely land an airship of such a large size. In order to tack on the mooring mast, calculations and engineering were needed on a massive scale. Safety was a key concern, as was ensuring that the dirigibles had a stable platform to dock. The engineers collaborated with the Navy in order to conduct tests to determine the best methods for safely mooring the airships.

In addition, the physical engineering of an airship docking point is difficult. While originally the builders planned for the airship dock to be connected to the roof of the observatory, this site was eventually discarded due to its precariousness and the strain that the weight of the airship would place on the infrastructure. As a result, a new part of the building had to be specially designed in order to house the airships.

To further complicate matters, the location of the building posed an issue as well. The building was situated in the middle of a densely populated city, making it difficult to use a winch system to
