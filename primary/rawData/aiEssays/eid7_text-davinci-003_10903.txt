I was recently visiting my parents, and my younger sister and I had a disagreement. I had a specific view of how we should do something, and my sister strongly disagreed. I was feeling frustrated and wanted to stand my ground, but I reminded myself to be patient and try to understand why my sister felt differently. So I took a deep breath, put myself in her shoes, and tried to see things from her perspective. We ended up finding a solution that we could both agree on. It wasn't exactly what either of us initially thought of, but it was ultimately the best decision. Being patient and open to different perspectives paid off and I was proud of myself for not letting my emotions get the best of me.
