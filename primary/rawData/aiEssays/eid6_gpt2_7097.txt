The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

A few designs still exist but these are simple to build and can be reused if neededâ€”like creating a new roof that opens up from underneath a building to use as a crane.

The latest version of the Empire State Building, with its three-story "drones," offers the most extensive of features yet. (Pressed for more details, the public is encouraged to use their right arrow to go to the roof or left arrow to climb the staircase to the floor: if you're lucky enough to have a drone, just slide over the railing to catch the helicopter hovering below.

Still, there's one major limitation of the Empire State Building's approach: A crane sits atop the building's roof like a tower on land. Unlike most of the skyscrapers built in China or America, the Empire State Building's ceiling didn't get much taller than the roof.
