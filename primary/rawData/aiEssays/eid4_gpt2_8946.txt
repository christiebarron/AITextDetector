The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it gives readers something to hold on to in the battle. As a man who had suffered in a foreign war, and had received only brief treatment there, he became an heir to the throne. He was not able to change the great fortunes or reign, and that helped him to get the necessary people into government, and that made him a great leader in the Church. To find such a way in his life was to prove himself worthy of eternal life.

It is interesting, however, that in the book the book does not explicitly state his real name. Instead, the book leaves open the possibility that he will have to tell his story, and that we might never know if he can. Indeed, some of those readers who care to have written about this topic in book one are interested in hearing the official English names of the people he was raised by, even going so far as to mention "Brent" when writing.

If he had written his own name this way, the book may well have been published by Harcourt Perennial. This is interesting because the book is published by Random House in America, and so is likely that there will be many reviewers who will not be happy if their name is not published. This is certainly true on Harcourt books, because many of the titles in the book have been given to Harcourt, but this is also something that many other well-known writers do not do
