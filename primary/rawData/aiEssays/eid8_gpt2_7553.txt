One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I stood up and walked away without even realizing it... My jaw dropped in shock. I did what a normal person would do...I pulled one hand out and said "yes...what if you wanted it?"... I thought I was done talking to any of these people now and that was the kind of person I was...That's when my eyes just instantly brightened and I started to realize I'm nothing like that person... I was just someone who has a heart full of desire and just wants to help, but isn't able to just look away."--Ebonyi
