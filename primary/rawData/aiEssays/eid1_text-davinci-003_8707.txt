I can still hear the laughs coming from the room. It was a sound that I remembered so brightly from my childhood, so when it echoed through the walls of my college dorm I was transported back to simpler times. 

My roommate and I had been studying together for hours. We had started acting silly over the course of the evening and it felt like we were kids again. Eventually, my roommate started to tell jokes and as soon as I heard his voice I knew that I wouldn’t receive a single punch line without laughing along with him. 

Soon enough our laughter erupted and spilled out from our tiny room, filling the hallway with its joy. Friends would pop their heads in and grin as we didn’t stop, as if our laughter carried a contagious joy and light that we could not contain.

We continued talking, cracking more jokes and running stories about the oddities of college life, as we laughed and laughed until we had to stop because our stomachs were aching. 

From then on, it felt like my roommate and I had developed a unique bond that I knew would last through the rest of college. We would laugh together for hours in our room, both grateful to have found someone who could make us feel like a kid again.
