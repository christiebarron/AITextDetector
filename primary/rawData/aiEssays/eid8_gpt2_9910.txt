She said she also had the feeling that she was in love or, at least, that her husband wasn't there, since he was doing everything he could to get her there.

The girl, who had lived in Los Angeles for two years, said she felt lost.

"I would never go to bed thinking I was with a man who did not want my children involved in my relationship or that something was amiss with my boyfriend," the girl said. "But I felt so loved for the person who did it but who would not stop doing it."

Police spokeswoman Sandra Lamberth said the incident took place Wednesday. She declined to comment on the specific circumstances that led to Sunday's arrest or on what charges the suspect may face after Sunday night's arrest.

The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said both adults were booked into the Orange County Jail on charges of aggravated child cruelty after a court hearing on Wednesday.

A second adult was booked into jail on suspicion of child cruelty, and a third person has been booked into jail on a lesser charge, prosecutors said.

The victims' families have said the shooting was justified in the interest of keeping other children from being harmed.
