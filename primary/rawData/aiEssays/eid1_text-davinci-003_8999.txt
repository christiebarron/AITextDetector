Dear [Editor],

I am writing to you today to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Technology has only become more prevalent and, of course, computers are at the forefront of this shift. While computers are undeniably useful tools, I believe they are also impacting people in a negative way.

In my research I have found that humans are becoming increasingly more dependent on computers for their everyday tasks. This has led to an almost complacent lifestyle which leaves little energy for critical thinking or creativity. We are relying too heavily on technology, instead of using our minds. Knowledge is being replaced by a few simple clicks and people's attention spans have drastically decreased.

Moreover, computers have been linked to numerous physical ailments, such as back problems in children, poor posture, eye strain, and even more serious health issues like carpal tunnel syndrome. These physical issues are often the result of prolonged use of computers.

I am not totally against computers and the technological advancements they have allowed us, but I think it's important to recognize the potential dangers of over-using them. We should be more aware of our dependence on computers and use them as tools instead of allowing them to replace normal activities. It is my hope that readers of this letter take these concerns seriously and strive to reduce the amount of time they spend on computers and focus more on activities that require thoughtful engagement. 

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
