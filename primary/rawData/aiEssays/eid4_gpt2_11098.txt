The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because of what happens infunding when you are able to come up with a new title. With that in mind, to tell the tale, the first half of the volume is a little bit of a mixed bag, with several books that have different characters and stories written into these volumes and then having those different stories taken into account. The second part is more more of a complete story which is, perhaps, more story-heavy but still Sharma-friendly compared to all other series. All the characters have their own distinct personalities and story arcs, so making the story more cohesive can be tricky when dealing with different subgenres.

I love the story of the "Lunar" (the book takes place in a deep, dark forest in the middle of nowhere) and there are four parts in the book, each of which feels like a bigger arc than each of the previous two. I love the tone of the book and the action it takes, from the moment of the book to when it's being written to its conclusion. The stories the book takes on are as much about the character and world that makes up the story as it is about the characters. I love both the fact that the main arc revolves around Lunar and when it takes place in an unnamed area or world (the action is all about the character and the world that make up the book) and the way the book is set up to help create the world
