The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The First and Second World Wars, for instance, left the military out of the process. The Empire State Building now occupies less than three-quarters of the space today, according to the State Department. But many builders were willing to accept the idea of building a large-scale dirigible.

If the space opened up to dirigibles, even the private owners would be able to keep control over the vehicle's layout. That's part of why the Empire State Building can no longer be considered private. Owners will have to sell their assets to pay the upkeep bills, according to the Pentagon. Instead, many of the large-scale dirigibles will ship with "in-service services." So even if private ownership were allowed, the building would still be under a federal monopoly.

On some buildings, the private ownership option would still be attractive. For instance, in the Lincoln Center building at the Pentagon, the Federal Aviation Administration would have ownership over all its construction and maintenance costs.
