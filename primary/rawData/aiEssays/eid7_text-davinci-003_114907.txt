I was visiting my grandma, who was in the hospital due to a serious operation. She was very weak and tired, but so happy to see me. She was trying to be so energetic for my visit, and kept wanting to know about all my friends and projects at school. Even though I could see that she was exhausted, I was patient with her and allowed her to talk and take her time to speak. I tried not to get frustrated and made sure she was comfortable and could rest when she needed to. I even told her some funny stories about my day to make her smile. After a few hours, she was able to relax and I could tell she was thankful that I was understanding and patient with her.
