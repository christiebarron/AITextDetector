The issue of censorship in libraries is a polarizing one. On the surface, it would seem that censoring library materials is a step in the right direction, protecting community members from potentially offensive or harmful materials. However, closer examination reveals this to be far from the truth.

Censoring materials in a library renders them completely inaccessible to the public. This has a deleterious effect on our right to access information and explore our own ideas and opinions. This right is enshrined in the First Amendment and fundamental to a free and open society. It also encourages individual growth and intellectual exploration.

Rather than censorship, libraries should be more conscientious when it comes to selection and acquisition of materials. Libraries should continuously strive to offer a wide range of materials that represent a variety of viewpoints and perspectives. Librarians and library staff should also be at the forefront when it comes to promoting available materials and offering sound advice as to which materials are appropriate for readers of all ages. 

Libraries have an important role to play in a democratic society. Censorship does not create a more tolerant or civil society and undermines an individualâ€™s right to explore ideas. It is therefore counterproductive to the goal of libraries, which is to serve as a place of learning and growth. Libraries should strive to create an atmosphere of open dialogue, where people can discover new ideas and explore their own in a safe and welcoming courtyard. 

Censorship is an affront to freedom
