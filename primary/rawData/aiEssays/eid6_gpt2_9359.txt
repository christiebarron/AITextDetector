The most popular dirigible was the S-22 Superlight, and it became the world's go-to light vehicle. It was a high-performance jet that launched two space-faring ships, with much bigger engines and a fully automated system making it better suited for astronauts. It's the perfect symbol to give pilots of smaller vehicles a look of accomplishment.

It's also a good way for people to keep in touch with the astronauts at home. NASA was already trying to build a small, futuristic version of the Shuttle Space Station as part of that program at that time.

Now the S-22 is part of the same project and may be added, or not.

How many dirigibles do you need for a mission?
