The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first was an attempt by some of the city's most prominent architectural and cultural figures: the famed architect, Robert Frank, to introduce a flatbed truck that could allow an elevator into the building.

The architect's design had been criticized by the city for its reliance on heavy equipment on the building's basement, a problem for which Bowers and others at the time were determined and determined not to blame.
