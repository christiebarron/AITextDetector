Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects of computers on people. With the advancement of technology, computers have become integral to our lives, particularly in the workplace.

On the one hand, computers can be beneficial to people in many ways. A computer speeds up document-processing tasks, making work more efficient. It can also be used to keep track of records quickly and reliably. In many areas of work and education, it can even help generate new ideas, allowing us to become more innovative.

On the other hand, heavy usage of computers can hamper productivity and increase the risk of mental fatigue. People tend to spend too much time in front of their computers, meaning they can become saturated with work and have less time for relaxation and activities that rely on communication or physical activity. Furthermore, there is evidence that long-term computer use can lead to an increased risk of poor posture, back pain and headache.

Despite possible drawbacks, the overall benefit the computer offers to people is great. We can use it to assist our work and research, generate creative ideas, and communicate with others. However, we must be cautious not to overuse computers and to ensure that we take regular breaks
