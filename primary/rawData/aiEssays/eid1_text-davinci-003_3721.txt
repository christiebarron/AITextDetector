Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects of computers on people. Over the past several decades, computers have revolutionized virtually every aspect of modern day life by providing easy access to information, efficient communication with people all over the world, and the ability to perform immensely complex tasks in an automated fashion.

The impact of computers on individuals and society has been tremendous. Computers have revolutionized the way people access and manage information; for instance, by simply entering a few words, anyone with an internet connection can uncover a vast world of knowledge and information. Computers have also changed the way people communicate; now, it's possible to contact someone on the other side of the globe in a matter of minutes.

In regards to performing complex tasks, computers are able to accomplish these much faster and more reliably then people can. For instance, computers can now perform complicated calculations in a matter of seconds that would take most of us days or even weeks to complete. This has enabled us to make far more informed and accurate decisions in a fraction of the time.

Overall, computers have been incredibly beneficial to individuals and society at large. Our lives are made easier, more efficient, and are granted greater accuracy due to the power of computers. Therefore, it is my opinion that computers have greatly improved the quality of life for all people.

Sincerely,

[Name]
