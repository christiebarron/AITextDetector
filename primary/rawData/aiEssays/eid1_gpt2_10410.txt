Computers have many effects on people. First of all, they create social interaction, as people often become attached to social events that are not their own, such as a birth, family reunion, or some other such activity. The more people feel connected with a particular event, the more it allows them to become connected to the group. Second, people are often in the process of forming friendships, since some of these groups are more successful than others (see discussion below), and they tend to do well in their friendships. As they become more connected in the group, they become less dependent upon their environment, hence decreasing their dependence on external things such as family and friends.

This relationship with environmental stimuli can make people feel socially connected to one another when social interactions in their community are made. These two things can be viewed as one and the same, because when a person experiences positive environmental conditions, one feels that their positive external environment or situation is different and therefore their social relationships are more successful.

One would have to assume that natural selection is causing this problem. But there is no clear evidence to back this up, which has been suggested by some. The main reason we find the relationship between climate change and the likelihood of negative environmental conditions extremely low is that most humans are in the process of adapting (in part a process where they are already adaptable to changing climate) and we are only adapting if we are exposed to conditions in which the environment is warmer than our own.
