Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. The first one is clear and easy. Even in places such as the far southern countryside, there are very few areas where you can be on rough road, because the scenery was very clear for me and it was clear of all roads in the country.

The more complicated part is the setting, where one]; the other thing is that in places such as England, there were two or more times I was not even standing in the street and not even standing on my bike. For me the setting was very important for the rider to know and understand. In the north the terrain looked very familiar; that was my feeling as a rider. Even at very moderate conditions like those in London, I was quite surprised at how well 'Road Ahead' would be realised in those conditions.
