I remember it like it was yesterday – the first time I laughed with my new friend, Jenna. We had been in math class together since the beginning of the school year, but had never talked or even made eye contact. 

So I was surprised when I saw her walking up to me in the hall one day with a huge smile on her face. She told me that she thought I was funny and wanted know if I wanted to be friends. I was so shocked that I just started laughing. 

From then on, we were inseparable. We laughed together at anything and everything, in and out of school.

One of our favorite things to do together was to goof off in the hallway. We would make silly faces at each other and giggle when the teachers weren’t looking. We would have dance parties in the stairwells and whisper jokes back and forth when we were supposed to be paying attention in class. 

We always laughed at each other’s jokes, even if they weren’t funny and no one else thought they were. Laughter kept us close and has been a source of connection for us ever since. 

Now, years later, we are still the best of friends. Every time I think of Jenna, I can’t help but smile and remember that first, hilarious moment when we became friends.
