Dear Editor,

I am writing to present my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Over the past two decades, computers have become ubiquitous due to increased affordability and availability. As a result, computers are becoming a larger part of our everyday lives.

While computers have brought us a number of conveniences, I believe that their widespread use has had a detrimental effect on people, particularly in the realm of productivity. The more time we spend on the computer, the less time we have for more creative pursuits. This has resulted in a decrease in productivity and a decrease in quality of work. Additionally, excessive computer use has been linked to physical ailments such as eye strain, headaches, and back problems.

Furthermore, an excess of computer use has also been linked to emotional and psychological problems. People who spend an excessive amount of time on the computer can often become isolated from friends and family, experience sleeping and eating issues, and can even suffer from depression or anxiety.

Because of the wide range of potential issues that can result from overusing computers, I urge readers to limit their computer usage and to take time away from screens to engage in physical and mental activities that do not involve a computer.

Sincerely,

[Name]
