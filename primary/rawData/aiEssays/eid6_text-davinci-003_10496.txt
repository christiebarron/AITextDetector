The architects and builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when allowing dirigibles to dock at its summit. The decision to add a mooring mast to the Empire State Building was made in 1930 to capitalize on the popularity of air travel at the time. It involved some ingenious engineering paired with the challenge, and risk, of allowing such a large vehicle to dock onto one of the world’s tallest buildings.

The engineers first faced the challenge of designing a mooring mast that was tall enough to accommodate dirigibles, while also being durable enough to withstand the strong air currents and winds that surrounded the building. To make this possible, engineers created a door-like balcony to guide the envelop of the dirigible into the room of the mast. This balcony was shaped like half of an inverted cone, with a light that shone through its center. This design was meant to minimize the amount of wind resistance the dirigible experienced.

The mooring mast also had to be connected to the building in a way that would not disrupt its structure and stability. To achieve this, the engineers added vertical girders, attached to the building’s steel frame, to give the mast its needed support. On the top of the mast, a cone-shaped cylinder was installed as a guard to prevent the balloon from inflating too much and sending the dirigible into the air. The cylinder became a fixture that was viewed as an homage to the early days
