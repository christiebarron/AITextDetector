Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

For example, 'Rough Road Ahead' reduces a cyclist's chances of hitting a peak whilst having it stay very flat in order to prevent people from crossing the 'rough road'.

'Rough Road Ahead' also affects the speed in which a cyclist can safely manoeuvre.

If the setting is 'Rough Road Ahead', the cyclist is forced to change his pace as he crosses the road at a faster speed in order to avoid having to push past the peak.

The second of the three 'Rough Road Ahead' values â€“ 'Rough Road Ahead' or 'Round of the Turn' were chosen to highlight the fact that the cyclist can safely overtake in order to avoid travelling too far in the opposite direction.

The setting also means a cyclist can 'turn' while wearing helmet on at all times.

And last but not least, 'Rough Road Ahead' also forces cyclists to move at a slower speed in order to avoid travelling too far in the opposite direction.

So what about the effect on cyclist safety?

As you probably guessed as this graph shows, 'Rough Road Ahead' is actually harder to judge than 'Round of the Turn'.

But because it's more difficult to control this behaviour, you can take advantage of the 'Rough Road Ahead' setting when setting up or driving in this setting.
