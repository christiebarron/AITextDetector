One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was 10 years old and I remember how great and tender it feels right now. Then, as I was growing up, I noticed there was a thing that seemed to me the closest thing to heaven. That's if I wasn't so scared of it.

Then the following day I heard this message. It was a message I could give any teenager that they should know the real truth that my body was a tool meant for me to grow up.

I've never even had sex. The only woman to ever be raped is really an adult male when you're 18 year old. That alone made my brain explode.

The fact that you can't tell an adult male what he is doing makes you feel so helpless. You can't tell them what you're doing and they'll continue to keep on reading and believing it. That makes you fear a certain amount and that's because they don't really believe that anything is real.

That's where I thought â€“ there's a way.

You just don't need to trust the body of someone you love to get their head around you, the way you can, especially when your body has the ability to control its own destiny.

You're too young to understand the way these things are happening. There's no telling what will happen to something that is happening to yourself.
