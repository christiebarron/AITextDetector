The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' follows Krieger, the owner of a well-known local cafe, to find that she herself has been kidnapped by an armed thug wearing a T-shirt that says "You are free." She finds herself stranded near a prison in a heavily-armed gang and has to escape her captors by swimming in the water to save some food. With her friend's help, her group is Andreas and they eventually escape on foot, with the help of the gang's leader on the run.

Despite their hard fighting and skill at fighting, it seems as though Krieger is a little bit frustrated at the situation when she is able to get away from the kidnappers. In fact, for the most part she was happy to stay with Andreas and be able to escape without incident. Krieger doesn't seem to have much hope for survival if she chooses to stay out of the harsh conditions she's in. Her group is led by Andreas who uses an improvised electric torch to burn a hole in the walls of the school and the group is told they have a hostage situation.

Krieger seems to have some very strong feelings for her fellow inmates, however. At first, Krieger has no love or anger towards her fellow students that she finds difficult to believe, however when she discovers her former comrade, she gets to know him as well and is able to show him the truth of her predicament.
