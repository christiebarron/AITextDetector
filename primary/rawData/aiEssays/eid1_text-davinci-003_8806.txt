I had been living in a small town for about a year when I met my husband, Dan. We had been inseparable ever since, and one of my favorite things about our relationship was how we could always make each other laugh. 

It was one of those days when nothing seemed to be going right. We had been running errands all morning and were both grumpy and exhausted. On our way home, we got caught in a huge traffic jam. We sat there for what felt like hours with nothing to do but complain.

Then something funny happened. Without warning, a chicken ran across the street in front of us. We both started laughing so hard we were nearly in tears. The chicken was long gone, but the laughter stayed with us. We ended up making it home in a much better mood, still tittering and joking.

From that day forward, our relationship got even closer, and all it took was that one silly moment of laughter to remind us that no matter how serious things may seem, there's always something to laugh about.
