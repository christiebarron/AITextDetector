At the end of the poem, Minfong Ho is suggesting that life is cyclical, and that things often come back around. He uses the metaphor of the hibiscus to link the idea that sometimes, when we find ourselves in difficult and challenging situations, we have the opportunity to try again, and to potentially have a different result. The poem ends on an optimistic note, encouraging the reader to look for second chances in life.
