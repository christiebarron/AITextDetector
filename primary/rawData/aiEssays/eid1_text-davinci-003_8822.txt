When my friend and I were in middle school, we would always get in trouble for laughing too loud, and our teacher would often find fun ways to punish us. One day she gave us each an index card and told us we had to write our own jokes and stand up in front of the class and tell them to one another. We were embarrassed but at the same time excited to show off our talents.

So, we settled into writing our jokes and to our surprise, we were actually quite good at it! When it was time to stand in front of the class and tell our jokes to one another, we were scared out of our wits, but we got up and faced the music.

I'll never forget the reaction from the class - my friend went first and I could barely contain my laughter as her joke was too funny for words! Then it was my turn and I just blurted out the best joke I could think of. The whole class burst into laughter and we just couldn't help ourselves, we both started laughing too!

It felt so good to share that moment and to make everyone laugh - it was a very special moment that I will never forget and I'll always cherish the laughter that we shared.
