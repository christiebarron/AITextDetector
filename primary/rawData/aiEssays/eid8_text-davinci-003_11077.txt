I recently had the pleasure to make the acquaintance of a friend of a friend, and we quickly found that we had a lot in common. On our third meeting, we had arranged a kayaking trip down a local river. Despite a few mishaps with our equipment, things were going smoothly, until my companion had somehow managed to tilt his kayak over in the shallow water and rolled out in a heaving splash!

At first I was a bit taken aback â€“ both from the shock of seeing him tumble and the fear of what his reaction would be after what had happened. But a few seconds later, to my surprise, instead of getting angry or embarrassed, he started to laugh. The joy of his laughter was contagious and I started laughing too. It was a moment of such joy, the sound of our laughter echoing across the river. We laughed for several minutes, and the feeling of shared mirth was amazing! 

We kayaked the rest of the way down the river with far fewer hassles, which I think was due in part to our new-found camaraderie and low-key mood. We ended our excursion with a goodbye hug, both grateful for the laughs we had shared on the water. 

It has been a few weeks since our trip together, but I still remember the feeling of being true friends when we first shared our laughter. It reminds me of how important it is to take pleasure in the little moments,
