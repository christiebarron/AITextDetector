Dear Editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the profound and long-lasting effects that computers have had on people and our society.

In today's society, computers are ever-present, to the point where modern life is inseparable from them. They play a vital role in our day to day activities and hold tremendous potential for growth and development.

One area in particular where computers provide great benefit is in communication. They allow us to stay connected with friends and family who may be scattered across the globe. We can interact and work together in ways that were never possible before.

In addition, computers are useful tools for learning and research. With such vast amounts of information available at our fingertips, many people would agree that our access to knowledge has been greatly enhanced. 

Furthermore, computers create new opportunities for people to be creative. With video editing and music production software, people can express themselves in unprecedented ways.

Overall, I believe computers have had a largely positive impact on people and society. They facilitate an ever-growing flow of information and knowledge, provide essential tools for communication, and give people new outlets for creativity. 

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
