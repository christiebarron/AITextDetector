I was out with my best friend, Danielle. We had made plans to go to a party that night, and we were getting ready to leave. We were both a little nervous and jittery as we stepped out the door. 

We had been friends for a few years but we weren't that close yet. As we got on the street corner and started walking to the party, we started chatting about nothing in particular. We were both awkward and uncomfortable, and I was starting to get embarrassed because I felt like I was being too quiet.

At one point, I made a joke that was so terrible that even I couldn't help laughing. Danielle took it one step further and started skit-acting out her response to my joke. She got so into it that I couldn't help but join in and start laughing, and soon we were both in stitches. 

The laughter broke the ice between us and soon we were joking and laughing without inhibition. We talked the whole way to the party, and when we arrived, we were both more relaxed and confident.

Laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people, and that night, that's exactly what happened with me and my best friend Danielle.
