The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho is symbolic of new beginnings and possibility. By ending with this line, the author suggests that the protagonist has the opportunity to learn and grow from their mistakes and start anew. The imagery of the snows melting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding represent the idea of transformation and hope. These words suggest that when the winter ends and the spring arrives, a new chance will come to face the challenges and adversities life throws at them and that the protagonist is ready to make the most of that chance.
