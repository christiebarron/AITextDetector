I was walking in the mall when I saw something that was amusing - a woman was trying on a funny looking Halloween costume that looked like something out of a fairy-tale. I stifled a chuckle as I walked past, but before I could make it any further, I heard a voice from behind me. 

"Hey, if you're gonna laugh, you better join me!" It was the woman who had been trying on the costume, and she was gesturing for me to come over. Amused and a little embarrassed, I slowly walked towards her, ready to apologize for my seemingly rude laughter. 

But before I had the chance to say anything, she beat me to it, asking if I wanted to take a picture with her. I was totally taken aback but eventually agreed and the next thing I knew, we were posing for the camera laughing and posing for silly pictures while passersby watched. We had a good time in that moment, and I left the mall that day knowing laughter was the shortcut to true friendship.
