I recently had an experience with someone being incredibly patient with me. My friend had gotten a new job and asked for my help in updating his resume. Although he had some experience, he didn't know what should be included. We sat down together to go over the details. I had a lot of questions and, in my eagerness to help him, I kept pressing him for more and more details. 

He responded to each of my questions cheerfully and was extremely patient with me. It was clear that he was putting a lot of effort into gathering the information that I needed. He was also really understanding when I couldn't remember something that needed to be included in his resume. He never once complained or seemed frustrated.

At the end of our session, the resume was complete and looked great. I was amazed at his patience. He had gone above and beyond to make sure that everything was perfect. His patience was truly remarkable and inspiring.
