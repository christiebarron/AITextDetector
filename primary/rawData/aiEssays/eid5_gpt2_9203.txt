The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' has raised tensions between American and Ukrainian voters.

In the past few days, protesters have formed demonstrations in key cities of Ukraine.

An AP reporter spoke with several people working in a Ukrainian civil society group involved in monitoring protest movements in both cities.

He said there was a "dire need" for an investigation of the protests in Crimea, which is governed by Kiev and the Russian Federation.

In Crimea, the demonstrators have also taken to the streets demanding the release of pro-Russia figures linked mainly to President Vladimir Putin.

Mr Yanukovych was ousted from office over a corruption scandal and had become a vocal critic of the Russian leader.

He was then elected to parliament in February, where Mr Yanukovych resigned in February.
