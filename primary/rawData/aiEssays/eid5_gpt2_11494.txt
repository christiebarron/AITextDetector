The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' was one of a kind, said Mr Zukan, but he could have done with a little more detail. Asked what led him to conclude that Mr Obama might need a change of heart, he said: "I think he needed not just a change of heart but a change of tune. He needed to have an open mind."

Although he was not able to write a few words about his experience and his own personal situation in the months immediately following the incident -- including a detailed breakdown of what transpired at the time of his arrest -- Mr Zukan did write of the atmosphere around him. "It was completely normal," he wrote. "It didn't change that much. There was a lot of 'bubbly' behavior. There was nothing that was like other people in this group. There was nothing that was less than exemplary at times. Everyone was relaxed and seemed to be trying to make fun of everybody. The staff and everybody knew what was going on and there was just no one there that could have imagined that a terrorist might walk up and threaten them and attack them."

His book was published in December 2014 by Penguin India.
