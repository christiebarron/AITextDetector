The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because the narrator is still a man.

Futility in the Medieval Church is not limited to the "holy war", as is the situation when the sword is involved. It allows people to exercise their own freedom in a place where it was previously ruled over, and to think about alternatives and alternatives to it whenever they'd rather see it, when a certain type of action is more difficult, less difficult and ultimately less beneficial. The main issue with this kind of secularism is that it limits both our freedom to choose what is and is not in front of us, but we're still free to be in it ourselves and to want others to choose what is and is not in the past.

But this isn't to say that medieval Christianity can't be seen as too extreme with the sword in hand. It certainly can. Some medieval Christianity, for example, is far more explicit about what a Christian can do in opposition to what others might find objectionable. It's the same as a western state of affairs today, and it's not very radical. There are even more extreme interpretations of Christianity today, such as the belief that the use of the sword with other men is prohibited (the Qur'an has explicitly banned it from its mosques). Even some Christian sects have made a concerted effort to make the sword seem less violent.
