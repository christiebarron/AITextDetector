The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The problem was that the pilots kept their guns within close range, as if they did not feel obliged to engage the foe. The Empire State Building of the United States of America was built in 1836 by a former German-American architect Dr. John Schiller, and was the first known space model built using this technique. guarded by American engineers and U.S. Navy ships. The only part of the Building that the U.S. Navy did not care for was the pilot. This meant that a number of problems had to be overcome. First, the pilot had to be able to take off from one corner of hashes, such as the side rail. Second, the pilot would have to be able to land between the aircraft nose and the fuselage. A third problem in the construction of the Building was that its weight was not so great (the airplane was only about 8 pounds less than it was before the airplane). Finally, the pilot would have to control and maintain the aircraft's forward, forward and rear controls. Both of these problems necessitated some kind of vertical stabilizer and other control devices. The problem with having a pilot so powerful as to do some of these tasks without having him pilot the airplane was that pilots were not able to practice proper flight in the hangar. During World War I, the Pilot was given a certificate to start at his new home on the south side of buildings.
