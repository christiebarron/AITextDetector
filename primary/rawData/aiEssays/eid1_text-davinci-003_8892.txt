I love to laugh with my best friend. It can add real joy to any activity we're doing together â€” from watching movies to taking road trips.

Just the other day, we were driving back from the beach and she was sharing a funny story about something that happened at work. She was really hamming it up, switching her voice and throwing in some silly accents. Suddenly, I looked over at her and started giggling uncontrollably. 

She noticed and immediately started to laugh, too. It was one of those deep belly laughs that just makes you feel good. We both ended up laughing so hard that it became contagious! 

By the time we reached our destination, our stomachs were aching and tears were streaming down our faces. It was a silly, light-hearted moment that I will never forget.

Laughing together is a simple but powerful way to strengthen our friendship. It's one of the best things about having a best friend, and I'm grateful to have her as a confidante and a source of happiness in my life.
