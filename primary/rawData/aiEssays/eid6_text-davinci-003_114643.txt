One of the most iconic landmarks of the New York City skyline, the Empire State Building was not only the tallest building in the world for many decades, but upon its completion in 1931, it also became one of the first buildings designed to accommodate the docking of dirigibles. In her book “The Mooring Mast”, Marcia Amidon Lüsted describes the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock. 

The advent of airships (dirigibles) in the early 20th century brought with it the challenge of allowing these large vessels to make landing, particularly in densely populated cities. Since dirigibles needed a large and projecting structure to either support the ship, or tie it down, it was clear that a custom support, or mooring mast, was needed for the Empire State Building. The designers faced a number of challenges in making this mast structural sound and able to support the weight of a ship. 

For starters, the supporting structure needed to be particularly lightweight, given the height of the building and the fact that dirigibles are significantly lighter than airplanes. With this in mind, designers used a technique called cantilevering to ensure that the structure could support the weight of the dirigible when it was docked. This entailed using a large truss steel attached to structural members cantilevering out over the mooring patch on the roof of the building.
