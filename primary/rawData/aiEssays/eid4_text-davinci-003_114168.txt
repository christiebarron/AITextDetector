Minfong Ho ends Winter Hibiscus with this line to suggest that the protagonist, Leng, has learned a powerful lesson from seeing the hibiscus endure winter weather. She has been struggling with her studies, but the hibiscus offers her a metaphor of resilience. She will take her test again in spring, suggesting that she too will persist and ultimately succeed. The ending also implies a greater connection to nature, which is often represented in the Chinese literary tradition. The hope for a successful outcome is combined with the expectation of nature's own time-dependent rebirth each year.
