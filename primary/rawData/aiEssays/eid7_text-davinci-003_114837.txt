Sometimes patience doesn't come easily to me, especially when I'm feeling overwhelmed. But there was a time recently when I showed remarkable patience.

I was travelling back to my home city from a work trip. I was already anxious about travelling with the current pandemic, but then my flight got cancelled. I had to rebook all of my travel, staying in the same airport overnight. 

I was stressed, scared, and exhausted, and all I wanted to do was get home. But I knew I had no choice but to stay and wait. I used the time I had to find a nice spot to sleep, and figure out my new travel plans. 

When my new flight was going to arrive, my patience was tested yet again when it was delayed for 10 hours. I wanted to get angry and frustrated, but instead I stayed calm. I took deep breaths, reminded myself that I couldn't control the situation I was in, and tried to see the positive side of things.

 Thankfully, my patience eventually paid off and my flight eventually departed. Now when I'm feeling impatient, I try to think back to that day, and remember that although it was tough, I handled it with grace.
