The ending of Minfong Ho's poem, Winter Hibiscus, is meant to provide the speaker with hope in the face of adversity. The speaker was reluctant to take the English language test that could potentially grant them a green card, which in turn, could signify a better life and future for them. The hope lies in the fact that the speaker knows that no matter what, they will return in the spring with the potential of a fresh start and another chance. The imagery of the budding hibiscus speaks to the renewal, resilience, and growth, in contrast to the freezing winter. The ending emphasizes the speaker’s courage in the face of struggles and how they are still hopeful in spite of all of life’s challenges.
