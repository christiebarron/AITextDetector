The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. This was the moment they tried to stop people from falling over and landing safely. The construction was so bad, the U.S. government cancelled the project in December of 2011.

The first such project was a 3-story, 20,000-square-foot apartment building at 675-0607 Longwood Ave. in St. Louis City. The building housed 2 million households, but the cost was too high for a single person to build it. The city council agreed to waive or suspend construction and start work in 2016. That's when the building's owners purchased a 20 percent stake through a bond issue in 2015. That led to numerous delays and costly repairs. The building closed for repairs in May of 2016.

Since then, nearly 90 miles of the freeway and other roadway has been open to vehicular traffic, which is a particularly sensitive area of the interstate. But that hasn't always been the case. There were numerous crashes on the freeway between 2002 as the building's roof got blown. Cars were eruption, with some drivers breaking into vehicles from underneath.
