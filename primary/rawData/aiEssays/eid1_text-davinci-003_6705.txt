I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have had on people. In this day and age, it is nearly impossible to go through life without some form of digital device, whether it be a smartphone, laptop, or computer. Technology brings a lot of great advantages, such as greater access to information and the ability to enhance communication across the globe. However, I believe there are potential negative consequences if computers are used in excess.

The lack of human interaction can lead to social isolation and loneliness, not to mention symptoms of anxiety and depression. 

In short, computers are an invaluable tool in this day and age, but it is important to keep the usage of these devices in balance. Spend time being active, socializing with friends, and being in contact with nature. All of these things can go a long way towards improving our physical and mental well
