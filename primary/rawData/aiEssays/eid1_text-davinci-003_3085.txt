Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Many people argue that modern computers are not beneficial to society and are detrimental to our lives. As a computer scientist and advocate for technology, I disagree.

Computers revolutionized the way humans interact with information. Before computers, we relied on paper-based storage and analog production; gathering and processing information was a time-consuming task. Now, with modern computers and the internet, information is easily accessible and production is much faster. Computers have made our lives much easier by drastically reducing the amount of time and effort it takes to carry out everyday tasks.

Furthermore, computers have the potential to bring people together. By connecting computers together, people can communicate with each other from almost anywhere in the world in a fraction of a second. This is invaluable in enabling us to bridge language, cultural, and economic barriers. Computers have also enabled people to develop relationships and foster collaborations between communities all over the world.

In conclusion, computers have been an integral piece of the advancement of humanity throughout the past few decades. They have drastically changed the ways in which we access and process information, interact with each other, and foster collaborations
