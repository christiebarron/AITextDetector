As libraries have traditionally been havens of free-thought and education, it may seem counterintuitive to suggest limiting access to certain books, music, movies, or magazines because their content is considered too controversial or offensive. However, in the interest of protecting patrons (particularly children) from material which may be traumatizing or inflammatory, the suggestion that libraries censor certain materials can no longer be overlooked. 

When we think of what it means to protect children, we tend to think of active physical protection, like building a fence to keep a playground safe, or teaching children to avoid touching a hot stove. But there is also an important role for protecting children’s minds. Research has clearly shown that viewing violent or explicit content can have a wide range of long-term, negative impacts on a child’s physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing. With this knowledge in hand, it becomes increasingly clear that information access should be limited or limited in some circumstances.

It is the responsibility of libraries not only to encourage learning, but also to protect patrons from harm. Libraries can take steps that are both effective and respectful of free speech, by ensuring that shelves are well-ordered and allowing for free access to materials that both adults and children need. Libraries can also ensure that potentially harmful material is stored in a separate area away from children, and that it is only available to patrons over a certain age.
