The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, the Empire State Building needed permission from the Federal Railroad Commission to construct a dirigible but did not meet one of its requirements. Later on, that authority was withdrawn, and a special agency created. A special unit of the Federal Railroad Commission known as the "Supervisors of the Federal Building Authority" met almost immediately to consider the proposed dirigibles and then decided it would be necessary for the building to undergo repairs. When the project was completed, at the behest of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, there were few plans to make the building open to the public. The only two open-source projects were the original design and the concept, which was later modified to permit two dirigibles.

To give our reader a taste of the situation, here's some early design data we've collected about the project and the design plan for the second dirigible, the National Weather Service Weather System Center.

A dirigible (and a variety of other types of aircraft with built-in umbrellas, depending on weather conditions) is a space-time phenomenon that has been observed and studied for decades. Although it is not yet in production, its presence might soon become commonplace in the skies. In the coming years, the Weather Model, created by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and installed on the National
