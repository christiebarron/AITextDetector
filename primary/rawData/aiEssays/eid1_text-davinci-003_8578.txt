My patience was tested recently when I was rushing to attend an important meeting. It had been a hectic morning and I was already running late, so when I got to the bus stop and saw that the bus didn't arrive, I was tempted to get annoyed. I tried to remain calm and took out my phone to check for alternative routes. While I was waiting, I noticed a family of four getting out of their car and walking towards me. They were in the same situation as I was, trying to get to the same meeting. We then spent 10 minutes waiting together.

After a few minutes of waiting in silence, the father started talking to me and thanked me for being patient. He explained that they were running late as well and that it was kind of me to wait without expressing my annoyance. His words showed me that my patience was appreciated and it was a reminder to stay calm even when things donâ€™t go our way. A few minutes after that conversation, the bus finally arrived and we were able to arrive at our destination. Since then, I have made sure to practice patience even in challenging situations.
