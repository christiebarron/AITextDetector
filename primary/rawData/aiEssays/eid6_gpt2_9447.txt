The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Since they weren't licensed, they needed to build all the rooms with the "right" wiring from a power supply or a fan. That would take an hour, but construction crew came up with the perfect arrangement and built them on top of a 20-foot long plywood spire.

What exactly was it that created the dirigible design? That's not really clear, but it was likely a project of engineering ingenuity involving a skilled group of engineers with strong training in engineering and engineering science. One of the earliest models from the Empire was the U.S. Army's AIM-129, which in 1945 became the first flight of a small, unmanned aerial vehicle. These days, a D-24 model would fly the most of any small, portable model found on the street, as seen here with the Lockheed Martin D- realm aircraft on display at the American International Auto Show.

In 1959, the AIM-129 (known as the ILS-9; later renamed the VNU-132 aircraft) took off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. It was a sleek and elegant aircraft that didn't give a flying impression until 1966, when the AIM-129 went on a one-way trip to Mexico for refueling that same year. The rest of the first flight took place, however, in a remote part of the desert. The aircraft was in production at
