An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a year ago when I got a book by a friend who was so depressed he kept reading it for hours every night for fear of going to bed. I never did anything about that. The writer of the book kept telling me to try not to get depressed but when I did I was happy for a few days, so I just went for it. I never stopped doing it, never stopped doing it. It's just been more difficult."

"That is amazing because this means so much to me and I'm so proud of her," he continues. "I've always loved her. She's a real soul. I can't imagine that at the same age she was sitting in this hospital with me. That's why I write my own books and I would be so happy to be able to do that. She's my son, but she knows how to get through the worst situation in lifeâ€”so much worse, I would tell my children I love them so dearly."
