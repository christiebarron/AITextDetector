I was visiting my friend's house for a late lunch, but when I arrived she had already set the table and was making sandwiches. She was in the middle of cutting the bread, but stopped when she saw me with an exaggerated look of surprise on her face.

"Did you think I wasn't going to show up for lunch?" I asked with a mischievous smile on my face.

My friend laughed out loud and said, "Of course not, I was just hoping to surprise you with some delicious sandwiches!"

My friend's response made me burst out laughing. We both laughed until tears streamed down our faces. We laughed until it felt like it was infectious, and soon we were both leaning on each other, unable to stop.

It was in that moment that I felt so connected to her, as if laughter was the shortest distance between two people. It was a moment I would never forget and I was grateful for the powerful connection we had formed with laughter.
