The builders of the Empire State Building faced several major obstacles when attempting to allow the mooring of dirigibles at its peak. In 1930, the idea of mooring dirigibles at the Empire State Building seemed far fetched. Nevertheless, the concept captured the fancy of the public and construction teams moved forward with their plans to make it happen. 

The first obstacle was the top of the building itself. The tip of the Empire State Building was round, while airships of the time had square bows. A solution was proposed to just add a mast to the building, which would allow the airships to tether to it. There was a problem though; the weight and size of such a mast would cause too much stress on the building and could potentially cause it to collapse. With this in mind, the proposed mast was only made of light, thin metal poles. 

The second obstacle was the direction and velocity of the wind at the top of the building. Being so high up, there was fear that the winds were too strong and would cause the dirigibles to drift away or push them into the side of the building. To combat this, a lattice-like structure was designed to funnel the winds to lessen their force. 

The third obstacle was one of safety. To ensure that mooring dirigibles would not cause any damage to the building, several safety mechanisms were put in place. The most notable of which was the
