It comes amid the latest controversy surrounding an interview in November during which Ms Houghton complained she was told she could not receive an interview and denied being on "a flight from London" to Los Angeles.

A source close to the singer said Ms Houghton had been told about the incident on the flight that was flying from London to Phoenix

The former musician was given the chance to offer her opinion that she was being refused an interview following an 'incident' at a nightclub in Los Angeles on November 17.

Ms Houghton told ABC's AM program that the incident - which she did not identify - was'really a shock' and that she will remain loyal to her music career.

'It was quite a shock. The feeling that my wife told me it was in Los Angeles, it was in Los Angeles. They had a chat,' she said.

'My name has been on the plane and I think I was asked to speak about it. I'm not saying I can't get an interview.

'When I did get an interview I was just really looking forward to the day that I would say I had an article in issue of our magazine in which I would write about what happened in LA and what has become of me.'
