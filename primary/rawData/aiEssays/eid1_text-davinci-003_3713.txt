Dear Editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Computers have drastically changed the way we live our lives and interact with one another. Despite the tangible and intangible benefits we have gained from the advancement of technology, I believe that over-exposure to computers has led to a number of concerning issues.

At first, computers brought convenience into our lives. We could now purchase items without leaving the comforts of our homes, access the internet to do research, and even hold conversations with loved ones from miles away. However, when over-used, people begin to lose sight of the value of real-life human interaction. With the influx of social media and other virtual communication platforms, people begin to use computers as a means of escaping the physical world. This phenomenon can lead to mental health issues such as depression and anxiety, as relationships stop becoming real and start becoming digital.

The effects of computers go beyond mental health implications. How often do you see people staring into their phones, watching television, or playing video games without moving? This has led to a decrease in physical activity, resulting in serious physical health conditions for many individuals. 

I am sure the readers of your newspaper will agree with me that, although computers can be a great asset, it is important that we use them in moderation and always keep in mind the significance of making meaningful connections with others in the real world. 

Sincerely,
