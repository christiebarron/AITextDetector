Dear Editors of the [Newspaper],

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers and technology have been having on people’s lives. I believe that computers are undeniably a great invention and have opened up so many new and exciting opportunities. However, I am concerned about the adverse effects they have, specifically in regards to our health and relationship with the people closest to us.

It seems that computers have become an integral part of our lives, so much so that it’s easy for us to have very little face-to-face interaction with our loved ones, due to so much of our communication now becoming virtual. Even in an office setting, technology has replaced many traditional methods of communication which is great for efficiency, but can be harmful when there is not a balance struck between personal interaction and screens. Furthermore, studies have shown that long-term use (especially with exposure to low levels of radiation) of computers and screens can have adverse effects on our health. 

Thus, it is important that we use computers and technology in moderation. We should use them only to supplement meaningful real-life conversations, activities, and interactions with the people around us. Technology should never replace but always
