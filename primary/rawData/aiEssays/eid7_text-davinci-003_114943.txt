I was helping my ten-year-old niece with her math homework the other day. She had been struggling with fractions ever since the start of the school year, so I offered to help her out. The first few minutes went alright, but then she started to get frustrated and began to get uppity with me.

At first I felt my temper rising, but then I decided to take a deep breath and be patient. I realized that it was just a matter of breaking down the concepts in a way that she could understand. So I started to explain things slowly and used different analogies until something clicked in her head.

Little by little, the frustration disappeared and she started to understand the material. By the time we were done she had a grasp of the concepts and a big smile on her face. I was proud that I was able to stay patient in the face of her frustration and that she was able to recognize it as well. It was definitely worth it in the end!
