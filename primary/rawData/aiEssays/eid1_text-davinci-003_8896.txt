It was one of those days when nothing seemed to go right. I had a flat tire, my wallet had gone missing, and I was running late for work. I was feeling pretty desperate until I walked into the office and saw my co-worker, Sam, doubled over in laughter.

At first, I thought something was terribly wrong, until Sam looked up and saw me. Instantly, his face lit up and he started cackling even louder. “Oh geez, John!” he exclaimed. “Look what I got in the mail today… a book about the history of the whoopee cushion!”

Sam proceeded to show me a very large book, which contained some very interesting diagrams and information about the classic gag item. We spent the next 20 minutes flipping through the pages and laughing at the various facts about the whoopee cushion. After a while, I forgot all my troubles and just enjoyed the moment.

I was so thankful that Sam was there to lighten things up. I will always look back on that moment fondly. There is simply nothing like sharing a good laugh with a loved one.
