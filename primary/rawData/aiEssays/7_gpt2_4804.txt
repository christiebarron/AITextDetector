An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the person my wife asked for service with me. It's a great moment to take a moment to see, to be in a place where you never thought possible.

This kind of love means that I can trust myself, a lot, that I'm going to make things right.

I used to have my doubts a million years ago.

This is why my wife's eyes are always open.

I trust what I know… I trust the world that you're going to do right, to stay right… and when I'm going to be okay.

As a human being, I believe in everything that is good, bad, ugly – that's your job, your life.

Everything is good.

And when that is, you can trust those things!

You're going to be the one who makes this decision right and you're going to see things, be present in the face of obstacles, just because you're going to get it.

So when you're in a position to help, don't worry because if I am able to, I can help too.

But don't lose your sense of justice.

You're going to see things that you didn't see before, but you'll appreciate, too, if I can.

I'd like to call you…
