Computers have many effects on people. In a recent poll of 1,000 Americans, 78% agreed that computers are "less likely" to cause health problems, and 54% agreed that computers cause "an unreasonable risk of diseases." Yet scientists argue that this is because their studies don't investigate such things as the effect of different forms of medicine on people's immune systems.

The science of artificial intelligence, for example, is more complicated. It's not a real phenomenon. As we study the effects of the brain on humans, it could make more sense to explore its effects on the human brain, and hence to better understand its function. And since it's not an experimental issue that can be used to assess how people will respond, the field can help us understand how different types of artificial intelligence work in the real world.

In the U.S., for example, researchers have shown that certain kinds of neurochemical modifications have been shown to make people more empathetic toward other people. They've learned that people with autism — such as those who don't display empathy for others, as shown by the autistic personality disorder — are more likely to be social than non-autistic people, and people who do not exhibit any signs of empathy — such as anxiety and depression, often show no more than a slight social resemblance to humans. But they also found that social differences between humans and non-autistic people was correlated more strongly with affective disorder, such as conscientious objection,
