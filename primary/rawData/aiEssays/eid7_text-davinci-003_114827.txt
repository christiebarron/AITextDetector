One time I was in class and there was a student who was having a really hard time understanding the material. We were covering a lesson about math concepts that was a particularly difficult one for the student. The student sat there for a good while, struggling to understand what was going on. Everyone was getting a little impatient but I just stayed focused and tried to help the student in any way that I could.

I asked if I could explain it in a different way and if there was anything we could do to help the student better understand the topic. Eventually, after a while of trying different things, the student was finally able to figure out the material. Everyone was very relieved and we all thanked the student for their patience and effort. I was really proud of all of us for being patient and not giving up on the student.
