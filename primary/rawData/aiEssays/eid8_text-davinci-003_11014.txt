I've never laughed so hard in my life than when I was with my girlfriend. We'd been together for about six months and had been having a lot of fun going out together.

One day, we decided to go to a park and take a romantic stroll. As we strolled, we started making up funny stories involving people we knew or situations we'd been in. We were having so much fun laughing at ourselves and at each other that it wasn't too long before we had tears streaming down our faces. 

My stomach was in knots and my cheeks and stomach hurt so much from laughing. Eventually, when we couldn't take it anymore, we laid down on the grass and just laughed uncontrollably for a good few minutes. 

It was one of the most amazing moments I've ever had. I can still remember it now, all these years later. I'm sure everyone around us must have thought we were crazy, but it was one of the best moments of my life, and I'm sure my girlfriend felt the same way. 

It's moments like that which remind you that laughter is truly the shortest distance between two people.
