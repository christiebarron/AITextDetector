Dear Editor, 

Recently, there has been a lot of debate over the effects of computers on people. Undeniably, advances in technology have improved the lives of people everywhere, offering a wealth of information, entertainment, and educational opportunities, and making tasks easier and more efficient. However, I believe that too much reliance on computers can have a detrimental effect on people. 

Robotic automation on computers has replaced the critical-thinking skills of people in many industries, leading to reduced quality of work. Technology has also created a great deal of distraction, with people spending far too much of their time on social media, gaming, and other virtual activities. This negates the true purpose of computers, which is to ease the burden of completing daily tasks. 

Furthermore, computers have been linked to numerous health problems, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, eyestrain, and headache. Prolonged use of devices can reduce physical activity, leading to greater rates of obesity. Additionally, computers can lead to social isolation, as people increasingly rely on them for communication.

In summary, while computers are helpful, they should not become a replacement for the skills and social interactions that are essential to healthy development. By
