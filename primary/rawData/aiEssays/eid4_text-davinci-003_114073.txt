The author is using this ending to emphasize the symbolic significance of the winter hibiscus, which serves as the main source of hope that the main character, a young Cambodian refugee, clings to. The winter hibiscus is a rare flower that can thrive in extreme temperatures, a symbol of resilience that the character needs to meeting the difficult challenges of the future. By ending her story with the promise of renewal that the flower will bring in the spring, the author reinforces the idea that all experiences are not necessarily negative, and everyone has the potential for growth and success.
