I was in a grocery store checkout line when I suddenly realized I had forgotten my wallet at home. I started to panic, but then remembered that my brother had shown up to do his weekly shopping at the same time. I quickly begged him to lend me some money to pay for the groceries I had already put on the conveyor belt. 

At first, he seemed frustrated and started to lecture me on how it wasn't a good habit to forget my wallet, but instead of getting mad he tried to remain calm. He could see I already felt really embarrassed and just said a simple “It’s alright.” That was all I needed to hear to stay composed and after a few more reassuring words, he took out his wallet and paid for my groceries. 

Throughout the whole experience, my brother showed me patience and understanding — he didn't make me feel bad about forgetting my wallet, and instead tried to calm me down and help me out of my mistake.
