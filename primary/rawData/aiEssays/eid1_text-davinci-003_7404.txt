The ending of Minfong Ho's poem Winter Hibiscus serves as a metaphor for resilience and hope, suggesting that although the speaker has failed an important academic test, they can look ahead to a new beginning and the chance to start over. The imagery of springtime, of nature awakening from its winter slumber, implies that difficult times can come to an end and new beginnings can emerge from the darkness. In this way, the speaker is encouraged to remain hopeful and determined, for better times lie ahead.
