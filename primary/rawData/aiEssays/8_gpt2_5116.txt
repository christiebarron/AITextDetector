One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my dad brought me home and I told him about my father's death after it happened, but he gave me no information. He knew what was going on because of the TV show."

In a subsequent interview with The Telegraph, I asked him if it was a shock that his mother wanted him to go to school instead of going to high school. He replied: "I can't understand why."

My father was born in the capital of the south east in 1918 and moved to Manchester, where he continued to attend Oxford. He returned to his home in Manchester, where he studied theatre and literature, and went to Oxford, where he received a degree in architecture from University College London.

In 1941, he moved to a very affluent suburb of London where he studied engineering, painting and literature. "It was like living with your father and mother at home," he says. "He brought all these things where they had so much in common together, that there was real difference between them in my view."

After the war, he decided to focus his education on English literature and decided lymphatics were a brilliant option. As a result, he became a private tutor for an adult male who trained to be a physiotherapist, often visiting with him.

He also worked as a physiotherapist at a hospital in London where he learned that when women become pregnant they will become breast cancer sufferers.
