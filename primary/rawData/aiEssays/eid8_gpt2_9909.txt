One time I experienced laughter in my life was when you had someone you weren't supposed to share to hate. Or maybe I would have seen it as an insult, and wondered why not just apologize? It is because when you are feeling down, that is where it is most funny (if not hilarious) to express your lack of empathy, which is especially true for me. "Good joke about it" is like a compliment, just like "you suck", "you're so low it hurts to even consider a joke" is an insult. This whole situation was a lesson to us all.

I understand that "good joke about it" is not funny anymore. In order to actually truly become great, you need a better idea of humour, both within itself and beyond. The less it feels like comedy (and more often it is just plain dumb humor), the more good humour is going to be found and you will begin to build something positive (or at least positive) out of it.

If you don't understand that joke, then I know you are not going to laugh. You will start to realize your situation without much thought, and whenanches are an awesome way to get into a good relationship with others. I know this is hard, but the bottom line is this. For many of you.
