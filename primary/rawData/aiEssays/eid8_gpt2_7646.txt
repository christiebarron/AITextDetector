One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was playing with my friend. He had been crying for years and I could see it in his face. I felt like a father figure crying over my son. And I said to him, "Where is he?" He was still laughing. Eventually I was able to stop laughing as tears drained from my eyes and face. This story resonated with me and I went to see the doctor and he told me he had no memory of what happened collects a doctor's card so his life would be better than mine. But, I am thinking it might be a bit dangerous when you live in a place like Chicago. I will be going back soon and I would like to thank Dr. Lee for being so kind to me for having some of these questions that I feel need answering. I am sure his life will be better in the future.
