I was standing in line at the grocery store, feeling anxious and out of sorts. As I stood there waiting my turn to checkout, I noticed the woman in front of me starting to chuckle. Curious, I asked her what was so amusing. She pointed to a bag of candy near the register and said, “I can’t believe it! I’ve been looking for this candy ever since I moved here two months ago. Everywhere I looked, it wasn’t to be found.” We shared a laugh and I immediately felt my mood lifting. 

Our conversation quickly flowed from the candy to what we each did for work, to our hobbies and kids. As we talked, I noticed how my body started to relax and my tension began to ease. I suddenly realized that I hadn’t made a real connection with anyone since I moved here and it was nice to have an easy and light feeling conversation. As we finished talking and said goodbye, I thanked her for the casual chat and found myself smiling.

I had momentarily forgotten my anxiousness and allowed myself to share in her joy at finding something she had been searching for. In a moment of humor and laughter, my mood shifted and I felt reconnected to the world around me. Perhaps the shortest distance between two people really is a good shared laugh.
