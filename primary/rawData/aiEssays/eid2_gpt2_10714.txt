I believe that censorship of materials in libraries, restaurants, theaters and other workplaces should be eliminated to preserve quality and due to public safety. By removing this kind of material from the public domain this can create a problem that has already been addressed but cannot be reversed or reversed.


"The problem is not one of censorship," said John E. Ariely, the co-chairman of the American Library Association's Subcommittee on Public Literature and Information Technology. "Instead the problem is one of control over who we get to access and it is in our interest to ensure the quality of libraries as well as our ability to control how we access all of our public domain materials and content that the public can access."


The current problem, he said, is in the hands of certain government agencies. "The biggest problem, I think, with the Internet is that it is in its infancy and is not necessarily a comprehensive solution to this problem."


The Public Library Association's Webmaster explained why this problem is so important, in a statement:


"There are many problems graphical user interface in the Internet and the problem that has been getting worse in our country for many years has resulted in the Internet not being able to respond properly to many requests, changes, or changes in technology to address these problems. Many people continue to say what if we started an Internet service and, with our efforts to improve the Internet, we would be able to do this. We don't know what would happen
