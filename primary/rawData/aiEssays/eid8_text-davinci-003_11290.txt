Growing up, my best friend was like a sister to me. We met in kindergarten and have been inseparable ever since. We shared laughter and tears together, and often found ourselves in the same outrageous situations. 

No matter how hard things got in life, we could always count on each other for a good laugh.

Recently, my friend got tickets to a sold-out comedy show. At the time, I was feeling down and out and she thought some laughs would do us both good. On the night of the show, we were both giddy with anticipation and entered the theater with huge smiles.

Once the show started, we held our sides, tears streaming down our face from laughing so hard. The comedianâ€™s jokes were ridiculous, and my friend and I could barely keep it together. 

We were in such a fit of laughter that several of the people around us gave us the nasty side eye and we only laughed harder. Everyone might have thought we were obnoxious, but there I was, enjoying a wonderful moment with my best friend.
