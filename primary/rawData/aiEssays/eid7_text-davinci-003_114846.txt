I was once in a situation where a friend asked me for a favor, and it was something that I was not expecting. She asked me to watch her dog for the weekend, and to be honest, I was dreading it because I have never dealt with an animal this size before. I was overwhelmed with taking care of the dog, plus there were a few other things that I had going on during the weekend.

But, I knew that my friend was going through a rough patch and she really needed my help. So, I was patient and I agreed to watch her dog. I took the time to learn about its figure of train and how to properly care for it, and eventually I felt like I was doing a decent job with it.

My friend was so thankful for my patience and understanding when she returned and really appreciated how I stepped in and took care of her pet. I was glad I was able to help in this situation and it taught me how to be more patient and understanding when it comes to a friend in need.
