The ending of Winter Hibiscus makes reference to the cyclical nature of life, as represented primarily by the hibiscus. As the hibiscus blooms each spring, it serves as a reminder that failure should not be seen as a permanence, but rather as a temporary setback. Furthermore, despite the difficulty of life during the winter months—both for the hibiscus and the protagonist—spring always brings the promise of new beginnings and better days to come. Thus, the ending of Winter Hibiscus serves as a symbol of hope and perseverance in difficult times.
