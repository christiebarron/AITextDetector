Computers have many effects on people.

What effects are there?

There are many good effects. One is the influence on motivation. "It makes our head explode, so it makes us look good. It makes us feel happy and we love ourselves, and all these things." It makes us happier, because it makes your life more enjoyable. And I think this is just what happens. People find happiness in the fact that they have something to feel good about, instead of wanting to change anything that can't affect them.

My personal favorite effect is the fact that you really like yourself. You're happy, that you're having fun, which allows you to do all kinds of good things. It's interesting to watch these people talk and to see how they talk, because they know what's going on with their brains, their personalities, and they want to learn. I'm not saying just people like your character, and their stories. I'm saying to me, who I am, what I think I like, and my favorite things, the things about myself that help. That's all there is in the world.

What is the secret of enjoying yourself?

Nothing. I don't want to be in a relationship. I think I could love myself if I could. I don't care what people think. I didn't play any of their tunes. I never really looked at their music. I was a music listener.
