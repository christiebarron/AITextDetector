Building the Empire State Building was an extraordinary undertaking that posed numerous obstacles. One of the most difficult challenges was figuring out a way to allow dirigibles to dock at and take off from the building’s upper floors. The risk of allowing the large airships to moor to the skyscraper was immense and needed to be addressed.

The plan to incorporate a mooring mast into the Empire State Building was initially proposed by journalist Kenneth Judge in 1929. Judge’s idea was to build a mast that would extend to a height of 300 feet from the 86th floor, allowing dirigibles to dock and making Manhattan the hub of air traffic for the East Coast. Although the engineering of the mast alone was a daunting task, the countless regulations, safety codes, and other guidelines for airships that had to be considered posed an even greater challenge.

According to writer Marcia Amidon Lüsted in her article “The Mooring Mast,” the Federal Bureau of Air Commerce had to approve the plan of mooring dirigibles to the Empire State Building. Additionally, a team of engineers had to study the technology of the mast itself, to make sure that it could securely dock the massive airships. Issues such as fuel transport and storage, wind speed, pilot visibility, mooring cables, and weight capacity had to be taken into account when creating the mooring mast.
