The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. It seems as though the government tried to stave off the problems but with only a few months left until the day of the inauguration, they fell short.

The FAA's inspector general, Michael Horowitz, has published a report detailing several changes in government regulations. One such regulation is known as "the rule of the road," which means that pilots are limited to driving the airplane in safe weather. The FAA says that pilots must stay in the aerials to avoid "any damage to the aircraft during the flight."

Another change is the policy requiring pilots to check the windows in two-thirds of the ceiling of buildings on their planes at the start—something that was very unpopular among the pilots on the towers.

The New York Times reports that the FAA has revised its design guidelines for the design of dirigibles that have been tested. But they also claim that "The Department of Defense has concluded that it has no authority to modify or modify a design without the express authority of a federal district court judge in which to make such modifications." This means that an individual's request for modification, however, has little to do with how the airplane is used—it's a design of private-property use that has nothing on its own.
