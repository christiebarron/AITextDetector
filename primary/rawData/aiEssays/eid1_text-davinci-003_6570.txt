Dear Editor, 

As more people gain access to computers, I believe that it is important to recognize the effects this technology has on us, both good and bad. Personally, I think computers can have both positive and negative impacts on people.

On the positive side, computers allow us to get work done more quickly, communicate with people across the globe, and access information with just a few clicks of the mouse. We can find solutions to problems, develop new ideas, and stay connected in ways we never have before. Computers can be incredibly empowering and help us to be more productive in all facets of our lives.

However, it’s also true that computers can have a detrimental effect on our mental and physical health. Too much time spent on the computer can lead to eye strain, back and neck pain, sleep problems, and general fatigue. Not to mention, of course, the potential for addiction and online security and privacy issues. 

Overall, computers can be a great tool, but it’s essential that we use them responsibly. We should strive to balance our time in front of the computer with other activities that benefit both our mind and body. 

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
