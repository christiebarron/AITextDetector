Censorship in libraries is a topic that has been debated for many years. Some people believe that libraries should not stock any materials that are deemed as offensive, while others argue that any material should be available for customers to access. I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from library shelves if they are found to be offensive. 

Although many people may disagree, there are several reasons why I believe certain materials should be censored in libraries. In the first place, libraries are public institutions which should be accessible to all people regardless of age, race, gender, and sexual orientation. Therefore, any materials deemed as offensive should be removed so as not to discriminate against any members of the public. Additionally, it is the libraryâ€™s responsibility to ensure that any materials made available are appropriate for their audience; by removing offensive materials, libraries can make sure that all patrons have equal access to suitable and relevant materials. 

Furthermore, children frequent libraries and therefore it is important to keep certain materials away from their view. For example, certain forms of media such as pornographic magazines have no place on library shelves, and should be removed from public access. This measure will ensure that the impressionable minds of children will not be exposed to such content. 

In conclusion, I strongly believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from library shelves if they are found to be offensive.
