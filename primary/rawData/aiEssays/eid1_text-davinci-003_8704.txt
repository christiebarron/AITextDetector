I remember the first time my husband and I really started to laugh together. We had been dating for a few weeks and he had invited me over for dinner. We had spent the previous few hours walking around the city and talking about our favorite books and movies, but now we were sitting at our table ready to start eating. 

When our plates were finally full, we both tucked into our dinner without saying a word. We ate in silence for a few moments, savoring all the aromas and flavors of our meal. 

But then, something happened. My husband took a big bite of his meal and began to cough and choke. It was only a few seconds before the laughter started. Despite my efforts to look concerned, I just couldn't stop myself from laughing either. We both laughed until tears began streaming down our faces. It felt so good to be laughing with someone.

My husband looked up at me, his eyes sparkling with laughter, and I knew that we had just made a real connection. It was in those moments that I realised how special our relationship was going to be. 

Laughter has held a special place in my heart ever since.
