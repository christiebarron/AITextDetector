The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first was that they had to go through extensive litigation, and often that cost money.

But over time, these setbacks have improved the Empire State Building after it was completed. The Empire State Building and related buildings have undergone many architectural changes such as the removal of the historic stone staircase that forms the lower level and subsequent refinements and additions, replacing the old granite structure on Broadway, and reopening the former lobby entrance that will continue to serve as its visitor service.

In terms of the Empire State Building's construction, it is a solid success, making all of its design elements look and feel at home. Despite its success, this design has no major drawbacks when it comes to the architectural and technological advantages of its construction.

To build the Empire State Building, the building must have a lot of surface area, which can take up to 3.5 acres if it is too large. A 1.2-acre lot is ideal for a couple in the city and would allow an unlimited amount of space with little to no construction or maintenance needs.

The Empire State Building's most notable design innovation lies behind the new staircase, which will give pedestrians and office workers a bit more visibility than before.
