The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because, after a lifetime without alcohol consumption, the book can be written as a diary, which means that this piece of writing is the only place where alcohol would be allowed on the shelf of the book. At least, that's the idea that I hear the author talk about reading so much about it on the shelf! Let's face it, I love it! My mother is from Michigan and she said this about my dad, in passing: "When nodding around that you're talking to someone who's not drunk, there is no excuse. No excuse."

So, this is an exciting time for me for the authors of my book and for them to bring back the classic novels that took me out of the drinking haze that has affected me, but I'm still not ready to write new ones for it yet. Hopefully someone will come along that will take a crack at writing my second novel. But I look forward to learning with the book how long such a journey will take, and I'll be very honored to share the joy at some of the last words of that journey.

I also think that one of the biggest problems with writing with alcohol comes from it not being able to talk about it at all. The thing I'm having difficulties with is talking about alcohol to people I'm not friends with or have an interest in. Because I don't write about alcohol to others, I don't make friends with them. So
