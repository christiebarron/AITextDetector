The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' has been an attempt to convey a simple perspective of what the novel is about.

From Home, from the place where a young girl spends her life, is an ambitious account of the experiences of people who spend their time not at home: a portrait of both their environment and in the world as they walk the land. But the protagonist's journey through the land is different from the one she encounters on New Year's Eve or the day after.

It is not a book whose aim is more to evoke the feeling of being at home than to show an individual experiencing the world. Even at The Lionheart's most striking feature was the fact that, while The Lionheart, by focusing on the social environment, explores many social situations, it focuses not on a particular social experience but on the way that others perceive and relate to us as individuals.

'From Home is an imaginative, poetic, and honest book that conveys the experience of the life of one in a different way than any book that had been published in the past. It is a journey that I will leave you with. To see it through I will have to leave off. But I will have to continue writing, because that is my duty.'
