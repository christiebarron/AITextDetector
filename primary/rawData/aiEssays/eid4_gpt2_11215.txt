The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because she decides not to write it herself, but rather to create a novel about her brother. To this end her writing career takes a hit because she's in dire circumstances. But the other side of Winter's story is that while she is working in the world of fantasy, she lives in the very real world of the world of fantasy: the real world of fear. Winter may not necessarily feel so, but she may, at least, look at life as just another day in the world.

This means that the novel will be divided into three parts. What you know about the characters and how they interact with the world that comes from the experience of the world Winter created is only the first part, which will be revealed later with the second portion. And while Winter is far from "The World" she may simply have been there, for once in Time the characters get into the real world. If you only know about two aspects of Winter's character, I'd say it's in the third part: Winter's first childhood is always that of a girl. And her second childhood is also a little bit like "The World." That part is more revealing. The second part is only a few paragraphs.

I've been thinking a lot about the books in Winter's life, and the way she's been feeling in the real world about her brother. I think it's a kind of thing that's really important to her.
