To the Editor,

I am writing to convey my views on the effect computers have on people. In this digital age, computers have become more pervasive in society. While computers have been a tremendous tool for enhancing productivity, there are both positive and negative effects. On the positive side, computers have revolutionized the way we do business. Our lives have become more efficient with computers helping to automate processes, streamline communication, and provide instant access to information.

On the other hand, too much reliance on computers can have a deleterious effect on people. With the advent of computers, we can become lazy and complacent, losing some of the important skills associated with problem-solving and creativity. Computers can also be a source of distraction. Furthermore, over-usage of computers can lead to physical, mental, and social health issues.

In conclusion, while computers are an essential tool for conducting business, it is important to acknowledge and address the negative effects associated with its use. We must strike a balance between leveraging technology and making sure it is not overused.

I urge your readers to consider the positive and negative aspects of computer use and practice healthy habits when it comes to computer usage.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
