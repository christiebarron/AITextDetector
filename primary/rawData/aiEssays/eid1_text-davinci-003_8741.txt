As I stepped outside on my lunch break, I was feeling a little down in the dumps about a particularly tough morning at work. Little did I know that my spirits would soon lift in an unexpected way.

Out of the corner of my eye, I spotted an old man holding a sign that said "Free Hugs". I couldn't help but chuckle to myself â€“ my mom would have surely had something to say about my laughing at a homeless man. But before I knew it, I had walked right up to him and offered him a friendly hello. 

He told me his name was John and then he asked me if I'd like a hug. I hesitated at first but then decided, why not? So I hugged him. But as soon as I did, he started laughing, the infectious kind that is hard to resist, and before I knew it I was laughing too! The two of us were standing there in the middle of the street, cackling like a couple of preteens at their first sleepover. It felt so liberating, like all our worries were suddenly no longer relevant. After an intense few minutes of laughter, we both said our goodbyes and went our separate ways.

In that moment, I truly felt like laughter was the shortest distance between two people. I realized how something so simple can be so powerful when it comes to your emotional wellbeing. That old man's presence and energy were just what I needed that day,
