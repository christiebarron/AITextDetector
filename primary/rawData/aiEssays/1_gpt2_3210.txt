One of those features is one that is most easily defined and encapsulated by an OS. So all you have to do is describe what does this OS do, and it will do it for you. To go back to theTechnologies, you will learn one important fact about the technology that is being deployed inside the OS. These are called "instances." Each of these instances has a specific "task," some kind of "value" and the "user." In our OS, there is a job called an InstanceManager.
