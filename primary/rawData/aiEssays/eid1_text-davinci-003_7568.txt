The author is conveying the idea that just as the winter-blooming hibiscus flowers, so too will the narrator have their opportunity to pass the exam they were previously not able to pass. The narrator is hopeful that the new beginning represented by spring will bring them the success they long for, and that the beauty of the hibiscus will be a reminder to stay positive in their endeavor. The quote also implies that just as the hibiscus is brought back to life in the spring, so too will the narrator be given a fresh start.
