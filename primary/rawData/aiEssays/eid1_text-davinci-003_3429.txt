Dear Editor,

As personal computers become more and more prevalent in our lives, I've begun to consider their impact on human beings. While I'm not against technology by any means, I'm convinced that these devices have negative effects that many people fail to recognize.

First of all, our use of computers has drastically increased the amount of stress in our day-to-day lives. We now have 24/7 access to work, emails, and social media, meaning that it's become increasingly difficult to switch off at the end of the day. This results in a society of constantly exhausted individuals, unable to properly relax and unwind.

Furthermore, I'm concerned about the effects that so much technology is having on our eyesight. Hours in front of a computer screen can cause the development of eyestrain, blurred vision, and headaches. Although these issues can often be rectified with rest, they still represent a quality of life issue that should not be glossed over.

Lastly, the more time we spend on the computer, the less we are engaged in physical activities. Although many of us aren't necessarily getting off the sofa much less, this still has a worrying effect on modern generations, who
