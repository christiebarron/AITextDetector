I had been friends with Tyler for years before we started dating, so he was already very familiar with my family. We had all been out together plenty of times, so when he asked me to dinner at my parents’ house for his birthday, it wasn’t entirely out of the ordinary.

When Tyler arrived, my parents welcomed him with hugs and a cake. Then, without missing a beat, my dad started in on the jokes. I had long given up trying to reason with dad when it came to his constant string of puns, and instead waited patiently as Tyler attempted to keep up with him. I could see he was trying his best, between laughing and smiling like someone possessed. 

As the conversation went on, I realized that the real gift being shared between Tyler and my dad was laughter. There was something special in that shared connection that could only happen between two people.

The dinner ended up going surprisingly well, and by the time it finished, both Tyler and my dad were so weak from laughter that they could hardly speak.

I’m thankful for moments like that, which will stay with me forever. Even after all these years, laughter is still the shortest distance between us.
