One time I experienced laughter in my life was when a fellow student asked me, 'Have you met my boyfriend?'

"They're both really funny and I'll always remember being a little bit embarrassed after that. I didn't take the joke well, but from that moment on I always wanted to find out if he wasn't joking."
