I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is counterproductive and harmful."

"I would urge everyone who can understand what it is to be a Christian to be sure that they understand how much it is to suffer and to face oppression for how you live your life," Pope Francis told the gathering at the Vatican press conference. "It is a challenge to allow a Christian society to be an incubator where people are not given this sense of being oppressed for being who they are," he added.

For many, the pope's comments are the latest in a string of statements from Vatican authorities condemning the persecution of dissent by Muslim and Christian scholars.

"We must continue to show greater respect for the human dignity of all persons, including our own. That is the fundamental responsibility of the Holy See," Francis told the meeting. "However, I must express our conviction that these attacks and attacks of violence on religious and intellectual freedom must be confronted and investigated. It is not possible for us to forget this. The Church needs the vigilance that comes from vigilance against these crimes to take into account the fundamental obligation of its people â€“ our own. I call on our Church to stand united against this attack and to do everything it can to ensure such investigations are carried out."

Pope Francis made the comments as part of a visit to Asia this week, in which he said that the "greater human dignity of the human person is undermined" when the persecution of atheists and other religious minorities continues.
