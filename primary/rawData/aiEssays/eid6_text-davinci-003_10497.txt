The Empire State Building was a milestone in architecture when it was built, deemed the tallest building in the world at the time. It was, however, designed with more than just an architectural masterpiece in mind; the Empire State Building was the first skyscraper to be designed and operational with the incorporation of dirigible dockings. While this seemed like a lofty ambition, it was not yet without its share of obstacles and challenges. 

One of the earliest obstacles encountered when it came to allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was a fear of safety and danger. Concerns about strong winds and gusts damaging the airship were a legitimate worry that had to be addressed before any ship could dock there. Additionally, during the day, the airships were at risk of being exposed to powerful sunlight, due to their closeness to the building. To address these challenges, engineers designed a large, eight-foot mast at the top of the Empire State Building to provide the dirigible with a safe place to moor.

This mooring mast, or tethering pole, was essential for dirigibles to dock safely at the Empire State Building. It was made from various materials and had a tower on one side, connected to the building by a steel cable. On either side of the tower, mooring arms allowed for the airship to be stabilized with a cable and hook. As this mast towered above the Empire State Building, passengers and sailors alike
