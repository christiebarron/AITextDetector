I was shopping with my best friend when we turned around to find a bald man carrying a laptop bag, wearing an ugly and faded Hawaiian shirt. We burst into fits of laughter uncontrollably, knowing it was the most ridiculous outfit combination we had ever seen. 

The man, embarrassed, looked at us and smiled. We just couldn't help ourselves and laughed even harder. He asked what was so funny and we did our best to tell him it was nothing against him, but the outfit just never looked good. He joined in the laughter, and soon all three of us were standing there, belly-aching from the laughter when another customer turned to join in the fun.

Though the moment was brief, the laughter was enough to break the ice and build a connection between us all. The man thanked us for making his day just a little brighter and we said our goodbyes, still laughing as we walked away.
 
Laughter really is the shortest distance between two people. Even a stranger can be united with laughter.
