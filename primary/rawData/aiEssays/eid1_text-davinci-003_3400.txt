Dear Editor,

It is no secret that computers, and other forms of technology, have had a significant impact on our lives. While technology can provide numerous advantages, we cannot ignore the potential drawbacks associated with this drastic shift. For example, increased reliance on computers can lead to serious physical and psychological problems.

One of the biggest physical threats associated with too much computer use is Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, which is a painful wrist and hand condition caused by repetitive motions from typing. Other physical issues such as back, neck, and shoulder problems stemming from a person being seated for long periods of time may also occur.

In addition to physical ailments, there are numerous mental health problems that can result from excessive computer use. Disrupted sleeping patterns, fatigue, depression, and general lack of focus are all among the symptoms of addiction to computers. It is estimated that more than 10 million Americans are addicted to computers, and teens and young adults are particularly vulnerable.

It is important for us to recognize the ways in which computers can be detrimental to our health and well-being. We need to find a balance with how we use technology and take time to engage in activities that donâ€™t require the use of a computer.
