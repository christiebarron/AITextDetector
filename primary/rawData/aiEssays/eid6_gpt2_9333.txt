The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first was that many buildings were either covered in asbestos or in concrete. The second problem was the fact that buildings had to take special precautions for air-tighting and safety. "The engineers of the time had seen these three obstacles very clearly â€“ even if they were painted or painted differently. On our previous designs their effect was exactly what they described," says R. Michael McShane II, a senior architect at George Mason. "The design of the building must have been far too complex for all of the existing engineering departments. The two big problem came in the process of putting the building in one set of three-storey buildings and that was not a good day."

The new version of the Skylark, introduced in January 1968, is the closest thing to a real skylark that a hotel needs, with a full deck of glass, the highest level ever seen in a single-story building, and a front panel that is 60 feet deep. It is equipped with two electric lights, 1,300 square feet of roof space and a 5,000 square foot open-air deck that serves as a living room with two bedrooms. If you can't see it from the kitchen floor, the only way to see is a narrow elevator that slides to the far end of the living room and goes over a glass ceiling covered in snow before climbing out a double-door onto a three
