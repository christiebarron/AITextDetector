The Empire State Building was one of the first skyscrapers constructed in Manhattan, and has held the title for the world’s tallest building for almost 40 years. Its design was a groundbreaking achievement, and included ambitious plans to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock at the building’s crown. Yet making this aircraft dream a reality was much further from simple than imagined, as detailed in Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s The Mooring Mast.

In attempting to facilitate this groundbreaking aviation technology, engineers faced a number of isolated obstacles. Most pressing among these was the question of the building’s stability and strength; engineers were concerned that the building couldn’t bear the weight of a dirigible as well as the thrust of its engines. Thus a new technique was needed to ensure the structure could sustain this unique arrangement; the engineers’ answer was the creation of large steel masts that embedded into the building’s structure. This would need to be combined with a mooring system capable of managing the dirigible’s force.

Reconfiguring the 74th floor of the building to fit the large airships was also a unique challenge. This meant placing a height limitation on the building’s spire, and completely reconfiguring the area’s layout. This included changing the elevators, converting an outdoor terrace to an interior space, and most drastically, raising the
