Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. First, it makes the cyclist feel more natural and comfortable: it gives the rider an adrenaline rush at peak braking, makes the cyclist feel faster and more fluid, and lowers the risk of injury. There is more that goes into lowering the risk of a collision. A second factor could be the "high-stacking effect": if you put a tyre in a particular place and make sure that no one's going out of their way to injure you with it, you are also making sure the bike is at the optimum level to keep them safe. A fourth factor could be the difference in braking distance: there isn't much braking that goes into the bike that would make for less danger for other drivers. And a fifth factor is how much time it takes a cyclist to brake at all, as riders often make their way through dangerous or dangerous stretches too.

The 'Rough Road Ahead' setting also makes a big difference in the amount of time the cyclist is in each race (for now). If there are no other drivers, they tend to drive more effectively at higher distances, but they're probably less efficient. For instance, if there are a few drivers on the team then it's easier to find them, but a few are less effective.

On top of that, having a good tyre setup helps with riding more quickly and smoothly and has little of an impact on the quality of the rider
