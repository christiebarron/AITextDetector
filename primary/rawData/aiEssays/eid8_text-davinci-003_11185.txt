I remember the first time I met my future wife with the fondest of memories. We were both freshman at the same university, and somehow we had ended up at the same dinner table one night. We talked about our hopes and dreams, and I was completely captivated by her. I was nervous, but she made me laugh and I was so grateful for it. 

At one point, I said something amusing, and she started laughing. Immediately, I felt a connection. I laughed too and soon tears were streaming down our faces. We laughed so hard, we kept looking around to make sure nobody was watching. It was the best moment I had shared with someone in a long time. 

From that moment on, I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her. Eight years later, we’re still together and making each other laugh. Whatever moments life throws our way, I’m glad I get to share them with her--and hopefully more laughter.
