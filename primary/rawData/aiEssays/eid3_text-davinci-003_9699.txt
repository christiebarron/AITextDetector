The setting of ‘Rough Road Ahead’ by Joe Kurmaski plays an important role in the story; its features directly impacting the cyclist. This is realized through the atmosphere that the setting creates as well as the physical features of the road.

The atmosphere of the setting is one of despair and uncertainty. On a cloudy day in winter, the cyclist sets out with no clear destination or mission, which indicates to the reader that he is in search of fulfilment. The feeling of vulnerability in this environment only serves to increase the cyclist’s sense of despair, as he is already feeling completely alone and exposed.

The physical features of the setting also present a challenge to the cyclist. He is confronted with rough terrain and steep climbs that require significant strength and stamina, and the fact that he is completing this journey on a bicycle only exacerbates the difficulty. He is physically challenged as he climbs and descends a steep hill, and the road conditions make it difficult to find traction and thus to keep moving forward.

Though the cyclist attempts to stay positive throughout the journey, the setting continually reminds him of the struggles he must face in order to reach his destination. From the atmosphere of uncertainty to the physical features of the road, the setting of ‘Rough Road Ahead’ creates the context for a difficult and challenging journey that must be faced alone, pushing the cyclist to reach within himself in order to find completion.
