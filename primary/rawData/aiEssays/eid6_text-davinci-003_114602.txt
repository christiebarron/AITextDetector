The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges when constructing the world's tallest buildingâ€”especially when they decided to make space to accommodate dirigibles. The building, constructed from 1930-1931, had to be designed to accommodate the gigantic airships while remaining structurally sound. The size and weight of the dirigibles, the wind currents surrounding the building, and the technology available at the time were just some of the obstacles the builders faced.

Since the airships were so large, the focus turned to the idea of building a mooring mast to provide a secure spot for them to dock. A regular mast just wouldn't do; it needed to be made of something strong and light enough to hold these massive ships. The builders found that the lightweight steel available suited their needs, so they constructed a heavy-duty steel mast that was 203 feet tall and weighed over 3,000 tons.

The mast had to be designed to allow for the airships to dock safely in the windy environment of New York City. The builders used ballast weight cables which ran to the base of the building to help keep the mast stable in the wind since the airships were so massive and required a lot of strength to remain secure.

Additionally, the builders had to consider the technology of the time. The mast had to be equipped with a mooring hook for the airship to attach to, and the cars at the top of the mast had to contain
