Over the years, the Empire State Building has featured a great many attractions, some more incredible than others. One of the most awe-inspiring was the idea of allowing dirigibles, often referred to a blimps or airships, to dock at the top of the building, creating a thrilling aviation-meets-architecture experience. However, the attempt to turn this idea into reality was a grueling effort, wrought with obstacles and hardship. 

For the Empire State Building, constructing mooring mast to secure a dirigible was a complicated and costly endeavor, requiring considerable resources and patience. First, a 625-foot steel tower known as the mooring mast had to be erected at the top of the building. Such a tall tower had never been attempted before and presented unique design challenges. The mooring mast had to be designed in such a way to support the weight of a dirigible, taking into account strong winds and turbulence that could topple the airship. In addition, the mooring mast had to be carefully anchored deep into the buildingâ€™s solid bedrock to provide solid support. 

Moreover, the logistics were daunting. Dirigibles need a great deal of space to maneuver and dock safely. To make the plan a reality, the engineers had to construct an oval-shaped door on the roof of the building big enough to admit the dirigible. Needless to say, such a large opening would not only be an
