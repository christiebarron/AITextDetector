Dear Editor,

In today's world of technology, computers have become increasingly essential to our lives. Not only do they make our day-to-day tasks easier, but also they enable us to access information much faster than ever before. As a result, computers have had a profound effect on our lives, both positive and negative.

On the positive side, computers have increased productivity and efficiency in almost every field imaginable. In addition, they have opened up vast amounts of information, making it much easier to stay informed. Furthermore, computers have facilitated collaboration, making it easier for people to work together on projects.

On the negative side, computers have had a huge impact on our social lives. People are becoming increasingly isolated and, consequently, disconnected from reality. Moreover, computers have caused a dramatic increase in cyber crime, and the resulting damage can be devastating. Finally, a reliance on computers can make us too vulnerable to security breaches, which can lead to financial losses and identity theft.

Ultimately, the effects of computers on people are both positive and negative. We must be aware of both, and take the necessary steps to ensure our safety and well-being. I believe that the benefits outweigh the risks, but thought must also be given to the long-term effects of our heavy reliance on computers.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
