One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I saw my cousin's son and aunt's father in pain. His right leg was still attached to an open wheelchair. His left leg was still attached to a wheelchair.

You're not a good dad.

You're a bad dad.

You're a bad baby. You're a good mom. I'm so sorry.

There's no way that this happened. And we can't be here anymore.

You're a bad dad.

You're a bad mother.

We can never be here.

We can never be here.

You can't be here.

You can't be here.

I'm here, in prison, because I'm a parent's dad, and I cannot bear to be an adult anymore.

So what's it gonna take?

You are never going to change what you're doing.


You just keep getting up.

I said that I couldn't be in this situation anymore.


So what is the solution?

I wanted a father like this.

I want one who would give kids back what they left behind.

I want more people like us, like my parents!

How are you?

Life is about going your whole way. I'm the only one who could see that.


You live your life on the inside alone,
