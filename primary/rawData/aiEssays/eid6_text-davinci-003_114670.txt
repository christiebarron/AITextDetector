The decision to allow dirigibles to dock on the top of the Empire State Building was a significant and ambitious undertaking. Throughout the design and construction process, builders encountered a variety of obstacles that needed to be addressed before a safe and functional docking station could be offered. 

The primary challenge encountered by those constructing the Empire State Building's docking station was the structure itself. According to "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted, not only did the building have to be designed with a substantial enough structure to support the weight of the docked ship, but it also had to withstand the additional force placed on the structure when the ship was tethered to the mast. To address this challenge, builders created a steel tower extending a full 200 feet from the roof of the building, allowing the dirigibles to land and turn around within the tight confines of the space in order to safely dock.

In addition to the structural integrity of the mast and the top of the building, the builders also had to consider environmental factors. Once an agreement was reached with the Port of New York to provide a station for airships, special considerations had to be taken to ensure the safety of the passengers, crew, and the building itself. Exposure to wind and icy conditions was of particular concern, as this could cause the ship to become unstable during takeoffs and landings. As a result, the builders redesigned the terminal to include windbreaks around the base of the mast and
