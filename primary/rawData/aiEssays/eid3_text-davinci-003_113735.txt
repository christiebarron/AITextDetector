The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski have a direct impact on the cyclist in the story. The rugged terrain of the Icelandic road is the first feature that has an impact on the cyclist’s journey. Not only is the road filled with sharp or slippery rocks, steep hills, and wind gusts, but it also is isolated. The isolation of the region heightens the cyclist’s sense of loneliness and vulnerability. Furthermore, the unpredictable weather conditions are another element of the setting that affects the cyclist. For example, the hailstorm that contributes to the cyclist pushing past her breaking point. The severe weather conditions challenge her endurance and strength as she attempts to reach her destination. 

The cyclist is also impacted by the features unique to Iceland, such as the sparse vegetation and volcanic rocks. As she progresses on her journey, the cyclist is surrounded by the beauty of the landscape, but this beauty is mixed with its dangers. Despite the difficulties, the cyclist’s determination and perseverance enable her to progress through the otherwise harsh environment. 

The features of the setting not only shape the cyclist’s journey, but it is ultimately her journey that shapes her as an individual, pushing her to her own limits. Her growth comes from the combination of the physical hardship of the environment and her courage and strength, building an inner power that is stronger than the actual terrain.
