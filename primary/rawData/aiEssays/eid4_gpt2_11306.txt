The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because a lot of times you're told it's the good stuff after all this time, and that you're going to grow up the way you do. And if it turns off people's interest, then they tend to make it up.

Did you consider how you might take a similar approach once you got back into the movie business?

When I went into acting. I didn't like any stage business, so I started out with a good role in the movie The Little Drum of the Wild. It was called The Little Drum of the North; and that was all I wanted to do in it. That was a lot of work. And that is why I decided not to take a stage career and went into producing. It was a long-time process. It was almost like taking a train and going through the same kind of process that was already starting in my youth.

What was that process like for you in terms of wanting to make a film?

It's an easy one on my mind. It's like the whole picture, it's just that it's more complicated at the top.

How did you meet the people you had working with for Your Name and Where Are They Now, and the people who were part of You'll Never Walk Alone?

It was almost like a family. That was the first time that, I guess, I learned and maybe learned a lot more,
