I remember a time when I was a kid that taught me the importance of patience. One summer, my parents planned a family vacation to a beachhouse. I was so excited about finally getting to go to the beach that I couldn't help but pester my parents with endless questions about what the place would be like. 

I wanted to know if there would be a pool, what the bed I would sleep in was like, what there was to do, and so on. My parents patiently answered my questions, never getting upset or irritated with me for wanting to know so many details. I could tell they were really looking forward to the trip as well, so I knew they just wanted to be sure I was prepared for the excitement.

When we finally arrived at the beachhouse, it was even better than I anticipated. All of my questions were answered and more. I had an incredible time, and it was only then that I realized how patient my parents had been in anticipation of our vacation. 

No matter how many questions I asked or how much of a hassle it seemed, they never showed me anything but respect and kindness. It was a valuable lesson and I'm very thankful for it.
