The Empire State Building is one of the most iconic structures in the world and is one of the most historically significant skyscrapers in New York City. Built in the 1930s, the Empire State Building was the tallest manmade structure in the world, and had the ambitious goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the building’s top. This goal was met with tremendous obstacles and challenges, and was only ultimately successful due to the determination of the architect, William Lamb.

The year was 1931 and the architect was William Lamd. He had been tasked with designing the world’s tallest skyscraper and he wanted to do something unprecedented. He proposed that dirigibles, airships that could carry passengers and goods, could dock at the top of the building so passengers could disembark at the highest point in the city. This was a revolutionary idea and one that he was determined to make a reality.

One of the biggest challenges faced by Lamb and his team was the design of a “Mooring Mast”, which was needed to provide the necessary support for the docking of airships at the top of the Empire State Building. Lamb worked with engineers to design the world’s first ever airship mooring mast, which was an incredibly complicated piece of engineering. In addition, the design also had to be approved by the New York City Building department, which proved to be a difficult task. 

The mast itself was an approximately
