I recently had to wait in the post office for what felt like hours in the longest line. But instead of letting my anxiety and impatience get the best of me, I practiced patience and understanding.

I kept my cool and waited patiently. Instead of tapping my foot and tapping the buttons on my phone, I took some deep breaths and embraced the stillness. 

The tension in the line dissipated as I used my mindfulness skills and it made the time pass much faster. After what felt like forever, I finally made it to the front of the line and was able to complete my errand. 

Overall, it was a good learning experience. I knew it could have been much worse and so I was grateful that I was able to find patience during this difficult situation.
