The Empire State Building has a long history of pioneering new building techniques, engineering marvels, and iconic architecture. However, despite all the glitz and glamour the Empire State Building is known for, it was also ahead of its time in its provisions for dirigible docking. Despite having provision for dirigible docking, the builders of the Empire State Building faced formidable obstacles in making the docking of dirigibles an available option.

The first obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the construction of the docking port. The entire plan entailed rigging giant steel mooring masts atop the building, which would attach to the dirigible and serve as the anchor point. Constructed in the building’s open steel frame structure, the mooring mast would protrude beyond the building’s façade and be several stories in height, standing 20 feet taller than the surrounding buildings. This meant that the Empire State Building would have to be built strong enough to support the mooring mast while at the same time remaining structurally sound.

In addition, the mooring mast presented a wind hazard, as the high-speed winds at the roof line would cause turbulence that could move the mast. The design engineers solved this by attaching the end of the mast to high-tension steel cables running along the sides of the building that would counteract any wind pressure. Furthermore, these cables were attached to the building’s steel frame, and in
