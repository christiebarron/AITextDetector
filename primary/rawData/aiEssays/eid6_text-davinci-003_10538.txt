Building the Empire State Building was a monumental undertaking. When it was completed in 1931, it stood at 1,250 feet tall, making it the tallest building in the world. At the time, many thought it should be a docking station for dirigibles, the airships of the era. Despite the grandiose idea, the plan faced several obstacles.

The biggest obstacle to constructing the Empire State Building for dirigibles was safety. Since the mooring mast needed to be remarkably strong in order to accommodate the airships, tremendous precautions had to be taken to ensure the structure wouldnâ€™t collapse while docked. Therefore, special techniques for steel strengthening had to be devised in order to keep the mast standing. Additionally, more modern materials like steel and aluminum had to be used as oppose to customary construction materials.

Additionally, the requirements for a successful mooring mast were much more demanding than a standard building structure. In addition to withstanding the extreme wind factors that existed on the top of the Empire State Building, it also needed to keep the dirigibles from swaying and swaying too quickly. For this to happen, the mooring mast had to be stiff enough to resist the wind but flexible enough to gently slow down the airships.

Furthermore, the design of the mooring mast had to be exceptionally proficient in order to provide a safe landing. Its mooring base had to be as large and wide as the ships
