When I was in middle school, I had the pleasure of working on an art project with some classmates. We had to collaborate on making a sculpture and we had quite a bit of trouble figuring out how to arrange the pieces. Instead of getting frustrated, I tried to remain patient and talk it out with my teammates. We spent the entire afternoon discussing and debating different layouts for the project. Eventually, we finally got the sculpture put together to everyone's satisfaction. Despite the complexity of the assignment, we were all able to get the job done without any blowups thanks to my patience.
