My best friend and I are always laughing together. It's a way for us to connect, and it's always been a part of our relationship. One particular time, that I'll never forget, that laughter really shone through was the time that we went out for lunch together.

We were both starving, so it wasn't long until our food arrived. We both ordered burgers, so when the waiter came to our table, my friend opened her box only to find out that in the Burgers the restaurant had put lettuce, cheese, tomato, and so on - but no burger patty! We laughed until we cried, it was such a funny shock!

At first, we were both in disbelief that the restaurant had forgotten a major part of our burgers! We both initially started laughing nervously, not knowing what to do, but soon the nervous laughter turned into genuine laughter.

The waiter offered to get us a new burger patty as soon as he could, but it was too late. We both knew that we couldn't take our laughter back, and it was a moment we will both never forget! Our laughter that day was a reminder of why we get along so well.

Now, whenever things get tough, we just look at each other and start laughing. It never fails to remind us how we can always lighten the mood and somehow make things better.
