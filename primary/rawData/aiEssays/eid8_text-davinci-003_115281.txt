 

I once had a situation that made me laugh so hard I couldn’t breathe. My best friend and I were walking on the beach one summer day when we stumbled across a large beach ball. We decided to have a game of beach ball volleyball, but since we only had two people, we had to get creative. We drew two lines of tape on the sand, one for me and one for my friend, and tried to keep the ball in the air for as long as possible. 

At first, this seemed like a straightforward challenge, until my friend started to come up with some wild rules that seemed to change depending on the score. He added in things like if I scored a point, he would have to do a handstand or if I got two points in a row, I’d get an extra point. These ridiculous rules had us cracking up and pretty much impossible to keep score. 

It felt good to be in the moment with my friend and laugh uncontrollably together. We had gotten so silly that it was hard to even keep playing the game, and people walking by were wondering what was going on. This game was a great reminder of the importance of laughter in any relationship. That day, laughter was indeed the shortest distance between us.
