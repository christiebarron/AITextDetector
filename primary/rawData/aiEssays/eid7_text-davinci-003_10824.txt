I recently experienced being patient when I was in line at the grocery store. It was a Saturday, so the store was busy and the lines were long. The person ahead of me was having a hard time counting out the exact change, and the cashier had to keep looking around for small bills to give him his change. I could tell that the cashier was getting frustrated but instead of becoming impatient, I chose to be patient and understanding. My thoughts were that this person was having a hard time and me being impatient wouldn't help the situation. I stood there calmly waiting my turn and in the end, the cashier thanked me for my patience. That experience kept me in check in situations when I'm tempted to become impatient.
