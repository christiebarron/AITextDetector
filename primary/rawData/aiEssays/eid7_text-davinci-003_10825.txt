I remember one time when I had been working late in the office and I was exhausted. I returned home and my family was nowhere to be found. I was worried and didn't know what to do or where to look for them. After a long and anxious wait, they eventually returned home, and I was relieved to see they were all safe. 

Instead of getting mad that they hadn't come home on time, I remained patient and understanding of the situation. I listened to their explanations and tried my best to stay calm and not jump to any conclusions. In the end, I was happy that my family was safe and I was proud of myself for being patient and understanding rather than react in anger.
