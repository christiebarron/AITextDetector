The construction workers responsible for the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when the idea of accommodating dirigibles was raised. Building the tallest, most modern skyscraper was only part of the task â€“ it would have to be capable of docking airships as well.

The first challenge was Space. The area of Manhattan which the Empire State Building was erected in was already built up. Space had to be created to accommodate the regal craft of the airships, and obtaining it meant negotiating with the established local businesses. Acquisition of a colossal block of real estate would be hazardous, as erecting a skyscraper would significantly intervene with the commercial environment. 

Furthermore, securing the space was only the beginning. Building the structure to actually host the dirigibles posed further risks. The Empire would be exempt from the requirement to build the same height mast as other structures, and could he given a break on the height requirements for masts. Still, the length of the mooring mast had to be lined up with strict guidelines to comply with safety regulations. This required adapting the skyscraper's architecture to fit the extended mooring mast, which cost both time and money.

In addition to the physical requirements, engineers had to develop a new type of system which would ensure the reliability and security of the mooring mast. This was necessary to guarantee the safety of the airships and also to make sure the construction met the standards laid down by the regulations of the Department of
