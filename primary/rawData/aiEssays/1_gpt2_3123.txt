Computers have many effects on people. People who think of themselves as software designers have the highest success rate among the professions. These two traits are why many software designers are considered "automores."

There are a few more variables that go into how your computer affects people besides their specific requirements. For one thing, computer scientists see computer programs as a "special way of working for you." This is simply not true. Computer scientists are not very good at understanding that.

Why Does A Computer Program Affect My Personality?

There are three main factors that go into computers' way of working.

First, all programs are built on top of each other. For example, software that uses a certain way of working is usually less buggy than software that builds on top of itself. This leads people to feel that their computer is more "natural" than others.

Second, every system produces programs which are built on top of all other systems. You may be surprised to learn that your home computer is built upon an operating system instead of a hard drive. In other words, the operating system is the computer.

Third, any computer program has a certain physical form that determines which parts of the OS it runs onto. The OS is not created using your data. The OS is created by the computer.

That's why it is good that computer designers design computer programs to be less "realistic." And it's why their computer works, despite not being
