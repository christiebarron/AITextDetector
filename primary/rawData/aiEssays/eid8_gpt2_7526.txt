One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I thought, "I would go through this sort of thing in my life." A lot of those experiences were for joy. And they were for people. People who loved living in the city and for getting to know each other, and who had been at the same place for a long, long time. So I wanted to get better with each experience. And that's really what all the stuff from last year was for me.

AMY GOODMAN: I want to break it to you about this year's Grammy Awards. You're actually going to be watching this in Seattle next month, which you're going to watch on your iPod at some point.

TENNIS WILLIAMS MUSIC TEAM: This was an opportunity to sing together with the best of the music, but at the same time, I was a member of a crew to do some more work with people all through the year. And of course this was a year of really, really great memories that you have with people I have known for 30 years. And this year had a lot of great songs.

And by the end of 2015, people had really started moving on, like, "We love you!" And so there were a lot of different avenues that I wanted to go. And those are different now. And that's what I'm going to tryâ€”

AMY GOODMAN: Thank you so much for being with us.
