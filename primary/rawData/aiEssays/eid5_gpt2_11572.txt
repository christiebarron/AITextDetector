The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' with its portrayal of the experience of a young Palestinian girl forced into prostitution, is so unlike how it presents the experience in any other story, that it is hard to imagine anything that would make a different impression. As a result, it would be impossible to put forward any of the ideas that the story contains. It should not, however, be seen that this lack of ideas – as a way out of that dilemma, the writers claim – is an accident. It is clear from that fact that the book uses the idea of a situation in which the female prostitute ends up in a public arena with people she is supposed to be caring for and who are also their friends. It seems very plausible, of course, that, as a consequence of this, it would be more appropriate with respect to the story's content.

The novel takes pains to illustrate and contrast how men treat women. In the book, the author makes a couple who work in the same part of the city as him look a lot alike: they have been in the same apartment for eight months, each and every time the other is there, they have not known each other. As a consequence, the female prostitute takes a little on her right; from a perspective that, it seems, is inescapable: she is in the middle of having her hair and makeup and having to pull the plug after the other one has taken so much time off and has to start again
