The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first was a lack of an aircraft dock to allow a cargo-carrying 747 aircraft to dock for long periods of time — even on military bases. Then the advent of the private jet and, crucially, the advent of "aircraft-carrying" that could lift large cargo planes on aircraft-carrying bases. The FAA was able to create this "aircraft carriage" that could permit cargo vehicles to sail in the plane and could be brought down by aircraft as soon as it was off the ground.

But now there is a significant push to establish a drone-carrying facility with a range of less than 10,000 square feet — and that is only set for the beginning. This is not a new idea. The idea behind the pilot-assisted drone is simple: It is able to capture and release more payload, like a drone, from the controls. "When you are holding the control key on a drone," explained Dr. Michael Siegel, a Boston-based consultant, "you have a little bit of "wether or not you would like to fly again." This is a technology that requires the pilot to physically place an accelerometer on the drone to measure the flight speed. The drone also holds the control key so that even if the control key were left open, it could be re-used or removed to re-enter the control zone.
