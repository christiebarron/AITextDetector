An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the patient who died of lung cancer from an accident. I wasn't sure what was causing illness at the time, but I knew when someone died cancer was less of a issue than it was then.

One of my biggest regrets to be honest with you is that at that time I could not live with my kids. I wanted to protect them and that was what I did when I was a child. I wasn't able to do that in my 30s with my mother and then when my husband died that was a big deal. But after my husband's death it's been a very difficult time for all of us, for it being a child and it being a life, and I want to go to some of the places that help this individual. It would feel good to get out of the house and go to a local home and help this woman who had lost her lung cancer and I hope to say to her we wish her luck and good luck this fall.

For those who are asking about the specific steps I take to be a better adult, I am so incredibly grateful for all of those opportunities I have. I have learned so much, including in general and my entire family. I do feel privileged in the way my family is treated here. My family members know how hard I work hard. My brother Mike is a wonderful man. He's been fighting for years and I want to thank him for that.
