The government also asked Ford to postpone the completion of the Presidential Building at the Washington Air National Guard Academy to allow for a further two-week build-out of the Presidential Building. The delay was in order to avoid the $21.5 million cost to build the Presidential Building. However, the $20 million cost was not met due to a lack of adequate public funds.
