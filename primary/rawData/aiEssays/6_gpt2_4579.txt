The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

A New Orleans engineer named Philip Smith built the structure to allow the use of a jet engine and was met with criticism from builders who said they did not need a propeller to launch their products.

Another New Orleans architect, Charles Todt, has already been sued for failing to use a propeller while installing the dirigibles on a construction site.
