(The developers have already said that 2009 is the year they started building a new Empire State Building and they're also saying that the box will be open this year. But it looks like there probably will only be two games for players to play. Let's hope they didn't want a second Empire State Building built.)

The developers told us that the only thing the game developers wanted to achieve was a way to do that by adding a new character with side objectives. That gives us the very interesting ability for the designers to have the player create a side-
