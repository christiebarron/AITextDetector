 

I was visiting my best friend Janice in New York City, and one day we decided to take a walk in the park. We were strolling through the park, chatting about everything under the sun. As we came around a corner, we spotted an elderly couple walking arm in arm. They were walking so slowly, but they were so sweet and in love. We couldn’t help but smile at them, and soon we had burst out in laughter. 

The elderly couple stopped and looked at us and Janice quickly apologized. “I’m sorry,” she said, “it’s just that you two are so cute.” The couple smiled at us and then started to laugh too. We stood there, surrounded by laughter. It was a beautiful moment, and I felt connected to Janice and the elderly couple. Laughter is such an amazing way to connect people and I felt a deep connection with both of them that I will never forget.
