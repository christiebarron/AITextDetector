The builders of the Empire State Building were arguably some of the most bold and daring architects and engineers of their time. In their vision to create a tower that would reach 1,250 feet and dominate the skyline of New York City, they also saw the potential of using the building for docking dirigibles â€“ a form of airship that was becoming increasingly popular in the early 20th century. However, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

The first challenge was engineering the infrastructure to support the docking. Dirigibles were enormous structures, both wide and tall, and the mast that they connected to had to be secured securely to support its weight. The builders of the Empire State Building had to carefully calculate the weight of the dirigible and the load-bearing capacity of the mast, while also factoring in wind and other weather conditions. 

The next barrier that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the design of the mooring mast itself. The mast was not just a piece of metal stuck atop the building, but a complex series of staircases and corridors stretching up 885 ft, strong enough to support the leviathan of an airship. The builders had to implement complex strategies, such as placing the stairways directly on the side of the mast, in order to minimize the amount of metal needed while still providing strong support for the weight of the dirigible. 

Finally, the builders
