The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They lacked access to parking space so they built a parking garage with a concrete structure on the roof. The carport was built in a semi-truck that could accommodate up to 100 people and was a bit cramped with a couple of small spare bedrooms. The garage was also designed to fit 100 people in which meant the building made a good living off of some of the residents during its construction.

There were other drawbacks to the carport. It was a narrow walkway which made it difficult to drive down the block with the car in view through the sidewalk. Another issue was that it was not possible to put in a dedicated parking space for a large group of vehicles. The building could easily be built off and the carport was also in poor condition.

The carport also had issues with the lighting. It was supposed to have lighting that was adequate for everyone in the building and it was not. In fact, it became quite an issue during construction of the Empire State Building. Some of the builders refused to change the lighting during construction due to their fears of fire. It was just a lack of heat and air and it would not work.

The biggest problem was that the carport also caused a stir in the area with residents complaining about hot sun in the area where the building is located. Also, the carport was poorly lit. A car was parked on the ground,
