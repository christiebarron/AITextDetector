A book about human nature. Winter Hibi isn't just about reading about. It's about the human mind! Let's look at the first three pages of Winter Hibi.

If you don't get your hopes up right away, you can't wait to read Winter Hibi because it's quite a bit of book, in many ways. First off, it's a book that you read every day. It's about a human heart.

So it's not just about finding out that there is a good thing and a bad thing and that life is clarifying things from some kind of universal. Winter Hibi also gives you a lot of hope about what can lie ahead, and it's one of the things that really makes you smile.
