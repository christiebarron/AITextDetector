Some of them consisted in installing and relocating space in the building to accommodate space restrictions imposed by the Empire State Building, which would prevent construction of new buildings as soon as they had been installed (Chernstrom, 1993).

In a more recent effort to create alternative means of transport via vertical freeways, the first known horizontal freeways were first proposed in 1864, which brought the Empire State Tower to a halt and ended up connecting the main buildings of the Empire State Building to the interstate system of interstate highway systems.

For new skyscrapers and intercity transit, however, the Empire State Building required that the only freeways available to the public were a portion of the Manhattan and the Manhattan Avenue Subway through Darrow Avenue at the upper level of the Empire State Building; the two major freeway exits at both ends of the Empire State Building.
