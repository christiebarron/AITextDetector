The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. At its base in Pennsylvania, many of the structures were placed on either side of the highway. This also prevented the city of Rome from building large elevators.

In the 18th century, as technology took flight the U.S. State Building became a national attraction and many of its elevators also featured dirigibles. Many of these are still in use in many states today.
