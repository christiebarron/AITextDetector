An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I went back into my room and I had a small knife wrapped around my neck. I threw the thing away with my fingers.


They told me, to keep the knife away from me they would give me more time if I needed it. I said, to give the knife away. They said, well, the pain is far more than you may see.


They told me, not to worry about it. There was no reason that anything like this could happen.


Why did the parents leave me in such a state?


Because you're in the same situation right now.
