Dear Editor,

I am writing in response to the article published last week discussing the positive and negative effects computers have on people. While I agree with the article that computers have enabled us to communicate more quickly and efficiently, access essential information quicker, and help with everyday tasks, there are certain aspects of computer use that need to be taken into consideration.

Firstly, computers have the potential to exist to perpetually distract people, as they encourages us to be passive and unfocused. Furthermore, for those who experience the deeper side of the digital world, there can be issues such as cyberbullying, cybercrime, and data privacy violation. Additionally, the overuse of computers can have a serious toll on people's mental health, such as depression, anxiety, and stress.

Our reliance on computers is only increasing, and it is important to consider the potential effects this could have on people. Therefore, I would urge readers to take into consideration the potential damaging effects of over-dependence on computers and be conscious of their usage.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
