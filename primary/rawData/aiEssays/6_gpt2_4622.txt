The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The Empire State Building, which is now in the West Wing of the White House, had a ceiling of 7,680 feet, but they could dock up to 5,600 feet for commercial uses.

At that time, it was not too serious. After all, all the other building that could be had at the time was only 6,920 feet long. As it became public that it was impossible to dock all that tall, those obstacles proved difficult to fix.

But in the 1990s, that situation was resolved by the Senate bill banning the construction of dirigibles on U.S. land. The bill required a three-year period before dirigibles were built, so no worries about getting them built on the U.S.-controlled land would apply.

The next years of development left them at only 2,000 feet tall with no dockable housing. And that was a long time ago. There are hundreds upon hundreds of dirigibles on U.S. land. Even though they will not dock, they can still dock up to 1,750 feet. So, there are many reasons why a space will dock.

The first is to give people extra room while there will be some people that feel the need to dock the stuff out. The second is that there are other ways to get people to dock down so the space is able to accommodate the
