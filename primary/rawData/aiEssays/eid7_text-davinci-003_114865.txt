I remember when I had just begun a demanding job and was feeling overwhelmed. My supervisor instructed me on tasks that I had never done before and I was struggling. I felt my confidence plummeting with the increasing workload and I started to think this was too much for me to handle. However, I could see that my supervisor was patient with me - they took me through the steps one by one and reassured me that I was doing a good job. With their patience and reassurance, I eventually completed the tasks and felt a sense of accomplishment. They had seen my potential even when I had doubted myself and that was incredibly meaningful to me.
