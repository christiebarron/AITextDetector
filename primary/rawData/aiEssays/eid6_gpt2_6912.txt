The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. While most of them were of the "new" form (the use of curved glass and light bulbs), those who chose to make such devices were able to adapt their structures to the current shape quickly and safely.

While many have pointed out that dirigibles do require human assistance in construction, it should be obvious that their use is dependent upon the particular job of the worker and who it is. The construction worker is responsible for maintaining a good working environment in which to work, and when the worker is sick, the workers receive an education that allows them to stay safe while doing their jobs. While the building and its workers suffer as a result of poor social safety nets, the fact is that they cannot take responsibility for their own lives when they do die.

One such worker survived, but her final meal was later found buried beneath the rubble.
