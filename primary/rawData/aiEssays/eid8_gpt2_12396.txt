One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was younger because it's kind of weird how adults are able to express themselves so much, and then you become so proud that it happens to you. I really feel a lot of joy when you think they're being sincere and I feel that. It's really amazing in my life.

In your second memoir, when you saw the face on that new picture from last month, which you thought were so beautiful, I couldn't believe it. I thought I knew where he was from. I could only imagine how small it must be now that I realize I'm still here.

Yeah! It was so beautiful. But it was the first time I actually had to write for it. And it started out as such a wonderful little joke, but now I'm really excited that it's been so much more interesting to me. I feel so liberated. I was so proud of it, and it just kind of seemed funny back then.
