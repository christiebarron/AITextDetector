The Empire State Building (ESB) was constructed in 1931 with the intention of being the world’s first commercial skyscraper. At the time, the idea of having dirigibles dock to the ESB was an exciting one, providing long-distance passengers with a luxurious way of travelling. Unfortunately, many obstacles stood in the way of their plans. 

The first obstacle was the weather. Winds in the area increased the difficulty of a dirigible landing at the building. Furthermore, the winds often changed direction suddenly, making a controlled landing and steady take-off a near impossibility. Despite the ESB’s Architects trying to implement strong mooring systems to secure the dirigibles to the building, these unpredictable winds were a continual issue.

A second challenge lay in the building’s delicate structure. The architects knew that a dirigible, by nature, creates a great deal of stress on the building with its moving parts and powerful engine. Therefore, they had to design a mooring mast that could withstand the intense pressure, while also allowing for one quick and smooth docking and undocking process. The mast needed to be lightweight enough to rest on the roof, but also robust enough to secure a large aerostat to the building.

Other obstacles included the requirements of zoning laws and air regulations that had to be met. This was especially difficult for the designers of the mooring mast, as they had to ensure that all regulations
