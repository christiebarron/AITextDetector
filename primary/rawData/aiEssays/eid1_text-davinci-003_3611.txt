 

It was a Sunday afternoon when my best friend and I decided to take a road trip. He had been working long hours all week and I thought the adventure would be a great way to bond and recharge. 

We had been driving for about three hours, arguing over the playlist and who could guess the most obscure country song, when I glanced to my side and noticed his face light up. 

"Do you hear that?" he asked. I listened closely and I heard it. A faint, distant laughter, coming from the outskirts of a nearby town. We looked at each other in amazement, as if we had discovered a hidden gem. Without speaking a word, we both knew that wherever the laughter was coming from, we had to investigate. 

We pulled off the highway and drove deep into the countryside until we stumbled upon the source of the laughter: a small farmhouse, with a large wooden porch illuminated by the burning orange of the setting sun. As we slowly pulled into the driveway, the laughter grew louder, and I could see a group of people sitting around a picnic table, laughing hysterically. 
 
Although we were strangers to them, they welcomed us with open arms. For the next few hours, my friend and I were both captivated by their stories, jokes and contagious laughter. By the time we left that evening, we had made some incredible new friends.
