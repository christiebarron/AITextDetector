The Empire State Building was built in 1931 in New York City. Construction of the impressive building took only one year and 45 days with an estimated 3,400 workers. However, no one anticipated the efforts that would later be needed to incorporate the mooring mast â€“ a feature that would allow dirigibles to dock safely at the top of the building. Despite the many challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State Building, they had the determination to make the mooring mast a reality and open the door to a unique form of transport. 

The journey to install the mooring mast was not easy and a multitude of obstacles arose for the people involved. Designing the mast was the first obstacle. The rules governing airships at the time required the mast to have one-twentieth the strength of the Empire State Building. This delicate balance of creating a strong enough support but not one too heavy was a challenge, even for the best minds of the day. The other obstacle was the logistics of constructing the mast. The 600-foot mast had to be built on top of a building so tall that workers risked vertigo and sun glare. Supplies and materials, such as the standard steel mast itself, had to be hauled up in an open elevator or suspended in the cargo area of an aircraft. This limited the dimensions of the jacking and installation equipment that could be used. 

The workers also had to take great care to ensure that the dirig
