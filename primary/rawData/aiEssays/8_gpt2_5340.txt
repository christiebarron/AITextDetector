One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was looking at an old picture. When someone says, I'm sorry, it sounds bad…I think people sometimes need to learn something to look like a stranger, to speak. But…I'm not sure, since I have no intention of saying "It's okay, okay, okay, you're okay, you're okay, all right…" but for me these words are part of living a new life.

If I see someone, look me in the eye, look at me, and tell me my friends are okay, so can I, even though I'm so insecure and miserable? I want something positive, something positive that would make my friends happy and to be able to do well once I'm out of my comfort zone. Or how could I not hear this line from this guy: "You like your friend?" You hear what I'm saying. I know it's a little hard for me to do, but I believe it's one of the joys of life.
