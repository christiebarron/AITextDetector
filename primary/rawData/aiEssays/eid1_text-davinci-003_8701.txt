I remember when I first met my best friend. We didn’t know each other too well—just that we had mutual friends and classes together. During our first conversation, I couldn’t help but notice how awkward we both were. But then all of a sudden something hilarious happened, and we both cracked up. It was such a release of tension—all of a sudden, it felt like we'd known each other forever.

We just sat there and laughed until our sides hurt, and it was like magic. We had instantly connected in an unexpected way that neither of us had experienced before.

After that day, I knew we were going to be friends for life, and I still admire how quickly we could bond on that day over a simple, shared moment of laughter. That's why laughter is so powerful—it can truly bring two people together in an instant!
