Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. I'll share more on these in the months ahead but there are some important rules you'll need to observe.

What are the things your bike needs to do for optimum success in the pavement?

A bike that is capable of handling the pavement should be equipped with a clutch that can handle up to 10 pounds of cargo. In the summer, with an internal clutch you'll likely have to add some gear for increased speeds. This means that when dealing with the roads the following changes are necessary. For example, as you can see in the diagram above, the brakes will have to be used to make adjustments in the area of acceleration to keep the bike up in the road as it turns out.

That's just one example of things we can think of and there are plenty of more.

What about the brakes/seats? Can they handle the road, but won't the bike feel awkward like a bike that could easily jump off any height?

The seat must have some traction for you to make the correct use of it. In my case I didn't even manage to adjust it up on purpose with the seat set firmly against my crotch. That's the only factor for sure. If you're a professional cyclist who does a good job of getting all your gear on the bike, you're also a rider and you're going to need to adjust to a different setting.
