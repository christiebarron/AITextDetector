I remember it like it was yesterday, I was volunteering at the local homeless shelter late one night. It was an often overlooked part of the city, and the people I encountered there were in desperate need of help. One particular man came in asking for a blanket, and when I told him we had none, he became frustrated and began ranting about the injustice of the situation. As he shouted, I remained silent, taking a deep breath and remembering to stay patient.

I calmly reminded him that the shelter was doing all it could to help, and I asked him if there was anything else I could do. I could see that his anger was slowly abating, and he eventually asked for some food. I helped him get a small meal and talked to him about getting back on his feet. I cared for him not as some angry homeless man, but as another struggling human being.

He eventually calmed down and thanked me before departing with a calmer outlook than when he had arrived. I was proud of myself for remaining patient and understanding the difficult situation he was experiencing. I will never forget that day and the importance of staying kind and patient during challenging moments.
