The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Docking dirigibles posed unique challenges that had to be addressed when creating architectural plans for the building. In Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted's "The Mooring Mast," it becomes evident just how difficult these obstacles were to overcome.

The first obstacle became apparent when considering the architecture of the building itself. To ensure that it could withstand the powerful winds that dirigibles generate during docking, a mooring mast was designed and built specifically for the Empire State Building. The structure placed on the top of the building was created to have a capacity that could house several dirigibles, and be wide enough for the docking arms to reach and secure them. The mast was built with a sturdy base that could withstand the winds generated by the airships, allowing for a safe and secure docking.

The second obstacle was that of the location. For a dirigible to dock safely atop the Empire State Building, the airspace would need to be cleared of any obstructions, including other buildings, power lines, and even trees. This challenge was especially daunting, as it would require collaboration between the Empire State Building and other nearby landowners in order to secure the necessary clearance. 

The third challenge was engineering. Even after all the necessary clearances, the Empire State Building had to be able to support the weight of the airships when they dock. In order to address this, the
