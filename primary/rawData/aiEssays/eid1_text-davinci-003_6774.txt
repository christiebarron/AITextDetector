Dear Editor, 

As computers become increasingly prevalent in our lives, it is important to consider how they are shaping our society. In my opinion, computers are having both positive and negative effects on the people who use them.

On the positive side, computers are giving people incredible opportunities to access information, connect with each other, and work smarter and faster. Through powerful search engines like Google, people can gain access to vast amounts of knowledge almost instantly. Moreover, by using video conferencing tools or social media, people can collaborate across borders and develop cross-cultural relationships. Meanwhile, advances in artificial intelligence and automation are allowing people to complete time-intensive tasks more quickly and efficiently.

On the negative side, some argue that computers are having a detrimental effect on people’s health and well-being. A sedentary lifestyle involving long hours sitting at a computer can lead to physical health concerns. Those working at a computer can also succumb to eyestrain from staring at a bright screen for too long. In addition, many people are becoming more and more addicted to the internet, leading to a lack of productiveness and difficulty with social relationships. 

It is evident that computers offer a vast range of benefits, yet it is also important to acknowledge the potential pitfalls associated with the technology. We must be mindful that while computers bring incredible potential, excessive use can lead to a detrimental impact on people’s lives.

Sincerely,
[
