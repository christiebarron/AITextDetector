The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

It seemed the only way they would get ahead of the engineers was by making something far better. In 1947, the World Trade Center underwent its first public exhibition. Many workers showed up to learn that the skyscrapers were not built by a single contractor. With the goal of preserving the Empire State Building for another 50 years, they decided to build it by contractors with experience in aeronautics. It was their first piece of art designed by someone with the skill needed.

To the surprise of more than 10,000 fans at the exhibition, NASA astronaut Edgar Mitchell and the U.S. Air Force's Charles de Gaulle set about trying to make the iconic piece better than they could with the help of contractors. They came up with "Invisible" and made a three-foot-square box that held the workbench. The box allowed engineers to inspect it and determine what the final product would do.

The next step in the effort was to put a building back into its former glory state. That was when two companies — the U.S. Department of Energy and the Smithsonian Institution — signed a contract for a project called "invisible walled-off building." It was an incredibly ambitious project that was finally put to a vote of the assembled staff of Engineers Association of America members.
