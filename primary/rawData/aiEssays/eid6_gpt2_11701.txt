The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first obstacle was building two long-distance trucks in line. The truck truck is designed for rapid acceleration and power transfer. The second obstacle was the requirement of a driver to be trained in proper safety standards. The bridge and steel panels were much less secure as they require a great deal more maintenance than vehicles are capable of installing in a given place. These obstacles also prevented the construction workers from maintaining an engineering level and therefore improved their chances of success. The two vehicles would have to be moved from the same location.


The final obstacle involved a "gigantic" concrete dome â€“ an idea that had been proposed to the building firm a few decades earlier. With more concrete than any concrete dome available from any manufacturer in the world, the builders were unable to avoid building two different, larger, concrete dummies. As the design proceeded along, some parts were altered by the development work and some were added to the dome by the construction crew to enhance its shape. The building firm eventually decided to make the dome more slender so as to allow the architects less chance of over-exploitation by the builders.

A third obstacle was the possibility of a "gigantic" concrete dome that would resemble what was seen on the Titanic. Building two concrete dummies were in order but the building firm decided to build a second one and to avoid further duplication of pieces and equipment. During construction it was
