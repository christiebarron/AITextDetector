Computers have many effects on people. Some of them are related, some of them temporary.

A second effect of computers has been the increase in numbers of computers around the world. For an example, we've seen a trend of decreasing numbers of computer users:

(We might want to include in our list of "software-dependent" activities, the fact that computers can be a source of friction for the average business. There are some really bad ones â€” like the Internet censorship wars. The Internet is also an incredibly powerful tool in the fight against terrorism and other bad behavior, but it is far, far from free.)

Another phenomenon happens in the developing world, where people use computers on a smaller scale. A few months ago, people were talking about computers that had no impact at all on real life, such as the Internet.

So we must think carefully about what our world has become: what are its consequences for its users? I am, of course, going to try not to talk about many of their biggest issues. I'm also pretty sure that some of them will be worse things. But I will not write too much about them, because the fact is they are very hard to see, because they are so small and so tiny in terms of their effects on us.

What is this effect in the developing world? Let's look at two examples of this.

You see people who are starting the software business use their computers to generate
