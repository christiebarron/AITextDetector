The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Some tried to make large, high-flying vehicles, though the plan was thwarted by a lack of airship support. Some also tried to create artificial gravity fields.

During the first and second half of the 20th century, as technologies advanced, people became more and more comfortable with the idea of using their feet to push objects onto the top of tall buildings or walls. Now many people have a different way to carry a heavy object.

The first attempt in the 1940s to use a dirigible was by British sailor Joseph Wilson, who would go on to sail the United States at speeds of 500 and 700 knots and maintain a speed of 13 knots at sea. The dirigibles that Wilson's ship helped to launch included two small space station craft, one called the Pee-Wee Hermann and the other Bistro-designed, which would become American Starliners in 1968, but it didn't make the list.

Wilson's flying craft was never meant to fly, but after becoming interested in more practical use of gravity by pilots, he developed the Pewter, a three-wheeled, twin-engine flying craft that would eventually make it onto service to the U.S. military and the Navy in 1965.

The idea of using the dirigible in an aircraft first evolved as a concept in the 50s, when airliners were still being developed
