One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I decided to give up doing some sports. My passion lies in life, and my wife and I have always found it very funny to watch others laughing. I was so surprised when I saw people who were very funny at these events like my girlfriend (Tina), and everyone I went to loved her. I felt so happy when I had this opportunity. I love watching the comedy of the sport and enjoying it in a positive way about what has to happen. I believe that laughter can be a lifesaver and I believe that it cannot last forever.

Thank you to all for taking the time out to support these organizations. I ask you to also tell the world about how lucky you are to live with the family of your favorite players and athletes. I feel that life is not set upon a man or women who have the best interest of their fans at heart. The world could be worse if most people don't get to see how wonderful sport is, and we must not let that be a limitation to our game. I hope that everyone at this site can see what a world of fun is like as it will allow us to continue to play. For all our fans out there wishing we could keep that from happening, please have a seat at the table. Also, there are a lot of amazing people with real stories to share!
