An example of a time someone in my life was patient was I remember I was the only time in my life I ever had a stroke. My heart didn't beat through my chest at the time and I was able to rest comfortably (like I'd thought my heart was ready to return) until about three or four months later.

And now I'm thinking about something different. After a year at hospital, I am now able to walk again. I was able to walk for quite some time now - I just don't know what else to tell you. I'm very grateful for the support and the help, but for the little things I do, I'm sorry. The doctor's voice was always nice and gentle. But it isn't normal. It's normal and it is painful. The medication I'm getting and taking, is actually less dangerous and I'm able to walk again. I can't say I've seen it from anyone with a heart attack - there were lots of people who were trying everything to hide their heart attack but all they could do is scream and they stayed on and they died from the shock for an entire year without being able to see their family again and to tell their family, that the hospital was OK.

It's not the same. It's different. People who have been on different medications and are in a wheelchair can't move a muscle. A person with a broken leg is able to breathe more freely with no problem, but they are suffering
