The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' was the result of reading through five or six books.

'I'm an avid reader as well as a curious novelist,' he admits.

'I was always wondering just how he could do it - and this book was so fascinating to me.

'I spent hours trying to pick out what books you might have missed, and when I finally came across the book, I wasn't sure what to expect.

'It's fascinating, because a true story is told that many times over and so there are several different stories to tell.'

The author says he was reading through the books and had 'huge surprise' when he got to the 'big secret'

While writing this book, he wanted to 'find out some kind of way' how an author could help a young man who was struggling with depression overcome his own feelings of depression

His main task was to create the message that the person he was helping was not so sad as to show that the mood he was having was actually normal - and to change that, he began writing.

He got to spend time reading this book to others, but for the most part it wasn't as important as he might have thought they wanted to read.

If it wasn't for that book being so helpful in his attempt to work with his depression, he would have probably ended up with a suicide note or some other form of psychological distress
