Narciso Rodriguez's memoir 'From Home: The Blueprints of our Lives' creates a contemplative and bittersweet mood. Rodriguez reflects on his upbringing in Hoboken, New Jersey - a place that was a key part of his journey to becoming one of the most iconic American fashion designers. Throughout the memoir, an aura of nostalgia and sentimentality hangs heavily in the air.

Rodriguez writes candidly about growing up as an immigrant in a New Jersey suburb. He speaks of the struggle, both internal and external, that he faced by seeking a career in a field historically dominated by white Europeans. Through his words, we sense his longing for a place that can be considered a home, both emotionally and spiritually. 

He expresses fond memories of bonding with his father by helping him in the tailor and fur shops, evoking feelings of comfort and closeness, and of spending time with family and friends around the dinner table, creating a subtle subtext of family and security.

At the same time, we gain insight into the hurdles that controlled his life. Although the obstacles happened in his past, they create an uneasy feeling and understanding that sometimes a person must venture away from home in order to pursue their dreams and find themselves.

Thus, the mood of Rodriguez's memoir 'From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives' is a complicated mix of nostalgia, longing, and a longing for home accompanied by an understanding of the journey towards growth and fulfillment
