The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. When they couldn't locate the pilot at a high vantage point, they needed to find another pilot through the public-domain photo app and a picture of the pilot at a lower point in the sky.

The engineers spent months, and years, studying the options. So they came up with a workaround that allowed dirigibles to dock safely on the skyscraper's upper floors and over the roof from anywhere.
