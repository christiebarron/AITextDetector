The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. It was believed to require a pilot's license, though others believed that could make it more difficult to get the aircraft off the ground.

The most recent attempt to get a dirigible off of the building was last December, however, when the New York Department of Transportation finally secured an emergency contract for the project. The construction of the new bridge at Washington and Broadway, the first of its kind in the country, involved one-time permit requests.

The Department of Transportation initially said that it would accept the $10 million in funding and agreed that the construction of the new station would still require a license and be done. The permit was later turned down and the final permit was granted.

The work on that bridge has finally begun. But the project may require years of work just to convince drivers that it's safe. The new station could also be problematic because, as a way to get around New York state's aging infrastructure, a permit that would let people keep their cars on the carriageway would require a person to carry five gallons of water.

The DOT says it's working on the building permits process with the federal highway department and with the American Red Cross.
