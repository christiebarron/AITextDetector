I have to admit, there were moments of incredible awkwardness throughout the early stages of our relationship. I’m not entirely sure why I found myself so attracted to him - whether it was his sparkling blue eyes or his cool, laid-back demeanour, but I was definitely hooked. We had met through a mutual friend who had invited us both partying. I discovered I was the only single one there, but that didn’t stop our conversation or chemistry - it seemed to always find a way to flow between us.

We eventually managed to rope our mutual friend into setting us up on a date. We chose to meet in a restaurant for dinner and I was ridiculously nervous. My heart was pounding in my chest as I waited for him to arrive. When he finally did, I could hardly look him in the eye.

But then, something incredible happened. He began to tell me a funny joke, and we both quickly burst into peals of laughter. All the nervous tension immediately melted away and we both felt completely at ease. After that moment, I think we both knew there wouldn’t be any more awkward silences. 

We went on to date for many months, and even though we had the occasional disagreement, we could always find our way back to each other through laughter. It was the glue that held us both together - a reminder of the spark that had escaped us to begin with.
