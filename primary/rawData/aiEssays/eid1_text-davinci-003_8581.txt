Growing up I had a lot of patience. I remember a time when I was in middle school and I was trying out for the school's basketball team and was constantly practicing. Every day after school, I made sure to spend at least an hour or two on the court trying to perfect my shots, dribbling, and passing skills.

I had gotten better throughout the months and was confident in my abilities. However, as tryouts approached, I started to get more nervous and even had the occasional meltdown when I just couldn't seem to make a shot. During those moments, I had to remind myself to stay patient and be open-minded.

Sure enough, it paid off when I made the team and even made captain in my last years of middle school. It was a great accomplishment and I couldn't have done it without the patience I had been developing over the years.
