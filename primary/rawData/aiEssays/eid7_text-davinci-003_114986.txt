I had always been the type of person to take things as they come and not rush to lead. That's why I was looking forward to taking the summer off from school and working at a beachfront rental office. As a teenager, I had never held a real job before, so I was sure I was going to make a few mistakes in the beginning.

It soon became clear that I had a lot more to learn than I had thought. My boss was stern and demanding, but also understanding. He answered my questions patiently and took the time to explain things to me when I needed help. As I worked, I noticed that all the more experienced employees had become quite familiar with the business, and as a result, rushing and impatience crept into their interactions with customers. However, my boss always remained patient and polite, no matter how frustrated he may have been. 

The patience he showed me during my time there taught me an invaluable lesson in how to handle tricky situations in a way that is both professional and respectful. I am forever grateful for the patience my boss over that summer, since it helped me learn the basics of how to carry myself in the workplace more gracefully.
