Dear Editor,

Today, computers have become a routine part of everyday life. We are surrounded by computers in the workplace, at home, and in our pockets. While computers have revolutionized the way we live and work, I believe it is important to consider the effects of computers on people.

In a widespread and globalized economy, computers make practically all of our lives easier. They help us track and store important data, search for information quickly, and maintain communication around the world. However, with the increased reliance on technology, it becomes easy to forget the social and emotional aspects of life. Instead of engaging in conversations in person, it is often simpler and easier to avoid someone via digital technology. Furthermore, studies suggest that computers can take away a person’s ability to think for themselves by providing easy answers to questions and instilling a reliance on external sources.

Ultimately, computers must be used responsibly in order to avoid the negative effects they can have on people. For example, it’s important to build time for healthy social interaction into everyday life, even if this time is as simple as having a conversation with someone about the weather. Additionally, adults and children alike should be encouraged not to rely on computers for their answers and to think creatively to find solutions.

I firmly believe that, with thoughtful consideration, computers can lead to positive effects on people and our way of life.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
