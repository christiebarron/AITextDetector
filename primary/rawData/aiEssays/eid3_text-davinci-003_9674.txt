The features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead" directly affect the cyclist and their experience. The article takes place in an urban setting, specifically on a broken and neglected alley road. This rough terrain serves as a metaphor to signify the inner struggles of the cyclist. At first, they attempt to push through the disrepair without notice; it is only after the futile debt to pretend the road is not in an unstable condition do they begin facing the realities of the ill-maintained alley.

The broken road acts as a challenge to the cyclist, as they must avoid the potholes and debris while traversing the alley. This forces the cyclist to focus harder on their path and the obstacles that stand in their way, a reflection of the difficulty they must endure during their own life trials. In addition, the overgrown weeds and dilapidated buildings that line the path serve as a symbol of the societal struggles the cyclist is navigating every day. 

The cyclist in "Rough Road Ahead" ultimately gains insight from the encounter, realizing that they must take on the task of fixing up their own inner roads that are in need of mending. By facing the challenges of the alleyway and successfully navigating it, the cyclist finds a metaphorical lesson in the experience. In this way, the setting of the story aids in the transformation of the cyclist's struggles into self-discovery.
