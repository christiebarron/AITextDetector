I was out to dinner with my best friend to celebrate her passing her driving test. She'd been hoping to get her license for months so it was a huge accomplishment. We were chatting and laughing, and halfway through the meal she started making some pretty outlandish remarks. We were both laughing so hard our stomachs were aching. 

Then, out of nowhere, this awkward silence descended. It was the kind of silence that feels like it's going to last forever. Eventually, we both erupted into laughter. We were both realizing the same thing at the same time: We had been so caught up in the humorous moment that we had forgotten to keep eating! We both sat there, laughing at ourselves, our silly moment, and the absurdity of it all. 

It was so refreshing to be in that moment with my best friend, and it felt like my bond with her had been strengthened exponentially. To this day, we still joke about the time we got so caught up in the moment that we stopped eating. It's one of our favorite memories, and it makes me smile every time I remember it.
