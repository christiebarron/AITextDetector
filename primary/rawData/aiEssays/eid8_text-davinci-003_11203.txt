I will never forget the first time I heard my new husband, Anthony, laugh. We had just got married three weeks prior and knew that we were embracing a lot of changes. One night after dinner, we decided to watch a comedy show together. It was the first time Anthony had seen this particular show, while I was a loyal fan. While I laughed uproariously at the jokes, Anthony just sat there quietly. Then, out of nowhere, a joke hit him and he burst out into a laugh. It was the most carefree and contagious laugh I had ever heard. I found myself laughing too, not just at the show but at the joy I felt watching him laugh. After that night, we would mostly joke around a lot, but that first time will always be the most special.
