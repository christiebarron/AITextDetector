Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. The range of options increases depending on the bike's riding style and the rider's riding style preference. For example, a range of different rider sizes for women and men can potentially offer wider ranges of options for a wide range of different riding styles. Rowing Style Rows can also vary widely depending on the rider's riding style preference.
