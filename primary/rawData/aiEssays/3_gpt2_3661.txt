Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. The bike's position is known through its lower parts. In the final distance from the bridge there is significant bumping up. That's a good thing and there were reports earlier that the cyclist had just gone through it before it hit the ground and so there were many people out there trying to get through and some had taken out a car.

A look at some pictures after the attack (file picture) After the attacks in Nice, the cyclist's position can be reduced further.

The distance between 'Rough Road Ahead' and the bridge is between two mountains. The bridge is about a block between it. Some people have been injured in the crossing. It should be noted that it is quite narrow (100 cm from end of main road to the bridge!)

The area was a little less dangerous for cyclists as the road was less travelled by bike and it was less exposed to wind and we are not talking about the main roads on the hill. The cyclists were more likely to stay out of the water along with the drivers that went along with the scene.
