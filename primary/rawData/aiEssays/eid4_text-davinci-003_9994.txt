Minfong Ho ends the poem Winter Hibiscus with this line to create a symbolic meaning. The hibiscus has become a metaphor for the protagonist's own life and her struggles to succeed. The line serves as a reminder that while she may be struggling now, she will have to take the same test over again in the spring, when she will have the opportunity to try again and find success. The imagery of the geese returning and the snow melting represents a new beginning for the protagonist and her own growth and development as she overcomes the difficulties of winter.
