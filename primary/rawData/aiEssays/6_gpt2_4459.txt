The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The Empire State Building is the world's tallest structure, and a large amount of space remains to be reclaimed for it, which could lead to some complications. Some of the items used on the Empire State Building may not be safe to use on a space ship. Even if it could be kept safe, what would that mean for the rest of the building structure's space?
