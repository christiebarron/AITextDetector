The construction of the Empire State Building was an incredible engineering feat, but another great challenge of the construction was allowing dirigibles to dock on the building’s spire. The construction of a mast durable enough to accommodate mooring ropes, along with the problems posed by high altitude winds, needed innovative solutions. 

The mast that was designed for the dirigibles had to withstand the strong winds that blow through New York City, especially those at the high altitudes. Due to the spire’s height, it was necessary that the mast have a high tensile strength to support the weight of the dirigibles. In order to build a mast that could perform these tasks, the builders had to turn to special kinds of steel and use new welding techniques. The mast was composed of duralumin, which is stronger and lighter than other types of steel, and is relatively resistant to corrosion. The mast was also constructed with butt welding, a process that allowed each section of the structure to be welded together for increased durability.

In addition, builders had to construct a platform on top of the Empire State Building where the rope could be attached to the dirigible. This raised the issue of ensuring safe passage from the platform to the spire mast. The engineers designed a folded ladder that allowed a worker to ascend the mast without needing to stretch too far away from it. This ladder was an important factor in being able to get the dirigibles d
