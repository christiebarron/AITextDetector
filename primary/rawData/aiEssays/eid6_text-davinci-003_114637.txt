The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with a unique challenge when confronted with the possibility of allowing dirigibles to dock at the highest and most well-known skyscraper of the time. Not only were there numerous engineering feats required to make the operation of dirigible mooring possible, there were also numerous safety concerns and political concerns that required careful deliberation and negotiations.

The first obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome was engineering a stable and safe system for mooring a large airship. The original plan developed by the Empire State Building Company was a steel tower protruding out from the 102nd floor of the building. Initially, the tower was to include a 1000-foot mast that would extend out from the building. At the top of the mast would be a cable that the dirigible could secure into place. However, it was soon realized that the sheer weight of such a mast combined with the ever-changing wind shifts around the building would be too dangerous and could potentially cause a catastrophic collapse.

Additionally, the project of allowing dirigibles to moor at the Empire State Building was met with significant political concerns. This task required the cooperation of many government agencies and the granting of safety certifications. Though both the Empire State Building Company and the American Zeppelin Corporation attempted to provide evidence that the mooring mast would be a safe facility, the lengthy bureaucracy and debates amongst the relevant government entities delayed full approval.
