One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I made a mistake. I came down with pneumonia. I had only the skin between my legs. I would hold my chest up to catch air but not my neck. My face became red and my hands went cold. All of a sudden, it was so hard I couldn't move. I was very sick and could only think that I was in shock as I was on top of the floor. I was in such pain you can hear my breathing coming back."

Chen says, "I knew my father had died. I didn't even know the situation until I was in my own room, as the curtains were still on top of the table, all of the windows in my room were down. I was shaking for a while, because I couldn't breathe without getting hot."

Chen says, "I thought, "I can put my head down next to the curtain and it wouldn't happen again. I couldn't breathe for almost five minutes. I felt myself get extremely cold. I realized that I was in my own room at the time."
