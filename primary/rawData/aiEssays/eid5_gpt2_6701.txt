The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is clear and intense on that front. We must now see how we, and we alone, can make this work.

As I look ahead, it's clear why this book is so important and why no one should have any doubt about its significance.


The following three days in 2011 have been extraordinary in the way the world has reacted to what is arguably an important chapter of her life and character.


This is when the most powerful thing about her book is now so clear and strong. 'From Home is' is based around five things:

1. This book is not about being a woman

2. Women need to read books that are as accurate as possible

3. Women need to choose their books

4. Women need to do other gender based roles and responsibilities

5. Women need to engage in the work that brings them the strength to live life in the most authentic and authentic ways possible.

From the beginning of the book, she presents the issues that women face, from the gender issues, to what she describes as the roles faced by women in the workplace and to the 'perceived'sex' of women that have become invisible.

You already knew this, but you don't know much more about her.


What makes her book so great is how she makes her vision and ideas feel true to me. It makes me laugh and feel happy.
