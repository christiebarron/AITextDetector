In Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead,” the protagonist is a cyclist riding on a road in a wild area of Chicago. The setting of the story affects the cyclist in a number of ways, most significantly in terms of the physical and mental effort she must put forth in attempting to navigate the rough terrain.

The many physical features of the setting make the journey difficult for the cyclist. The environment is described as “empty,” filled with “abandoned warehouses and boarded-up shops.” In addition, the road itself is described as being “full of potholes,” creating a hazardous ride for the cyclist. The cyclist is further challenged by the exhausting effort required to negotiate the several “sharp climbs” that the road presents. These physical obstacles present a significant challenge for the cyclist both in terms of her safety and in the strength of will and power of determination that is required to complete the task.

The mental impact of the setting is no less challenging for the cyclist than the physical. In addition to the sense of isolation she feels due to the lack of people or other cyclists, the cyclist is also presented with her own internal doubts and fears. The challenges of the terrain, combined with the “stark emptiness” of the setting, cause the cyclist to feel discouraged and overwhelmed. The cyclist must dig deep within herself to overcome the fear and continue on her journey.
