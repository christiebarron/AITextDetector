One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I had to watch a couple of sports games. I am a bit embarrassed to admit I have laughed so much because I am not very good at that. But I don't think I have ever been laughing just the way I am."

"I don't know what the joke was. I didn't come across the joke on reddit, because I was sitting there thinking I didn't like the idea of jokes as people and I was laughing so hard and not understanding what I was doing, but when you are an avid sports fan you can have no idea what goes on when people are like, 'Oh my god, that was funny!'"

When asked why he does not laugh at jokes during the game that he feels are so disrespectful and insulting, he said: "Because I am doing the biggest show of my life in New York â€“ New York is my home and has nothing to do with my sport."

"I am the ultimate sports fan. I just have to have a good time and go out there and do something. As an athlete you don't have to worry in the back, on set, in practice or around the team. There are more to come from me than just having fun."
