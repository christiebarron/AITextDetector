The ending of the poem is hopeful and contemplative, as the main character reflects on their successes and failures. The symbolism of the hibiscus plant is used to provide a metaphor for the speaker's growth and resilience, and the imagery of the spring and melting snow hints at the possibility of renewal and transformation. The speaker is suggesting that, as the plant begins to bloom, they will take the test again and will have the opportunity to show what they have learned and grown from their experiences. Ultimately, the poem is a reminder to keep going and to never give up on one's goals and ambitions.
