In Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead,” the setting plays an important role in the cyclist’s experience. The cyclist rides down an abandoned street, surrounded by ruins of warehouses and abandoned workshops. This creates an atmosphere of loneliness and despair, which adds to the tension of the cyclist’s ride. The cyclist is in an environment in which anything could happen, as the long, desolate street leads to an unknown destination.

The rider maintains a steady speed of about 25 mph, despite the damaged street. The deteriorated asphalt reflects the amount of time it’s been since anyone has driven or walked down the road. The cyclist is surrounded by decaying buildings, and he also passes by piles of scrap metal and broken glass. This adds an element of danger to the environment as well. Anything could lurk in the shadows of the ruined buildings and around the piles of junk, making the cyclist feel uneasy and vulnerable.

Another important feature of the setting is the light. As the rider passes by abandoned factories, the street is illuminated by shadowy, flickering lights, adding to the unease and giving the cyclist even more reason to be wary of his surroundings.
