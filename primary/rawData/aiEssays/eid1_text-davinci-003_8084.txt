In the 1930s, the Empire State Building was constructed in New York City, USA. At the time, it was the tallest man-made structure in the world, and was intended to be a symbol of the future of modern progress. This ambitious project also created an unprecedented challenge: allowing dirigibles, or airships, to dock on the top of the building. In the book "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock are described in detail.

To begin with, there were significant risks associated with the concept. Dirigibles rely on helium to stay aloft, and if a spark were created near the dirigible, the resulting explosion would represent a significant danger to people on the ground below. Secondly, the sheer height of the building – over a thousand feet – posed a challenge. A docking mast needed to be added to the building structure, and it had to be secure enough to withstand strong winds and gusts. The engineering process for the dock also presents a unique challenge; any mooring mast had to be designed to handle the weight and strain of a large, unwieldy airship.

Furthermore, even when the mooring mast was constructed, the building owners had to find a way to attract passengers who were willing to take the risk ?air travel to the top was a novelty, but not yet commonplace The owners
