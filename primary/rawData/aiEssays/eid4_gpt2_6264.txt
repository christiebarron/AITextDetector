The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it asks: Will people not believe in Jesus Christ? Is it true or is it just a lie? Does the Bible speak of a God of many levels of belief, such as those who make up the "true believers"? It concludes by telling us that those seeking salvation and those who wish to be saved simply don't understand the Bible:

But since our minds are far more complex, and our ideas and views are, if not completely different from their understanding, to our Atlantis of God, it is important for us to know about the real God as fully as we can. We now know that the God of our religion has a life of its own, and this life of ours has no boundaries. Our understanding is based on the truths of the Bible. But that understanding means that we must believe. We will believe because Christ is at last the God of mankind, and that is what he wants our faith to be about. We know that all of us can be saved by faith, and if we trust in Christ our faith may be truly at peace with God.
