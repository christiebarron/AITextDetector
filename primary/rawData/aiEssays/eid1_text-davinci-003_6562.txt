Dear Editor,

As technology has advanced, computers have become an essential part of our daily lives. Everywhere you look now, you will see people using computers to do their work, research the latest news, or even just to relax with a few games. Have you ever stopped to think about how computers can affect us? 

I believe the advancement of technology has overwhelmingly been a positive influence on humanity. Computers help us to connect with people, no matter how far away they are, and to find answers to almost any question that pops into our minds. They help us to learn new skills, develop relationships with other businesses, and even to speed up our daily tasks. With a computer, you can take care of your documents, research, and accounting without ever leaving your chair.

On the other hand, it is important to remember that computers can also have a negative effect on people. Not only can lengthy hours on the computer be hazardous to your mental and physical health, but computers can also give us too much information too quickly. People have a limited time to absorb the information that they are taking in, regardless of how helpful it is to them. 

All in all, computers have helped us to make some incredible advancements, and have helped to make our lives easier. While we should be aware of their potential risks, I think that we should all recognize computers for the invaluable resource they are, and for the positive effects they have had on our lives.
