I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is based on the premise that these materials will not be disseminated without a fair access through a trusted third party. The Library of Congress will continue to make sure that the materials in question are made accessible only to authorized public access and to the Library Service for which their contents were approved. At the National Book Critics Circle, our national staff and our other dedicated staff members will continue to work to ensure the availability of accessible materials and make sure to include on some books an important message for young people who might otherwise disagree with them and in particular those with disabilities."

The ACLU said Korg's report "calls into question our current and existing system and our current policy and practices that prevent free speech to be suppressed and held responsible for the consequences to public figures who challenge these policies," including the government's response to critics' concerns about the library's decision to not publish the book "in full." The agency said that despite the fact that several prominent critics, including the late Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Paul Dini, were censored in 2013 and 2014, it "continues to evaluate and evaluate those critical views and will continue to work with law enforcement agencies to make sure that all of these perspectives are heard."

It is the first time the legal community has heard about the decision from the Copyright Office of the Library of Congress to not publish a work by James Joyce to its own library list this year
