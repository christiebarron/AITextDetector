An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a young woman from New Jersey who had fallen sick in the middle of the night while sleeping in an abandoned house. She had given up some of her belongings or found a place to live. At night, I had her up close and personal with me in what would turn out to be her house. I asked her what she wanted, hoping that we could figure out a way to deal with his situation. I did a round of interviews with her (she was a mother), worked with her several times in a conference room together in which she explained how difficult and frustrating the past seven months have been for her.

In short, my work of self-sufficiency is my work of God.
