The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. It was argued that the Empire State Building could never do that since the building would move through most of the city. But the city wanted to add something special.

A few weeks after the movie's publication, California's Transportation Department gave the state the green light to remove dirigibles from the state's buildings. So the city took the concept seriously and began constructing them.

"It was the biggest engineering challenge we didn't realize we had, and it was the biggest cost," says Robert Hildreth of the California Institute of Technology that built the building. "It really cost us about $500,000, and we decided to do something special with the project because we really couldn't have done it without the support of the state, the local government and the federal government, who said, 'No way we can get to it without you.'"

The massive, $17 and an estimated $30 million in federal funding were necessary to construct the tower, Hildreth says â€“ and because it's a real-estate deal in the United States, all the state had to spend was a couple million dollars.
