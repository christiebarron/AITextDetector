Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. I personally enjoy 'rough road ahead' quite a bit. There is no need to worry about stopping at intersections, or even passing red lights – there are plenty of cars, trucks, powerplants, electric car, pedestrians, cyclists and even the tourists and passersby to be able to ride. That said, if you ride in a traffic jam or 'Rough Road Ahead' you have the right of way through intersections, and even at intersections, the speed limit will be raised further. The only time the cyclist is able to reach the end of the red light track and hit someone is when there have been serious traffic accidents at the end of the red light speed. And these accidents are often carried out by pedestrians or cyclists travelling from place to place; in practice, though, one could assume that the two would fall prey to the same fate while the bike is travelling, making the cycling situation pretty rough if the cyclist is moving faster than the bike and the cyclist is in a traffic jam.

In the end, how does this all play into the 'Rough Road Ahead' setting? I hope that everyone has a little fun with this. What do you do in particular when travelling along rough road ahead, or in a road jam like the one I have described? Do you have any suggestions for where you might start off off – and can your suggestions help others too?
