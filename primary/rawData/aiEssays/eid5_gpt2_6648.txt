The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' was all-consumingly dark. The book opened with a rousing, ominous narrative of love, redemption and the dangers of failure. But, once those dire prophecies were established, one could only hope that a book can be "changed" by the same kind of book-changing and spiritual experience.

Snyder, however, was just a brilliant writer to be. The title, of course, doesn't appear to have ever come from Snyder's mind when he wrote 'From Home.' Snyder's most impressive feature in this is his ability to speak of her life and times under the cover of the memoir. After she told him her story (as well as the ones about her children, her husband, his wife, and their mother), who he then told her he never knew, Snyder began writing a piece of art featuring her. You're left with your own stories, and while Snyder's work has long attracted numerous collectors, he does so with a kind of grace to ensure that each story comes as it comes: as if its creator had come up with the best idea.
