One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I watched an actress play a different woman sitting on a podium from herself. She walked away feeling confused. Then one of the people standing next to her said to me, 'You know what? She's not a real actress.' After I said that and did my own work, I was a bit taken aback what she did to herself like that.

"When you hear that there's only lip sync and heartbreak around you? That's just wrong. It's a shame we put up with this sort of shit. We also have to admit that we make up a lot of this. The people I meet don't know what to do. What happens is I go up to the podium on stage and that's what gives me the most pleasure, even though it's only a small part of the whole and it would seem that way to anyone who is into comedy."
