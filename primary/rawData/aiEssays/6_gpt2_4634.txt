The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first was the fact that the first-floor windows were either barred or partially opened. The second obstacle was the fact that a closed-doors window prevented the builders from putting down any of the doors. At the time, the second-floor windows of the Empire State Building were usually open and accessible by stairs and stairs. As time wore on, some of the upper and lower windows had been raised up, but the windows remained closed or closed (especially when building to facilitate the horizontal passage). This meant that there was no way for the new builders to walk to the elevators or to the elevator shaft, even if the new doors open from the lower floors.

Finally, there was the matter of how Dulce could have opened or closed the door. This was an issue which was discussed in the final meeting of the Committee on the Construction of a State Building at Madison Square Garden on September 6, 1946.

A further issue of note was how to move the elevators from basement into elevators in the Empire State Building if the stairways were closed up.

During the early stages of the building process, the builders of the Empire State Building had to prepare for various scenarios:

a.) to install elevators in the basement;

b.) to replace the existing stairs on the upper level with new one; and

c.) to make a vertical and horizontal descent
