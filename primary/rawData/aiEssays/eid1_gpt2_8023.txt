Computers have many effects on people. One of them is that there are always negative consequences to working with others. For example, you may feel that you haven't done enough in your careers because of your hard work. I've watched a lot of bad working habits people come across because they think it's unfair.

Another is that what they think about you is not necessarily the quality of your individual work performance. For example, what I see on social media is that people are not always positive about the work they have done in general because they believe that they haven't done enough with a given kind of performance. You see this in our work. This comes across in a sense in many businesses, where you just have to look at them for a different performance approach to your team.

Another thing is when people say "My girlfriend makes a great product" what they mean is something is not aligned with their personal interests. They don't know what their personal interests are. You're constantly talking about the performance you're going to create.

Another point we try to make is that there is a natural tendency to feel pressure to be good. To be good at a certain job makes you want to improve your performance or because you are trying to be better or are just lucky like you might be. But then when people feel that pressure to be good they just don't put themselves in a position where they're going to excel. They are going to find that they are just lazy.
