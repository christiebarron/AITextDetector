"Library patrons shouldn't have to worry about finding things to read in the public library in their library system," Justice Department lawyers said, without detailing how the library system works.

'Telling us they don't'

At stake in this case is whether the federal government can take control of the way public library services are distributed.

State and city libraries, which were the subject of a 2001 regulation by the FCC, all have agreed to the order. But all are being held liable over the decision, and the case can be heard in court on December 22.
