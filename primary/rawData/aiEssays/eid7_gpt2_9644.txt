An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I became pregnant with my first child. It was only a few weeks into the pregnancy. The first night before bed, she woke at 4 AM with the same problem. The next night, I went to sleep, then woke at 6 AM. By the time the doctor called back to check on me, I was sure I had a serious birth. When I gave birth I did not have my first born. No baby was born. We had a month and had two miscarriages. We had to leave my house for the next week and I asked for a week off to rest for a couple days. We would go back to the house again but the door still locked. It was that little day when I was diagnosed I was diagnosed with the birth syndrome. I remember just being overwhelmed. I also became the focus of a lot of anxiety I just couldn't stop talking about the baby I saw that day. A lot of people in my family had that anxiety. I started to look at how the birth happened to my child with a lot of emotion. It was when my first baby came out, and there was no other information, how soon I could talk about that. I started to think about the birth and I started being a little less anxious. I had no idea how to be. It was a pretty big day. For the first time the doctor thought I was a baby. I was not. We had two miscarriages
