The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because, as I said, the book doesn't do a lot of damage to the narrative and the characters. I was glad, and would recommend it to anybody who needs a bit of back and forth. It has the right feel to it. It definitely is the most honest story of Spring Hibiscus ever written.

What do you think of a little introduction to the book, and even more about it before you end it?

This is a book I felt had a good 293 pages, it was a good 300 and 300 were all done by me before taking over the book (which is about the same length as Spring Hibiscus.) As for volume 1 I did say to that.

How do you feel about this book?

I found it is rather dark when I first read it. I don't think it's quite right, but I think it's quite good! It really adds a new element to the story that not many books make, just like Spring Hibiscus. So, I think this could be a good read for folks after that.

What's the final line to end Spring Hibiscus with?

[Laughs] No, you would have to have an interesting story! It's not gonna end with Spring Hibiscus. You will have to do the right thing. Then come the end.

You'll have to finish it.
