The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. It was impractical for a car to dock because it would also make the vehicle harder to drive around at night. The building owner decided to build a full-sized dirigible based on a Tesla Model S instead, after which he wanted to build a single wing-mounted dirigible for the Empire State Building. The next generation, however, had problems, and the car couldn't dock. Once the next generation began, the car broke apart, causing any number of structural problems. The following year, after building the new dirigibles he saw that he could finally get his aircraft into production in time. This was then the year the plane was successfully delivered to New York City.
