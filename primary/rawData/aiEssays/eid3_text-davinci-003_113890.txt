In Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead,” the setting has a huge effect on the cyclist: it is no ordinary bike ride. The cyclist must navigate the harsh, rocky terrain, struggling to stay upright and avoid the obstacles in his path. The dangerous terrain requires complete attention from the cyclist in order to stay safe and make it to the end.

The challenging setting is especially evident when the cyclist is navigating a steep switchback drop. The terrain is lined with rocky outcroppings, and the sharp turns of the switchback make it difficult to remain in control. The terrain also changes at a fast pace, forcing the cyclist to adapt and adjust their movements rapidly to continue their progress.

The mountainous environment is also a challenge for the cyclist and requires them to constantly battle to keep their balance. The gradient changes abruptly, making it difficult to keep the same altitude. The cyclist is also forced to confront changes in uphills and downhills, requiring careful maneuvering to stay balanced.

The cyclist must also confront the frequent gusts of wind that make the ride even more difficult. The gusts of wind can make the cyclist lose focus and can throw off their balance. The cyclist must stay focused and remain aware of the wind in order to remain in control of the bike.
