I believe that censorship of materials in libraries (usually non-fiction) would be effective to the public good," said Daniel Pappas, president of the Library of Congress and chair of the National Book Critics Association. "No matter what library they hold, you can not expect people to write without the express permission of their library patrons."

For many scholars, the library is an example to other institutions, such as the American Library Association.

"How we could stop this from being a massive problem is very interesting â€” we know that it is a criminal offense," said Laura Womack, a computer scientist who leads the Association's Library Safety and Access Task Force. "There is a strong case that there can be substantial protection if a significant number of patrons are aware of people using the library without the express permission of the library."
