One time I experienced laughter in my life was when it occurred to me when I felt my brain explode.

In many years I have been fortunate enough to have experienced a "moment of a million years" as my baby was born. Every time I looked at my face, how the pain, sorrow, and shock was felt by my newborn baby, the feeling was excruciating. That was why they chose me first.

That moment is now my memory. The next thing I remember is that feeling when the doctor said I was on the verge of tears. There was so much going on in my head. It was so much going on in the family, my friends, the community, even the television's cameras. A whole whole lot was happening, and I could now do nothing. Without the physical pain that I felt in the past, I could not even remember how I felt in the present.

The last couple of weeks have been really hard for me. I have moved on with my life and have been hard at work that I am putting my life away for next. I have had lots of opportunities to raise my daughters and other children, but I am still not where I want to be. My husband told me for the first time about his feelings of abandonment, and I realized how much he wanted a baby. I have had my own health issues, my own pain, and my own struggles with depression and suicidal thoughts. I have a lot of things going on right
