The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In 1842, after the death of Charles I, the Crown of Kings building was destroyed. The tower-building lobby and its interior were rebuilt at a cost of $400,000.

The construction of the Empire State Building was a long-held plan for New York City and the Brooklyn waterfront.

For 1802 to 1909, after a two-year contract, the state was able to construct one. Four buildings, one-bedroom, one-bathroom condominiums and six-foot-high concrete decks served the state.

As well as the Empire State Building and the Empire State Building Association, New York city also developed other construction facilities, with the State Building Association being one of them.
