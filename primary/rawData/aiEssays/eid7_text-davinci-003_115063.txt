I remember a few years ago, I was on vacation by myself to this small town in the middle of the mountains. It was the most peaceful place I had ever been. It was really remote and there weren't any big stores or restaurants anywhere. But I was really enjoying the peace and quiet.

One evening, the power went out in the cabin I was staying at and I had no way of getting in touch with anyone or getting the electricity back on. I knew that this was going to be a problem, especially since it was getting darker and colder. 

At first I was very anxious and panicking. But after a while, I started to relax and understood that there was nothing I could do in that moment. I meditated and sat by the fire for warmth and simply accepted the situation as out of my control. 

Eventually, the power came back on and I was so relieved. I was able to get back to my routine and the calming calmness stayed with me from that moment on. It was a great reminder to stay patient, no matter the situation.
