I remember the moment when I was able to share a true moment of laughter with my love. 

It all began with a silly joke. I had suggested that we both wear matching bow ties to an upcoming event. They crashed to the floor and he burst out laughing. I had thought it was a pretty good suggestion too, but when he told me I should wear it alongside a purple tutu I couldn't help but join in on his laughter.

The next day, after the event had finished, we went for a walk along the beach. As I talked, he would sprinkle in some of his own weird thoughts, and soon enough I found myself doubled over with laughter at how he could take the craziest of situations and make them amusing.

It was this connection we had, this ability to laugh at anything that slowly began to bind us together in our relationships. We joked and mocked, we laughed and cried â€“ everything was shared and no joke was off-limits. We'd tease each other, crack each other up, and I'd know there was something special between us without either of us ever needing to say a word.

We're now married and we still share those same moments of laughter together. That simple joke was the start of something special and our relationship as we know it probably wouldn't exist without that first laugh.
