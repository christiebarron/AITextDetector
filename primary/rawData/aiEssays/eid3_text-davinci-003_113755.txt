In "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski, the cyclist is significantly affected by the features of his setting. The cyclist is in a ruggedly mountainous terrain, navigating narrow and dangerous paths littered with tree branches, roots, rocks, and muddy patches. This topography makes the ride arduous and dangerous as the cyclist has to frequently swerve and adjust speed, making it even more exhausting than a normal bike ride. 

The cyclist is also navigating through dense forest cover, where he canâ€™t see far ahead, which adds to the danger and uncertainty of the journey. He must be constantly aware of his surroundings, including the landscapes, sounds, vegetation, shadows, and wildlife, making it difficult to relax and enjoy the ride. This leaves the cyclist feeling fatigued and emotionally drained. 

The cyclist's situation becomes more challenging and increasingly risky as darkness quickly descends and strong winds start to sweep through the rugged terrain, making it even more difficult to navigate the off-road routes. The dark and the wind are extra obstacles, leaving the cyclist with a feeling of fragmentation, a mild sense of paranoia, and an acknowledgement of how his surroundings have become alien and hostile. 

Overall, the features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski's story have a significant effect on the cyclist. The rugged terrain, dense forest cover, darkness, and strong winds make the cycling experience both challenging and dangerous. The cyclist is left feeling mentally and physically exhausted
