The Empire State Building was an epic achievement when it was built in the early 1930s. While it was mainly designed as a stunning skyscraper that was the tallest building in the world at the time, it also had an ambitious goal of having dirigibles (also known as airships) dock onto its 200 foot mooring mast. However, this plan faced many obstacles that the builders had to overcome to make this goal a reality.

The first challenge in building the Empire State Building’s mooring mast was structural engineering. It had to be incredibly sturdy in order to support thousands of pounds of airship as it backed into the mast. It also had to be tall enough so airships had ample room to maneuver. To make matters more challenging, the structure had to be light enough so airships didn’t have difficulty backing into it, and it had to be able to withstand strong winds. The Empire State Building’s team designed a mooring mast of steel with a triangle base and ballast tanks to hold the weight of the airship and stabilize the mast against strong winds.

The second major obstacle was the issue of air traffic control. The airspace over the Empire State Building would need to be carefully managed to ensure the safety of the airship pilots and the people on the ground. To do this, the team had to get approval from the U.S. government and set up a system of signals to direct airships to
