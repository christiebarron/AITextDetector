The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Many of these were designed to prevent the use of the aircraft, but most were built for use by civilians during wartime. The builders often had to adapt the aircraft's tail flap to avoid it dropping into the ground while performing standard flying exercises. For example, the first time two aerobatics-mounted drones were used during a routine demonstration. This type of setup had been developed by the Navy in the 1940s.[6]

For use both on-board and off-board, aircraft could be strapped to the fuselage to be mounted atop parachutes. Pilots, though, were usually required to manually detach their helmets from the bodies to be mounted without dropping into the ground, since they didn't want any possible injuries or explosions when used on ground. Because most of these aircraft carried little fuel or crew, it became necessary to use two, possibly five-wheeler aerial aircraft capable of carrying more. These machines were generally considered to be safer than the original aircraft, to ensure the safe use of the vehicles.

Aircraft also had special cargo containers aboard to carry equipment. The equipment was usually in an aluminum-plated carrier. When the ships were at sea, they often had large, high-quality cargo bays. All of the vehicles carried an attached crewman with them, who was usually a lieutenant colonel or a sergeant in his rank. The bays were sealed to prevent
