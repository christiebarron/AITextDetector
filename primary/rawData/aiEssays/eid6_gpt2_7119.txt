The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. At first, the Pentagon decided that such containers were safe, but it took another 25 years to come around. The C-17 carried a huge pile of wood for cargo when it made a move to the World Trade Center. As it turned out to be a very large warehouse, the Pentagon was able to open a few containers for dirigibles when the construction of the World Trade Center came to an abrupt end.

The C-17 was no different. Over the next decade, a vast complex that was designed to carry large quantities of dirigibles, such as the Lockheed Martin C-17 Globemaster II, and the McDonnell Douglas F-35 are both being built in the United States. The latest project is called the Stinger. The C-17 has a small crew of four and has more than 300 people on it. A few of those crew members are currently traveling back to Syria in support of the rebels. The next phase of the project is likely to launch sometime in 2006.

But that's a little too soon. The C-17 has been in the works for quite some time, from 2009 to 2012. Some of these work will require the full integration of the laser systems aboard the C-17, as opposed to a separate system of controllers or other equipment that were necessary. But after some time it is now known that the C-17 can handle the heavy
