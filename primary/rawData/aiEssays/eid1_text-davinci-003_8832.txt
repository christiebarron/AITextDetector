I remember the first time I laughed with my partner. We both had been talking for quite some time, and I had been admiring how truly funny he was. After what felt like hours of conversation, it came to a point in which we were both laughing so hard at each other's jokes that tears were streaming down our faces.

That moment connected us in the most genuine way imaginable. After that, it felt like the door had been opened for us to discover how humorous the other truly was. We had so much fun laughing at even the most ridiculous and silly jokes. Our laughter became a source of comfort, connection, and energy between us. It became a way for us to bond and strengthen our relationship. 

Laughter was a huge part of how we kept our relationship alive and thriving, and it is still a cornerstone of our relationship today.
