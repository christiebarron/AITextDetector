The setting of “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski affects the cyclist in a number of ways. The setting establishes a feeling of danger and intensity. Right away, the reader is made aware of the steep, winding mountain road. This steep terrain with numerous curves creates a sense of challenge for the cyclist and demands their full attention and focus.

The setting also provides insight into the cyclist’s physical and mental condition. The cyclist is biking up the mountain, a task that requires tremendous effort and stamina. This physical demand can be interpreted as a metaphor for the emotional challenge the cyclist is facing. The cyclist’s arduous journey to the top of the mountain can be seen as his struggle to reach his goal of being successful.

The gloomy and dismal atmosphere of the mountain makes the cyclist’s journey seem even more difficult and, in a sense, creates a feeling of despair. The blanket of fog that envelops the cyclist symbolizes the uncertainty of the road ahead. This creates a sense of uncertainty and fear, as the cyclist is unsure of what lies in store for him.

Overall, the features of the setting contribute to the feeling of intensity and foreboding. They also help to establish the physical and mental condition of the cyclist, along with creating a sense of uncertainty. The setting of the story helps to convey the intensity of the cyclist’s experience and reveals the kind of challenging journey that lies ahead of him
