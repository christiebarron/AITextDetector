The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' has resulted in his character's life being affected by a serious mental disorder â€“ some of which he had committed a year prior.

The real-life actor suffered from depression in 2002 while filming the first two seasons of the cult hit 'House Of Cards'. It was at this time that writer and performer John Ford went public with his diagnosis of depression. Following the show's cancellation, Ford suffered massive losses following the show's release on May 30; he had been prescribed several meds over the following six months, and his condition only got better and better for the year.

After the filming of season two in 2005, Ford found himself in a real-life slump that has led to chronic issues from drinking, to mental health issues that included paranoia, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia, leading to the actor's retirement in 2012. Ford had suffered a stroke and other serious health issues the previous year.

He has since released a memoir, 'From Home is', which explains his struggles with depression, and he is hopeful that his character will ultimately turn on his psychiatrist in a way that will help him deal with it.
