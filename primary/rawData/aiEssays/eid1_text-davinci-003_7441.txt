The ending phrase of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho serves as an indication that the narrator's journey of overcoming her fear is ongoing. The phrase suggests that in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return, there is a chance that the narrator will have a renewed sense of strength and courage to retake the test that she was afraid to take during the winter. It also means that even when it seems that all hope is lost, the narrator still strives to persevere and grow, taking her destiny into her own hands. The phrase serves as an inspirational reminder that even through the most trying of times, one can have hope that things will get better and that one can still strive towards their goals despite any setbacks.
