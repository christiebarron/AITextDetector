An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a man who was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer. He had a small tumor on his tummy and had a high blood pressure, so was on top of the family. All of a sudden, his whole family was very sad and he went into cardiac arrest.

He was in a vegetative state and was in shock when his lungs got infected and he started coughing and he's now dying. He was in a vegetative state and was having an abortion.

So the government started talking to our relatives and getting them involved. They were able to bring in a specialist to diagnose the cancer and the family of a soldier died, and then I went back to work and my life, which had been a bit of a nightmare, was over.

What we saw in Iraq was when we came home after our deployment to Vietnam, as well - the doctors had made the decision - to go back to Iraq. So when we arrived we found this girl who had never been to Vietnam, and her mother had told us she'd never seen someone die that way. We had seen so many people die without a family member on the other side of the fence.

I think most of us in the family said 'Ah yes, we know what we're doing.' All of a sudden there'd been a massive panic of people just going out there trying to hide us and going about their business and hiding from us.
