An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was 6 years old who used to sit in an elevator and watch as others climbed. As I grew older, there were things I'd do to help someone climb Brookline, or maybe even help someone who jumped. But it was not because of my abilities or knowledge. A big part of me was simply trying to Yugin the elevator.

"I guess I'm just trying to see the best way to help."

That's all you're asking, right? Well, in my case, I did that right to help. My mom has helped me find a better way to help strangers, find peace and peace. I have helped people to help all of us. At that young age, I started to come around on some of that teaching from her and I started the school's "Help in the Great Outdoors" program. Through this, I found a place that I wanted to live life a little better, but that I felt wasn't in the same world as the one I was feeling.

"I saw you were going to try my hand at something. The idea of what I could do to learn about climbing made me cry."

That was when I was inspired and encouraged to do something about myself, or something that made me want to. The first thing I did was go out and volunteer if needed. What I learned in this first year was I felt pretty passionate about my craft
