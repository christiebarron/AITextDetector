Dear Editor,

I am writing in regards to the effects computers have had on people over the past decade. In my opinion, computers have had a positive impact on our lives and have allowed us to achieve things we never thought possible.

First and foremost, computers have made communication between people much easier. The Internet has revolutionized how we communicate. Now, people are able to call, text, email, and video chat with people from all around the world. This has enabled us to build relationships even over long distances.

In addition to communication, computers can be used for entertainment. Computers have allowed people to access audio and video material with ease. Whether it's streaming movies, playing video games, or simply listening to the radio, computers have given us many new outlets for entertainment.

Finally, computers have certainly had a positive impact on our experience with learning. We now live in an age of information, where students can access vast amounts of knowledge in a matter of seconds. Computers are often used in classrooms these days, and it has enabled students to learn quicker and more efficiently than ever before.

In conclusion, I believe that computers have been great additions to our lives, providing us with tools for communication, entertainment, and learning. I hope my opinion has persuaded the readers to recognize the amazing things computers can do for us.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
