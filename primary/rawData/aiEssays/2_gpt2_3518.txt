In a statement released by the National Center for Education Statistics' website, Professor Tohoku University President Kitaro Yamazaki explained the University's proposal as an "absolute necessity of education."

He stated that: "Students can and must be taught that no one is responsible for all his or her teaching decisions and that everyone should have a free choice of what to do with their attention."

In light of these factors, the Japanese government has ordered the government to address what is seen as the main causes of the recent controversy surrounding the publication of a New York Times article calling for censorship of public school websites, which has been condemned by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

In a note to students after the Times article was published, one principal of the University commented that the article was "obscene and inflammatory and the school would like to be better informedâ€¦ I don't know how you would respond to something like that."

The school principal also said it would appeal to the government to put the issue directly to the public school system. In his letter, he said that there is currently no "good reason" for the Times article to be taken as seriously by school officials.

The school's letter also listed two other problems. The first is the fact that the Times article was published anonymously, which is common in Japan. The second is that teachers have been "dictatorsially harassing"
