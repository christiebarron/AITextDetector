An example of a time someone in my life was patient was if she saw me or told me she has diabetes, I would not go into the hospital and ask her "did you have diabetes?" She would say no, but if I made the case to her then the doctor would put me on a card that did not allow her to go to the hospital. I thought, how am I going to go? And she was just so adamant that my patient's diagnosis was no different than the one she had when we both went to the hospital, but she took up what I was told was my side of the story. It got so out of hand, my doctors had to find a different way of dealing with every patient, and what was at stake because every time the doctor got so much more information, we were so exhausted. We were making our way to the ER and it just sort of got to the point where we just had to rely on different medicine to go home. So I think that's what I think is, one thing, was to try to figure out how we can avoid these huge things where at long last the doctors and the hospitals are going to be making that judgment on whether we have diabetes or not. And eventually, that was where we came to the point where everyone's doing the same thing and I think it was very easy.

What's something the researchers believe can be done to help?
