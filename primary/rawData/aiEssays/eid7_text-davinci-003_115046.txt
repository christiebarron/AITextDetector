I remember a time some months ago when my friend from college had to unexpectedly stay with me for a few days. As his plans had fallen though, and he hadnâ€™t had time to arrange other accommodation, he asked if he could crash at my place for a while. Although I was a bit surprised at first, I took a deep breath and stayed patient. 

I explained that I was juggling a lot of things in my life at the moment and that it would really help if he could be a considerate house guest by helping out with house chores and keeping noise to a minimum. To my relief, he understood and agreed to my conditions. He was more than considerate, in fact - he cooked meals for us both, helped with the housekeeping and was even willing to lend me money when I needed it.

I feel that I was exceptionally patient throughout this experience. We both handled the problem calmly, without shouting or complaining. Even though it was a challenging situation, I was grateful for his help and support, and in the end we both got through it without any major dramas! Through this experience I learned that patience is a valuable skill in everyday life, and it pays off in the long run.
