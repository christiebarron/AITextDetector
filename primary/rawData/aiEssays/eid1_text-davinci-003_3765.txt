 

Dear Editor, 

It is apparent that in recent years, the presence of computers in our lives has grown exponentially and made a lasting impact with people of all ages. With the number of things that people use computers for, there are both positive and negative effects that have arisen from the use of computers on people today. 

On one hand, computers have enabled individuals to be more productive, creative, and connected to the world outside of their own. For students, computers have allowed them to have quick access to a wealth of information and resources, enabling them to learn quickly and effectively. They allow students to stay in touch with their peers and collaborate on projects with people from all over the world. Technology and computers have also opened new paths of communication between individuals and allow them to access helpful information. 

On the other hand, improper use of computers can also lead to serious negative effects such as cyberbullying, increased sedentary lifestyles, and even internet addiction. Computer addiction can compromise a personâ€™s mental and physical health, and there is no denying that some individuals have become too immersed in the virtual world. 

Therefore, computers should be used responsibly. We should not forget that at the end of the day, the main goal is to remain productive and healthy.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
