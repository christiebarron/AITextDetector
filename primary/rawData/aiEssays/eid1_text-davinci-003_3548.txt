Books, music, movies, and magazines are necessary parts of every library. They offer insight into different ways of life, places, and cultures. However, issues arise when certain materials are deemed too offensive for the library.

The idea of censorship in libraries is controversial, to say the least. While some may argue that anything offensive should be removed from the shelves, I believe that censorship is an unnecessary burden on libraries. Libraries should be held to the same standard as any other establishment - a place where people come to learn, explore, and grow. Censoring certain materials limits the resources that can be provided by a library. When books, music, movies, and magazines are taken off of the shelves, readers are deprived of a valuable source of information. On top of that, the freedom to choose what materials readers want to consume is also taken away. 

Furthermore, censorship in libraries can often be done in a biased manner. Due to certain materials having unacceptable content in the eyes of some, the books are expunged. Unfortunately, thousands of stories remain untold due to this form of censorship. Allowing readers to be their own judge in terms of what is offensive will lead to a broader education and understanding of culture
