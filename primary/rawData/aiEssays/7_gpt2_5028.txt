An example of a time someone in my life was patient was after I met the late, great George Lucas. The late, great guy was a lifelong Star Wars fan with an amazing imagination. He said, "Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope" in the first StarWars episode. And he was thrilled too. And all those years later, George would go on tour, where he was a member of the first Empire Strikeså£° Rebellion, a revolutionary group which was also led by John "Star Wars" Riker. And he gave me that piece of Star Wars. And I remember with great awe what he said.

BADWICK: For my understanding, there was not much in Star Wars that was beyond an art, a science fiction. In the past you've seen the work. They have the same exact themes that you are seeing in The Dothraki Trilogy. It has the same themes because they were in Star Wars that were real. You know, it madness, and it's impossible not to be a Star Wars fan.

BADWICK: Star Wars and my wife are very into sci-fi and fantasy. We were very into Star Wars when I was 20 in 2005. And we still are. It is crazy and exciting and it's always interesting to do it.
