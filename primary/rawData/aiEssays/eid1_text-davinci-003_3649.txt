Dear [Editor],

I am writing to you to share my opinion on the effects that computers have on people. I am sure many readers can attest that computers have revolutionized our lives and have made certain tasks easier and more efficient.

However, I believe that computers have created an increasing dependency on technology. Today, most professional and academic tasks require some form of computer knowledge, leading more people to conduct their work and entertainment exclusively on computers. People often forget how to navigate the physical world and form relationships and instead are constantly staring into a screen. This has caused us to become more isolated and less capable of having meaningful conversations.

I understand that computers can benefit people in terms of convenience and making our lives easier. However, I believe that balance is key. Technology should be used only when necessary and appropriate. Without proper moderation, people risk succumbing to an over-reliance on computers. We must recognize the importance of social communication, diversifying our entertainment and not entrusting too much of our daily routines to computers.

This is why I urge readers to take their time when using technology. Please use it only when it is necessary, not out of habit. When it comes to technology, it is important to ensure we have a healthy, balanced relationship with it.

Sincerely,

[Name]
