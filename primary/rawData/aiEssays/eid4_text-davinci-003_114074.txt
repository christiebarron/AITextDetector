The narrator of the story is a young girl who has recently moved to the United States from Thailand. At the end of the story, she contemplates taking a test that will make it easier for her to learn English. The test is taking place in the winter, which is a difficult time to concentrate on new tasks. The narrator believes that by the time the spring comes around, she will be more prepared to take the test. The hibiscus, which is a symbol of her home country, represents her connection to her heritage and culture in a new and unfamiliar place. By ending with the line about the hibiscus budding, the narrator is connecting her own hope for her future to the distant springtime.
