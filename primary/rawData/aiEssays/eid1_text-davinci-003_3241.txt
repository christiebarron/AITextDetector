Dear Editor,

With the evolution of computer technology, it is undeniable that newer generations are now living in a world of digital dependence. While computers have revolutionized the way we work, learn, connect with others, and go about our lives, it's important to take a step back and analyze the effects these devices have on people.

As technology improves, our social skills seem to suffer. Studies have shown that the use of computer technology can decrease social contact and reduce interpersonal skills, which can lead to feelings of isolation and depression. Furthermore, excessive screen time causes problems with physical and mental health, including eyestrain, headaches, and sleep problems.

However, if used properly, computers can be invaluable tools for teaching, communication, and information gathering. They can also reduce dependence on paper and help us become more organized and effective in our work.

Ultimately, understanding the effects computers can have on our lives is important. Computers can be a great asset to us if used responsibly and in moderation. We should strive to use computers to enhance our lives, not let them take the place of the real-life relationships we need with our friends and family.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
