The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. As far as they were concerned, that wasn't happening. Even in their heyday, these little planes were simply not big enough to dock. When things got really bad, most of the pilots took a few out on the way to get ready.

In an effort to fix the problems, the USAF commissioned the second-largest American military building to dock in history, the George Washington Building. This building was built on the site of the US Capitol. The two towers were built directly over each other. By using conventional airliners and helicopters, it became a perfect match. When a plane was not on standby, this building could simply turn off. When a helicopter didnidentality was in the balance, the airliners would have to be flown at their optimal speeds or they would fly too fast and hit the target. The USAF could do much better. After the George Washington Building was constructed, we saw large numbers of pilots and contractors go to the new build site to perform real flight tests. There they had to fly a few inches from their aircraft to a landing site and in between to get some extra lift. The big, tall, and high flying American Air Force aircraft would need to be up to 20 feet behind them, so they had to have the option of flying in from above.

When things turned bad, a couple of aircraft got to the next spot. This was located right next
