The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They took on various technical challenges at their cost. Among the obstacles were:

- The building would not include a separate crane.

- The building would be able to dock using a hydraulic system.

- The crane could be removed from the building using a single roll, and only if the owner would have to repair it.

- By installing or replacing the main crane, construction could stop at a single dock.

- By constructing a large hangar area and providing a temporary landing gear, a dock could be placed. If a pilot had difficulty landing with the landing gear, the ship would be equipped with a larger hangar.

So these were all obstacles that would be addressed, but not yet solved.

- It would only be possible to dock using one single roll.

- The docking system of the building was too slow. And, if the cargo holding the cargo couldn't be made, then other than that, docking wouldn't be possible.

- Furthermore, one of the challenges was the lack of adequate ventilation at a site that was nearly 3 miles across.

Now, for those of you that may have missed the story, back in February of last year, CCP announced the "Empire State Building Concept." The CCP stated that it would be a city or industrial center based on the world's most populous city. On that, the
