The task of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was one of the most ambitious construction projects of the 20th century. Despite its success and influence on the future of aerial transport, this undertaking was fraught with obstacles for the builders. From the difficult weather conditions the dirigibles had to endure while docking to the unique building structure designed specifically for the purpose, a great deal of ingenuity and craftsmanship went into making the Empire State Building a landable destination.

One of the biggest challenges to allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building centered around the weather conditions in the New York City area. The winds around the skyscraper were often strong and unpredictable, presenting a hazard to even the most experienced pilots. In order to safely land the dirigibles, the team needed to figure out a way to anchor them to the building. This was accomplished by building a huge mooring mast at the top of the building, which was also equipped with a giant searchlight for pilots to use as a beacon in darkness or foggy conditions.

The mooring mast was also equipped with a pair of cables connected to the ground below, containing a fast-acting electrical circuit designed to sound an alarm and shut off the power below if any dirigible attempted to land outside of the designated area. In addition, the mooring mast had a system of pulleys and brakes that could be used to slow the dirigibleâ€™s descent and prevent it
