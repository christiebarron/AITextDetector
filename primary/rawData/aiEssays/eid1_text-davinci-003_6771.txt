Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. While it is true that computers have become an integral part of our lives, I believe that their effects should not be taken lightly.

On one hand, computers have brought about a number of benefits: they have facilitated communication, making connecting with people from virtually anywhere in the world quick and easy. They have also made access to information more immediate and comprehensive than ever before.

On the other hand, however, the current level of reliance on computers - and the Internet, in particular - can be counterproductive. As people become increasingly dependent on computers and technology, they become less productive as well as less skilled in other areas, such as interpersonal communication. Use of technology can also lead to privacy issues, such as identity theft and cyberbullying, as well as isolation from the outside world.

Thus, I believe that the use of computers - and the Internet, in particular - should be limited and monitored in order to ensure that people are able to maintain healthy relationships and interaction. Each person should limit the amount of time spent on computers and be aware of the danger of spending too much time hooked online.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
