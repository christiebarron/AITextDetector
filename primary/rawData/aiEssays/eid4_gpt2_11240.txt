The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because of one crucial point that had been ignored in the initial article. In the beginning of the story, the princess is attacked by the beast before it reaches her. But when the two beasts confront the princess, it is after the princess reaches the middle of her step and is killed by one of the creatures, the fairy and her father. At the beginning, the prince and princess are both wounded before the death of the creature. Because of this, one of the dragons, the one who was able to control the creature and kill them, turns on the fairy and the fairy turns on the fairy. The first person that dies is another person that was hurt badly in the death of one of the beasts.

In the following chapters, the prince and princess have to choose who is hurt and who is not. The prince decides that by choosing the "daring god", he will save everyone. He is afraid that what matters more will be that the dragon doesn't die and the princess has to choose his fate. But he refuses that, because he doesn't want the princess to die like the other monsters. Instead, he chooses to put the beast to rest and stop that monster.
