In response to the rise of airships, the builders of the Empire State Building committed to installing a “mooring mast” at the top of the building, designed to facilitate the safe docking of airships in midtown Manhattan. Decades before the building’s completion, engineers had to face a considerable number of obstacles in order to achieve their lofty goal.

The primary challenge in constructing the mooring mast was the sheer height at which the builders had to work. As the building was designed to be one of the tallest structures in the world, not only did the mast have to be just as tall, but the installation of it had to be completed from such a vast height with limited resources. The mast presented the construction workers and engineers with further struggles as it had to be able to withstand the strict winds that would come at the top of the building. 

According to Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s “The Mooring Mast,” the “mooring circle” at the top of the Empire State Building was to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building and supply passengers with an impressive view of the city. But construction workers, engineers, and designers faced further issues. Building, inspecting, and maintaining the mooring mast required access to the roof. As “the mast was designed to stand high above the surrounding city,” the only means of accessing it were by
