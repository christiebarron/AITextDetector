The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it doesn't let the writing know where the line starts because there is no line to tell. I think there was much in the world of the story about my father and how one has to keep your feet from the ground at times, and let that line be, one is not going to walk the land without doing something dangerous for your family.

So, while I enjoyed the book and it told me I knew I could get my voice, I had an issue with some things I saw on TV and that might be related to how I did the book. I think in the book there's a certain place between a book about being a grown up and a book about someone who was raised by parents.

So I also thought it was kind of unfair that there's a part about the book about something someone needs to do to achieve a certain level of success. That part is there but it's not there for a simple audience audience where something goes wrong. I'm not saying that you don't get to make the mistakes. It's important to make them and take responsibility and be the person that takes responsibility.

So that's one of my personal preferences of where I am getting and when I'm getting it and being a big part of what I am. So I think if the book told me I needed more advice than what I got, I would have the book written differently to me but it would have been interesting
