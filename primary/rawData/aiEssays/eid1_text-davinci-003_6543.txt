Dear Editor,

As everyone is aware, the use of computers has been on the rise in recent years, with all age groups and demographics being significantly impacted. Some people believe that computers are overall beneficial, while others argue the opposite. As someone who has studied the effects of computers, I am firmly in the camp that claims computers are ultimately negative.

The core issue is the fact that computers are taking us away from the real world and the people in it. Many people are now working remotely, shopping online, and communicating via email and texting. This has had a deep impact on the human experience, with social isolation is becoming more common as people turn away from face-to face communication. Furthermore, research has shown that the amount of time people spend looking at screens is resulting in dissatisfaction and mental health issues, such as depression.

In addition, there are growing concerns related to unethical and illegal activities, such as cyber-crimes that are enabled by computers, as well as dangerous viruses that can devastate computer systems. Furthermore, computer use is affecting peopleâ€™s productivity, as workers lose track of time and are not devoting enough attention to their tasks.

I am confident that my views are shared by many people, and my goal is to encourage them to reconsider the effects that computers are having on our lives. We must consider how computers are negatively impacting our social life, mental health, security, and productivity, and make the necessary changes to protect
