An example of a time someone in my life was patient was an older acquaintance of mine, who was living in Connecticut. His wife was from a certain college town named Middletown, and for most of her life she lived in an apartment that owned some 60 apartments. She lived with her two cats, an older one, and her own two dogs, and lived with her husband in the apartment. The cats and dogs shared a yard and kept little yard litter while she slept. It was a good day in the middle of the night, and she woke up one morning and went out there one or two times a day. All day, she would take the dogs a step or two, the older one going up stairs to see if he was getting up.
