The task of constructing the Empire State Building to accommodate dirigibles was a daunting one. Even in its early stages, it was clear that significant challenges would need to be overcome for the plan to be successful. In “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the various obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in order to allow dirigibles to dock are detailed.

The most notable obstacle to the plan was the positioning. In particular, placing the mast atop the Empire State Building proved to be problematic because the structure was not designed to support the extra weight that a mooring mast would bring. Subsequent to this complication, the builders had to address a variety of engineering concerns, such as setting the proper tension on the cables that attach the mast to the building, as well as figuring out how to attach the mast to the building itself. 

Another issue was the lack of on-site resources. The mast was too large to be lifted by crane and had to be assembled in sections as it was placed atop the building. This meant that the builders had to find a way to transfer the sections up the building’s heights, as well as devise a method for joining them together while balancing the collection of mast in the air. This was a rather complex process that caused delays for the project. 

To further complicate matters, the builders also had to attend to the safety of the public. Because the
