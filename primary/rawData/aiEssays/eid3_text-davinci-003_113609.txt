The setting of the short story "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski greatly affects the cyclist in many ways. The setting is summertime in Southern Colorado, where the roads are unpaved and rocky. As a cyclist, the cyclist is experiencing the roughest terrain that they could possibly encounter.

The hot summer temperatures make it more difficult to cycle through the rough terrain as the heat can cause physical discomfort and fatigue.

This puts an additional strain on the cyclist as they have to adjust quickly to the terrain, which is often unfamiliar or dangerous. The cyclist must also take care to avoid obstacles or dangerous elements such as cacti or rattlesnakes that can make the journey even more difficult.

Overall, the features of the setting in â€œRough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski present a challenging and difficult surface for the cyclist. The cyclist must be prepared to face the unexpected as well as the physical toll that a rough terrain can take on the body.
