Censorship in libraries is a controversial issue that continues to spark debates between those who support censorship and those who oppose it. While library censorship exerts control over what library patrons can access, it also threatens free speech and the freedom of information. 

Censorship in libraries takes the form of book-banning, which is the removal of materials deemed offensive or potentially influential in some way. Book-banning is not only dangerous to our culture, it’s ineffective in producing meaningful change. When items like books, music, movies, and magazines are removed from library shelves, doesn’t it come at the cost of potentially enriching experiences? Or thought-provoking dialogue? 

We can’t deny the fact that books, music, movies, and magazines deemed offensive may have a negative influence on some library patrons. However, censorship suppresses meaningful conversations and restricts readers’ access to resources that could help educate them about issues they may not even be aware of. 

Furthermore, censorship denies people the opportunity to form their own opinions and make their own decisions about what they find offensive or acceptable. Allowing library patrons to have the freedom to make their own decisions over what books, music, movies and magazines they want to access promotes critical thinking and encourages active participation in their own learning. 

Opponents of censorship will argue that books contain ideas which are just as capable of offending readers as any other form of expression.
