Dear [Editor],

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. I believe that computers can be a valuable tool for facilitating work, communication, and entertainment, but that there are still many drawbacks that should not be overlooked.

In the modern world, computers are very convenient for accomplishing tasks quickly, but they can also lead to an over-dependence on technology. People can find themselves losing sight of the value of activities that involve physical labor and creativity, such as gardening and painting, or of finding joy in spending hours talking or playing games with family and friends. Computers can be seen as a potential hazard to real-world relationships with their distraction and misinformation.

Moreover, too much screen time can be detrimental to our mental and physical health with its disrupting of natural circadian rhythms. Staring at a screen for too long can lead to vision problems, headaches, and back pain. It also can lead to sleep deprivation, and indirectly, to decreased concentration and cognitive skills.

For these reasons, I believe that computers, while often very useful, should not be overused and should not replace physical and social activities. We should strive to use computers judiciously and take regular breaks for our mental and physical health.

Thank you for considering my thoughts. I hope that readers of your newspaper will consider why computers are both useful and detrimental in their lives and how best to balance the two.

Sincerely,
