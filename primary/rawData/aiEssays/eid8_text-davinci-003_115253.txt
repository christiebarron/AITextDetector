I couldn't help but chuckle as I exited the restaurant. It had been a fun evening with a few old friends, exchanging stories of our old days and catching up on our lives. As I said my goodbyes, one of my buddies thought he'd make a joke about the increasing "grayness" he observed in my hair since last we'd met.

I burst out laughing. It was so silly and unexpected, yet strangely fitting. We all knew I was getting older, so why not joke about it? It was a fun way to wrap up the night.

The laughter was infectious, and soon we were all laughing harder than we had all night. We knew that this moment of laughter was going to be what we would remember most about our evening. Even as I dashed off after our goodbyes, I could still hear the others snickering in the parking lot. 

Laughter is special, I reflected as I drove home. And it can bring so many people closer together, even if just for a few moments. It's funny how something so simple can bring so much joy.
