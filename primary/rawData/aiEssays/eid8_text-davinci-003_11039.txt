I was at my friend’s house when I decided to tell a silly joke I heard at school. I had been giggling about it all day and couldn't wait to share. After I told the joke, all of us burst into laughter that went on for what felt like forever. It was one of those infectious laughs that just kept going until someone had to finally give in and take a breath.

My friend’s face lit up with such joy and she started laughing even harder. I could tell that she really appreciated the moment and it was such a powerful experience for both of us. Before I knew it, tears were streaming down our faces because we were laughing so hard.

I felt like all the stress and worries of our week just melted away. The feeling of laughter radiating through my body was like a wave of energy that made me feel so alive. It felt great to just let go and be in the moment.

Laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people. In that moment, the bond between my friend and I was cemented through the power of laughter.
