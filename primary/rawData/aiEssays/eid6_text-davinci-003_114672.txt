The Empire State Building was a remarkable engineering feat of its day, with builders going to great lengths to create a modern metropolis that could adequately accommodate the latest transport technologies. One of the most unique aspects of the project was the plan to construct a tower capable of accommodating the docking of dirigibles. While ambitious, the idea of a tower high enough and sturdy enough to allow the dirigibles of the day to dock posed a great number of engineering and practical obstacles.

The first problem engineers faced was the sheer size and strength of the required materials. Dirigibles were much less maneuverable and required more stable towers for mooring. This meant the tower designers needed to ensure the Empire State Building was strong enough to withstand the jerking and tugging of a dirigible docking and departing. Regular mooring towers weren’t built to bear up to this weight, so the Empire State Building would have to be made with reinforced steel and extra strong foundations.

The Empire State Building was also a landmark construction, and the engineers needed to make sure the mooring tower met the aesthetic goals of the project. This created a further challenge, as the presence of the mast and docking area, such as reinforced steel bands to help steady the dirigible’s cable, would interfere with the iconic skyline of the building. To combat this, designers opted for an eye-catching design for the mast that didn’t take away from the beauty of the building
