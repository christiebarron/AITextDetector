The ending of the poem serves as a metaphor for perseverance and hope, suggesting that the speaker will be able to overcome the test the second time around. The imagery of the hibiscus coming back to life with the melting snow and the return of the geese emphasizes the idea of rising up after a difficult time. The speaker is equating the return of the hibiscus to his own resilience and the idea that he can push through the challenge and have a successful outcome.
