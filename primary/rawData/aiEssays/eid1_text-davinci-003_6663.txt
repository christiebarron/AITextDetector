To the Editor of the Local Newspaper:

As technology advancements continue to grow exponentially with each passing year, it is clear to see the immense effect computers have had on our society. We are living in an age where virtually the entire world is connected, and where computer processes dominate the ways in which society functions.

The ease of access that computers allow enable people to engage in new ways of problem solving and collaboration which would have not been possible only a few decades ago. Computers also enable us to store data more efficiently and make use of powerful algorithms which increase the speed with which processes can be completed. Additionally, computers provide us with an almost infinite wealth of information which can be used for leisure or research.

Computers allow us to stay connected with people from all over the world, at any time of day. The connections established via the internet are incredibly powerful and can help to broaden our world view and expose us to new ideas and cultures.

It is clear to see that computers have had a positive influence on society. The increase in the availability of resources, increased productivity, and improved communication are all direct results of computer advancements. Although there may be some tradeoffs to the domination of computers, the implications have been overwhelmingly positive.

Sincerely,
