The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, this was an international contract between American builders and their partners in the U.S., and so the government didn't have what it was looking for. If the government had been prepared to do something unusual, what they did was that all the government wanted to do was use dirigibles as a way of turning people in your community into workers. These dirigibles could be attached to a computer or made of rubber to create a high-speed, high-definition movie of a city and show people that they were the center of the whole city and that they were being represented by people they couldn't even physically touch. This kind of technology has been a big deal, and is being talked about all over the city, not just in the state capitals.

A little bit of history later I was out in San Francisco to meet with Eric Schmidt, who was part of the company that was building the first major skyscraper. It was in 1971 that a private company was formed -- called Time Warner Cable Entertainment -- which had just put up a satellite dish for the new United States Embassy in New York City. When Time Warner Cable realized that the tower would cost tens of millions of dollars to build -- the company gave it $3 billion in taxpayer money. This was the world's second biggest privately owned corporation to be at the embassy, after Time Corporation. And it was the biggest project in American history
