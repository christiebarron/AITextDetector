I remember the first time I met my best friend. I was 10 years old, walking my bicycle around a local park when I spotted a group of boys playing basketball. I stopped for a moment, watching them play and feeling a bit intimidated.

That all changed when they called out to me to join them. I nervously walked over, not sure of what to expect. But when I approached the court, the boys burst out laughing. At first I was confused, but then I saw that they were laughing because my shoelace had come undone and was now trailing from my shoe.

I had never felt so embarrassed, but then I started laughing too. This only made the boys laugh more, and soon we were all laughing and trading jokes. That laugh marked the start of what would become a long and cherished friendship.

Laughter has been one of the most important parts of our relationship ever since. We always crack each other up, and it's one of the best feelings in the world to be able to laugh so deeply with someone who's been in your life for so long. 

Laughter has truly been a source of connection and joy between us, and I'm so glad I walked up to that court all those years ago.
