Dear Editor,

I am writing to state my opinion on the effects computers have on people. I believe computer technology has the power to positively or negatively affect individuals, depending on how it is used.

One of the most positive effects of computers is that they allow us to communicate with people from all over the world. In addition, they permit us to be more productive and efficient in completing tasks faster than ever before. Computers also provide access to vast amounts of information that could help increase knowledge of various topics. In short, properly used computers can provide an abundance of benefits.

On the other hand, some may argue that computers have a negative effect on society. The most prominent point of concern is that people are spending too much time in front of a computer for recreational activities. This large amount of computer usage has been linked to a decrease in physical activity and a lack of exercise, thus leading to health problems. In addition, it is said that people are becoming addicted to computer games and other online activities, resulting in a disconnection from reality.

Despite the potential risks, I believe that overall, the use of computers can be beneficial. It is up to users to realize the potential harms of using computers and
