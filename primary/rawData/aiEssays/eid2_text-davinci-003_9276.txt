Censorship in libraries is becoming an increasingly controversial issue. On one hand, some patrons believe that librarians have an obligation to protect citizens from potentially offensive materials. On the other, others believe that libraries should remain havens of free thought where citizens can access a range of materials, regardless of their content or message. To address this debate, it is important to examine both sides of the argument and explore the implications of either viewpoint. 

Proponents of censorship in libraries argue that materials which are deemed offensive should not be available to patrons. Any materials that encourage immoral behavior or contain invalid points of view should be removed from the shelves. This would help to ensure that only reputable sources of information are available at the library. Additionally, it could play a role in protecting the wellbeing and safety of patrons, especially young children, who might inadvertently access materials that could be dangerous. 

However, opponents of censorship in libraries consider that it restricts the freedom of citizens to access a variety of materials. When certain materials are removed from the shelves, patrons can no longer make informed judgments about the accuracy or suitability of information they encounter. Additionally, if materials are censored from a library, they become inaccessible to patrons who might have a valid reason to use them. Censorship is also often seen as a form of repression, whereby those in power can censor materials they deem politically dangerous.

Ultimately, there is a deep divide between those who endorse and those who oppose censorship in libraries
