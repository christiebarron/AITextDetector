In Joe Kurmaskiâ€™s "Rough Road Ahead," the setting of a rugged mountain pathway greatly impacts the experience of the cyclist. The setting creates a physical environment of steep cliffs, stretches of uneven terrain, and narrow paths that are both dangerous and exhausting. As the cyclist navigates the course, he is forced to confront these hazardous conditions, which makes him physically uncomfortable and anxious. 

The mountain's terrain forces the cyclist to use his skillset and knowledge of the mountain to guide him down the steep pathways. He must rely on his strength and technical ability to pick the best route and manage his speed. The cyclist is also presented with small obstacles such as rocks and thick vegetation, and must use his balance and agility to maneuver around them.

The environs also serves as a psychological test for the cyclist. During the descent, the cyclist is forced to confront fear and doubt as he's faced with difficult terrain, extreme heights, and the potential of a fall. His pace is limited by the terrain, creating periods of intense physical effort interspaced with the need to take breaks to catch his breath. The extreme nature of the course and the struggle to advance present a mental challenge that he must overcome in order to reach the finish line. 

In "Rough Road Ahead," the rugged mountain pathway challenges the cyclist both physically and psychologically. The steep terrain and its accompanying obstacles require the cyclist to use his skills and knowledge to successfully navigate the course
