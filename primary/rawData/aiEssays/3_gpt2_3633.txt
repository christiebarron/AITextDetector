Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. First of all, it affects how far to go you are going before braking and then when. There is an assumption that when you brake too far and the bike stops for a corner (or you feel the air hitting you), the cyclist would take a step forward – not just make a right turn towards you, but the edge of the road away. This, of course, is the goal of 'Rough Road Ahead' – you don't need too much effort on your part to make a right turn on a straight line (you can be very close). And although the average cyclist would probably start out with a right turn, there are only three or four cyclists who run into this problem every single time you enter the 'Rough Road Ahead' setting, and if every cyclist runs on the same line as you, then you're going to fall behind.

If you hit your brakes too far, and you feel another right turn (or the air around you starts to hit your brakes), the cyclist will fall into a'slow and sudden turn' from you: as your speed drops to about 0.1mph, or your speed reaches about 60mph (a few seconds after you hit the'slow and sudden' level, it's going to be quite hard to hit the braking threshold), the road will slow down. You'll hit the 'quick switch' to a'slow and sudden'
