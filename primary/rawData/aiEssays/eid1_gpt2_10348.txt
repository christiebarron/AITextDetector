Computers have many effects on people. One way people are able to take over is to have their computers run through their own training, learning, development, and testing cycles, as well as taking on more and more specialized tasks.

That's an ideal way to look at this: Every major organization has a set number of workers responsible for testing its code. It goes without saying that the organization is best prepared to take on the challenges of its workforce at a time when the workforce is expanding.

But if this scenario came true for the U.S., how could that organization help in addressing these challenges? That's where we started. In 2007, we launched a dedicated Task Force on Artificial Intelligence (AI) called The Artificial Intelligence Project (ASI). One of the goals of this project was to bring together all the intelligence researchers and technologists whose research had been focused on solving human-based problems at large.

The purpose of our ASI was to bridge the gap between work and tech from all different fields. The goal is to improve the human-directed learning of machines ensemble and to also ensure that the overall computer system designs are suited for general tasks such as making good decisions, running applications, programming, and so on.

The ASI's goal was to combine these ideas into a broad framework for what people can do when they are in high-value jobs.

So how did
