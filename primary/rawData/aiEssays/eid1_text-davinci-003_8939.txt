Dear Editor,

In today's society, computers are ubiquitous; they are used for everything from work to entertainment. As a result, they have had a tremendous impact on our lives. In my opinion, computers have had both positive and negative effects on people.

On the one hand, the use of computers has created new opportunities for people, especially for those living in rural areas. It has made it possible for people to stay connected globally, giving them access to valuable information that may have been otherwise difficult to obtain. Computers have also made our lives easier, as they enable us to access and share data quickly and efficiently.

On the other hand, computers can have a detrimental effect. They can lead to increased feelings of isolation and loneliness, as people are increasingly spending time interacting with computers rather than people. In addition, computers can be used for malicious activities, such as the distribution of viruses and malware.

In conclusion, I believe that computers have both positive and negative effects on people, and we should strive to ensure that the positives outweigh the negatives. I urge your readers to take steps to ensure that the potential benefits of computers are fully realized, while controlling the potential for misuse.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
