The setting of Joe Kurmaski’s ‘Rough Road Ahead’ provides a distinct atmosphere that shapes the cyclist’s experience and directly impacts their choices. The story takes place on a clear winter night after a long day of snow, leaving the weather and terrain unpredictable and dangerous. The cold air and snowdrifts limit visibility, intensifying the sense of danger and insecurity. It’s hard to judge the depth of the snow and the road conditions, creating a sense of anxiety and anticipation about the hazardous journey that lies ahead.

The rural landscape is vast and desolate, making the cyclist feel exposed and vulnerable. Coupled with the silence and stillness of the night, the cyclist is confronted with an unsettling sense of being overwhelmed and vulnerable. The lack of any sources of comfort like streetlights or other people make the journey even more challenging.

The setting of ‘Rough Road Ahead’ is also integral to the cyclist’s success, as the cyclist must rely on their wits and determination to find their way. They must make their own decisions and trust in their own capabilities to reach the end of the treacherous road. The untamed and uncharted environment of the setting foreshadow the great trial that lies ahead, while providing the cyclist with a sense of hope that they will find a way to the other side.
