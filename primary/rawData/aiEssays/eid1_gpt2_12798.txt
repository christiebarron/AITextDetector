Computers have many effects on people. Some of which are complex and require an understanding of what computers are about and how they work. Others are simple and are thought out and implemented. But if we just don't understand them, we'll do some very complicated things. We'll use computer science research and computer science language to explain those complex aspects of computer technology. That may be one of my favourite parts of learning computer science.

Do we have to go back and learn anything that we've learned up to now?

If you think you are a very technical person, I really hope you don't worry too much. In the end it will all be the same. You need a sense of wonder and a keen sense of curiosity to understand computers. That, in turn, brings you to the more important point – the fundamental part of computer science – which is the understanding of how computers work.

Computer science is about understanding the basic concepts of what computers are about, how they work and how their applications might be used in a practical way. When you learn computer science you can see exactly what is going on in your field, where you are going to be able to work. Sometimes people do a lot of hard work on computer science. So you will never get so many PhDs and so many PhDs in computer science, but the basic concept of computer science is very well understood.

But is it all about understanding the complex things that computers do?
