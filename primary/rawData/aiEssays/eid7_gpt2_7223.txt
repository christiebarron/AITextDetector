An example of a time someone in my life was patient was his wife.

And he was there, waiting for a call. I think he had to be very patient and understand what happened to a patient that was not just sick but struggling."

Dr Zirked, who did the study for the Medical Research Council, said he thought it was difficult to have healthy conversations about patients' illnesses in terms of understanding and understanding the problems.

"I believe that if patients had the freedom to express their suffering but have the right to ask for help, then we could make an informed decision," he said. "It will take time and effort but we should be willing to allow patients the freedom to express their suffering if they have the chance."

Dr Zirked said the research of the research team involved in the study may not be entirely representative of the population of patients suffering with serious conditions, but is "the type of research which is required for good outcomes".
