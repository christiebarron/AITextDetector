In Joe Kurmaski’s short story, “Rough Road Ahead,” the setting plays an important role in the story. At the opening of the story, the cyclist is presented with an abandoned highway with the bridge out, making the bridge passage impossible. The narrator, the cyclist named Barry, is aware of the possible danger he may face as he continues on his journey. He is described as being aware of the foreboding and uneasy feeling “the deserted highway had given him from the start.”

All of these features of the setting contribute heavily to the tension that builds throughout the story and that courses through Barry’s body as he rides. For instance, the abandoned highway reminds Barry of a graveyard, creepy and abandoned. This foreboding atmosphere makes Barry anxious, and his anticipation of danger becomes even more intense. The reader is given descriptions of the curvature of the road and the darkness that surrounds it. These details help to build the suspense even more and put Barry on heightened alert.

The backdrop of the setting also creates the feeling of being watched. It is constantly mentioned that the lack of cars and people gives him a greater sense of being alone and, therefore, increases the feeling of potential danger. Overall, the setting of “Rough Road Ahead” adds a level of suspense and tension that makes the story exciting and gripping and is an integral part of the experience for Barry the cyclist.
