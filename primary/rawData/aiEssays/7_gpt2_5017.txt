An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my friend who gave me a very tough drug because he started taking it to the point where he really had to stop. And we would all be so anxious and hurt that we would not wake up and go to bed. At that time he never saw me on my cell phone and he was just so in love and so excited and really trying to make sense of it all. I was really grateful for all of the positive feedback, that helped me in my development and this is really what he's taught me. He's been the kind of person that my parents know and like for as long as I could remember, my mother would be in my prayers, and she would ask me to come out and make some music for him. After so long I've accepted he's a great person and I think the last thing I want him to do is have to get divorced or have a daughter or have to start a business and leave me. I don't think he can. He really has taught me a great deal.

So if you're so lucky to have someone around who's doing this and helping you, do follow my instructions to get the drugs and things are going great. We'll see you in the hospital but hope you've got a very hard day.
