The Empire State Building is an iconic structure in the New York City skyline, one that has served as a backdrop in numerous films and other popular culture. But the building was not always so iconic, as many unique obstacles needed to be overcome to allow for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building’s mooring mast. This essay will outline the difficulties engineers had to face in order to make that dream a reality.

The first and perhaps most significant obstacle was the underlying engineering challenges of designing a structure sturdy enough to take the weight and wind stress of a docked hydrogastic airship — as the dirigibles of the time were known to be. The engineers of the Empire State Building team needed to think outside the box, as traditional buildings and towers could not withstand the strain of a dirigible. They eventually designed an A-shaped structure with a counterweight that could support the great ships. Another major engineering challenge was the problem of creating a strong enough rail system within the mooring mast that could constantly keep the ship in place. The final design would feature two 1,500 foot steel tracks with powerful electric motors that would lock the ship in place.

The second obstacle in enabling dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was the surrounding environment of downtown New York City. Many were concerned that the powerful winds and turbulence of the cityscape could create a dangerous situation for the airships, which could lead to disastrous results. To solve
