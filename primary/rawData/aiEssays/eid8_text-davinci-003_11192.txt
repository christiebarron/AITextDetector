I was out on a first date with this guy from my school, and we were walking near the lake. Although we hadn’t known each other long, there was definitely a connection and the conversation was going well. All of a sudden, a goose flew right by us, making us both jump. We laughed so hard that we had to sit down right on the street. It was such a silly moment, and I loved that we were instantly comfortable enough to laugh together. After that, it felt like the barriers between us had been broken and we talked for hours about our lives and interests. We started dating shortly after, and for the next few months, laughter was a constant in our relationship. I’d never felt so connected with someone before, and I’m thankful that the silly moment with the goose helped bring us together.
