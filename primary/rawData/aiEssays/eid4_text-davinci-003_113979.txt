The ending of Winter Hibiscus provides a literal and figurative representation of hope and perseverance in the face of adversity. The narrator, by expressing their hope for the future in terms of the hibiscus blooming in the spring, is showing that, if they keep trying, they will eventually be successful. This serves as a metaphor for never giving up in spite of disappointment: if the narrator can pass the test after multiple tries, so can the reader. The hope for the future—expressed in the geese returning and the snows melting—motivates the narrator to keep going and provides a reminder that difficult times can eventually lead to happy ones.
