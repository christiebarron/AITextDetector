The building of the Empire State Building marked a major moment in history as it ushered in a new era of skyscrapers. However, from the very beginning, the architects of the Empire State Building wanted the pinnacle of the building to be the docking of dirigibles. The idea of utilizing the rooftop to allow passenger-laden dirigibles to moor was attractive to the architects, but it was not without its obstacles.

In order to understand the obstacles faced by the architects, one must first understand the context and design of the building. When the Empire State Building was constructed, the tallest building in the world was the nearby Chrysler Building, which had a mooring mast that allowed dirigibles to dock. The architects of the Empire State Building wanted to exceed the Chrysler Building by allowing dirigibles to dock on the top of the building, instead of just the mooring mast. This idea sent the architects on a quest to engineer a solution to the tricky engineering problem of how to allow dirigibles to land safely on a rooftop.

The first obstacle the architects faced was the wind conditions at the site. Dirigibles were massive and slow-moving, so they needed a steady flow of wind in order to steer. The wind near the Empire State Building's site was always tricky and unpredictable, making it hard to plan for a reliable docking procedure.

The second obstacle was designing a mooring mast that could not only withstand the wind but also
