One of the greatest engineering achievements of the early twentieth century is the Empire State Building in New York City. Completed in 1931, the building stood 102 stories tall and served both commercial and residential tenants. In the same year, the first successful dirigible, or airship, was introduced to the public. As remarkable as the building was, there remained the challenge of allowing dirigibles to moor on the building.

The most obvious obstacle for a dirigible to dock in the Empire State Building was the height. At 1,250 feet, the Empire State Building towers over other skyscrapers and the airships of the era had difficulty navigating at such altitudes. Additionally, there was the danger of the airship being damaged when coming into contact with the building. Many dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen, and even a small spark could cause serious destruction. It was clear a better docking system needed to be in place in order to ensure the safety of the airship and the building.

In order to tackle this issue, a special mast was constructed for the Empire State Building. This mast, known as the "mooring mast," was a solid steel structure, fifty-five feet tall, designed to accommodate an airship. This mast could also extend to double its size and had a “spread quadrant” at the top, which consisted of metal bars. These metal bars greatly reduced the impact of the airship and created a
