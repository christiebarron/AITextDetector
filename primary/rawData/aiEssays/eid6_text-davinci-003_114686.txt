The construction of the Empire State Building presented an incredible challenge to the builders, which was allowing dirigibles to dock safely at the building. This goal was made more difficult due to the technological limitations of the time, money constraints of the project, and the dangers of mooring aircraft safely. 

The main technological limitation of the time was the lack of material suitable to build a proper mooring mast. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building would need to be incredibly tall to allow dirigibles to dock properly and even then, it would need to be built in a way that guaranteed safety for the aircraft and its passengers. In response to this, the architects and engineers considered several types of materials, from steel cables to steel beams, but nothing was satisfactory. To complicate matters, the mooring mast would also need to be flexible enough to cope with any work of air currents or mechanical vibrations from the nearby elevators, without causing harm to the aircraft or passengers. In the end, after much consideration and experimentation, the engineers agreed that the best material to construct the mooring mast was aircraft grade duralumin alloy. 

The money constraints of the project also presented a challenge to the builders. Duralumin alloy was expensive, and the cost of the mast was only a fraction of the total cost of the project. It was also necessary to hire certified air traffic controllers to operate the mast, and they required expensive training and equipment. The
