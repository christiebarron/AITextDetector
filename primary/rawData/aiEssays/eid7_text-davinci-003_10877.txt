I'll never forget the time I was standing in line at the grocery store and it seemed like everyone in front of me was taking an eternity to pay for their items. My hands were full of groceries and I was trying to juggle it all, and I was getting tired and cranky.

At first, the thought of leaving the line crossed my mind; however, I didn't want to move my spot since I had already been waiting for a while. Then I thought, I'll just be patient and wait it out.

I kept my cool and decided not to rush anything or anyone. I remained standing on my spot - not saying a word - and focused on calming my breathing in order to remain patient.

As the time slowly ticked away, yet another person stood in line. I kept waiting without saying anything, although it became increasingly unbearable thinking about who would be next.

Finally, I was at the counter and it was my turn. I was so relieved that I managed to stay patient. Even though I had to wait a really long time in line, it made me a much calmer and happier person when it was finally my turn.
