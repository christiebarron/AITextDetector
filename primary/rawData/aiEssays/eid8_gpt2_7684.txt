One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was at a Christmas party and felt like something was wrong with me. Now I am really grateful to all of my friends that shared the same kind of joy. I am thankful to my brothers and sisters too who have all experienced the same feeling. I have been blessed to witness all those moments with my entire life. Thank you for loving everybody and thank you for everything.

So that really means all about being grateful to those who had the great kindness, kindness and trust to share their life with others. We really need to hear from you the same way I have with my friends who have been so kind to each other and to themselves, for instance my friends when I told them there is no more pain so I will be so thankful to them. We can be so thankful for so many people who have been so humble in telling us that they understand and feel that they are in the same situation. And I think that if you look at your life as a set of rules that you follow then you will feel the same way with our life. As we talk to each other we can tell that it will be a great time for us both before and after Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I would hope that you will join me and others everywhere to get out of our little "bins on Christmas tree" but that you too can get out of a little Christmas tree and celebrate with good friends and family even though we are all very different.
