The narrator ends the poem with this line to emphasize the cyclical nature of life and how even through struggles, such as taking a difficult test, their can always be hope for a better outcome in the future. The imagery of the snow melting and geese returning combined with the hibiscus budding is meant to represent the metaphorical rebirth of nature which is paralleled in the narrator's experience as she takes the test again when they return in the spring. The poem implies that through this renewed hope and optimism, she is able to persevere and strive for success.
