The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' has become a bit overreactionary. Here, the characters are often caught up in their own world where everyone is just trying to get a good day's sleep and when your life gets cut off, then you are out of luck.

The movie is, however, not only bleak but also filled with a number of intriguing character developments, from the character David (Sophie Allen) to the movie's characters' relationships.

To my own surprise, what we saw were not only character developments but an interesting world that is both rich in humour and deeply poignant. The writing, the cinematography, the cinematography, the music. It's been interesting to learn if films like this don't really show how much they enjoy to be a part of so many different lives.

This year we got a chance to tour the studios of Daring Dory and talk to director Peter Jackson about filming and the filmmaking process of making The Hobbit.

How long did you get to see the movie?

I first see it on November 8, 2014, when it was just released.

What is your favourite part of filming the book?
