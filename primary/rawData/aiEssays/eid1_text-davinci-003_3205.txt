Dear Editor,

The rapid emergence and development of computer technology has significantly impacted people worldwide. It has revolutionized the way we work, learn, communicate, and entertain ourselves. But there are opinionated debates about whether computers have a positive or negative effect on people.

I believe the system of computers are beneficial to all of us. By utilizing computers, we are able to access essential resources that would otherwise be unavailable to us. For example, new computer technologies allow us to access vast amounts of data from around the world, as well as to purchase goods and services remotely. Consequently, we are able to gain access to information that is not locally available and have access to products we could never have obtained without these technologies.

Moreover, computers have contributed significantly to increasing the speed and accuracy of completing complex tasks. Automation has allowed us more time to focus on creative endeavors, which can significantly boost innovation and productivity.

Finally, computers have improved our ability to communicate with one another. With faster and more secure networks, individuals can quickly communicate with people from different parts of the globe. These technologies are also transforming the way we learn and exchange ideas, thus improving our problem solving and decision making abilities.

In conclusion
