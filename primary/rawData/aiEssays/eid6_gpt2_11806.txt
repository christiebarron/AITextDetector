The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They had to create a way to allow them to make one part of the tower's face so it looked like an upright one.

"We created 'floating' face design to permit an upright face," said Mr. Ebbbins.

But despite its size, the curved faces were costly to build. "We used them to create our own custom pieces, like in the 1930s," he said.

Some of his ideas were for the Empire State Building to come down in the height of the Second World War and for the building to take off at the end of World War Two instead of just above the New York Monument.

Still, Mr. Ebbbins doesn't see the Empire State Building as having to be a bridge in order to get a few billion dollars down the road. "How does it go from that?"

Mr. Ebbbins said he thinks the design would have been much better built.

And he expects the building to still be used for military purposes â€” even for defense.

"I don't see the building being used for a military event," he said, but "if something happens in those areas, we are going to do something about it."
