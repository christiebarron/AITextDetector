I was at the store the other day, waiting in line to purchase my groceries. I had kind of a full basket and had already been waiting in line for a while. The person ahead of me was very elderly, and seemed to be having some difficulty with their payment. I could tell the store worker was getting a bit frustrated, but I stayed patient. I thought to myself that there was no reason to rush the process and be impatient, so I stood there calmly. Eventually the person finished their transaction and thanked me for being so nice and patient. It felt good to extend that courtesy to someone else, and it was a reminder of how important it can be to be patient in times like these.
