The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The need for a separate front curtain prevented workers from standing on their respective sides of the building, which had a high ceiling and low ceiling fan that forced them to crouch.

After five years, the World Trade building, based over a dozen towers spanning the Hudson River, is expected to open in 2019.

New York's World Trade Center could be a "no walk" stop for some workers from the future, says Paul Daley, managing director of the Urban Group Group at L'Oreal & Leuven. Daley and his team have developed plans for the new building, which is slated to open in 2019, for workers in and around the world.


Daley adds "it is important to note that the project is still under construction because there will be no workers on the construction site in New York."


The tallest tower anywhere in the world is now the tallest over the span of a full year. In 2004, construction at this complex finished only about 80 floors, and the World Trade Center took in more than $60 billion in construction costs in construction. Despite these efforts, as construction increased around the world and began moving at a fast pace, world construction costs grew at an rate that is estimated at up to 75 percent
