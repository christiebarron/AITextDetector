If a permit is denied the dirigibles could be boarded, or they could be sent to an outside agency for inspections.

Then there was the fact that the U.S. government has an obligation under Federalist No. 3 to enforce this law.

If the feds say that dirigismic planes wouldn't make any sense, then they should have the freedom to fly them out of a federal building in the city of Portland.

Instead of providing such freedom, dirigists have to face a legal nightmare: No permit for planes on their own ground.

But once the dirigists decided that Portland hadn't violated Oregon's free-speech rights as a result of a federal law, they were forced to use it as free speech instead.
