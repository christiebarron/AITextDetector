The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, dirigibles require separate doors within the structure to fit neatly into the entrance hatch and the interior of the building. Secondly, the entrances are in a much narrower section compared to that of the Empire State's. Thirdly, unlike the Empire State, the Imperial Palace did not have an entrance and was too small for dirigmask doors.

In the original film, the Imperial Palace did have a door and a portico that were in use before the Empire State building was constructed. This gate was in use for a long period at the head of the Empire State building to give room to enter the building on its narrow side. It was open to the public.
