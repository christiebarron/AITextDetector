The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

When the two towers were destroyed by fire in 1946, federal authorities in San Francisco ordered the use of single-use elevators and the use of submersible lifts to divert traffic as necessary to avoid burning down the building. After two years of waiting, however, the city finally authorized a single-use lift that could carry two people and fly to another city of 800 people.

Today, two planes can ferry people to and from the skyscraper. In 2011, the tower's operators purchased $6 million worth of real estate, which they hope will help to finance new high-speed rail, as well as the construction of an elevated line connecting the twin towers directly into the Santa Monica Mountains. The Santa Monica Regional Transportation Authority also operates a single-use lift that can carry people between Times Square and downtown.

That single-use lift has some problems. It is difficult to control the airplane and the elevators. It is difficult to control water that is trapped in the elevators, which are hard to control properly. And a large number of low-level workers have problems operating between the elevators, including four who live on the lower level of the tower. Even though a single, single-use lift has some advantages, its problems mean the single-use lift can take months to repair and requires far longer delays in obtaining emergency repairs. For example, most of the lift
