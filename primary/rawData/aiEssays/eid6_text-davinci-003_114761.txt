The Empire State Building was a landmark achievement in architecture and engineering, and a huge source of pride for New Yorkers. However, it was also a first of its kind in its innovative design that would allow dirigibles, more commonly known as airships, to dock at the building’s top. This was no simple task, and the engineers faced a great many obstacles prior to completing the mooring mast for the airship docking.

The Empire State Building was originally designed to accommodate airship docking- hence the 203-foot spire that would eventually land the mooring mast. However, since airships had to be moored by a cable, which would be connected to the mast, extraordinary precautions needed to be taken in order to ensure that the mooring line was strong enough. After examining many designs, the engineers eventually settled on a metal mast as the optimal structure, and it would be made from ten 5-inch steel pipes bolted together in a pyramidal shape to accommodate the mooring cable. 

But the work didn’t end with the mast. This structure had to be secured firmly to the building. To do this, the engineers had to excavate the top of the building and install a foundation for the mast, as well as a mooring anchor near the base. And that was not all. To guard against the wind, the engineers had to build a windscreen and a "hurricane house" to
