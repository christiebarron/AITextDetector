The features of the setting greatly impact the cyclist’s experience in “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski. The cold, windy weather creates an uncomfortable and hostile environment for the cyclist, forcing him to embrace the pain of the ride and push through it. The wet roads add an additional layer of difficulty, making the cyclist more prone to slipping and falling. The darkness of the night can also be disorienting and could lead to him making wrong turns or not being able to keep track of time and distance, making the journey all the more challenging.

The hilly terrain and lack of street lights also make it difficult for the cyclist to see ahead and make proper turns. Additionally, the lack of familiarity with the roads and the area adds an extra level of adversity, as the cyclist is less comfortable in unknown terrain and could make potentially dangerous navigational mistakes. This lack of familiarity can also be a cause for distraction, leading to an increased risk of accidents.

Overall, the features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead” serve to test the cyclist’s strength and resilience, pushing him to his physical and mental limits. Although the cyclist does experience some fear and doubt due to the many challenges posed by the environment, these features ultimately work to bring out the best in him by inspiring resilience and courage in the face of difficulty.
