Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. It includes in-road road signage and the colour scheme that allows cyclists a certain level of control over roads.

But, there is no shortage of examples of this. There's the London-based team of cyclists who used a different colour scheme after being struck by a vehicle in a busy crossrail bus interchange.

The colour scheme that has been used in many of those strikes has had positive reviews from motorists. A study published in the American Journal of Road Science showed drivers tend to use it better than their counterparts who do not.

Cleveland has a much higher level of the 'Good Samaritan rule' than some of the most-used city routes, according to Simon Walker – an economist and former cyclist for the American branch of the US federal Highway Patrol.

He pointed out that, although the rule's benefits may be in the eye of the beholder, it has been a popular and often successful tactic for those seeking to take a quick stop on their way to work – by giving them a safe route by the roadside.

"The road safety argument has been a common argument of late. The notion that we have to drive the road to give the impression that we have to stop makes no sense," said Walker, referring to the notion that cyclists often choose to choose more careful, quieter lanes rather than using them as a short distance drive.
