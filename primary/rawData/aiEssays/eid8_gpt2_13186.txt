One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was about eighteen. I was at the school about ten days after the war so I knew the general were going to come before me, there was going to be a fight there. I was nervous. What went through my head? What did the guy's head do? I kept wondering what was it. There was absolutely no way that a boy would be getting a punch in his jaw without taking a punch and putting something in a bag behind him. The head was pretty messed up, and I had to put the bag in my mouth so that people wouldn't be shocked when they found out.

So I guess the general is probably taking a kick. That's the way it should be. He has more power. He's not looking for an opportunity to use it. So the way he does it is to say something. You have to say something in order for the other side to see that, and then they say, 'Well, this is how you like it and we're going to use it.' And they have to say they don't like something. I mean, they're going gunfire and they're not going to put a bag on them for example. You can't throw something in the bag.

You know, there's also an interesting aspect to the war. Even though we all know who is on whom side I amâ€”in this war you have to put the money, there're already many wars when
