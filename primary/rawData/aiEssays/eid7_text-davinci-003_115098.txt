I walked slowly into the store, determined to not let my agitation show. After I had received the email notification that the new video game console I pre-ordered was finally in stock, I wanted to hurry to the store to pick it up. But I was aware of how many people have been waiting a long time to get their hands on this same system, so I knew I needed to be patient and courteous if I wanted to get the most out of my experience.

It was hard. The line in front of me seemed to be moving at a glacial pace and I could feel my irritation rising. Finally, it was my turn at the front of the line. The worker seemed to take longer to process me than with the other customers, and I could tell she was taking her time to make sure she got everything right. She apologized for the wait, but I smiled and told her it was no problem; I understood that she was doing her job and that I just needed to be patient and let her do what she needed to do.

Her demeanor changed instantly, and I could see her relax in response to my understanding attitude. Before I knew it, she was happily ringing up my purchase and congratulating me on getting the system before it sold out. I thanked her, took the glowing box in my hands, and quietly left the store feeling much more at ease than when I arrived.
