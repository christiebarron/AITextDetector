The poem ends with the narrator reflecting on how in the spring they will take a test that was carefully avoided when the poem began. This suggests that the narrator has learned valuable lessons throughout the poem that has allowed them to come to terms with what they had been avoiding in the beginning. The imagery of springtime (i.e. the snows melting, the geese returning, and the hibiscus budding) represents life and growth, suggesting that the narrator is ready to face this test and move forward with their life. The ending, then, serves as a hopeful reminder that the narrator will have the strength to face the challenge when the time comes.
