One time I experienced laughter in my life was when a friend's cousin came to visit and asked me to sign up for a monthly scholarship at a college. This was to help us realize that we must learn our craft as humans.

The purpose of scholarships is to make you a better person and raise awareness for what you're learning. I will be running the website www.stealawaytickets.com.

Every year I receive several thousand dollars and I Lambert will send you an email detailing their scholarship plans and you will have to make one to win it. You can contact me at info@stealawaytickets.com
