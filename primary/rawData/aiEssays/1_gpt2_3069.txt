Computers have many effects on people. Some research in the 1980s concluded, "The incidence and duration of Alzheimer's disease can be controlled with an Alzheimer's diagnostic test." It was not until 2000, that the idea got serious.

The "Dealing With Alzheimer's"

The study of Alzheimer's disease, led by Dr. Dr. Michael J. Nee, one of its key authors in The Lancet; was published in January by the Lancet.


Nee and his colleagues found a link between Alzheimer's disease and brain death. As a result of the gene mutation, Alzheimer's disease increased by 100 percent. They were able to pinpoint that the number of brain tumors in the young men with Alzheimer's disease was so high that they could "set off a very complex chain reaction"â€”a process called "retrieval." Because this process was "sudden," the young men had two separate brain tumors in their brains. The second brain tumor was diagnosed within one week of the first. A "disease response" was observed as early as the second year, suggesting that these men had the right to recover the brain tumors.


Nee and his team also reported a pattern in how they found the brain tumor to be more aggressive than Alzheimer's disease. These "diseases response" patterns, referred to as disease behaviors, might have been more pronounced if it appeared at a much younger age than it did in people in the older group. This was
