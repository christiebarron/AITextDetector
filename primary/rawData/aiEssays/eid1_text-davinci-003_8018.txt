In order to draw the attention of Americans, they came up with a unique, ambitious concept â€“ to ensure that dirigibles could dock at the top of the tower. It was thought that this would be a creative way to bring leisure flight to the masses and really wow the American public. However, the idea of dirigibles docking at the top of the Empire State Building would prove to be difficult and full of obstacles for the builders and designers of the structure. 

The first issue was one of scale. It was one thing to design a tall structure but another altogether to ensure that it was suitable for docking dirigibles mid-air. Therefore, the engineers designing the Empire State Building had to put in extra careful consideration into the details of the mast above the 102nd floor. The mast needed to be strong and secure enough that large dirigibles could anchor without damaging the structure or endangering the people on board. They also had to ensure that the mast could take the strain of strong gusts of wind and remain steady in the air above the building.

To ensure the stability of the mast structure, the builders installed a steel mooring mast which could withstand up to 6,600lbs of pressure. In addition, the builders fitted the mast with special air valves which maintained the necessary pressure and reduced the risk
