 

I still remember the moment like it was just yesterday. I had just moved to a new city to start a new job and I was feeling overwhelmed and homesick. As I looked around my new neighborhood, I felt alone and scared of the future.

But then, something amazing happened. As I was walking down the street, a young girl ran up to me and looked me right in the eye. She smiled, and then let out a big, belly laugh. It was the most contagious laugh I’d ever heard. I couldn’t help but join in, and soon both of us were laughing until tears ran down our faces. When we finally calmed down, the girl said, “Now don’t you feel better?”

I couldn’t help but nod my head. In that moment, she had taken my loneliness and transformed it into joy. That little girl taught me a valuable lesson that day: laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people. No matter how dark the world might seem, a shared laugh can erase any fear or sadness. 

Even today, I carry her lesson with me in everything I do. Whenever I feel disconnected from the world, I just remember to laugh.
