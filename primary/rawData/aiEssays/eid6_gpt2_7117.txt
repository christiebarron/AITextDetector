The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First was the fact that the building itself was only one story high. The architects also had to overcome the need to build one block on each side of the building at all times. Secondly, having dedicated space in the building, a construction inspector would have had to place two different kinds of mirrors with separate mirrors on each side of the building. The first would be used to record the level of debris and the second was the third and final mirror. The only way to control the level was to use a special system called the "sickle-meter" to measure the level of the mirrors. At each level, the engineer could monitor the reflection and reflection from every side of the building. This system allowed the engineer to see through the levels Mental Trainers would sometimes use to identify the level of debris. To find debris, any debris placed in front of the building had an angle of zero (which, as you'll learn, is one-quarter of a degree off the ground). Some of these debris could be seen from the building, and this was a problem that the builders struggled with. To get rid of the issue, the builders designed a special kind of "sickle-meter" that was designed which looked like a black square at the end of a tube. As the shape of the black square was designed, it could be seen to the end of the tube's end. The second kind of s
