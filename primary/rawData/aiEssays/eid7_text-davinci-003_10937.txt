I was having a challenging time at work. I had just recently been promoted to a new position and everyday I felt a little more overwhelmed. To make matters worse, I had a hard time with some of my coworkers who would often criticize and pick at my work. 

I was struggling to not let their negative words get me down, and I certainly wanted to avoid any conflict with them, so I decided that the best course of action was to be patient and understanding.
 
So, I continued to do my best and take my coworkers' comments with a grain of salt. Whenever someone picked at me, I responded with understanding and patience, and took the opportunity to learn more and improve. 

I soon realized that my patience was paying off. I started to get along better with my colleagues, and they began to respect me more and offer their constructive feedback rather than their unsolicited criticism. In the end, I'm glad I chose to take the more understanding and patient approach â€“ it made a big difference in my work performance, and my relationships with my coworkers.
