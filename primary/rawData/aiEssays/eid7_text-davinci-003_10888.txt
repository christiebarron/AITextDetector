I remember one time when I was in line at the grocery store. The lady behind me had been on her phone for a few minutes when the cashier asked for her items. She apologized profusely and asked if the cashier could wait as she was in the middle of a call. Everyone in line started muttering and rolling their eyes.

The cashier replied politely that of course she could wait. She remained calm and understanding the whole time. I could tell that the other people in line were impatient, but the cashier was being incredibly patient and sympathetic.

When the lady was finally off the phone, the cashier finished ringing her up. The lady thanked her profusely for her patience and understanding. The other people in line seemed much more understanding as well, and I was impressed with the cashier's patience. It was a reminder to me to always be patient and understanding, no matter how frustrating a situation may be.
