Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. By default, I choose the 'Flex-Cycling' setting and the 'Speed' setting to maximize the range of motion available to the cyclist. If you are cycling at a high rate of speed at hills or roads that are unevenly paved, this will make a great setting and will not hurt the bike.

Slightly differently, I have opted to use the F1 mode to add maximum braking potential to the speed dial. This doesn't affect the total braking potential, but it changes the overall setting of the setter's choice, which means if you put a higher value on this setting, the bike may accelerate more freely. The only effect that I see is if you use the 'Dive Mode' setting as the'speed dial, which is a very subtle setting with very little effect, and a huge range of motion. If you use the 'Shimper Mode' setting, the bike appears much smoother and appears almost no effort required by the speed dial.

Slightly different settings can be used to optimize your choice of setting while making the bike 'feel' and 'feel like a bicycle'.

I am using the Speed setting to help me set the overall maximum speed that a rider can hold at an acceptable pace.

Finally, with Speed setting enabled cycling moves to its logical starting point in the middle of the road. This leads into a very limited
