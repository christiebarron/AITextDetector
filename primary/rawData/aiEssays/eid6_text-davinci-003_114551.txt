The Empire State Building was built in 1931 and was a marvel of engineering for the modern age. The architects of the building wanted to make the building even more impressive by allowing dirigibles to dock on the roof. Although this idea was daring, the planners and engineers encountered a multitude of obstacles that posed challenges to the success of this project.

The most notorious and pressing obstacle was the strength and security of the docking system and mooring mast. Initially, the building was designed with a flat roof which could not support the 80 ton weight of the U.S.S. Los Angeles during a routine landing. To remedy this issue, architects had to reinforce the entire roof with steel girders, and surround it with a reinforced concrete barrier for protection. The mooring mast, made of oversized steel pipes, was hoisted into place and provided the necessary vertical height for the dirigible.

The building also needed to meet the needs of navigating airships, leading to the installation of a powerful beacon light and guidance wires at the top of the building. The beacon was used as a visual guide for incoming airships, and the guidance wires allowed the incoming craft to easily locate the dock without the risk of large wind currents blowing them away.

In addition, the engineers needed to create a space that was large enough for the dirigible to maneuver. In order to do this, the engineers had to give the dirigible a space large enough for a slow advance towards
