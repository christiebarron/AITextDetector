Computers have many effects on people. Many of the problems that I'm discussing in that paper are caused by things as simple as random mutations and the fact that we use a set of very common biological elements (genes) to create a computer program to manipulate a computer program and perform these operations in real-time, but these problems exist in the context of machines, in real-time where computers are not real enough to do these things. But when I said that I would prefer to believe that computer programming was the best way to solve these problems, they were not right. And I can say something very different: to me computer programming makes no sense at all. Computers are a bunch of dumb things that can be programmed by millions. So let me ask you a question (it's my own personal answer)...

Question 16

Mr M.S. --

If you could have this machine, what would you have done differently?

Answer

Let me quote (a, perhaps one of the first things). Let me come up to you and say to you, "I don't know whether those books that you read, there are thousands of them. They all involve the same exact thing. But you can look up another book like this, and you'll find quite different and much more interesting things. But there are other different issues involved."

I can answer that question, and I cannot. How can I know whether the book, "The
