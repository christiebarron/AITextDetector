I was at the supermarket the other day and I had a few items in my basket that I needed to pay for. I got into the checkout line, but the person in front of me had a lot of items and items coupons which slowed down the process. The cashier was having a difficult time scanning her items and the customer was getting frustrated as she kept trying to explain her requirements. However, I was patient and didn't complain. Instead, I stood quietly in line and tried to help the customer by offering to retrieve items that had been misplaced. After a few minutes, the customer finished her transaction and we both went our separate ways. It turned out that the woman was a regular customer, and both her and the cashier smiled in appreciation of my patience.
