The construction of the Empire State Building was a massive undertaking, but one of the most challenging aspects of the project was to provide a way for dirigibles to dock. Dirigibles were a popular form of transportation during the early 20th century, and they needed to have a place to land at the Empire State Building. This task faced numerous obstacles, and the mooring mast was the solution. The following essay will describe the obstacles encountered in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, as detailed in “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted.

The most significant challenge was the sheer height of the Empire State Building. A major part of the design of the Empire State Building was the top observation deck, which was 1,050 feet above the street. This meant that any mooring mast had to be at least this tall. However, the tallest possible structure that could be built was limited by the fact that dirigibles are delicate and require a stable and steady platform to dock. The use of a structure as tall as the Empire State Building seemed impossible to achieve.

The engineers of the Empire State Building weren’t ready to give up yet, however. They turned to the Wright brothers’ wind tunnel tests from the early 1900s which had demonstrated that strong winds could push a steel cylinder as high as 1,100 feet into the air. The engineers decided to use this concept for the m
