Censorship in libraries is a controversial issue, and one that is hotly debated among librarians, parents, and other members of the public. 

Many people believe that libraries should remove certain materials if they are defined as offensive. They argue that this helps protect children from exposure to violent, explicit, or other age-inappropriate content. Furthermore, they argue that libraries should not only respect the values of the community, but also promote them as well. 

On the other hand, there are those that believe libraries should act as havens for free expression and knowledge. They argue that librarians should not censor materials based on their own subjective tastes and preferences or the desires of the community at large. Instead, they argue that libraries have a responsibility to hold a wide variety of materials so that everyone can find something of interest.

Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to censor materials in libraries should be left up to the librarians. Librarians are trained professionals who can evaluate individual materials to determine if they are appropriate for their library system. Furthermore, librarians should also consult with library patrons to ensure that their community standards are accurately met.
