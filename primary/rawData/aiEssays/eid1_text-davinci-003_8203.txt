The Empire State Building was a marvel of its time because of its lofty height and unique Art Deco design. But it was also engineered to be a docking station for dirigibles, a then-common form of transportation. Despite its ambitious goal, the builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

The first obstacle was the size of the dirigibles, which were usually over 200 feet in length. While the two masts atop the Empire State Building were capable of holding the weight of the airships, the roof of the building was only just over 144 feet high. This posed a challenge, as the dirigibles needed to be able to maneuver in and out of the 92-floor building easily. To that end, the roof was lowered and the mooring mast was built higher than the rooftop, reaching to the dizzying height of 1,050 feet. 

The second obstacle was the brittleness of the dirigiblesâ€™ kevlar fabric. When it came in contact with any hard surface, the fabric could be torn and cause a fatal crash. To help the dirigibles dock safely, the builders used a technique known as 'balloon braking'. They created a mechanism where the stationary mast and the mobile mast created a powerful air pocket that slowed the dirigible down, allowing for a gentle landing.

The third obstacle was that the airship pilots had to dock the ships manually with
