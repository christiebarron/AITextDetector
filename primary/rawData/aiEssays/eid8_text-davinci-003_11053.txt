As I walked into the room, I could feel the tension in the air. Work had been especially stressful lately and my boss and I had been at odds. We were both tired and frustrated, so neither of us wanted to speak first.

Suddenly, my boss began to laugh. I couldn't help but laugh too, even though I had no idea what had just happened. We both looked at each other in surprise, not expecting laughter to be the solution on this particular day.

As our laughter died down, I realized the tension was gone and a new connection had been made. We continued to laugh for five solid minutes and by the end of it, the atmosphere had completely changed. We were now friends.

Since that day, we have continued to find ways to bond and rebuild our relationship. And the most important tool in our toolkit is laughter. We now greet each other with a hearty laugh and often make each other laugh with jokes or stories.

That's the true power of laughter - it can build or heal bridges between even the toughest relationships. I am grateful for the day we both decided to laugh, as it has made all the difference in our working relationship.
