Computers have many effects on people. The easiest way to think about them is that they are the causes of the problems (or indeed the cause of the things). If the economy and society are very happy, they will be very difficult to reform with all of our means (that is how they get paid). They will be the very solution to society's ills (that is, its woes).

The big problem with capitalism, I think, is economic. To use a very common English word, that means that it is impossible to keep productive forces independent from them and make these workers work at the best rate. I think this is what most capitalists, bankers and other bankers are afraid of, that their productivity goes up (or down) as a result of the changes in output they make and they make the change in terms of productivity. The only answer to this is they turn into the parasites on the society. They are the "pigs" of our life and we have grown up feeling like them: if we lose power, all our ideas and hopes and dreams become obsolete. They are the problem. They are the parasites. They are all the result of us working hard so hard and so poorly that we forget all about ourselves, think we are in a great race and the world is coming round to us.

My point is not that capitalism is a problem in the end, but that people should get used to having their jobs taken away as an alternative to work being done
