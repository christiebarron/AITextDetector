The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is very strong. He says: 'From home, I knew that my life should be easier because I am happy to be surrounded by my best friends. On the outside, it was like a quiet summer outside my home. I feel much happier and that is because I can look back at things on another day in a different place, and I can feel happy, and I can go to school to learn.'

The book's narrator is'satisfied' with the world around him after the breakup with Jessica, who is 'a beautiful, bright star, and the most inspiring person I have ever met,' and he is 'finally coming down from her' when she is 13. The book begins with Jessica saying an outrageous story in which, while trying not to give advice to her sister, the older woman tells him to stop being selfish and look at himself in a mirror.

At the end, he gives his character advice and advice about how to look for success on the inside. The title is also given to him by an artist known as "The Man Who Knew Better Than You", who went on to win the 2015 "Design for Success" competition.
