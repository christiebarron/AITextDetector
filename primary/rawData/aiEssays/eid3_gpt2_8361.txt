Secondly, there's a difference in the way the bike controls the road. Thirdly, the distance the bike is taken from you has a much greater impact during a ride, due to the bike's handling properties in a different way - you'll do much more things running straight in front of you than if you used any less of an approach. With a slightly more conservative approach this effect can be reduced as the length of the bike is increased and there are more points of contention - this could be useful for people who are getting on and off road with bicycles in the saddle for most people.

An analysis of bicycle control results will often suggest that it's hard to set up and run smoothly if you just set your distance between you and the rider, but again that will be taken into account when setting up and running the bike.
