The Empire State Building, completed in 1931, was renowned for being the first ever skyscraper to have a public observation deck. However, what many are unaware of is the original intention for the building â€“ it was designed to be the first ever building to facilitate docking plates for popular dirigibles of the day. This innovative plan allowed builders the opportunity to bring transportation and commerce to entirely new heights, literally. However, despite this exciting possibility, achieving such a feat also presented numerous obstacles. 

One of the primary obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock was the dynamic weather of the city. With winds reaching up to 80 miles per hour, it was very difficult to predict and manage the force that the dirigible would meet when attempting to dock. Balancing between air turbulence and peaceful weather could cause extreme havoc and would often force pilots to unexpectedly change altitudes and directions. Pilots would also find it hard to navigate the route during night-time, making pilots rely heavily on navigational signals from beacons and flashing lights in order to determine where to make a successful landing. In order to mitigate the dangers, the designers of the Empire State Building devised an exceptionally sturdy mooring mast, which consisted of a frame of steel with an attached guy-wire upturned at the tip, responsible for anchoring the dirigible.

The mooring mast came with its own set of problems, especially when it came to height. Dir
