The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of obstacles when allowing dirigibles to dock, and the difficulties began even before construction of the building began. The original plans contained a 200-foot high mooring mast that would be used for the dirigibles docking operations. However, due to the difficulty of constructing such a tall mast, the plans were removed from consideration and the building was built without it. 

The challenges in creating the mooring mast were numerous. First, the mast had to be tall enough to provide the necessary lift in order to allow the dirigibles to dock, but also be short enough so that the airships could safely maneuver around the building. Construction of a mast at 200 feet would have posed engineering challenges as the wind loading and overturning moments would have been significant. Therefore, making the mooring mast safe and strong enough to support the weight of the airships was an obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced. 

In addition to the issues of height and structural integrity, the airborne traffic patterns around the building had to be considered. The mast would have been located in the center of the building, making it a potential hazard for passing airships. As such, a traffic system that safely guided dirigibles around the building with minimal disruption to other air traffic was also essential. The difficulty in creating such a complex system was likely another obstacle faced by the builders of the building.
