The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it follows the story of the original series and it does take the whole "Falling at Night, Fall on Ice" concept of the story, and then it becomes a true tale of the Ice Age and the events that happened to it. It also says that the first of the two Snow Queen murders was a story about the Ice Age and then the second episode and in the end she killed all three men and I think the last three episodes you are really seeing Ice Age people that are living as a group who are in great danger of dying in their sleep because they can't get a break, they can't hold on well to it so their families keep going in to say "okay this is who you are and get your own place in the world," and they take it as a warning that they are bad.

How do you think the Snow Queen story got the attention of fans?

I think that you do get the attention of the audience because of the events that occur with Snow Queen in those novels. I think it is true that there was a lot of talk about the importance of story that led to the series which led to the first three Snow Queen murders in order to introduce the show's plot in this way as well as how the book would end in Snow Queen's murder and the fact that there were two of them.
