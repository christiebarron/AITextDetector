In Joe Kurmaski’s  “Rough Road Ahead” the features of the setting play an important role in the cyclists’ experience. The winding, curvaceous path in the dense woods is a great challenge that tests the cyclist’s skills as they maneuver around turns and dips while trying to maintain their balance and momentum. The terrain also presents obstacles, such as rocky surfaces, and potholes where the wheels can slip and send the cyclist crashing to the ground. 

The dense foliage and thick forest provide a secluded and isolated feel throughout the story. This amplifies the intensity of the experience for the cyclist as their vulnerability along the unpredictable path increases. The trees also act as a “wall” blocking out any semblance of outside assistance. Knowing that they are on their own and must rely solely on their own skills and expertise makes the experience feel more intense and exciting. 

Additionally, the early morning nature of the cyclist’s ride adds another layer of difficulty. The cool air is energizing, but it also makes the cyclist’s muscles stiff and tense, making it harder for them to stretch and relax into their movements. This adds to the danger and intensity they feel while tackling the unpredictable path. 

All of these features of the setting contribute to the cyclist’s experience on the “Rough Road Ahead” and further increase the difficulty and danger they feel throughout the journey. The
