I recently had a challenging experience at the grocery store. As I was checking out, the cashier looked at me and asked me to step aside as she got some help bagging my groceries. A few moments later, a customer service rep came to her aid. The cashier proceeded to apologize to me profusely, but I just smiled and told her not to worry. I was actually very impressed with how patient she was in waiting for the customer service rep. She took the time to ensure she was comfortable and wasnâ€™t rush the situation. I appreciate her patience in the moment and her unwillingness to make me feel bad or embarrassed for needing extra help.
