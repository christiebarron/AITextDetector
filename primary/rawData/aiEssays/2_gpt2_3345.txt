I believe that censorship of materials in libraries contributes to a wide range of problems around speech from bullying in the classroom to academic freedom and access to public office.


I stand in solidarity with the thousands of people who have been affected by these issues and support their efforts for legal action. They have all shown that they are not afraid to speak up for their rights, to demand equality and for their rights to fair representation.


Now that we have made our statement, I would like to point out we welcome the efforts of others who have tried to share their experiences and share experiences of being bullied, and to bring those people up on this important matter to change their ways of thinking and their actions.


I hope that a few more of you take the time to support us through this journey. I hope you hear from people of all backgrounds, especially in schools, who have been affected by the issues that have arisen. Let us make a shared message, let's hope every conversation is a positive one and for our country to be able to reach out to those who are being bullied and who know that the voices of people with differing identities, and their own needs and needs, are what have brought them here and that is what I will be taking this journey in.


I ask that we make a statement in support of our students and communities who are being impacted by the bullying and that they be heard.


Thank you, and very much,


Sara Wasserstein
