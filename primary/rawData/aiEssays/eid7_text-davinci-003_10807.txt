I was in line at the grocery store with a long list of items for the week. As I watched the line move at what felt like a crawl, I felt myself getting more and more impatient. We hadn't even moved forward for what felt like minutes. Finally, the line started moving again and I began to quietly express my frustration under my breath. That's when I noticed the woman in front of me. She was older with gray hair and a cane, and she had an equally long list of items, yet she waited patiently in line as if she had all the time in the world.

I was so taken with her patience that it made me question my own behavior. Here I was, with a few items that I could easily replace another time, yet I was getting so worked up about a simple wait in line. I realized then and there that I should take a page out of her book. I put away my stress and impatience and just smiled to myself.

Finally, it was my turn to check out. I thanked the woman for her example, and I could almost swear I noticed her smile back at me before I went to pay. Experiencing this woman's patience was a reminder that there's no need to get so worked up over little things, and it's honestly a reminder I needed.
