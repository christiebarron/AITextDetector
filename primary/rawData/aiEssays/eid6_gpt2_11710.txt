The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Some felt that using a standard-sized camera might have allowed them to remove all but a handful of elements and replace it with a smaller version. In the end, many of the elements were removed from the tower and the main elevator. The builders also wanted to use their craft to move other buildings into service later. One solution was to give the air conditioner a small version to use to let people escape. Another was to replace all the lighting with "free sunlight."

However, these changes were not as radical as many people imagined. The government proposed allowing dirigibles in the towers to be removed in two different ways: by replacing the lights with "free light" and by providing them with a special "free" light source called a light shield. This allowed the building to be used without the need for any additional light sources.

The government agreed with the architects who proposed this approach. A new type of dirigible would be needed to stop lights. This one could be used for the power, food, and other functions that can be triggered by such a shield. A different type of dirigible would also be needed to prevent the building from collapsing.

By the end of the year, the building was well-equipped, and the construction industry was starting to use its newfound power to provide a new kind of safety net for commuters. But just as important, the government
