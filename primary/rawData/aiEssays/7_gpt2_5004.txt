An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I went to college and I said I am the best medical student I would ever give my kids. I said, "I have to hear your voice. Please pick me up." And they said, "You know you could call me anytime of the week."


And I was like, "Yeah, I'm doing that right now." It was kind of like that.


Was that really you?


I was just kind of looking at all of these guys. Everyone was just like, you know, "You know what?"


But I thought, this is a really important time for your kids, because your kids are coming out of high school and having this incredible experience. That's what you want your kids to do. There's going to be a lot going on with your kids.


We don't get a lot of interviews in our town because of the fact that there's a lot of different kids in our community. So it's really nice to be able to hear your children do great.
