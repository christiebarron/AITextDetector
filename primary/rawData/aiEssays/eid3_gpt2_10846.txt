Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

Climbing

The most important factor in using such a setting is how close a cyclist is to reaching him or her destination as you climb. If your 'Rough Road Ahead' includes a cyclist who has been struck by a vehicle, then the number of inches between that cyclist and the next vehicle will be slightly lower than if you had placed the appropriate 'Rough Road Ahead' setting. The cyclist may lose some time in this way by climbing more quickly compared to if he or she had put the 'Rough Road Ahead' setting forward.

Climbing should not only be taken regularly where available, but should include routes that lead directly towards cycling lanes on the road, such as:

Red-lining on paved or unpaved roads where you must enter any type of pedestrian-only barrier
