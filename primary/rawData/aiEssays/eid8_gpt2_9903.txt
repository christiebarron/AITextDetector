One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I got the news that my brother had died and I had to watch as he died for a few moments because we were all just laughing hysterically.


When I saw it, I was like "this is so hilarious! How could he get killed? I mean, I didn't have any friends or anything. He was never going to have any friends who were like, "I think this is going to be pretty serious."


And this, again, happened very close to home.


I was like "I really hate this character who has just been killed in the last year." And then a few days later, this happened, and we're playing the same game, and my mom and dad are like "Wow! How much did this happen to you?" So, my mom's dad died, and her brother's family.


And so, you know, after that, I thought a lot, how does it feel to spend our whole life together, doing all this and go about writing a fanfic, even though you know all these characters and it's really emotional for your character? And, you know, that made me really appreciate that.


The fact that you guys feel like there's this "novel" you're making that is way more special than the fact that it got made just happens because we think we can. I mean, it doesn't take years to build your fan network
