The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' by photographer John Williams at the University ofitcher's College London may sound like something out of a cult TV series 'Seed.' And even the title track of a documentary by the same name features a lot of self-importance. From Home, the New York City indie photographer and writer, has given us a whole new look at the origins and influences of a culture that's long been beset by inequality and the rise of capitalism.

This documentary has not shied away from showcasing the many influences and influences at play while also being fully transparent with its topic. Like the documentary itself, it includes audio recordings recorded in the 1960s and 1970s. In addition to Williams and his photographs, they take you behind the scenes of Brooklyn, New York's most high-profile garment mill, where the work has been published and photographed by prominent photographers and historians.
