I believe that censorship of materials in libraries should be made an absolute priority," writes Robert H. Miller, dean of the Department of Art and Design at the University of Chicago, who studies the arts. "If it's hard to distinguish between artistic materials on paper and print, it's difficult... to really judge what is and isn't okay."

The problem is that the vast majority of materials on display aren't good enough — or at least aren't considered such — and there's nothing to stop artists from using them to produce art that's not as good.

In the late 2000s, the Museum of Modern Art became famous for the paintings of Pablo Picasso. As the country's first art gallery, it began doing research into contemporary works of art on loan from museums, and its own curator, Michael Seiden, had an open mind.

The museum was established partly as a way for artists to showcase their works to the general public. Artists could go to museums every day and see what they were discovering, and in a little over a year it hosted exhibits in over 20 countries. The Museum began providing exhibitions after receiving an open letter from the American Civil Liberties Union in 2014, and now it's doing another round in Chicago.
