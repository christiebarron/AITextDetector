I remember the first time I really laughed with my now-wife. I had asked her out on a date, to the movies, and I was a little nervous about it. We decided to go to a comedy, something lighthearted. When the movie finally started, something funny happened and we both laugh. To my amazement, we had the same exact laugh. We looked at each other with this shocked look in our eyes and then burst into hysterical laughter. We both just kept laughing and from that moment on, I knew we were going to have a special connection. We eventually got married and laugh together all the time now, no matter what we're doing. Laughter brings us closer and is a reminder that life is too short to take it too seriously!
