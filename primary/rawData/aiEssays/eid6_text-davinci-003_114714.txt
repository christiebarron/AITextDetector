The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One of the first was the physical nature of the building itself, which was not designed to function as an airship terminal. The top of the building was made mostly of concrete, which posed a risk to the airship itself as it was not strong enough to withstand the force of lashings attached between the dirigible and the buildingâ€™s roof. This meant that some kind of mast had to be constructed, and the task of doing this was complicated further by the fact that the entire tower had to be completed before any attempt to construct a docking mast could be started.

To make things worse, the design of the Empire State Building meant that it protruded from the skyline, and at its highest point was 1,250 feet above the sea. This increased the difficulty of securing a docking mast to it and ensuring the safety of the dirigible as it made its way to the scheduled mooring point. Another factor that created difficulties was the fact that the mast had to be strong enough to withstand both the weight of the airship and the elements, including rain, wind, and snow.

In addition to the physical challenges, constructing the mooring mast also posed a financial challenge. The cost of building the mast and maintaining it over a long period of time was an added expense that the builders of the Empire State Building had to consider.
