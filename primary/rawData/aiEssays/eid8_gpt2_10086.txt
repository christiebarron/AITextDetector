One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I watched my partner grow up. We had children, but I never thought we'd be together forever. I think when she said her smile was something she did to keep in line with her children, she started asking her parents about how much they loved her. I think that had made things more fun for me. The fact that she was growing up was kind of good, that it made things a little easier.

As for the rest of my day? Well I was feeling more optimistic. We'd stopped being so busy, we'd moved out, our kids were all going to college now and we were spending the rest of our time as we normally would. It's what works for us.

Do you think you'll be happy to go on a trip to Mexico with my husband when we're all busy, and do you ever think about how he'd be able to take them when they're older?

Absolutely. I think when he's out on a date or even before the date you think aboutâ€¦ he's never been away from us. We've been friends all our adult lives, even when we were both in our twenties. I think his family, even if they're not the best couple from our whole lives, they've always been there for him. He Ling's really nice to his guys. I love spending time with him.

Why wasn't he there for you when you were taking the kids
