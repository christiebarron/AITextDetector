The ending of the poem Winter Hibiscus serves to provide a hopeful ending to the poem. The speaker reflects on how tests can cause much stress and how they are arbitrary and fleeting. By ending the poem with the speaker deciding to take the test again in the spring, after the snow has melted and the geese have returned, the poet implies that these tests, while necessary, should not be taken too seriously and that nature and life always prevail. This ending provides a sense of hope and resilience, reminding the reader that life is always changing and that one test does not define us.
