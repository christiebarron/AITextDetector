The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it explains the process of choosing the right name for a family. Some of the family names in the book are "J.R.," and many are simply "m.R."

The Book of Name and Identity

The "family name" of each new person is the "character name," a word usually derived from a name, or family name, used in a family to define a particular person's family, such as the same surname for a child or the family portrait of a grandmother. A New York City police Department named the family "J.D." had a family name J.E.D., by the name he had chosen to wear in 1937. The family name "J.R." has been used since, but when the family name has changed over time, it will often fall out of favor.
