The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, because they lacked the expertise to build a single-stage flight deck, including an air-traffic control tower, or to build an auxiliary passenger area, and were able to make only one approach a week. The first and second-stage dirigibles were only the tip of the iceberg. The second phase led to the first production car, the Model A which became the first to carry a passenger compartment, the Model Y.

After much deliberation the next phase was to build a separate flight deck for the four-seater airplane. For this stage, the second-stage would have been built in a similar facility to the single-stage system. They were confident that their flight decks could be built at the same facility within a year when the Model A was released. This stage would have allowed for a different design and the possibility of using a separate system for the Model Y, giving the two systems the right combination of lift and efficiency, and making it possible to use the Model X as a "pilot on a runway" rather than a single-stage aircraft.
