I believe that censorship of materials in libraries, museums, and information venues is not acceptable based on public policy recommendations or the legal requirements for government access. We can work together to encourage the dissemination of materials as they were written in academic settings or in other venues, such as in academic institutions, libraries, information institutions, or other civil and societal organizations."
