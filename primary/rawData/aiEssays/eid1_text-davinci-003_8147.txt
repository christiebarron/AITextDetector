The builders of the Empire State Building faced an array of obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. From aeronautical challenges to problems with the infrastructure of New York City, there were numerous complications that needed to be addressed. As outlined in the text ‘The Mooring Mast’ by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, these barriers posed a headache both logistically and financially for the project's supervisors.

The first and most obvious challenge to surmount was the size of the airships. The winds and air currents of New York often made it difficult for dirigibles to remain on a particular course, meaning the city skyline needed to be taken into account. The Antoinette monoplane’s tragic crash into the Empire State Building’s 79th floor in May 1931 was a stark reminder of the perils of too ambitious a flight path. 

The Empire State Building couldn’t just randomly support a dirigible mooring mast either. The airships were large, and the erection of additional complexes of support beams would not only have been prohibitively expensive, but would also have been likely to interfere with the building’s purpose as a skyscraper, blocking lines of sight and disrupting the efficiency of the building’s design. In the end, the plans for a mooring mast were deemed infeasible.

In addition to the complications of the skyline, the design of the airships was
