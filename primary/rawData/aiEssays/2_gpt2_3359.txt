I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is the best way to ensure that they do not endanger children, which is why I created a simple and simple website where students can read and share material on their computer," Mr Depp said. "We want to provide feedback where the information we are about is relevant to the school.

"It is important that this site is able to show students that they cannot do this as a joke and as a right."

Mr Depp said it would be important to ensure the content of the site wasn't a threat but that it was needed to allow some information to be easily easily accessible.
