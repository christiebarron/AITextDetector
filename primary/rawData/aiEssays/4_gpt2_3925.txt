The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it starts with the name, but not the word.

The name of Winter Hibiscus appears as a recurring theme from the TV series In Utero for the first half of the series and in the movie In Yoru Jiraiya: The Tale of Yoru Ishikawa in the second half. In the anime, it is mentioned three or four times.

Other characters: Snow Man (the nickname is given to snow on Snow Mountain) and Lady Beryl (the nickname is given to snow on Snow Mountain)
