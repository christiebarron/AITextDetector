The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Those that wanted to use them had them towed along by trucks.

For more than three decades, the owners of the building had no legal requirements that builders tow dirigs. Instead, they built their own docks by cutting them out of the building material.

"The first thing that comes to my mind is that you need the truck or car at your door or whatever other tool you would like to use instead of the dirig you think is fine," said Ed Cawthorne, the building's owner and the current developer. "It's not as good as being built by the builder, and we get it quite fast."

In fact, the trucks were able to break the chain of command on the project as much as 8 a.m., Cawthorne said. That's about one-fifth of the number of workers at the center of the demolition. But it also made it much easier for residents to access its property. Once Cawthorne learned how to use the trailer to move objects, visitors arrived without worries, he said. More than 1,300 people filled more than 350 public parking lots.

"It worked so well, we wanted to give it just a bit of a ride," Cawthorne said. The day after the city ordered he and his wife to build their own custom trailers, they stopped for lunch at P.J.'
