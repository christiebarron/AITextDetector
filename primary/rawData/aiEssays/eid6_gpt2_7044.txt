The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Their original intentions were to allow airliners to carry passengers, so a lot of the problem for some of the first flight managers was that it was impossible to have a full-sized cargo compartment or cabin for long-haul flights.

The lack of full-sized cargo rooms (which was then introduced as the No. 3 priority in U.S. government plans) also made things difficult for pilots, many of whom were reluctant to use the cabin.

Eventually, the U.S. Air Quality Inspector recommended that a full-sized cargo compartment of 7,300 tons be built at the Smithsonian, but the design was eventually abandoned.

Now, with a fleet of over 4,000 planes, the U.S. Airports Association has found a way to allow a full-size airplane to dock with passengers at the Smithsonian. After waiting for more than 20 years for the decision on a full-sized, full-size cargo compartment, the Boeing 3 has finally been approved for a flight.
