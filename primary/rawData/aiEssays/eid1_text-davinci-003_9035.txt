Dear Editor, 

As technology grows and changes with each passing day, the effects of computers are becoming increasingly apparent in our modern world. It is easy to laud the advantages that they provide - from staying in touch with family and friends to researching virtually anything - but it is also essential to consider their potential harms. I believe it is imperative that we recognize and respond to the effects that computers have on people today.

First and foremost is the mental and physical health impact, which is particularly acute for those with frequent access to computers. A lack of physical movement, often combined with a greater tendency to snack and an increased workload due to unconventional hours, makes computer users more vulnerable to a range of health risks, from obesity to heart disease. On top of this, the addiction from persistent use of technology can be a huge leading factor in psychological issues such as depression, anxiety, and insomnia. 

Additionally, it is impossible to ignore the potential usage of computers for cybercrimes such as identity theft, malware, and cyberbullying, which have become key features of the technological age. We must be proactive in introducing security protocols and ethical online behaviour to protect users’ privacy, which has become ever more important in today’s digital world. 

Ultimately, computer use can have both tremendous advantages and worrisome disadvantages on our society. It is therefore essential for us to understand and consider the implications of this powerful tool - both positively and negatively - and act appropriately
