I was having a difficult time with my math exam. I was feeling really overwhelmed and anxious because I wasn't understanding any of the questions. I knew that if I didn't do well on this test, it could affect my grade.

So I decided to approach my teacher after class and ask for help. She could tell I was stressed, so she took her time and calmly explained each problem to me until I was confident I could solve it. She also gave me some extra tips on how to approach different problems.

By the end of our conversation, I was feeling more confident. I thanked her for her patience and tremendous help. I was so grateful that she was willing to take the time to help me out in such a meaningful way. Her patience truly made all the difference.
