Dear Editor,

As technology continues to make advancements, there is no doubt that computers have a tremendous effect on all aspects of life. From the way we work, communicate and entertain ourselves, computers are omnipresent in our daily lives. With this in mind, I wanted to share my opinion on the effects computers can have on people.

I firmly believe that computers have had a very positive influence on human beings. The internet age has enabled us to stay in touch with distant friends and family, explore different cultures, and open up opportunities to learn about a wide selection of topics. Computers have also increased productivity through a variety of software and other helpful tools. For instance, a spreadsheet application greatly simplifies the process of managing financial data.

There are, however, some drawbacks to the heavy usage of computers. Individuals may develop a dependency on technology that allows them to forfeit personal development due to reliance on computers for simple tasks. Furthermore, needing to constantly upgrade our systems with the newest version of software can be costly for both individuals and now businesses.

In the end, I remain confident that the advantages of computer use outweigh the disadvantages. By utilizing effective personal and organizational strategies, we can reap the rewards of computer use, without succumbing to the potential pitfalls. 

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
