The construction of the Empire State Building in New York City was a monumental feat, and was designed with the modern advances of the times in mind. One project that was considered by the builders of the Empire State Building was allowing dirigibles, or passenger airships, to dock. There were, however, some formidable obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock.

The primary challenge the builders of the Empire State Building had to face was designing a secure mooring mast. Dirigibles are relatively delicate vessels and require very specific conditions in order to stay aloft and dock. To design a mast that could safely accommodate airship docking, the builders had to research and draw upon existing knowledge as well as consult with a variety of experts. According to author Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted in The Mooring Mast, they also had to be aware of the prevailing winds of New York City, as the mooring mast would have to be in a position to withstand strong gusts.

The builders had to factor in not only the physical dimensions of the mooring mast, but also the amount of surface area it would need to securely dock one or more dirigibles. The mast had to be able to handle the weight of an airship being pushed against it by the wind, without the anchor points of the airship destabilizing the structure of the mast, and without the mast putting too much stress on the airship's
