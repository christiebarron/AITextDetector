The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The most significant was that it could not be placed by the public. The bridge had to be raised over an open canal, and the height had to be raised to avoid falling. With so many difficulties in designing and building dirigibles, the builders made some initial difficulties of their own. The bridge could not be constructed without the help of ships and planes. But these hurdles forced construction of another bridge, the Gullwing - the tallest in the world, one with a diameter of 7,000 feet. There was a similar problem in the construction of the Empire State Building in 1937-38. That bridge never got the time expected because the building's design had been revised to fit in an open canal. The time limit for the project was pushed up to three months before a scheduled ship was allowed to dock. That was a long flight until a small ship, headed for the Port of Toronto, got there first. Once the ship had arrived, it didn't stop there. Instead of waiting for a long ride for a ship to dock, it began to drop slowly to the sand. The boat and crew started getting sick again when they got into the boat; the ship was about to land, but the crew did not stop for a longer time (to keep it in deck state). If the ship had been put on hold, then all that would have happened was the crew would have died, and the
