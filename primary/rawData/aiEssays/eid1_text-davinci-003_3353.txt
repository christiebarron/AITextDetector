Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the affect computers have on people.

As technology continues to develop, computers are playing an ever-increasing role in our lives. On the one hand, computers are a great boon in the world of education, providing countless online and interactive learning resources for students. They also greatly assist in workplace productivity, allowing the completion of multiple tasks with just a few clicks.

On the other hand, computer use poses potential risks. Overuse of computers can lead to sedentary lifestyles and physical health risks such as obesity. Furthermore, overuse of computers can also have detrimental effects on mental health, leading to depression and other mental health issues.

In spite of these potential risks, I believe that, overall, computers can have positive effects on people. Their capacity to access a huge range of information makes them a vital tool for learning, work, and leisure. Furthermore, despite physical health risks associated with computer use, many people use computers to improve their health, such as tracking their workouts with fitness apps.

Therefore, I believe that, if used safely and responsibly, computers are a valuable asset that enrich our lives in countless ways.

Sincerely,
