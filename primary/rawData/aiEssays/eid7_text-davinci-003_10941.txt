I was meeting a friend for lunch, but when I arrived I realized he was running late. I knew he had been really busy lately, so instead of getting frustrated, I decided to be patient and wait for him. I found a seat and a few minutes later he finally showed up. He apologized for being late, and I just smiled and reassured him that it was completely fine. I knew things had been hectic for him lately and that he needed to take some time to catch up. So I was patient and understanding of the situation, and we had a great time catching up over lunch.
