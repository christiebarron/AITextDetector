The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, because the state building system required all residents to have an enclosed garage. At another time, a home was the place to house your home, much like a car. The state building also required many "tents," which enabled the construction of a single living space.

As the Empire State Department of Building Rehabilitation announced to the public in April 2007 that it was working on the project, many residents of the new building, who did not want to live in what was originally built as a "new" house, left the building with only their clothes on.

The building was eventually remodeled to include luxury accommodations, such as a bedroom on the third floor or a bath in the basement. The rooming at the front door allowed for a private kitchen and an on-site meeting room.

In a 2010 report, The Empire State Department of Building Rehabilitation identified a variety of options for tenants and explained how the apartment building might play into the future of the Empire State Building. As a result, the building, which serves as the backbone of the Department of Buildings, had been re-designed and constructed.

The construction took seven years and resulted in an estimated cost of $19.75 million. The State Department also estimated a cost of $24 million of the total cost of the renovations.

The Empire State Building reopened to the public in 1990 with new owners
