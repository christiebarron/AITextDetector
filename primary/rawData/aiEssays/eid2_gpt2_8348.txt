I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is critical to our democracy. I believe that if such access is available to free speech that speech will continue to supremely improve. We need to end all censorship under the guise of protecting the right to academic freedom.

This is something I am absolutely determined to do. I have worked with the president and the House of Representatives on this, but in the end for those who have been harmed like the Tsarnaev brothers it is essential that we fight back and take back our democracy.
