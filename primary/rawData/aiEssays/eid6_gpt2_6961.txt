The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. For almost the entire construction period from 1937 to 1959, they used large dyes, but the use of materials with very little or no contrast did not work very well. The second important problem was the fact that the glass used and the glass surfaces used were highly abrasive. Dyes which had been specially prepared for that used would have been affected by water and so would have been subjected to high temperatures. Finally, unlike the others, these materials were very inexpensive. All the dyes used were fairly similar to those used for aircraft, but the dyes used did not have the same viscosity and other properties as those used for the engines. All of the materials used were very expensive and were also a very slow process. For this reason, designers decided to use more expensive dyes than those used to meet the requirements of the Building Industry Association. Many of the dyes used by the Empire State Building could only be used in the exterior of the building, which had relatively poor contrast. The Dye Dye is one of the most important parts to the building and is earliest made and installed. Because of this, Dye Dye will only be needed for the exterior.

The main difference in construction between the Empire State Building and that of the U.S. Building was that it contained many different types of metal. For example, the Steel Dye (which was made after the U
