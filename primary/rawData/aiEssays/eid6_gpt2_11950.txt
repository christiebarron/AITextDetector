The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. For example, on a major runway at Washington D.C., an Air Force X2 rocket used to loft a helium balloon was designed with helium in the fuselage exposed to the sun at 45 degrees F. But, as the rockets were being built, helium's tendency in the fuselage to freeze the balloon was causing the helium to burn badly, and the balloon did not start to explode when it touched down.

Although these challenges, in some cases leading up to the invention of the balloon, were too serious for the designers to overcome, in others they only helped fuel the balloon's design.

Now engineers from New Mexico have gone on a historic quest to make rocket launch vehicles. The company has been making rocket rockets over the past six and a half decades at one of the country's busiest airports, but just last June, they gave up making their first, successful rocket, because the Federal Aviation Administration forbade them to make any vehicles that use a helium balloon as an option. The FAA is also now reviewing the government's regulations to make sure rocket launches operate safely. (They are also reviewing an additional requirement to make an X-29B rocket available for testing. The test will go to an FAA committee.)

The question for the engineers is how to get the balloon to reach the intended destination, so that the rocket could be ready in its first month without any
