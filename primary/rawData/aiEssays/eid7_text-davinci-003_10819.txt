I was working on a project for school and it was due soon. I felt overwhelmed by the amount of work that had to be done. I was feeling stressed and frustrated but managed to remember to be patient. I took a few deep breaths and reminded myself that I can't accomplish everything in one day. I took a few steps back, looked at the project in a new light, and started to break it down into more manageable chunks. After taking it one step at a time, I was able to complete the project on time and with a good grade. The process was difficult but being patient helped me tremendously.
