The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because we'll end it with a little bit more humor than you're used to. There is more to life than making fun of the world just because you're here to have fun. If you're going to want to be funny, you need to be able to be around some real people doing what they're doing. People who've spent too many years in the world just become what their world needs them to be. I understand that. That's part of the reason I feel good about it. My best advice now is to work from what I see as the best. I'm a really good cook, and I want my best to come out. A couple of years ago, I was driving along the highway and I started to think about how I was going to make some delicious meals for my kids. Nowadays, I'm planning to go out and cook. I'm going to make some great pasta, and I'm going to do dishes for the kids. The kids are going to have some fun at Thanksgiving. [I also see] how all of this can bring out creativity through doing things together."
