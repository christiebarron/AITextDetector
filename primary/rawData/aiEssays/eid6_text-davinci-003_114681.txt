The Empire State Building is an iconic skyscraper located in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. When it was completed in 1931, it was conceptualized as a revolutionary innovation for its potential to enable dirigibles to dock into its 200-foot mooring mast. Although this concept was relatively novel to the world of construction, its completion was still hindered by many obstacles.

The initial challenge was simply getting the Empire State Building approved by the city. It was a particularly tall and enormous building that had seemed to appear out of nowhere and was being constructed at a breakneck pace. It took time for the city to agree to the modifications needed for the mooring mast and the new road that would be needed to connect it.

After the concept was accepted, the next hurdle the builders faced was figuring out how to engineer the mooring mast. Marcia Amidon Lüsted's book, The Mooring Mast, describes their challenge as producing "the strongest, most flexible mast of its kind with the least amount of material." As mentioned in her book, the engineers had to design the engineering in a way that was “strong enough to stand up to strong winds, resilient enough to absorb the shock of the mooring line's impact as the airship docks, and light enough for the mooring line to pull the mast as the airship departed."

The designers had to be creative with the materials they used to construct the mooring
