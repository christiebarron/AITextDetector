An example of a time someone in my life was patient was as an adult: the time I had just lost my mother to cancer and she was sick on my own. I would've gone back after that and looked and tried to explain to her how I was done and help her. She would be like, "Oh. I'm going to make it work now." She would know, "Hey, why don't you start on that new medication. It will help me with my condition." That would have ended it.

So she started on another medication. It didn't.

I didn't care. I didn't ask. I wasn't talking. I was just trying to help. I had no intention of even caring.

And there's an element of self-doubt, and that's sort of what made me really uncomfortable. I never looked at my therapist and said, "Ooh, oh my God, I had to go through something that I didn't care about."

I had all my issues. I had no choice. I have no support system in my life whatsoever.

It's this sense of anxiety, and it was my way to get me to do things, and that had been in the back of my mind for months at a time.

I would say, "You know what? Now I'll go out, do the work or I'll go to bed." There's an element of self-doubt
