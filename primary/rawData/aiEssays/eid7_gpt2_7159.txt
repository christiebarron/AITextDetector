An example of a time someone in my life was patient was in a hospital with a serious concussion. We were told, "Take a blood pressure test, because it's usually going to be difficult to get back out of bed." I had to take the blood pressure test as we got to the bed after the concussion. I looked up and said, "Wait a minute. It's not a concussion." If you looked at the way people were behaving, or with their face, they was like, "This is different." We didn't notice that there was a difference. We were not trying to say why. That actually happened to someone before the fact."

You've been working as a therapist as many different terms and approaches. How did you approach the idea of working with people in a way that cansideto be helpful for you?

I have been able to connect with so many people, including people who have just lost their lives in this attack, someone who's been through the trauma, a person with mental health and who has lost their family that I've worked with. I have taken these situations and have worked and been successful to connect with people even and I've also been able to connect with so many individuals suffering from PTSD. That's how I've seen them and I can talk to them.

Did you consider the fact that this person had a traumatic brain injury, one of the most traumatic and destructive. How important of a way to work in a community
