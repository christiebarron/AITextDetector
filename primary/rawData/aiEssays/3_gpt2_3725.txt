What is the cycling programme?

The cycling programme is the introduction of cycling on roads around London between November and April to provide safe driving and cycling for pedestrians.

Transit operators and car manufacturers are expected to open hundreds of new routes, all with links to London, as part of this new plan. This cycle program will not apply on the majority of British road routes as it replaces other services.

Many cycle routes are already provided in London before this shift, including Southend in Hackney, Kent from Southend to Hounslow in East Lothian, Surrey and the Central London Link with Bristol and York North.
