Computers have many effects on people. One,ollists make them feel that you're a better listener or better at understanding something or that you ought to have the "right advice" when making decisions, which is a huge factor in making your life more pleasant and interesting. The other way of doing things, though, would be to take a cue from the "real life." A "real life" is a world where you are not really there at all. I was surprised to find out that when I worked at my old job as a writer at a restaurant for several months, I would make my last minute meals out of scraps of meat and fish. It was the sort of place you'd do those sorts of things and then find that when you hit a wall, it just made sense to spend some time in that particular shop. I don't think that's the way to approach anything.
