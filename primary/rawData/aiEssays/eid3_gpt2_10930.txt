Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. For example, cyclists in rough roads typically have significantly more cycling volume compared to men (43% increased cycling volume) and women (33% increased cycling volume during a bike ride). These findings are particularly noteworthy due to the fact that when it comes down to 'hard' roads, men tend to increase on average 1.0 (less than one third of cycling volume) and women the other ways. But where the findings seem to match up, where the research might be more representative of cycling intensity, there might be a few other considerations that are worth remembering. The first is an important distinction that could help in understanding how to choose rough roads, for example in an effort to minimize risk of injuries to road users.

The most pertinent question for cyclists on a road that has had a number of recent changes is how much they want to get into the bikeway, and what they are thinking about moving into it, in particular to avoid cycling crashes. The results from this research indicate no real significant difference in the effect of any change on behaviour. By the end of the year, the main drivers of the improvements in overall cyclist volume are likely to be women and young people, so in a way the findings from this study point in the right direction.

Research on roads on rough roads should ideally be restricted to 'road design' where a road has been designed in such detail in a way that is
