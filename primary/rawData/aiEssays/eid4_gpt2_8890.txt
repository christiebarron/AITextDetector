The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it was published with a title of "Winter Hibiscus by J.J. J. Jackson". In fact there is a cover in the book, which shows the cover of Winter Hibiscus and it has a yellow, long piece of silver wrapped around it.

Hibiscus is not actually an ice breaker that is part of an old-fashioned fire-fighting system which was invented in the late 19th century. Instead, it is an artificial fire-breathing plant built by a small, but very clever, German man-scientist who lived in a small farmhouse in the Bavarian town of Bickelfeld a couple of centuries ago. The plant was called "Hibiscus glückli", after Günther Huxley whose father was the legendary chemist Albert Huxley (see picture at top), father of current current American chemist Stephen Huxley. It is a type of "cold water fire" designed by James Moore that fires on a small fire which is only made of hydrogen sulfide. However, when this gas fires up the burning hot water, it breaks and starts to combust, and so it is called "Hibiscus glückli".

"Winter Hibiscus" (shown above) is a kind of "cool water" that was invented by James Moore in the 1930s in a farmhouse in the Bavarian town
