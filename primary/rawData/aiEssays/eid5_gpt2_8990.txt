The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' has gone from tense, angry, emotional to joyful. 'When you know your partner is angry,' he said, 'you know something's wrong. And you can understand why the partner was hurt. It can always end up as this moment for you. It never will be for you.'

He then pointed to the fact that "some" of the men he took as his 'cogs in this family' had become 'welcomed' by his boss.

'They've been allowed to take my money. They weren't given. I've been asked what I need from my partner,' he said. 'My understanding of things is they've been let go and I'm only allowed to pay them at their house. It just doesn't seem fair. I don't want to take more money for food than how many drinks my partner drinks and now their friends are drinking.'

He added a suggestion for how to use his 'coffee machine' in the long term he added that he was 'going to start using it to cook my dishes and the next time I'm at a party and find it too expensive'.

The new book is due out in early 2016 but it will be titled 'Heather Brooks' and will explore the'relationship of a sexual identity' with an ex who has left a'seemingly ordinary past' to take the leadership role in a'sex movement'.
