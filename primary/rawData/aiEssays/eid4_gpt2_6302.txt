The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because he has a vision of the future. He has taken a new perspective on the world, by reading more from the writings of the greatest mathematicians of all time, Alexander von Ribbentrop, and Arthur C. Clarke. He has created his own history, which he uses as a primer and reference in his quest for a better future.

This book is the one that will help save your soul. You know that that quote about how you cannot learn a second language without reading ancient books? Well, this book tells the story of Alexander von Ribbentrop, who had this vision for a better future he called his "Hibiscus and the Sun". He had this vision through the struggle to find his way back to heaven: in an attempt to achieve the glory of his divine potential. One day a magical object was brought to the mind of a man named Kropotkin. However, it didn't seem that he could see a future, and so he looked at the Sun and came to the truth: it existed! Kropotkin's goal, he found, was to escape the curse of the gods and get back into the physical world, where he would see the light and reach his goal from it.

He does, here, come to the physical world for his vision to stand true.

Hibiscus and the Sun is a wonderful, informative and true history.
