The Empire State Building, built between 1930 and 1931, was the first skyscraper to ever attempt to incorporate the ability for dirigibles to dock on its spire. Despite a huge engineering challenge and a myriad of obstacles, the reach for building higher and higher was stronger than ever. This project was revolutionary and ultimately a success, though not without difficulty.

The first obstacle to be faced was safety. Creating a space for a dirigible to dock, which held the lives of both passengers and crew, meant that all factors had to be taken into consideration when calculating the structural integrity of this tall building and how it could support such a large machine. The builders had to be sure that the spire was comprised of a sturdy steel skeleton capable of withstanding gusts of wind and other unpredictable forces. 

The second obstacle was the design. To ensure that the dirigible had enough space to safely dock, the Empire State Building had to be outfitted with a pad and mast for the ship to arrive at. This required the creation of a forty-eight foot, two and a half ton mast, three safety rigs to keep the airship centered, and a three-hundred-ton landing platform. Such a task was unprecedented.

The third obstacle was the size and proximity of the docking space. The Empire State Building was situated in the midst of a bustling city, and the confined space meant that the engineering team had to get creative and use what they had.
