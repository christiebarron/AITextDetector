Dear Editor,

I am writing in regards to the effects computers have on people. As computers become ever more omnipresent in our lives, there is no doubt that the effects computers have on us will become increasingly important.

Personally, I believe that computers can be both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, the vast array of technology available to us, from basic desktop PCs to complex tablets and smartphones, makes a range of activities much simpler, faster and more convenient. Computing can certainly provide numerous advantages in arenas such as communication, education, and research, to name but a few.

On the other hand, computers can have the potential to be detrimental to our lives and health. Excessive usage of computers can lead to addiction, poor posture, eye strain, and lack of physical exercise, to name a few of the more serious downsides. Moreover, computer addiction can lead to an inability to connect with the real world.

It is thus incumbent upon us to use computers responsibly, to be aware of the consequences of too much computing, and to use the technology for the benefit of humanity. We can become responsible digital citizens who enjoy the many advantages that computing offers while safeguarding ourselves and those around us from the potential risks.

I am sure that many readers will agree that while computers bring great opportunities, it is important to use them safely and with moderation.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
