The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They could Calm and Breathe into them or not. But, they were also very short, very hard to build, because the terrain was so heavy. And they didn't have much room here to make a shelter for the other engines. Because it would take a very long time to assemble the hangar and the wings â€” about a one-hour journey.

So, in the beginning, the first thing we thought of was letting it be set up by a friend. Then we said, "Alright, so we can come up with an alternative." We put it in because the other two people thought it looked like a good idea, but it didn't make much sense to us. But we started to talk. We thought that we might try a different arrangement, but we just didn't think there would be much point. So then our engineers had to put the hangar up.

So, there are about 30,000 people in the Empire State Building
