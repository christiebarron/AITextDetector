Dear Editor,

In today's world, technology has become a big part of our lives. We heavily rely on computers for almost everything. But in my opinion, computers have had a negative impact on people.

First of all, many people forget how to communicate in meaningful ways because they are so used to the rigid structure of online communication. The lack of body language and facial expressions, as well as the lack of physical contact, can lead to misunderstandings and even a sense of isolation.

In addition, the use of computers has also been linked to weight gain and other health issues. Studies have also found that people who are constantly exposed to the blue light from screens are more likely to suffer from sleep deprivation, which can lead to a decrease in productivity.

Finally, computers have made it easier for people to look up facts and information quickly, but they have also caused us to become less reliant on our own knowledge. We are more likely to outsource our knowledge to the internet or other sources rather than trying to figure it out ourselves. This can lead to a decrease in critical thinking skills and creativity, which are essential for sustainable development.

I believe that if we use computers wisely, they can benefit us in many ways, but we must be aware of the potential negative impacts of the technology. We should be responsible users who recognize and take action to minimize the harm caused by computers.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
