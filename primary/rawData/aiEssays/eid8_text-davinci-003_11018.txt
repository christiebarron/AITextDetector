I'll never forget the first time my husband and I laughed together. It was shortly after we started dating and we had gone out to dinner at a Mexican restaurant. As we began to talk, it was clear how different our personalities were. He was analytical and philosophical, while I was bubbly and outgoing.

At one point, the conversation became a bit heated, and it seemed as though we were about to start an argument. But then something completely unexpected happened. He made a joke and I chuckled. He looked a bit confused and then I laughed harder. Eventually we both couldn't contain our laughter and the entire restaurant seemed to look in our direction.

For a moment we forgot the differences between us and laughed together. It was a beautiful moment that we'll never forget. From that day forward, laughs and humor has become our common language and we have grown even closer from it.
