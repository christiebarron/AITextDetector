I was visiting a friend at a nearby town recently and my car suddenly broke down at the edge of town. I was stuck there as I couldn't find a mechanic who might be able to help me out. I was starting to get very frustrated and impatient as time went on but I decided to stay calm. I stopped for a while to take a few deep breaths and tried to focus on the positive things because I didn't want to make the situation worse. 

I kept telling myself to stay patient and soon enough I noticed a mechanic not too far away. I waved to him and asked if he could help. He agreed and soon enough he had my car running again. He was really nice about it and told me that it's good to be patient in situations like this and that I shouldn't give up hope. I'm really grateful that I stayed patient in this situation, as it wouldâ€™ve been a lot more difficult if I was impatient and angry.
