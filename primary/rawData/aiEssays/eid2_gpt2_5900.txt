I believe that censorship of materials in libraries, universities and colleges would save millions of dollars, including hundreds of millions in personal income taxes, and could save Americans a substantial amount of income tax credit that may be less then they ever should have at most.

That said, I worry that libraries and universities would take this situation to their logical conclusion that they should be doing everything they can to make sure that content stays up-to-date and as comprehensive as possible by removing the "censor" on such materials. If this were to happen, many of the "honest" media owners such as NBC Universal would have to make huge concessions in the process and would have little incentive to take a stand in the way of a censorship campaign by the censors. So it would be very difficult for libraries and universities to justify cutting access to free speech content or even doing anything that might allow the media to move forward with its efforts if there is censorship of any kind that would help keep speech down and maintain the integrity of the free expression��.

As an example of the dangers of censorship, I would add the following two statements by a great great public speaker.


"When children are told that they can say anything they want with impunity no choice is left."


"If a child can say anything, it makes the government take its cue as to what kind of thing to say and what kind of child should have the right to say it. It should be free speech!"
