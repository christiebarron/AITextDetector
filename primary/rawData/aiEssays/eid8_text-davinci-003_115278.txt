I was visiting my best friend with my family on a hot summer afternoon, and we decided to take a little dip in his neighborhood pool to cool off. We were all having a great time, laughing, splashing each other with water, and having a blast. Then, as we are all about to get out of the pool, my friend shouts out that he needs to "go pee real quick!" 

The rest of us were in complete shock and we all started to laugh simultaneously - the kind of laughter that just bubbles out of you without any control. It was a contagious laughter that spread to everyone around, even those who weren't there with us but heard us. 

I realized then that there is nothing that can lighten up a moment like laughter can. That little moment of bonding between me and my friend, his family, and even complete strangers, will stay with me for years to come.
