Today was my best friend's birthday, so I decided to surprise her with a picnic by the lake. She had no idea what was ahead of us, so I tried my best to keep it a secret. When I picked her up, I could see on her face that she was already excited.

We got to the lake, spread out our blankets, and got the snacks out. I was so excited for my idea to finally come to fruition, I could hardly contain myself. 

But then, something unexpected happened: a duck waddled right up to us, quacking loudly. We both giggled and looked at each other in excitement. We had never seen anything like it before. We started laughing, until tears were streaming down our faces.

We spent the rest of the picnic chasing after the duck, trying to get it to come closer. Then, the duck decided it had had enough and waddled away, leaving us in stitches.

We'd never laughed that hard before, and that moment really brought us closer together. From then on, whenever something funny happened, all we had to do was look at each other and instantly burst into laughter. That unexpected moment with the duck really made our friendship that much stronger.
