The construction of the Empire State Building in 1931 presented a great innovation: the mooring mast. Designed as a docking station for dirigibles, or airships, the mooring mast was the greatest technological feat to be mounted on any skyscraper in the world. However, there were numerous obstacles encountered during the process of permitting dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Buildingâ€™s mooring mast.

The first obstacle was the time frame. The project was incredibly ambitious, involving the engineering of a 500 foot tall steel tower and building a mast atop it capable of holding 1.2 million pounds. There was a limited schedule for completion, as the dirigible Hindenburg had been announced to land in New York City by May of 1937. This aggressive timeline meant that the engineers and builders had to work quickly and efficiently, but not to the detriment of the safety of those who would dock on the mast.

Another obstacle was the design of the mooring mast. The Empire State Building already had its iconic design, and the mast had to be designed to complement it. The architects and engineers had to ensure that the mast was well-crafted and aerodynamic, so that the dangers of turbulence encountered during tight turns were minimized. Additionally, the design had to keep the mast accessible not only to the dirigibles, but also to the citizenry, who were expected to be frequent visitors.

Finally, there were safety concerns. The moor
