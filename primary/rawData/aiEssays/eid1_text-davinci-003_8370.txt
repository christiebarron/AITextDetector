I recently had a customer service experience where the representative needed to ask me many questions in order to help me with my issue. As they took the time to process all of the information I gave them, I knew I could be waiting a while. I sat there patiently, however, understanding that they needed to ensure they were able to resolve the issue and did not want to rush. Eventually, they were able to help me, and I was thankful for their patience and dedication to getting the job done.
