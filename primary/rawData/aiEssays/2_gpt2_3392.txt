I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is necessary and should be encouraged."

He added that libraries should not Simpson be forced to censor materials they already have to comply with, citing the example of recent years of censorship in the UK.

And Mr Hutton said the government has spent up to 50% of its budget on public libraries and had pledged to pay "significant sums in order to ensure that these investments are made a priority". But he insisted there was "no political or organisational control" over schools - including the funding of some arts and sciences initiatives.

In his address, Mr Hutton said he was "appreciative and grateful that all the government has done on behalf of all children and young people to support, support and enhance the voices of these young people".

The minister also called for greater transparency in the education system and the introduction of accountability. In a speech to the Home Affairs Select Committee, minister for youth and families Martin Robertson urged parents of young people to be more aware of why the education system is failing children and young people.

Mr Robertson said education policy should be more on the books, and for parents to think more deeply about their children's futures.

Mr Robertson cited recent recommendations from schools to introduce a "tough start" policy, called for accountability for teachers and parents, and proposed that "unfair and unequal use of funding be considered". He called for greater control and oversight over education.
