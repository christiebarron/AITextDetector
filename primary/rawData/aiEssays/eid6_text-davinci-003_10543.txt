The building of the Empire State Building included the curious task of allowing dirigibles to dock at its top. Despite the difficulties presented by this innovative idea, the builders of the Empire State Building persevered and eventually achieved success. 

The first challenge was the intense wind and other weather conditions at the top of the building. A mooring mast was necessary to secure the airships, since a regular mast would be too unstable to withstand the violence of a storm. The builders created a mast 82 feet tall, which was the largest structure of its kind at the time, and were met with criticism. Engineers worried that the mast would cause damage to the building itself and there were public concerns about air traffic in a densely populated urban center. Despite these doubts, the builders persevered and were eventually able to install it successfully.

The second challenge was adapting the mooring mast to the changing seasons. During summer, the sun would cause the metal structure to expand, and the builders had to develop a special longitudinal slit to account for the expansion. The widening of the mast meant that cables had to be added. 

The third challenge was the infrastructure for mooring dirigibles.  Due to the size of the building, extra infrastructure was needed in order to accommodate passenger traffic. This included an elevator for passengers, stairs, and a framework for the dirigible's tethers. The builders had to keep in mind that the infrastructure had to be able
