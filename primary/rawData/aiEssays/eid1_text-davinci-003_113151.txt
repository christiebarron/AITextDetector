Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my opinion on the effects of computers on people. As the technology landscape continues to evolve, computers have become largely ubiquitous in our lives and their impacts are undeniable.

Many people view the advent of computers in a positive light, as they provide people with countless opportunities for work, entertainment, and creative expression. By leveraging computers, users can take part in activities such as video gaming, digital media editing, coding and programming, and many more. Additionally, computers give people access to a vast array of information, allowing them to stay informed on current events, and being able to connect with more people than ever before.

Furthermore, computers have the potential to save humanity countless man-hours of labor. Automation and robotics provide businesses with the opportunity to reduce costs and improve efficiency while still providing an acceptable level of quality. 

Unfortunately, computers also have their downsides. Many people, particularly children, have become so reliant on computers that even basic everyday tasks can become difficult. Additionally, recent studies have linked long-term computer usage to potential health problems such as headaches, neck pain, and eyestrain.

That being said, it is clear that computers are an integral part of our lives and can be used with care to maximize our potential. I hope that the readers of this publication agree that computers must be used judiciously to maximize gains while minimizing potential detriments.

Sincerely,

[
