I remember the time when my son was learning to ride a bicycle. He was five years old and every time he tried he would get frustrated when he lost his balance or didn't make it very far down the driveway. Instead of getting frustrated with him or scolding him for not understanding right away, I stayed calm and coached him patiently.

I talked him through how to push off and which way to turn the pedals. I kept encouraging him to keep trying. Eventually he learned how to keep moving and soon he was riding down the driveway all by himself.

Seeing his smile and determination when he finally made it was so worth the patience. I am so proud of how hard he worked and how patient I was.
