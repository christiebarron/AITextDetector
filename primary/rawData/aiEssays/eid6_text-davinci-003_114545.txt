The Empire State Building was an incredible feat of engineering when it was built in 1931. At the time, the concept of linking air travel to building construction was relatively new, and the building’s designers saw the potential of linking air travel to its tower. As a result, they sought to create a way for dirigibles – large, airship-like vehicles – to dock at the building, and for that vision to become a reality, the builders faced a number of obstacles.

The first challenge was the need for a mooring mast, which would provide a point of contact and an anchor for the airships and hold them steady while docking. This posed a significant problem for the Empire State Building’s designers. Due to the building’s height, it was difficult to design a mast that was both functional and aesthetically pleasing. Consequently, the mast had to be built directly into the building in such a way that it would not stand out, detract from the building’s stature, or disrupt the airflow around it.

The second obstacle was the need for the mooring mast to be strong enough to hold the weight and pressure of an airship. This was complicated by the fact that airships can be up to three times the size of a commercial airliner, and can weigh up to three tons. The mast would need to be designed to bear these extreme forces, and the building’s architects had to take into account the
