The monumental Empire State Building, completed in 1931, serves as a testament to the indomitable spirit of the American people, and to the ingenuity of its builders. The sheer size and structure of the Empire State Building, however, posed considerable challenges to the idea of allowing dirigibles – or airships – to dock atop the structure. As any engineering feat of such grand scale is bound to bring with it engineering deficiencies – the harnessing of wind and handling the stress of an airship – the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building was seen more as a dream rather than a reality.

To facilitate such a daring engineering feat, the engineering and design teams had to solve two major obstacles. The first challenge concerned the presence of a strong wind current, particularly at the higher heights of the building. To avoid damaging the airships due to the turbulence, a movable mooring mast was designed and erected at the very top of the Empire State Building, making it the first ever airship mast in the world. This mast had to be able to pivot to adjust to the naturally changing winds, and also to be adjustable in heighth, as to better accommodate the different size of airships. 

The second challenge the engineers had to face was the immense stress to both the building and the ships caused by the shifting of wind, and the movement of the airships. To counter this problem the engineers designed a series of power winches on
