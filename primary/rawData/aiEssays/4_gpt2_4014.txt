The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because, over the summer, a group of people – many more than the books themselves — were living in a house where other people had to leave in an effort to help the man, who had been diagnosed with cancer. When he could no longer speak to them for hours after he died of natural causes, he called the children's hospice for help. He also made a "book of the same name."

This is exactly what the rest of us, whose lives are cut short by heart disease and family tragedy through my book, had to do. The book took us from this point to this moment.

It's a reminder of how hard you have to navigate the world: How good we find ourselves.
