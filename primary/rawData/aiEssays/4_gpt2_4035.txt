The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because of the author's love for her readers. In it, she tells herself that she cannot be content to just sit around, and it is only then when the novel begins to move on her mind that winter falls. The book doesn't matter much, and there are so many things going on here that is just very disappointing to me. I was just happy to see that Winter Hibiscus is finally getting her heart back on track and is getting out there for the real thing.

How big was the Kickstarter for Winter Hibiscus?

Just $7k raised! We started out with only a one-week goal, but by the second time around (about three weeks prior), we were hitting our fundraising goals, and we couldn't keep our project going. Our goal was 3,640k, which is a very significant milestone that shows that all the hard work went into it, and we all got on board from that point forward.

How long would you say you had the funding?

We were almost 2 days away from a milestone; I didn't want to give up on this project. It was a dream come true. We spent hours each night to make sure that everything that was needed on our schedule was being fulfilled, but we still knew this was not going to be what we wanted for the book.

So just how long would you say before you're done with Winter Hibisc
