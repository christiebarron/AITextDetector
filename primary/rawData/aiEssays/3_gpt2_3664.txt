All six also make it clear to cyclists who come to the cycling event that they may not be getting adequate ventilation, so it is crucial that they know where they need to stop, so they don't jump (in order to avoid being struck by an ice pick.

On second and third-hand, this is especially important. On the surface it looks like there is 'no need' to get up on the bike and take a look at the road to find a set-up, but in actuality all it does (even the roads outside of Toulouse to an extent) is allow a cyclist to enter the setting with his bike by simply having to look down.
