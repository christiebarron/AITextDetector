Growing up, I often had to babysit my little brother. At five years old, he was almost always running around, playing loudly, and getting into mischief. One weekend, I was in the middle of doing my math homework by the dining room table, and my brother was trying to get me to play with him. I made it clear that I needed to finish my assignment, but he wasn't deterred. 

For a few moments, he kept asking me to play, but eventually, he started to get upset. I remained patient and understanding despite his frustration. I was calm and told him that I really needed to finish my work, but we could play afterwards. Finally, he agreed and ran off to find something else to do.

I appreciated my patience during that moment because it taught me that sometimes, you just need to stick with something and remain calm when someone is getting upset. Patience can make a difference in any situation.
