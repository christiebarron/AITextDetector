The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it also ends with an easy explanation of what the book of Winter is, and why it's so cool.

To begin with, there are two main reasons for saying that Winter is good. One is that it tells a straightforward and easy story without overly dramatic twists. The other is the fact that, despite its simplicity, it never gets caught up in an overly formal framework. Winter isn't a complicated story; it's just all about one thing, and that is the same. One thing you can't live without, Winter is always perfect.
