Computers have many effects on people. The simplest effect is increased aggression. That is to say, as much violence and hate as one can create that affects the world, and yet there are always exceptions. And to understand them all, consider this:

There has been a major influx of hate crimes in recent years, with the numbers peaking at a staggering 24,000 in 2012 and up significantly following the 2008 financial crisis. On a recent morning in Portland, we had nearly 9,000 people attending a rally on Martin Luther King Day, where the mayor and city council debated whether to approve a new gun law that would allow for the sale of "assault-style weapons," the practice of which has resulted in 21 of the 30 law's most horrific killings.
