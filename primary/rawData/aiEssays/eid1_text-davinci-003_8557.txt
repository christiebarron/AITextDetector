I remember the time when my car broke down on the side of the road. I was so frustrated - I was trying to get to an important meeting, and it seemed like I was never going to get there on time. But, I tried to keep my cool. I called a tow truck and calmly explained how urgent the situation was, and the tow truck driver said he would be there as soon as possible. 

It only seemed like an eternity as I waited for the tow truck. Even though I was running late, even though I was incredibly angry, I tried to remain patient. I sat in my car, meditating and taking deep breaths until the truck finally came. 

The tow truck driver was amazing - he quickly got my car loaded onto the back of his truck, and asked if I needed help getting where I was going. I thanked him, but told him I had already called a taxi, and I was able to get to my meeting with just minutes to spare. 

That experience was a valuable lesson in patience. I was so glad that I had been able to remain calm and patient, and that it had paid off. It reminded me that sometimes, when I am in challenging situations, the best thing to do is just take a deep breath and be patient.
