Dear Editor,

I am writing to state my opinion on the effects computers have on people and to persuade readers to agree with me.

In today's technological world, most of us are exposed to computers in some way, whether it be for school, work, or leisure, and its impact on our lives is undeniable. While the effects may not always be positive, I strongly believe that computers benefit our lives in many ways.

For starters, computers have made learning and researching easier. With so much information available, it is easier to gain knowledge and fuel creativity. Additionally, computers can help us stay connected with friends, family, and the world in ways we couldn't before. We can now easily communicate with people from all corners of the globe and take part in new communities.

Computers can even be an effective tool to stop crime. Access to databases and improved surveillance technology has led to the faster arrest of criminals. Furthermore, computers can help protect accounts and information from unauthorized access.

Overall, it is clear that computers have many positive effects, both on a personal and global level. They can open up a world of opportunities and allow for unprecedented levels of creativity and knowledge. I urge your readers to
