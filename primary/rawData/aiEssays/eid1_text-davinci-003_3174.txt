Dear Editor, 

As technology advances, the cost of computers continues to drop, leading more and more people to own them. With this increase in computer ownership comes the inevitable increase in the number of people using them. This is a huge step in our technological and social evolution, but it also means more and more people are exposed to the potential risks associated with using computers.

For example, computers can be a major source of distraction. People often spend hours at a time glued to their screens, forgetting about more important things, like the people around them or their own health. Computers also can contribute to an increase in the amount of time people spend sitting, leading to a sedentary lifestyle and openings themselves up to other health issues associated with inactivity like obesity and heart disease.

But computers can be more than a source of distraction and potential health hazards. With their easy access to information and their ability to quickly connect people, computers can be used as powerful tools to promote education, creativity, and communication. We often take for granted the wealth of knowledge we have at our fingertips and how easy it can be to connect with loved ones near and far.

Ultimately, like anything, computers should be used in moderation
