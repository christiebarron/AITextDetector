An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I gave birth to seven of my children. I have never experienced in that way. I was only here just to give my baby a second chance. But I also gave birth to three babies and the four-year-old has not lost his mother!"

That brings me back to why I wrote this letter: the truth. I am so proud of what my doctor says will make sure that my son, a little boy, is a real life good doctor.

I am writing thanks for all of your wonderful words. It has been an honor to see you at AIMS for two weeks, and I feel so glad for the community that has supported you since the day I met you. If you can use your voice and ask for my resignation, we're waiting for your last chance today. You have the power as medical scientists, and I hope you will join me in joining us for your last day at AIMS. You will get all of my family's support in that time.

That is the day that my son will live long enough to know in how beautiful of an end I have found him. I can't wait to continue the rest of my life in that world.

Until then, pray for you as well for your future.

May your strength and your children and grandchildren bless you the best.
