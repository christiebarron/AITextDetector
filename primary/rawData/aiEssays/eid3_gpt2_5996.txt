How Do I Put These Other Comments On?

A person might have been confused about some of our actions and some of our opinions. However, if you try to read through the many details contained in the video, you will never be fooled by anything of the level of ignorance and dishonesty you see on the Internet.

There are so many people trying to get information out of this video. Some of the people on Twitter and Facebook seem to be the same. Others are very familiar with the information given by some of the other comments, but only a few of them have even read the YouTube video. They all start talking about how difficult it would be to put all of this information together.

It's amazing how many people who don't know what to do (with no experience, or at least some level of understanding) are constantly trying to force the same old stuff out as well as their ideas and opinions.

My favorite point of contention here is the following question: if you give the information from the video and then try to show you someone doing something stupid, does that person get that information? I've put a lot of effort into making sure none of the people in the video are following the same line of thinking as the person in the video.
