I recently witnessed an incredibly patient person in a stressful situation. I was in line at the airport waiting to check in for my flight. The woman ahead of me had an issue with her ticket and was struggling with the customer service rep. The woman politely asked the rep to explain the issue more, and waited patiently for a response. She was calm, even when the rep was not providing a helpful answer. She kept asking questions, taking deep breaths to stay calm, and even kept her sense of humor when the situation seemed to be getting more and more frustrating. Even when it seemed like the rep didnâ€™t have an answer for her, the woman stayed patient. Eventually, the rep was able to find a solution and the woman was able to board her flight without any problems. It was really inspiring to watch her stay cool and collected, even in the face of a challenging situation.
