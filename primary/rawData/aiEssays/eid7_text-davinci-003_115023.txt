I remember one time when I was going through a really difficult time at work. My boss wanted me to finish a project by the end of the week but I was struggling to stay on top of it due to all the other projects I was working on. My boss knew I needed more time but he was getting impatient and wanted the project done as soon as possible. Despite his frustration, he remained very patient with me and encouraged me to keep going and to ask for help if I needed it. 

I was definitely overwhelmed but the support and patience my boss gave me made the whole situation much easier to handle. He continually checked in on me to make sure that I was doing okay and to answer any questions I had. He even gave me an extra day to finish the project, which was a huge help. In the end, I was able to complete the project and I definitely couldn't have done it without the patience of my boss.
