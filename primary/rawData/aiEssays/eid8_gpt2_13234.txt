One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was working on the soundtrack for a game I was being given on this. I was working on a commercial with the band and the first thing the people would say was 'I'm sorry, and sorry, but I hope you like it.' I never asked that question out loud, but as a comedian I was shocked and humbled by it.

So to give away your own music, you tell me about the situation of the band, which is in a good place, and what kind of career you'd recommend for them?

I don't know what I would recommend a good career for a singer, because they are so unique but what I do give back to each and every song comes from the heart. I like to try and get it out and feel what it means to me. I get a great amount, and it always makes me appreciate it.

What does the future hold for you as a composer? Could you tell me if you could return to classical music?

This is my favorite kind of book, because as long as I'm using classical music, then the future will hold true. At the moment it doesn't even matter if I was writing it myself or how I went about doing it myself.
