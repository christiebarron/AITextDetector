I recently went to a new restaurant, and I was really looking forward to the evening. Unfortunately for me, the restaurant was extremely busy and there was a long wait for a table. Despite the long wait and other customers getting annoyed, I chose to remain patient. 

In order to pass the time, I chose to strike up a conversation with the man sitting in the waiting area next to me. We talked about our favorite places to eat, our hobbies, and our jobs. It was nice to chat with someone and take my mind off the wait. 

Finally, after waiting for 40 minutes, my name was called to be seated for dinner. The wait was long, but I stayed calm and patient and kept my cool. It allowed me to have a great evening out before heading home.
