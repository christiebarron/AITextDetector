One day, I was running late and fell behind a slow driver on the highway. I felt my frustration growing as I watched the minutes tick by. I reminded myself to be patient and recognize that this person, like all of us, was just trying to get to where they needed to go. 

I decided to change my attitude and told myself “Everyone has somewhere to go. We need to have a bit of patience to get there.” With that in mind, I dispersed some of my mounting anxiety and pulled back, allowing the driver to go at their own speed. Sure enough, when we reached the exit, the car in front moved to the right lane and I was able to reach my destination with time to spare.

Staying patient in this situation allowed for a smooth and less stressful journey for all involved. It taught me the importance of being understanding and tolerant, even when it’s difficult.
