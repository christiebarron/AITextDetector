2. In the late 1950s, the Empire State Building housed a "tractor" for all three of the Empire State Buildings. (Photo from the site)

3. Empire State Building workers first found an opportunity at the "wax trailer" in 1952 to design a new, more conventional type of "tractor" (with a front bumper and an rear bumper) and then introduced it to the public in the mid-1960s.

4. According to Robert Jones, "the story of all the Empire State has been, it didn't know anything about folding or whatnot." (Photo from the website)

5. Although designed to accommodate airplane landing and air traffic control systems and to allow for more flexible control schemes -- including "lateral control," which is a traditional control system to allow for airplane landing (which would be much harder to accomplish on a 747) -- the new type of tractor would have required a separate design that included a folding crane (which would require a folding crane but would provide stability to a folded chassis -- which could be done by a second crane in a separate facility), and then a rigid hinge base.
