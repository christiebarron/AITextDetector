It is vitally important that libraries remain open as a forum for exchange of ideas, and it is of utmost importance that the right kind of censorship is applied in order to ensure that the library offers a safe environment for users. The appalling effects of censorship in the past have shown just how far governments can go if censorship rules are not carefully established and enforced. 

When it comes to what materials should be removed from library shelves, the question of censorship should not be taken lightly. While some materials, such as books, music and movies, may be viewed as offensive by certain individuals, there is still the possibility that their content could have a positive influence on others. Thus, libraries should allow users to make informed decisions on when to access certain materials, rather than have them completely removed from the shelves.

Furthermore, it is important to consider that when it comes to controversial books, magazines or movies, they are often the most compelling and relevant works of literature. Allowing users to access these works might potentially open their eyes to different perspectives on controversial topics and even challenge their preconceived notions. In other words, while it is true that such works could possibly be deemed offensive, understanding the exact reason why and taking that into account could potentially lead to meaningful dialogue. This kind of dialogue is essential to fostering an open and accepting library environment.

In conclusion, while some censorship is necessary to protect the libraryâ€™s users, it is important not to overstep this boundary.
