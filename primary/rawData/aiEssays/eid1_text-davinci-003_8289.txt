The Empire State Building is an iconic symbol of the power of human ingenuity. So, when it was discovered that the design of the building also allowed for the docking of dirigibles, it was met with great excitement. Unfortunately, the builders soon encountered a number of obstacles when attempting to create a safe environment to accept the mooring of dirigibles.

The first challenge was to create a tall and sturdy mast that could support the weight of large airships. For this, the builders designed a mast composed of steel pipes welded together, with a height of 450ft and weighing approximately 71 tons. Below this mast was a steel deck construction where the dirigible would actually dock. This was essential to ensure the safe transfer of passengers and goods from the airship to the building.

Another obstacle the builders faced was in the construction of the mast itself. They had to ensure that the mast was designed in such a way that the forces generated by the air flow around it could be safely distributed to the building. In addition, the mast had to be connected to the building in a way that would enable the mast to move around during mooring operations. Consequently, the engineers came up with several ingenious solutions, such as bracing sections, jointless welding, and a cross bracing system.

The third challenge was to determine how to control the air traffic flow around the mast and ensure the safety of the passengers. Many different ideas were proposed, but the most
