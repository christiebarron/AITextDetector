Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

We would like to express our admiration to David Hagen, Director of the Department for Road Safety at British Transport Police. We have followed the lead of the National Transport Safety Board (NtB) on setting up the National Safety Recordkeeping Agency, which has the power to examine driver behaviour as a risk, making recommendations for improvement and making proposals for changes or enhancements. The following data sets are our primary source of evidence on how all the parameters for 'rough-road ahead' relate to performance;

The NtB aims to make road safety determinations through a series of benchmarks. For each road use measure we make a determination as to how well 'rough-road ahead' (Figure 3) reflects the performance of drivers as a whole. This determines how well we would like driver behaviour to play an important role in understanding their risk assessment from Road Safety.

We consider the following factors to monitor the performance of drivers in each measure:

Difficult or moderate travel;

The risk taken on the road for
