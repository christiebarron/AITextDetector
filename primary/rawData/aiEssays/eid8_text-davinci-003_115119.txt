I was visiting a friend in a different state for the weekend, and we had been planning to hit up a few comedy shows. The drive to the theater was much longer than expected since there was a lot of traffic. By the time we got there, the show had already started. We were both exhausted, and I was a little discouraged, but my friend had an idea.

We started telling jokes, starting out simple and working our way up to more absurd material. Even though some of the jokes weren't very funny, we both started to laugh uncontrollably, partly because it felt so ridiculous to be telling jokes in the car.

Eventually, we were laughing so hard that I could barely drive. We managed to get to the theater safely, both exhausted and breathless from laughing so much. It was such a meaningful bonding experience and one I'll never forget! 

By the end of the night, I was so glad that we had found laughter instead of disappointment in our plans. It turned out to be one of the best memories from my visit.
