The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In 1815, a federal law barred a pilot from docking a plane outside of Washington. In 1819, a law outlawed a pilot from docking a ship in Pennsylvania. As of 1911, dirigibles operated only in the federal capital, but the Department of Justice considered their commercial value to be minimal and restricted them from flying as government buildings.

The current government regulation of dirigibles is somewhat different, but it does seem like federal regulators have finally figured something out. It is unclear what specific restrictions the Federal Aviation Administration would have to make in order to operate a dirigible in the United States and beyond.

But the problem with the FAA's approach is twofold. First, the FAA doesn't own the aircraft. Second, the FAA doesn't have enough aircraft to put the planes together.

The FAA's approach seems to be having a major impact on safety in the United States, as well as the United Kingdom.

According to a report released Saturday (January 2), United Kingdom aerodynamics expert and former FAA pilot Dr David Williams found that the European equivalent of airfoil is significantly larger and thicker. In a 2001 paper, he found that the wings have three times the air volume versus the wings of the United States. In addition, the wings are much easier to maintain and the wings' weight is much less.

This means that U.S. government
