I was recently helping out at a local soup kitchen and felt the pressure of the time constraints placed upon us. Serving food to dozens of people was no easy task. We were trying our best to handle all the orders and move quickly, but still take our time to ensure that everyone got what they wanted. 

At one point, a woman at the counter was very particular about her order, asking for more items than we usually serve in one order. I kept my cool and was patient with her, not wanting to rush her through the process or make her feel uncomfortable. 

When it was all said and done, she thanked me for being so understanding and patient. She said that it made her feel respected and that she appreciated me not getting frustrated or short with her. It was a reminder to me of how important it is to be patient and understanding towards others, and to always take the time to be kind.
