Dear Editor, 

As technology has advanced, computers have become an integral part of people’s daily lives. Everyone from students to business owners can benefit from the advantages that computers provide. However, it is important to recognize the potential issues that can arise from computers’ pervasive presence in our lives. 

For one, physical and mental health are inevitably impacted by using computers for hours on end. Excessive use of computers can cause eyestrain, headaches, and fatigue. Additionally, people can become addicted to their computers, developing a sense of dependence that can take away from the rewards of spending time outdoors and engaging in physical activity. 

Countering this, computers can help promote productivity and collaboration in the workplace. People can use computers to improve communication with colleagues, network with new contacts, and finish more important tasks in less time. Additionally, people can leverage computers to access valuable educational and research resources that would otherwise be difficult to obtain. 

On top of this, computers have opened up new opportunities for creative pursuits, allowing people to innovate and express themselves in ways that weren’t possible before. Many talented artists and musicians owe their success to the power of computer technology. 

In sum, computers can have both positive and negative effects on people. It is essential to use them in the right way in order to take advantage of its benefits while minimizing its risks. 

Sincerely, 
[Your name]
