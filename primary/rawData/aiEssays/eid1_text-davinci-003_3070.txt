Dear Editor,

I am writing to voice my opinion on the effects computers have had on people. We now live in an age of technology where computers and smartphones have become a part of everyday life. While technology has been revolutionary, computers have had both positive and negative impacts on people.

On the bright side, computers have produced remarkable advancements in communication, education and research. They have allowed people to access an unimaginable amount of information, obtain advanced levels of education, and collaborate with others in real-time without ever meeting them in person.

However, there are a number of negative impacts computers have had on people. By their nature, computers are disrupting to the environment and have the potential to cause addiction, reduce productivity, and put users at risk of health hazards such as repetitive injuries or vision problems. Furthermore, the rapid advancement of technology has resulted in a digital divide and created a huge rift between those that are able to access computers and those that can't, indicative of our society's reliance on technology to educate and provide opportunity.

I believe that it is essential to focus on the positive effects computers have had on people while also raising awareness of the dangers associated with technology. People should be mindful of their increased dependency
