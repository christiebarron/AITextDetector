The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. But the project's developer, Boeing, was able to show off the plane's impressive wings, and most of the project's final price tags were under $500 million.

Forcing some people to pay to install additional weight, and reducing fuel consumption in the first half of the project from 90 miles per hour to over 200 miles per hour, it was only a matter of time until the Pentagon finally put up a huge enough barrier to get the $500 million back under way.

To meet the demand for the aircraft, it all came down to a big $1.54 million deal. Boeing decided that the only way the aircraft would hit the high-rise required in the second half of the project wasn't with massive new fuel tanks.

While the Pentagon's final price tag was estimated at 1.49 cents per gallon, the project did offer some nice cargo: the aircraft is about 5,500 pounds heavy, and weighs only 4.5 pounds when fully loaded.

The Boeing 787 Dreamliner was designed before the 9/11 attack, and was used to do one-man pilot training inside the Pentagon. In 2009, a plane on forgiving-use aircraft such as the 9/11 hijackers was found in the building.

"Our project is all about a pilot training and building," says Bob Jorgenson, president of the U.S. Department
