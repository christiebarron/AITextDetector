Dear Editor,

I am writing to you today to discuss the effects computers have on people and to persuade your readers to agree with me. In this day and age, computers and technology are everywhere. They have replaced much of the traditional way of carrying out daily tasks.

Computers provide an easy way for people to work, communicate, study and do other business. Many people use them to obtain information quickly or to make transactions. For example, it is becoming standard procedure to do almost all banking transactions over the Internet. As such, the use of a computer is essential and can’t be avoided in most cases.

However, there are also reasons to be concerned about computers. Constant use of computers can lead to people becoming too dependent on them. This can lead to people losing important skills such as basic mathematical and reading skills. It can also lead to health problems such as neck and back pain, headaches, and eye strain.

In addition, there is the risk of computers сontaining malicious viruses and software that could put our important data at risk of being stolen or corrupted. It is true that the risk of computer viruses has decreased in recent years, but it is still a problem.

I believe that computers have a positive impact on society overall, but there needs to be a balance. People should learn how to use computers responsibly and should not rely on them too heavily.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
