I used to work as a receptionist at a busy medical clinic. One day, a frail old man limped through the door. He told me that he had to wait to see the doctor for his monthly check-up, but that he was in a lot of pain. I explained to him that there was a long wait and that he would have to be patient. 

The man replied that he understood and that the pain would make the wait much more uncomfortable. Despite being in agony, he remained polite and waited calmly in the waiting area without any complaints. 

As people around him were getting irritated and restless at the long wait, he didn't waiver in his attitude. I was truly impressed by his display of patience and understanding. 

Eventually, after what felt like a long eternity, the man was called in by the doctor and I waved him off with a warm smile. It was a great reminder to me of the value of remaining patient, even when faced with difficult situations.
