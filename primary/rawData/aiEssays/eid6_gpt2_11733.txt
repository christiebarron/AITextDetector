The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

First, the building needed to meet building codes and regulations when construction of the structure began. After the Civil War, a series of ordinances were enacted in the 1920s that made it illegal to carry any sort of concealed-carry device. By the time they came into force, it was almost impossible to carry any device, according to the National Museum of the Civil War. That ban was later amended as the city sought to build a public light system.

There were several changes to state building codes and regulations in response to the end of the Civil War. The first came in 1935 when the city added a sign to sign those using a concealed-carry device. The sign had to be clearly outlined in order to be accepted by people who were not residents.

However, the city passed a similar ordinance by the following year. In 1931, the city was informed that it needed to sign off on the changes to its building codes. In the end, the city's new building code would simply not apply.

Finally, the Civil War ended after nearly a decade and only a matter of time â€“ in fact, the Civil War era ended about 35 years after the sign and the city started complying.

Although the Civil War ended after nearly a decade and only a matter of time, the Civil War era ended over 30 years after the American flag was lowered and raised during Confederate General General
