Dear Editor,

As technology continues to advance, computers have become increasingly prevalent in our lives. But the question we should be asking is what effect is this having on us as people?

Many people claim that technology can have negative impacts, such as increased stress, limited attention spans and loss of human connection. However, in my opinion, it is important to look at the other side of the issue.

Computers offer people endless opportunities to create, learn and collaborate. There is no shortage of tools and applications that allow us to discover new ideas, explore the world and develop relationships. In addition to this, computers can offer a great deal of support to people whose skills and resources may be limited.

We should also take into account how computers have simplified mundane tasks such as communication and shopping. This has allowed us to have more time to spend on the things we love to do.

Ultimately, I believe that the positives of computers far outweigh their negatives. We should not be quick to forget that these machines can have a positive influence on us as people.

Yours sincerely,

[Your Name]
