Dear Editor,

As technology advances, the use of computers has become more commonplace in our lives. While many people use computers in various aspects of their lives, not everyone is aware of the potential impact computers can have on people. 

First, the use of computers keeps people from interacting with each other in person. With the rise of online interactions, many people are choosing to communicate through email or text rather than face-to-face. This detachment can lead people to feel more isolated, which can have a negative impact on mental and physical health. 

Also, computers have the potential to disrupt normal sleeping patterns. Many people have difficulty tearing themselves away from their computer screens and later find themselves in a state of sleep deprivation. This could lead to serious physical and mental issues if left unchecked. 

Finally, the use of computers poses a danger of eyestrain. People can spend hours looking at a screen, and as a result, suffer from headaches, blurry vision, and dry eyes. 

Overall, I believe that the effects of computers on people can be both positive and negative depending on the userâ€™s behavior. We should all be aware of the drawbacks on our physical and mental health that so easily accompany the convenience of computers. 

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
