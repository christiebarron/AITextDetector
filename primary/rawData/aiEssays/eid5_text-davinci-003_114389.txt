From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, written by Narciso Rodriguez, is a memoir that narrates his life of growing up in an immigrant Latino family in New Jersey. Each chapter highlights elements from his life story that are reflective of many immigrant families' experiences; from his parent's ambitions and struggles to the recurrent themes of language, identity, and (im)migration. 

The memoir sets the atmosphere of Rodriguez's life before a single phrase is even spoken. Not only does it introduce the reader to a unique worldview that lingers in the unknown, but also has many implications that reveal a wider perspective. Rodriguez paints the snapshots of his life with vividness and a sense of belonging that frequently radiates from the characters themselves. This creates a warm, inviting mood that is often pervasive throughout the book.

By emphasizing the compassion and empathy between himself and his mother, Rodriguez conjures a feeling of intimacy that is sweetly comforting.
