The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho reflects the idea that life is cyclical, and although there may be difficult times, there will also be good times that come again. The hibiscus flower is a symbol of persistence and resilience as it is one of the few plants that can survive even in the harshest winter conditions. The protagonist's coming of age story can be seen as an analogy for the hibiscus, and the protagonist's promise to take the test again in the spring symbolizes hope and determination for a better future.
