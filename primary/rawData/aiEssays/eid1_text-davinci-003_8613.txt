My friend and I were chatting over beers at happy hour one evening, and were soon the only people left in the bar. We were laughing and sharing stories when suddenly the door opened and a gust of wind blew in, carrying a large pile of leaves with it. We were so surprised that we both cracked up – I couldn't help it – the sight was too bizarre! We started trying to shovel the leaves back out the door, but the wind kept sending them flying all over the place. Our laughter only got louder the more we tried to organize the pile, until eventually we just gave up and resigned ourselves to the mess.

Eventually the bar was filled with leafy hills and we had created a tunnel path to the door. It was a hilarious sight and we couldn't help it as we laughed at our accomplishment. We ended the night with a satisfied smile on our faces and memories of our funny adventure that night.
