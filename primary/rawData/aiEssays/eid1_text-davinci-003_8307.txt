I recently had to fly from Chicago to New York for a business trip. However, when I arrived at the airport I was told that my flight had been delayed due to bad weather. I was exasperated, as I had been looking forward to this trip for weeks, and I wanted to get to my destination as soon as possible. It would've been very easy to get frustrated, but instead I took a deep breath and stayed calm.

I kept reminding myself that these things happen sometimes, and all I could do was wait it out. So, I grabbed something to eat and grabbed a book to read until things were sorted out. 

After a few hours, I was informed that the flight was cancelled altogether due to bad weather. It was a huge aggravation, but I knew that there was nothing I could do, so I kept my patience and calmly worked with the airline to figure out a way to get to New York. 

In the end, they were able to arrange a connecting flight for me the following morning, so the delay was only a minor setback. Even though it was a frustrating situation, I was proud of myself for my patience, as it worked out well in the end.
