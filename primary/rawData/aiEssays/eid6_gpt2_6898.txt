The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. This would make the building less accessible to the public, and would have allowed for the building to move to the new location from which it was built. The new building is built on a former military base in Nangarhar, not far from Singapore. Although one would have expected the architects to be more careful using dirigibles, the fact that the builders built a large building in a very rural part of the state made them more willing to tackle them. In a report, the Federal Government noted that the new building was constructed with "good design [and] good technical know-how". The building is designed to be extremely light. Therefore, all dirigibles will require special construction, making it challenging to design a solution without it being too complex for a simple and quiet viewing experience. This is one of the challenges facing the project, with the two largest dirigibles ever built, a new building at the Federal Government Building and the recently completed Empire State building.

For the construction of a new building at the Empire State building, the first contractor was the Construction & Construction Department, which had completed the first of 4 construction workmen. As in some other countries where the size of the building can be compared between private companies employing different types of contractors, the construction worker would require a specialized experience and a combination of experience and skills. All of the contractors involved have taken the time and effort to
