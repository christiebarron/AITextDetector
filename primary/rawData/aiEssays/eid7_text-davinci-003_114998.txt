I remember the time when I was working in customer service and I had to answer a lot of questions from customers. One particular call was especially difficult as the customer was very agitated and was raising their voice to me. I felt like I was being verbally attacked by the customer so it was very difficult to stay calm. 

However, I decided to take deep breaths before responding to their questions and I remained patient throughout the entire conversation. I responded to the customer's questions calmly and politely and assured them that I was doing my best to help. After the call ended I felt very proud of myself for staying patient in such a difficult situation.
