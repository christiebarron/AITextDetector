The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it is still true to life despite changes in culture. No longer in touch with the realities of humanity in the modern age and the realities of politics or economics, we are on the brink of cultural extinction. The only hope for a survival of our species is to survive in this new phase of change and hope for a new civilization. Here, a new version of winter and a new time are at hand. That, too, I hope; my dream is to share the experience of winter and make time for an adventure once in a while. It is time for me to return to my country and to join a social circle.

If you are wondering why I would want to create a new time, that would be wonderful. Because in my youth my parents and grandparents watched as their children ate chocolate. They were able to say, "Yes, you can taste chocolate, but it could cause severe food poisoning." If there was indeed such danger, why do I want to create a time of peace? Because it will help me in my youth in any way I desire. I need a time of freedom and of liberty to find the way. If I areNext to die and end winter and begin something else, how can it be possible to hope for the safety of the country and to live a happy life? I want to live. And if what I am trying desperately for is not a nice thing, I will continue to try.
