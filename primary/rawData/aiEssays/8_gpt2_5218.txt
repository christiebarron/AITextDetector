One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was an 11-year-old when a man from the opposite sex ran into me and said, "I think you're making me look good. Your wife is getting the fuck out of your dick and that's probably not going to do you any good." And I said, "I thought you were going to be mad but I said, 'We're going to make a move, we need to do something else.' " There's always going to be a reaction.

"There's also when people are going down a rabbit hole."

The real thing about this new life isn't sex itselfâ€“it's love.

All that passion helps define your sexuality.
