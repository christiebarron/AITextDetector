Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. Some of the economic effects go unnoticed or unrecognized in the public mind. But for drivers, these minor changes in attitude might well be noticeable.

Here are three things that might not be perceived as big environmental influences in cyclists:

• More aggressive vehicles. In most cases the drivers will put up with much less noise.

• Fewer traffic volumes. Drivers who are more aggressive generally experience less noise.

• Increased street level congestion. In most cases those who make the most use of the roads will increase the road surface, making up only 1% of the road's surface area.

These factors can be seen in many important ways, such as:

• Traffic has increased and decreased in different regions of the country.

• Roads often don't have sufficient level crossings.

• Roads have deteriorated in the past and are not easily rebuilt.

These factors are the driver's own fault, not that of the road. However, they can be seen in the same way in the "Big Roads Ahead" campaign: there might be more to the situation as a result of "robust road widening" and road design that allows for more surface area and better intersections on the roads. By making road widening easier and allowing more light being used, the number of cyclists living in cities can be reduced in cities without major changes in traffic patterns.
