I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is an essential condition of preserving the integrity of our democracy and of the rule of law. The current system is one that uses excessive control for political censorship in the public sphere."

Some of the key ideas behind the bill, which passed the House this past week, and may soon pass the Senate, are:

• Open access to library information

• Government bodies with a clear mandate to provide access to its materials

• Open access to library material for all

• Open access to library material for all public service libraries

• Access to library material in all the libraries

• Information sharing for children with the public

• Access to library material in social welfare schools that are based at state universities

The bill will be passed in both houses of Congress and will be debated for the first time this year. It will be considered during the next legislative session, scheduled for May 18-20. A decision on the issue is likely by in November or December.
