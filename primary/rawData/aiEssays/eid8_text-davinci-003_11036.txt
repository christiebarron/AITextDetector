I'll never forget the moment I shared a laugh with my best friend for the first time. 

We had been friends for a couple of weeks, and that day we had gone out for coffee. I was telling her about a particularly embarrassing moment I had and how it always made me feel so embarrassed. She started nodding along and then it happened. She burst into laughter. I was so taken aback at first, because the story was so serious and it didn't seem like something that should be funny. But then, after a brief moment of shock, I began laughing too, and it felt so natural and freeing.

Since then, we laugh all the time. We laugh at the little moments, the funny things that each other say, the silly videos that I find online, or even the smallest of inside jokes. 

Most of all, I absolutely love the sound of her laughter because it is so unique and full of life. And no matter what else is happening in my world, her laughter never fails to make me forget all of my worries and fill me up with joy.
