Recently, there has been debate around the issue of censorship in libraries. This has been concentrated on whether or not certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. 

In a world with such a wide variety of diverse beliefs and perspectives, it is difficult to provide a unanimously accepted answer to this question. While some may suggest that freedom of speech should enable libraries to provide diverse perspectives without the risk of censorship, others may view certain materials as detrimental to their individual[s’] values and sense of safety. 

As such, I believe libraries should seek to balance the needs of their patrons while maintaining the principles of free speech. This means that libraries should, whenever possible, provide access to materials that reflect a variety of perspectives without disregarding the values of its patrons. 

To ensure the safety and values of their patrons, libraries should work with local communities to set reasonable standards by which library materials may be evaluated. This would allow libraries to provide access to materials that expand their patrons’ intellectual horizons without sacrificing their values and beliefs. 

By maintaining a diverse selection of materials while also respecting the beliefs of its patrons, libraries can serve to break down communication barriers and help foster a sense of understanding and civil conversation. In the event that some materials are deemed offensive, such as in cases of blatant racism or hate speech, these books should be removed from circulation.
