Across the nation, libraries have become the center of a debate on censorship. The question remains whether certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.

Critics of censorship believe libraries are supposed to provide access to knowledge and information, therefore allowing individuals to make informed decisions for themselves. Furthermore, it has been argued that censorship in libraries sets a dangerous precedent in that it limits free speech and expression.

On the other side of the debate, proponents of censorship believe it is the role of library staff to ensure that the materials they provide are suitable for all patrons. Even parents who are unable to monitor their childâ€™s exposure to objectionable materials can have peace of mind knowing that the library has taken measures to protect younger visitors from potentially harmful material.

In my view, censorship should not be the solution for individuals uncomfortable with what libraries have to offer. Rather, libraries should provide an open and cooperative environment where patrons can discuss controversial material and get alternative points of view. Libraries also should continue to provide access to a variety of materials and use age ratings to ensure that children are not exposed to inappropriate material.

At the end of the day, libraries should remain open forums for circulation of knowledge and information. This can only be achieved if libraries continue to maintain open policies of free access to not only mainstream, but also to controversial material.
