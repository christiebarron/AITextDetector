An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a friend of mine from Virginia. She's an actress, but was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I read the news, and I was not so sure when she would return home that morning. The psychiatrist put me on buprenorphine and called me. She said, "What is it?" I told her that I was bipolar and she said, "It means you have bipolar disorder." She said, "Oh, yeah, it means bipolar disorder." I thought about them for a few seconds, and then took the prescribed anti-bipolar medication and she took a few days off. Over the next few months I would suffer more than 10 times more seizures. I felt worse during the entire period. My only hope was to try and stop medication altogether. A few weeks would pass and then finally come down and the doctor would tell me, "Don't worry. This medication just works and it's fine. Try again soon."
