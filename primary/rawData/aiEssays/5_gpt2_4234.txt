The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' by its author is different than the previous story or series. The author sees the book as an important piece of work that informs his own life. It is often a story about love and loss for each other. A man has lost a sister but his brother believes his sister's death, when she was 10 years old, could have put a halt to this. She was the oldest and still lived in her parents' home and thought her father 'had a son'. A mother and wife must look after each other and have sex. In the book 'The End of the Road' they take each other on their journey as they seek out a new life. Both of them have had success; both are at their best when they live up to their own expectations for themselves.

Another aspect of this story is the fact that there is a love-hate relationship between the two characters. Despite the intense love-hate, it seems that everyone seems to live their lives on the lowest possible possible levels of love. It's not really about love and there are no words to express this for now. In the end it's not a book about that. The book simply expresses a love that can only be expressed by one person.
