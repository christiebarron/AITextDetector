The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it concludes with a message that should be seen as a moral imperative:

The time has come to take back the memories of the innocent, to recognize that what the world had been like before became impossible to return. This will not be easy. For if in the end there are no more of us, there will be no of the children and grandchildren they loved. I am trying to take back my own.

I guess I'm not as bad as they say.
