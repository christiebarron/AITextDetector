An example of a time someone in my life was patient was after a patient got pregnant or had a heart attack who is too poor to work. I remember that doctor saying that in any health care setting they have to be there if this person was going to get treated, and that was all done in the hospital before the patient got pregnant. This was the reason why, in my experience, I was always on a very slow clock. I was constantly sitting in the nurse's chair because I wasn't sure what was going on. I never thought twice about it, and it made for really emotional and even personal and well loved conversations between patients. I think I had an amazing relationship with those people, and I have now experienced many things with them too. I also think we were all friends growing up. My dad was one of the leading psychiatrists in Europe and I remember how when he was an infant I would sit there and talk to some of those people. I would just see these beautiful people in their late twenties with this beautiful young doctor sitting on a chair and being patient.

I am almost 50 years old, and I am really, really proud of these girls who are trying to go to great things. I was born after that, and I wish that my parents would do the same. When people are trying to go through this, in my opinion it's always better to do them justice rather than trying to do them harm. I feel like I have to help people with this,
