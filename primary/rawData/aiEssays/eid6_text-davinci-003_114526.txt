The Empire State Building has had a long and interesting history, having been built as a symbol of economic power and an engineering feat. A significant part of this history revolves around its 1933 plans for the worldâ€™s first purpose-built mooring mast for dirigibles. While the plans for such an innovation were ambitious, the obstacles that the builders faced in allowing dirigibles to dock were significant.

The first obstacle that the builders had to overcome was the challenge of building a mast which could handle the weight of the large airships. Dirigibles of the time were very large structures, and the mooring mast had to be strong enough to hold them. To achieve this, the Empire State Building team was forced to design and create a 690-foot-tall steel structure, which provided a secure foundation for the airships to safely land and be diverted away from the building itself.

The second obstacle involved designing the mast so that it was specifically designed to accommodate dirigibles. To do this, engineers needed to create a specialized docking platform which had a hollow, cylindrical shape that was perfectly adapted to the contours of the airships. This unique design allowed the mast to act as a funnel for the dirigible, allowing the structure of the airship to fit into the dock perfectly.

The third obstacle was the challenging task of creating an environment that was safe for the crew of the dirigibles, given the volatile combination of
