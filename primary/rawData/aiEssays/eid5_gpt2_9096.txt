The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' was not one of shock, shock, disbelief or awe or joy, but rather the fact that, for its first six hours, its tone and character could be described as inextricably bound together to a larger truth, a greater truth or truth that could be interpreted and conveyed. As well as being open to the possible interpretation and use of this narrative framework, the book also offers an accessible, nuanced and fully grounded approach to its characters for readers of both gender and sexuality, as well as for those of many identities and experiences. While 'From Home' was still largely a novel, it was also the first time in British fiction that readers were able to relate to a novel, or to see the book in other languages and cultures, even in English.
