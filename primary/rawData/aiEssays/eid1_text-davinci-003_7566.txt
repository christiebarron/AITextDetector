The ending of Winter Hibiscus serves to not only bring a sense of closure to the story, but to emphasize the importance of the hibiscus plant as a symbol of hope for protagonist Dani. The phrase “then I will take that test again” serves as a reminder that no matter what challenges and obstacles Dani may face, he will find the strength to endure if he continues to maintain his determination and confidence. By associating his ability to overcome his struggles with the return of the hibiscus in the spring, Minfong Ho is suggesting that Dani's struggle is universal and that hope can be a powerful agent for perseverance.
