My mom and I have always had a special bond. We've been through a lot of life's ups and downs together, and no matter what, have always managed to make each other laugh.

One day, we decided to go on a roadtrip to visit my grandparents. We had been planning it for months, and had prepared snacks, directions, and a great playlist. But my mom and I always took extra delight in going off-roading when we were out and about, and within minutes of hitting the highway, we were lost among the backroads. 

At first, we were a little frustrated, especially since neither of us could remember the last time we had gone this way. We both started to get a bit snappy with each other, until eventually we just had to laugh. We started to joke about how inevitably, we always end up going the wrong way when we travel, and how it's surprising we had made it this far without any more detours. After a few minutes of laughing together, we found our sense of direction again and eventually found our way to my grandparents'. 

The whole car ride was full of jokes, laughter, and stories, and we made it to our destination with huge smiles on our faces. It was the laughter that really kept us going and helped us get through this roadtrip.
