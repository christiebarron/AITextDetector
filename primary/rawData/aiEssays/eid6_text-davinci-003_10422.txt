The building of the Empire State Building was a remarkable undertaking, but it did not come without its barriers. One of the main obstacles faced by designers of the building was the incorporation of dirigibles — large passenger-carrying airships — into the building’s structure. This idea of allowing dirigibles to dock was proposed by the building's developer, Alfred Smith, which, if successful, would make the Empire State Building a marvel of modern engineering and design.

Developers faced several challenges in creating a structure capable of allowing dirigibles to dock. Most significantly, the size of the dirigibles at the time created the need for a sturdy mooring mast. To ensue the safety of the passengers and the ship, the mooring mast had to be designed with extremely high safety standards—the mast needed to be strong enough to bear the weight of the dirigible and withstand strong winds and turbulence. As a result, metal was chosen as the primary material for this mast, and its diameter was designed with measurements close to that of an elevator shaft.

In addition to the heavy engineering requirements of the mooring mast, architects of the Empire State Building needed to account for the location of the mast on the top of the building. The mast also had to be placed far away from the propellers, turbines, and other aircraft in order to reduce noise. This limited the developers to small areas on the 114th and 116th floors. Moreover
