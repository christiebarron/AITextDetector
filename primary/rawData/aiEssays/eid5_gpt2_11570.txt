The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' by the former British Prime Minister Blair has changed in the wake of these latest revelations.

Caught between personal politics and personal reality, Mr Blair, who is under house arrest following allegations of child sexual abuse, writes the memoir in response to allegations he was sexually abused by some of the world's brightest young women with whom he had a child.

But in writing, the former Conservative leader is also writing "The Boy in the Hood", a damning book of accusations that he was sexually abused by a teenage girl with whom he had a child who was also born.

He reveals he has had sex with more than 200 men and women and has even been called a "savior".

One of Mr Blair's former wives, and atone for his alleged sexual abuse of a young young school boy in the summer of 2008, was his sister-in-law Lynne Blair.

"My husband's story is that after he was sexually abused as a child I had the opportunity to meet some of my own close friends who didn't want to be associated with those names," says Mr Blair in the latest memoir.

"I had never once encountered a single friend or family member who was anything resembling a perfect good and I had never witnessed such a life-affirming, joyous act of self-reflection by someone who worked to protect and fulfil such a profound and profound responsibility to me.
