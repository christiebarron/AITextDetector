Dear Editor: 

In today's world, computers are no longer perceived as a convenience —they’ve become an absolute necessity, especially in light of the ongoing pandemic. Despite its many advantages, the expansive use of these high-tech devices has had many negative consequences on society and humanity as a whole.

For starters, it has become increasingly easy for people to disconnect from reality, each other, and themselves. While technological advancements have allowed us to easily use digital tools to interact with one another, people often feel isolated or misunderstood when engaging in online conversations, leading to feelings of depression or anxiety. Additionally, computers have made it easier for people to cheat and plagiarize, leading to a deterioration of a sense of personal integrity.

Moreover, the overreliance on technology has harmed cognitive reasoning skills such as problem-solving, as people are more likely to rely on computers for solutions than apply commonsense or basic logic. In addition, the vast amount of time people spend hours behind screens can lead to poor posture, eyestrain, and other physical complications. 

Fortunately, the issue of overreliance on computers is easily solvable. By reducing our screen-time, engaging in healthy conversations with those around us, and diverting our focus away from brightly lit screens, we can easily begin to see the benefits of technology without the harm.

Hopefully, this letter will help to shed some light on the negative effects of technology,
