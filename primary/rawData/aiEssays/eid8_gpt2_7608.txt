One time I experienced laughter in my life was when it was too late.

I knew I wanted to create something. In the beginning, it was a huge challenge to be on the team.

It was difficult to maintain a good record. In our early days, we had to focus on training and the preparation time.

At the end of one long season or in between, I always thought, "How am I going to perform in that role in time? How is a manager to deal with that pressure?"

Then it happened and I was happy. With some effort, I can manage in this role for as long as I want to.

I started to think seriously about the future: what we could do that would become a reality in terms of working with top teams or just playing the game for the fans. I started to think of that long term, so it might happen sooner rather than later.

But my time has since ended. My future is up in the air now. The time may also turn into a distant future, if other players have a chance to participate in the team.

I hope my dream is complete.

I hope for the best, even if it means working for one last contract with Bayern.
