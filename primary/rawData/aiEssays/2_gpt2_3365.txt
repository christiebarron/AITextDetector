"To be clear, that a library's'speech' or 'book' is only a book you read or listen to is a book I'm going to review. I don't want to censor my work if I can and I'm open for that to be protected as well. I believe (that) this is a good way to promote freedom because it could stop bullying and it could help promote dialogue and discussion amongst those who live with autism. A few hours from here is when you'll know for yourselves.

"The only way to stop those who wish to manipulate our culture of ideas and freedoms and to stop people from doing so is to speak out against bullying and discrimination and to take actions that will change a community."

In a letter to the minister, former Liberal MP Scott Emerson labelled the bill "inexplicable," saying it was "part of a broader government effort to destroy our community" and he was concerned it was "more than just about banning children".

The legislation was first introduced by former Liberal leader Brian Mulroney, who previously told Fairfax News: "This has a profound and tragic impact on communities around the country. The changes which will be needed in the medium term are important and will ultimately help to prevent similar incidents like this."
