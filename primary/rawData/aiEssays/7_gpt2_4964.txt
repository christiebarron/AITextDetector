An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when she met another one with the same exact name, both very strong emotional traits, but much later to my surprise a person I was working with was her brother-in-law, "Cheryl" who had been to my first two wedding ceremonies.

They would be getting ready for the wedding and when we got on the bus we sat down, grabbed our things and waited for her to get back on the bus to the restaurant. He had left about 3 hours before we would see eachother and he was already back in there at about 9:30 in the morning.
