In Joe Kurmaski’s short story “Rough Road Ahead”, the cyclist’s journey is full of hazards. From the outset, the setting creates a sense of immediate danger and foreboding. The weather is oppressive, described as "sweltering" with "stifling humidity". The road is “narrow” with “giant boulders” and “tiny stones”. This makes it challenging for the cyclist, who is already struggling for breath and balance. The narrow road is a metaphor for the cyclist’s own struggles: the difficulty of navigating the forbidding terrain representing the personal obstacles he is trying to overcome in order to reach his destination.

The setting also affects the cyclist’s mental state. The oppressive heat and difficult road cause both fear and fatigue; he is constantly aware of the dangers around him - perceived or real - and his exhaustion is compounded by the need to constantly be on alert. The shadows of the trees expand as night falls, further contributing to the feeling of dread the cyclist experiences.

Throughout the story, the setting reflects and enhances the cyclist's emotional state. From the oppressive heat to the treacherous roads, the cyclist’s journey is filled with obstacles, both physical and psychological. It is these struggles that drive the narrative, forcing the protagonist to confront his own weaknesses and ultimately determine his own fate.
