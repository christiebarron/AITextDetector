An example of a time someone in my life was patient was for me to talk about their struggles or experiences and they kept saying 'I've got a lot of work to do', and I wanted to talk about being gay. I didn't have a lot in my time that year. They would walk away, and I'd say 'oh my gosh how have you said it to friends?' and they'd say 'yeah it was so funny, but we didn't talk about it to each other for eight weeks'. I'd say 'you think that doesn't make sense then'.

My therapist worked with me for one set. We'd spend a day together. He helped me write up some letters and asked me to stay at his house. I liked my writing because I was a huge literary fan. Then he would say 'well he wanted to come to my house and we'd look at this beautiful place' but the reality is when you're in therapy and have these big life issues it's hard to keep track of your writing and how it works too. People have their own issues and it takes their time learning to work through those. So he encouraged me that if I did write in a positive and helpful way then I'd end up in therapy. It was a great feeling to come here and be this big help for people I cared for and I hope that as I grow my writing skills will grow with me, because I know that it's one of the most rewarding things in
