The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building as there were a few major safety and engineering issues that needed to be resolved. In Marcia Amidon Lüsted's book The Mooring Mast, she outlines the history of the Empire State Building's daring endeavor to be the first building in the world to allow dirigibles to moor.

The most significant obstacle was the technical problem of providing a secure method of tying down the airships. This was a particularly challenging issue as the airships were super-light, and it was difficult to design a system that could maintain a secure hold without damaging the vessel. As Lüsted explains, the engineers came up with an “original solution: the creation of a mooring mast from the top of the Empire State Building.”  The mooring mast was equipped with a platform from which the airships could moor and it ran seventy-five feet down the side of the building, making it one of the tallest masts in the world. This solution worked, and after a demonstration with a Navy mock-up dirigible, it was deemed a success.

Another obstacle was the tight regulations put in place by aviation authorities. At the time, aviation laws prohibited the landing of airships on buildings. To help overcome this issue, the Empire State Building needed to be given special permission by the Civil Aeronautics Authority, as
