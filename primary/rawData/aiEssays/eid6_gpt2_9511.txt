The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The Empire State Buildings, like many of the iconic buildings at the time, were built as an experiment to allow people to take part in activities like theater, photography, and public art. In the years immediately following World War II, numerous building projects that offered the potential for interactive entertainment and educational learning took place at the Empire State Building.

In 1966, a team of five California steel workers, led by engineer Henry F. Cate, created the New York City Opera House, which was constructed just after World War II. Over the next 20 years, American opera industry had grown up around the building and the production of opera was popular. The opera house proved to be the best performer at any event from the 1960s to the 1980s in New York City. To create a permanent live theatre that was not only a major part of the nation's economic future, the opera house offered a public space to participate in activities with other people who saw it as providing entertainment for a living. At the end of that long time, the building had nearly double the number of public events annually, having performed more than 10,000 times as many performances. In 1970, an ad hoc team of eight Boston and Los Angeles opera houses purchased the building because it provided a perfect location for its performances.

Although the Empire State Building was soon home to numerous opera organizations, the building remained a national symbol to watch in
