The builders of the Empire State Building faced a multitude of obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In “The Mooring Mast,” Marcia Amidon Lüsted outlines some of the issue engineers and architects had to consider in this endeavor. 

The first obstacle was the size and weight of dirigibles. Dirigibles were incredibly large, and to dock one accurately meant that engineers had to account for varying wind speeds and directions. This was difficult to predict with the skyscraper’s height at a staggering 1,250 feet, making it difficult for dirigibles to simply stay aloft that high. 

In addition, the design of the building was not well suited for docking. The main mast for the cable car was on the 80th floor, well above the recommended 90th floor. The mast needed to be placed at that height to prevent the dirigibles from turning in circles and getting hit by the edges of the Empire State Building if strong winds pushed them off course. 

Further obstacles included the structural integrity of the building and the safety of the commuters. The building itself had to be reinforced to bear the weight of the ships, and the cable car had to be secure enough that the ships wouldn’t send it to plummet to the streets below. The Empire State Building designers and engineers had to consider how different ships could damage the building’s walls and windows, as the ships hovered
