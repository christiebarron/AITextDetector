The last line of the poem is meant to provide a sense of hope for the narrator as they reflect on the cold and seemingly hopeless winter. By associating the test with renewal symbolized by the return of the geese and the budding of the hibiscus, the narrative creates a sense of optimism and the belief that the narrator will be able to conquer their exam the second time around. The imagery used also serves to remind the reader that spring and summer will come again, no matter how harsh the winter may be.
