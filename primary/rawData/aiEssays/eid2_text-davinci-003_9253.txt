In today's world, censorship in libraries is a hot-button issue. While some advocates standpoint to protect certain people from being exposed to certain materials, there are staunch opponents who believe in free-flow of information. While both arguments are founded in ethical concerns, I am firmly in the latter camp who believes in open access and the power of librarians to provide balanced resources.

Libraries are one of the most valuable institutions in the world. They champion free-flow of information and unite the public in a mutual education. When censorship is imposed, it becomes an indirect form of censorship that limits the access of materials even to consenting adults.

More often than not, those materials that some people find offensive may contain crucial information that may turn the tide of opinion on certain topics. True education comes when readers are exposed to a wide range of ideas. Librarians are trained to provide resources that are balanced to different points of view. Therefore, with the guidance of a qualified professional, individuals may choose to access these materials on their own premises.

Censorship in libraries also contradicts the idea of a college library or any open-access library. Without the ability to access different materials, learning and research is limited. Clearly, censorship in libraries undermines the basic purpose of libraries as focal points of education and information. If people are not able to access the information they want, the library becomes useless.

In conclusion, censorship in libraries is a terrible idea.
