The memoir ‘From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives’ by Narciso Rodriguez is an intimate and personal reflection into the fashion designer's life. Written in a conversational style, it is as if Rodriguez is just telling us his story in real-time, inviting us along on his journey.

The mood of the memoir is one of nostalgia as it takes us through Rodriguez’s early life growing up in Newark, New Jersey. The sense of nostalgia is perhaps most fitting for Rodriguez's family origins and his personal connection to his Cuban heritage. Throughout the memoir, we experience the warmth and love Rodriguez has for his family, both old and new. With vivid descriptions of his memories, we can almost feel the heat of summer days in New Jersey and we can almost smell the Cuban flavors of his Grandmother’s kitchen. We also feel the uncomfortable tension building between Rodriguez and his family and the joy of his happy memories as he creates his own path within the fashion industry.

The memoir creates an air of warmth, understanding, and calmness; a sense that it is going to be okay. This is not a memoir that seeks to draw attention to the negatives in Rodriguez’s life, instead it seeks to focus on the positives in his life, even when times are tough. Rodriguez’s appreciation for the art, beauty, and designs that shaped his life shines through in the pages and reminds readers that we all have our own story.
