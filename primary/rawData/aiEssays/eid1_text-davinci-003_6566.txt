Dear Editor,

As technology advances, computers have become an essential part of our daily lives. But the effects that computers have on people are just as important as their convenience. 

It is true that computers can make our daily lives easier in many aspects. For example, we can communicate with people around the world through the internet, and research and work can be done much more conveniently. However, if we’re not careful, computers can also be a negative influence. Computers have a habit of distracting us, leading to decreased productivity if we don’t focus on the task at hand.  

In addition, relying too heavily on computers makes our ability to think critically and creatively decrease. We become entirely dependent on Google or whatever search engine we use to answer all of our questions. We lose our ability to think for ourselves and instead search for the answers. 

For this reason, I believe it is important to use computers only when necessary. We should take breaks away from screens and use our skills that make us unique and able to think for ourselves. We should also take advantage of all the good computers have to offer—convenience and expanded communication—but recognize that too much reliance can have serious consequences.

Thank you for your time,

[Your Name]
