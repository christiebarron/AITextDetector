As long as there are other drivers to lean on, they can enjoy the comfort of being away from the track, and the chance to experience theverting or other road conditions which lead to more road accidents, on the other hand. That being said, it's important to note that all drivers are responsible for their own safety decisions based on their particular environment, and that it's essential to have the right level of training to ensure maximum success at racing level.

There are two factors that contribute to the use in racing of tyre-based helmets. The first is that tyre conditions change during the course of race, as well as on the circuit. As each race develops, there is more tyre-related data to be collected to better understand how the tyres perform in each situation. With increasing tyre density in the road, as more tyre applications are applied and tyres are put into longer tyres, the chance to wear the tyres decreases. Therefore the use of
