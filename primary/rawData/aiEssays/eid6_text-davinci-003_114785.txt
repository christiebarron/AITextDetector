The Empire State Building and its iconic history as a symbol of New York has been intertwined with dirigibles since it first opened in 1931. The original building was designed to include a mooring mast on its 86th story rooftop, which was meant to allow airships to dock at the building. As detailed in Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s The Mooring Mast, the Empire State Building was an architectural marvel of its time. Despite the ambitious design of the building and the daring prospect of having dirigibles dock at the skyscraper, there were many obstacles that the builders had to face in order to achieve their goal. 

The first challenge for the builders was technological. At the time, the technology to moor airships to buildings was not available. A docking mast had to be specially designed, and this was no easy feat. Engineers had to figure out how to rig a steel cable, which had to be extraordinarily strong to support the airships, to the building and create a mechanism to reel in the dirigibles with the greatest of precision. The mooring mast, which would eventually be completed in 1931, was designed to be two hundred feet tall with four pairs of steel arms that could pivot in two directions.

The second obstacle was more involved with transportation. The mast that was created had to be tested. However, due to the fact that there already were airfields around New York City, it was illegal for dirigibles
