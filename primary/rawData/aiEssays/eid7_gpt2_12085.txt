An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the story of my daughter in college and my grandmother just walked into that house and it was cold outside, soitation was going on. I was actually standing a few feet away from her house. I thought she said, oh I'm so cold upstairs, and then it was cold outside, so I went running to the bathroom and looked up but nobody had ever seen me come up that far.

I told her why, and she said yes — and that is how there was an ice bath being done upstairs where I had never done that before. But you saw that, because I was sitting there and she was looking straight at me, I said, ok I'm sorry. She said you know he thought it was really cold outside.

I was also there for the day. If I'm out with some ice cream and the weather is OK, I'm there. I'm going to the restaurant to hang out and make dinner and eat food.

My book is collecable to about 4 ½ pints of ice cream a day, which is almost double the amount I've ever made. I've been able to enjoy so much more of the ice cream than a week or two ago. I had no real plan when I came along.

Now, I don't know if you recall that there was talk about the Chicago Ice Cream Association about raising a conference to demand that any ice cream factories be held
