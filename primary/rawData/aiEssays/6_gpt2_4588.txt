The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

One reason was a ban on full-body air fresheners that can be purchased for less than $30. In response, the Federal Aviation Administration issued an order for all commercial air cargo including helicopters and planes from May 2, 2010 to February 27, 2014. They could only sell the air fresheners to people for only $30.

It turns out that the FAA can still allow dirigibles on commercial airplanes from now for less than $40. A U.S. Customs and Border Protection report on Jan. 13, 2013 examined two cases of commercial air cargo docking that were conducted for less than $30, said Christopher A. Green, a deputy inspector general at the customs agency in Tucson.

Green said they were not "necessarily designed to be used by air travelers, but instead required to be in service if possible."

A Customs and Border Protection investigation has found that about 90 percent of the docking occurs for commercial planes, but not for a drone. At the height of the market, the FAA and other authorities conducted a number of inspections with helicopters and aircraft used for civil aviation. After that, the FAA began installing new scanners. Most pilots on the market now have the best of both worlds.

A second problem is that it's not common for air service passengers to be scanned separately from the drone while it's in flight, Green said.
