I recently had to help someone move into a new house. We had only one day to get the entire house set up and move all of the boxes and furniture. I was getting frustrated as the day was coming to an end and we were still not done, but I reminded myself to stay patient. 

The day had been a long one, and I was starting to get hungry and tired. I could tell the person I was helping was getting exhausted, too. We were both doing as much as we could, but it wasn't enough. I suggested that we take a few minutes to rest and eat something before getting back at it. 

At first, the person I was helping was hesitant, but after a few moments she agreed. She later thanked me for understanding how tired she was, and that it was nice to have a break. 

After our break, we finished up the rest of the packing and moving. We even had time to explore the new house together. 

It certainly wasn't easy to stay patient that day, but I'm glad I did. It allowed us to finish in time and it also allowed the person I was helping to feel taken care of.
