I remember a time when I was stuck in traffic. After being on the road for what seemed like hours – time had started to feel like it was standing still – I was starting to grow impatient with the snarled traffic. People had even started to get out of their cars to see what was going on.

Rather than grow frustrated, I decided to take a different approach and just be patient. After all, it wasn’t like there was anything I could do to make the traffic move faster. I decided to turn up the music in my car and use the extra time to meditate.

I kept this mindset for the remainder of the trip, and it worked wonders. Before I knew it, the traffic cleared and I was at my destination in no time. 

This experience taught me that having patience is far more powerful than frustration when dealing with difficult situations. Patience allows us to remain calm in the face of uncertainty.
