In Joe Kurmaski’s short story “Rough Road Ahead,” the features of the setting have a significant affect on the cyclist, Angus. The story is set in a remote location, likely in the Canadian wilderness. The terrain is rugged and the roads are mostly unpaved, making the cycling conditions difficult. Angus is forced to climb steep hills, ride through muddy patches, and dodge stones, potholes, and other obstacles. The darkness and wetness of the night make the situation even worse, creating a sense of dread and danger.

The setting also adds tension to the story. Angus has only a flashlight to guide him, and bedding down in the wild is an intimidating prospect. Between the cold, the darkness, and the possibility of danger from wild animals, there is a sense of threat and suspense. Angus is tired and alone, and the sense of isolation enhances the feeling of menace.

The elements present in the setting not only challenge Angus physically, but they also provide an emotional and psychological obstacle. His dogged determination and will to survive add depth to the story, as does his ability to endure despite the difficult conditions. The rough terrain adds an additional challenge that reflects Angus’ internal struggle and determination- he must push himself to the brink in order to achieve his goal. 

Ultimately, the features of the setting prove essential in creating the dramatic arc of the story and serving as a metaphor for Angus’ growth.
