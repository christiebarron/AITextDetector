I was running late for an appointment the other day and, as usual, my mind was all over the place. I had a million things on my plate, and I was hurrying to be on time when I got to the office and the receptionist told me to wait. I was so impatient and frustrated, but I was able to take a deep breath to calm down.

I reminded myself that getting angry and pushing everyone was not going to get me anywhere. Instead, I decided to practice being patient. I was aware that the staff was swamped and doing everything they could to attend to every patient quickly.

I took a few moments to meditate and do some breathing exercises. It helped a lot to stop worrying and just enjoy the waiting period. As I waited for my appointment, I opened a book and immersed into a new world, allowing time to pass without noticing it.

Eventually, the receptionist was able to provide an update on my appointment and I was glad to see that I was going to get the care I needed. I had learned an important lesson about being patient - it doesn't just help others, but it can help us transcend difficult situations and be calmer and more mindful.
