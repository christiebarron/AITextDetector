Dear Editor:

I am writing to express my opinion on the impact that computers have on people’s lives. It is undeniable that computers have revolutionized the way we work, communicate, and access information. However, I also believe that their increased use has had negative consequences for people on both physical and psychological levels.

The use of computers has caused an increase in cases of eyestrain, neck pain and bad posture. It is nearly impossible to get up to stretch and move around to prevent these problems without sacrificing productivity, as research has proven. As a result, working marathon sessions on a computer has become commonplace in many workplaces and homes, often leading to sleep deprivation and stress.

Moreover, computers have changed the way we interact with each other socially by isolating us into our own little worlds, and from the physical social environments that used to nurture meaningful relationships. Overusage of computers can also be linked to depression and decreased motivation due to lack of social interaction and physical activity.

It is clear that computers have a negative effect on people’s physical and mental health and social-interaction. Thus, it is important for us to remember to take regular break, to get outside and interact with people, and to practice healthy computer-usage habits.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
