Dear Editor,

I write with regards to your recent article discussing the effects of computers on people. In this age of ubiquitous technology, it’s important to consider both the pros and cons of an increased dependence on computers.

It’s undeniable that computers have provided us with countless advantages. In an age when knowledge is accessible at the touch of a button, we now have access to a wealth of information. The internet provides us with opportunities to communicate with each other, shop, and stay connected with the world at large. It has also revolutionized the way in which we work, allowing us to work remotely and make money from the comfort of our homes.

At the same time, it’s important to address the potential downfalls of computer usage. Computers can be isolating if we spend too much time interacting with them instead of other people. It also increases our risk of cybercrime, as well as the potential for mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and addiction.

Overall, I feel that the benefits of computer usage outweigh the drawbacks. However, it is important that we are conscious of the potential risks, and take steps to protect ourselves from excessive computer usage.
