To the Editor, 

As technology continues to make its presence felt, computers have become an integral part of life. Though computers have eliminated mundane tasks and enabled us to be more efficient, one cannot ignore the fact that their presence has brought several impacts – both positive and negative – on people’s lives.

On the plus side, computers have enhanced our ability to process information quickly. It has allowed us to access information quickly, thus freeing up time to focus on other activities. Computers have also created an opportunity for connecting with people globally, making it easier for us to stay informed about what is happening around the world. In addition, computers often make work faster and easier, allowing us to achieve more in less time.

On the flip side, extended and excessive use of computers can have a negative effect on human health and behaviour. It can lead to social isolation and decreased physical activity, as people spend more time sitting in front of computers than engaging in physical activity. Overuse of computers has also been linked to mental health issues such as stress, eye strain, and fatigue. 

Ultimately, computers are essential to modern life. However, we need to be mindful of the potential negative impacts of overusing them and take steps to moderate our usage. It is crucial that we understand the power of computers and use it for the enhancement of our lives rather than allowing it to control us.
