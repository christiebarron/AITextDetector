The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho is symbolic of the main character's journey through the poem. She has endured a hard winter and faced many difficulties in her life, but she has remained resilient and she still hopes for a better future. Her comparison of the hard winter to a difficult test implies that she has grown and learned from the experience. She is ready for a new beginning and a new opportunity to take the test again when spring returns. The imagery of the snow melting, geese returning, and hibiscus budding is a reminder that despite the difficulty she faced, nature is ever-changing and will eventually bring her new opportunities.
