The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many obstacles when it came to allowing dirigibles to dock. The idea of a docking ability for dirigibles was woven into the Architecture from the very start. When construction began in 1929, the planners saw the potential benefits of allowing airships such as the Graf Zeppelin or the Hindenburg to dock safely at their building. However, the task of turning that dream into reality was far from easy.

First and foremost, the height of the building was daunting. The highest mast cumulated 81 stories at the rooftop. Keeping this in mind, the builders had to factor in the mooring mast which had to be higher than the building itself by around 20 feet. This meant that the mooring mast had to be 101 stories or 1,248 feet up, which presented a challenge as it was so high up.

Second, the question of creating a strong structure faced the builders. The mooring mast had to be strong enough to not only hold the weight of the dirigibles, but also withstand the powerful winds high up at such an altitude. Engineers had to work diligently to create a special type of wind bracing. This created a steel structure that could not only withstand the winds but also support the weight of the airships.

Third, an access route presented a huge obstacle for the Empire State Building builders. In order to dock the dirigibles, a route of access had to
