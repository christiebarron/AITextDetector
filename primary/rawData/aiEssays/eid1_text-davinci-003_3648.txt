Dear Editor, 

I'm writing to you today to share my opinion on the effects of computers on people in today's world. A lot of people are concerned about the potential harms, such as addiction and isolation, computers may introduce. However, I believe that computers provide individuals with many more benefits than what they take away. 

First, computers have made the world smaller by increasing our access to knowledge. Now, anyone can explore information, ideas and cultures from any part of the world. Education has been made much more widely and easily available and anyone has the chance to get any amount of knowledge with just a few clicks. Furthermore, people have access to countless resources which allow them to explore hobbies, self-taught skills and new hobbies that were so hard to obtain or even, not possible. 

On top of that, computers are a great way for people to stay connected. Communication has never been easier with an infinite amount of ways to connect with others, such as e-mails, apps, social media, online forums and more. This way, it's much easier to get your thoughts and emotions out and connect with the people who matter. 

The benefits of computers don't stop there. One of the greatest advantages of technology is the access it provides to entertainment. Whether it's movies, music, books, art, or even video games, computers facilitate access to many forms of leisure and can even help to relieve stress.
