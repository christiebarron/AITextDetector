Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. The first is its importance for all users to identify the appropriate road for them to drive across, or how well a particular street will fit one to its character. This has two points, one on the road to follow, and the other at the junction with the street. Each has its own set of issues – one of which is whether the bike is travelling at the level of the road, or it can safely drive through – and it's difficult to assess either on its own. 'Rough Road Ahead' is the most useful setting because it gives users the option to set up an intermediate path without a traffic signal, or with the bike in the correct situation. This may be a good idea if you expect the cyclists to drive at very high speeds, or when travelling at an angle, but is hard to tell if a route is too narrow, where there won't be space between the vehicle and parked space, or where the signal is off and the cyclist will go very slowly or too rapidly. Most users will have never driven a bicycle before, but this is something they understand. It is possible that a 'Rough Road Ahead' setting is already here if they have a few extra years planning ahead, but this is simply not a real-world issue.
