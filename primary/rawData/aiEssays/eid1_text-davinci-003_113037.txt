Dear Editor,

As technology advances, the use of computers has rapidly become a norm in today's world. They are a valuable tool for businesses and have revolutionized how we communicate. But the effects computers have on people, specifically their physical and psychological health, must be acknowledged. I am writing to bring to your attention how severe these consequences can be.

Physically, computers are notorious for causing physical strain in people who use them frequently. They can potentially lead to back pain, neck tension, and eyestrain. Many people suffer from Carpal Tunnel Syndrome due to excessive typing and other repetitive motions. These issues are particularly rampant among office workers and students, as they often find themselves stuck in front of a computer for extended amount of time.

On the other hand, computers can also harm people psychologically. They can cause psychological effects, such as reduced concentration due to excess usage, lack of physical activity due to sedentary lifestyles, and stress from constant multitasking. Furthermore, there is a link between increased computer usage and depression. Studies have also found that people who spend more time in front of the computer are more prone to anxiety and mood changes.

The effects computers have on people must be taken seriously. I urge you to spread awareness and advocate for the implementation of policies that promote computer use in moderation. While computers can be used for exponential productivity and efficiency, too much time spent in front of a computer can lead to serious physical and psychological issues.
