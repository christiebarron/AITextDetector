I’ll never forget the time when my best friend and I went to the movies together. We were sitting in the theater, waiting for the movie to start, when she started to make a funny face. I started laughing and before I knew it, we were laughing hysterically, tears streaming down our faces and people staring at us. Even though we were embarrassed, the laughter felt so good and so genuine. 

After the movie ended we walked back to my house, still laughing about the funny face we’d made. I remembered all the times we’d shared together throughout our friendship and felt so lucky to be able to laugh and bond with someone like her. That night, I realized that laughter was more than just a way of communication, it was a way for us to connect on a deeper level.
