The prospect of dirigibles docking atop the Empire State Building was an exciting proposition that could have changed the face of transportation in New York City. However, the engineers and architects faced numerous obstacles in constructing a docking mast for their proposed airships.

The mooring mast concept was first proposed in 1933, a time when dirigibles were the most reliable form of long distance air travel. The Empire State Building was chosen as the docking site, as its location near the cityâ€™s financial district would allow travelers the ability to quickly access their destinations. Despite the benefits, engineers and architects faced numerous challenges to make the concept a reality.

The first challenge was the height of the Empire State Building, which was much higher than that of the tallest existing mast. To build a mast as tall as the building, multiple problems had to be addressed such as wind strength, and the need for additional metal detailing to stabilize the mast. This detailed metalwork, along with a stronger, more stable foundation, was essential for a safe landing.

In addition to the height, the architects had to create a custom design for the mast that could accommodate the large dirigibles. Designers needed to envision a structure that was the exact shape of the dirigible in order to perfectly fit the airship without touching the building or the mast itself.

Finally, the architects had to consider the external environment when designing the mast. Since the Empire State Building was located in a heavily
