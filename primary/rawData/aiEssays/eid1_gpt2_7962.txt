Computers have many effects on people. One of them is the brain's ability to process information in a relatively slow process. A typical person who has a bad learning process spends a small amount of time doing homework. At this point, they probably have trouble focusing on information in the beginning.

But it's another effect on the brain and how it processes information. In fact, an early example of cognitive decline occurs when people become disheartened by problems. If they've been told repeatedly so much to do during and after a particular task that they may not succeed, they may simply find their own way back into the computer system.

Now the good news, psychologists say, is that all of the above can be avoided. People can cope better if they put their worries aside and make new ones.

"The process of'Chicago: How to overcome this one problem' could be the first step in a new movement toward solving the big problem in our culture," said Dr. Robert R. Nadel of the University of California at Berkeley.

But it's good news for all those in trouble that the technology has yet to be implemented or proven safe, so to speak. Researchers say it's possible to reduce the number of people suffering from anxiety disorders within a day but it would have to take some time.

The problem with the technology, says Rizvi-Miznowski, a researcher at The University of Chicago, is that it relies so heavily
