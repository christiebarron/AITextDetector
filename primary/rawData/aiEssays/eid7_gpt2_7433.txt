An example of a time someone in my life was patient was during an injury; there was a woman in my life who had lost the right arm she was so lucky to have given her. She had had a very traumatic injury when she was 11. It was a huge shock to me to be so lucky. And when she gave birth she had suffered severe pain. So in that moment I knew that she wasn't going away. I knew. I felt like I never saw her again.

My dad did some research and came up with this idea of giving birth that was different, something that was going to last for as long as I could live. My dad came up with this idea for when an injured person might feel so helpless; they can die from any illness it is, or it might also get worse. So he said, we could do something to help somebody lose their arm. I thought, you guys need to do something.

Samantha Ziemann: The idea of donating a kidney has been around for a long time, but we thought maybe you can do a little experiment?

Dennis Miller: Oh my God. It's been in this family for a very long time, and now that it has started that it could be for anyone. We all want to have a kidney, our kids are healthy, and if somebody had a kidney they'd be a great person, AUTHORED. So it's great for our story to be this little experiment
