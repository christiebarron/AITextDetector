The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, they had to design and build the system that allowed both motion and vision to be captured: in any direction, the view would remain blocked. In reality, the design of the tower needed to be as precise and precise as possible. Then, their engineers were able to go on the high road, but the tower's main building, the Empire State Building, required the work of several engineers each year. The designers did not want to be in the middle of an operation too small and cumbersome, so they used materials that were known to be expensive to produce. With those materials, all they needed was to attach a crane to the building. One drawback to the crane system wasn't that a crane would require a crane at all when building the Empire State Building, but that too was expensive: most commercial crane operators used commercial cranes, and the Empire State Building's cost was high. The most famous crane project was the New York City crane tower, complete with four or five small and medium-sized crane towers (both with 4.5 inches of lift attached to them in the upper right corner). The tower's lift was about 40 feet, which was pretty damn fast. The tower had 12 bivouacs, five of which carried electrical power, four to 5 feet high (like the one on the Tower of Pisa) and three to four feet deep (like on a crane, but with
