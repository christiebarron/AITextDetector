I recently had an experience where I had to be extremely patient and understanding. My dad had recently undergone a surgery and the hospital where he was being treated had a policy of a two-day waiting period before any visitors were allowed to visit a patient. As a family, this was extremely difficult for us as we wanted to ensure that he was doing well as soon as possible. 

However, we decided to respect the hospitalâ€™s policy and be patient. For two long days, we called the hospital numerous times to get an update on his health but had to settle for small updates from the nurses on the phone. We also knew that it was important to give the doctors and nurses the time and space to take care of my dad properly. Finally, after two days, we were allowed to visit him and it was a huge relief to see that he was recovering well. 

This experience taught me the importance of patience in difficult times. We had to put our own worries aside and trust that the medical professionals were doing their job to take care of our dad. This experience reminded me how resiliency and understanding are important virtues to remember during trying times.
