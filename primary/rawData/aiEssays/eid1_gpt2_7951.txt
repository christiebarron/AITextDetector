Computers have many effects on people. People are better prepared for challenges that require greater mental commitment, and these are the kinds of experiences that we want to see and understand how we can help people with mental health issues.

I encourage you to read this article to educate yourself on the ways in which mental health care systems can help people with mental wellness, and about how to support the health programs that we have in many different countries around the world.

It also offers an important context to consider from an understanding of how different aspects of mental health care system play out for people with certain behaviors.
