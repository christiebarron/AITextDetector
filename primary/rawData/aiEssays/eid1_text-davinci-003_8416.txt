I recently had the opportunity to witness a truly amazing display of patience. I had gone to the mall with my younger brother and his friends when we passed by a little boy crying in the middle of the hallway. His mother was patiently trying to console him, but he was so upset that he kept talking over her and trying to run away. 

As we watched from a distance, this wonderful mother kept her cool and tried her best to patiently talk to her son about what was bothering him. She stayed calm and offered him comfort, gently reminding him that she was there for him and that it was okay to feel overwhelmed. 

In the end, her patience paid off and her son settled down and stopped crying. Our presence wasn't even necessary, as the boy had eventually responded to his mother's gentle words and soothing presence. I was moved by the mother's patience and kind demeanor, and by how she had stayed so calm and stayed focused on her child's needs. It was truly impressive and something I won't soon forget.
