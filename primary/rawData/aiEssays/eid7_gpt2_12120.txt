An example of a time someone in my life was patient was John C. Stroud, who used to say, "Just look at the face you have on your lap!" It took him a month to realize that was nothing more than a lie.

He did it all the time in my own living room, so I went there a few times at night until I was convinced he was lying. He claimed that he didn't want me to look at him as I looked at him on my own face, which I didn't want. He was lying on top of me.

John's lying, of course. He was all over the television in a dark spot, and I saw it for what it was: a momentary moment that I thought I could get over. At one point, he admitted to asking me, and my family, a few words later, to see who the doctor said was the victim of suicide.

I told him that my friend was lying. We said it was OK for me to lie and that he could see it.

Then, he said, he would have to die. As a father, I thought I could do it to save him.

It never occurred to me that he has his own family living in California, or that he had any special or special experience, or that it was something that helped his son die. He's still a little stunned by the things he's experienced pervasive on television, on the radio
