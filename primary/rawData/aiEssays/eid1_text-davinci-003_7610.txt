The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho serves as a metaphor for resilience and hope. The speaker is referring to an upcoming test that marks a difficult challenge in her life. By suggesting that she will take the test again when the snow melts and the geese return, she is suggesting that, just like nature, she will find a way to persevere and overcome the challenge. The implication is that she will find a way to succeed in the test, just as nature manages to survive and flourish in the face of the harsh winter. The ending also serves as a commentary on the idea of rebirth and renewal that comes with the changing of the seasons.
