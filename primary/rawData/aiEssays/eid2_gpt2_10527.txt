I believe that censorship of materials in libraries can be a good way to make people safer by providing a means of educating people about the importance of ideas.

It is easy to get lost when deciding to view a paper that is not published or not referenced by the general public. But I would recommend simply being a better citizen rather than looking for information from a publication that needs my personal opinions. This way when I have to see this paper, I am more aware of what I said and felt. If you are reading this for the same reason I do, I think you deserve to hear it again.
