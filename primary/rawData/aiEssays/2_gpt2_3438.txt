I believe that censorship of materials in libraries for a specific subject is unconstitutional."

This claim is likely based on the fact that many people on campus use it as a protest technique, as "people use a bunch of different names and symbols for things we don't need," says David Weisman, a professor of humanities and social sciences at Harvard who has studied how the protests were handled. Weisman is a critic of a series of university systems, many of which are trying to shut down free expression, as well as some that are taking steps similar to censorship (like those at Yale).

And Ahmad Rudeh, a professor of political science at the University of California, Berkeley, who has studied the response to protests at Yale, notes that the rhetoric is a great tool for organizing people on campuses. "There's been a long way to step it up in the last couple of years," he says.

But he is worried that the rhetoric can draw backlash elsewhere, and that if these protests spread to other sites, it could trigger a backlash against students and other marginalized rushing to support these spaces.

"Anonymity is important for any form of speech. So if you know that someone is going to use one of these on your campus, Robots In Motion will be up and running. But if you don't, then it's going to cause an immediate backlash, probably not the immediate benefit of a larger fight with an individual."
