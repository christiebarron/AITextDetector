Laughter was always a big part of my relationship with my best friend growing up. We could always make each other laugh, no matter how bad a day either of us was having. 

One time we were walking to school and we came up to a street crossing. As we waited for the signal to change, I turned to my friend and deadpanned, "I really hope the light changes soon, I'm not sure how much longer I can stand here." Without missing a beat, my friend responded, "Why don't you just go for it? We could make a dash for it, like they do in the movies."

That's all it took. We looked at each other and started laughing so hard that people walking by stopped to stare. We had to take a few moments to compose ourselves before we could continue on our way to school. 

It’s moments like that that I’ll look back on fondly and cherish forever. We may not have been the cool kids in school, but when we were together, laughter was all around us.
