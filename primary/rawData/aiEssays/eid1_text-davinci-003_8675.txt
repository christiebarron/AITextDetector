I met my girlfriend in an unexpected way. We had both recently graduated from college and while searching for a roommate on an online forum, we found each other. I'll never forget the day we finally decided to meet up in real life. 

I arrived at the coffee shop 10 minutes early, secretly hoping she wouldn't show up so I could pass it off as a funny misunderstanding. But she did show up, right on time. She walked in with a big smile on her face, like she already knew a secret we had yet to share. She saw me and waved, and I waved back nervously. I couldn't help but feel exposed, like all my most embarrassing quirks were already open knowledge. 

We sat down at the table and sort of stared at each other. We hadn't said anything yet, and the silence felt like an eternity. But finally my fear melted away and I couldn't help but laugh. I think it was out of relief. We both laughed, uncontrollably, and just kept going, like we couldn't stop ourselves. After that, we were able to truly relax, and I came to know the girl who would soon become my girlfriend. 

That laugh was the first real interaction we had. It connected us in a way I could never have imagined, and it showed me that we could spend the rest of forever together.
