I believe that censorship of materials in libraries and museums is wrong and that it should never be allowed without proper safeguards and legal safeguards. We also agree with our friends in the US, Germany, Turkey, Russia, Hong Kong, China.

We will provide all legal avenues in our campaign in the wake of the tragic incident.

The Committee and the European Commission have informed the Czech Republic government that it is implementing an initiative to bring the legal mechanism for regulating and supervising the use of books and other information on Czech citizens abroad into being.

We believe that any attempt by Czech authorities of censoring or restricting literature on any European continent, be it in the Library of Congress, a research library, an amusement park or any other place where books are collected, will raise serious legal and technical risks.

We would like to extend our sincere thanks to the Czech government, for its continuous assistance in this matter, and to all authors, authors' societies, libraries and universities who have helped carry on this work.
