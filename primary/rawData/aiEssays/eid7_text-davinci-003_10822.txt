I was volunteering at a local soup kitchen recently and there was an elderly homeless man who was having a particularly hard time. He was rambling on about some things that didn't make a lot of sense and it was making the other volunteers uncomfortable, but I wanted to try and be patient with him. So, instead of brushing him off and sending him away like the other volunteers were doing, I decided to sit down next to him and try and engage him in conversation. I asked him questions about his life and listened attentively as he told me about his past and his life story.

We ended up talking for over an hour and I could tell he really appreciated the time I took to get to know him. I was surprised by how patient and kind I was able to be with him, and it made me feel a lot better about the state of the world and the people in it. I was so moved by this experience that it has reaffirmed my commitment to volunteering at the soup kitchen as much as I can.
