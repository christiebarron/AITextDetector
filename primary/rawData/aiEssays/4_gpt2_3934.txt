The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it takes us through the end of the book to its conclusions. Even though this was a huge journey and the final chapters are not very enjoyable, here I have come to the realization that there were many great things in this book and I am happy to say it was written by a true writer of a wide variety of backgrounds. There was very little background research or exposition. The writing was beautiful. The characters were also excellent. The story of a group of men and women is very clear and it is a very enjoyable story. Even though it is about people, it does not involve anything of this kind. It only addresses them as they say they are from different cultures. That is really what a good book should be. I really could not recommend it to everyone. Overall a love letter to the story, by another author - and I hope I did not write too short a review. It is just about life, I am still writing, and I am writing this book anyway. Thanks so much, Mr. C. - "N everybody always said I was stupid, you must just give it to me! Oh, and by the way, I just wrote this book with my phone turned off! Thanks!"
