Censorship in libraries concerns people of all ages, and it is an issue that readers should be allowed to voice their opinions on. Libraries are meant to be a safe haven for readers of all backgrounds to access books and resources in an unbiased environment. While some materials deemed offensive should not be made available to the public, it is not the right of library administrators to decide which materials should be removed from shelves. Libraries should uphold the standards of the First Amendment and maintain an atmosphere of free exchange of ideas. 

While some materials may be regarded as offensive, the mission of libraries should remain that of providing access to information. Works of literature that contain themes or language which may be considered offensive to one community may not be offensive to another. Libraries should not be in the business of determining which readers should or should not have access to what materials. Libraries should remain open to the full range of ideas and opinions found in literature and should only remove literature deemed inappropriate from circulation if mandated by law. 

In addition, libraries should offer resources on a wide range of topics and not just topics determined to be suitable by administrators. While libraries do have an obligation to protect children from certain materials, this should only be done by having age appropriate materials in certain sections of libraries, and not by completely removing them from circulation. By presenting a wide variety of materials even material that may be considered offensive, libraries provide readers with an educational experience and the opportunity to learn from cultures, people, and ideas
