Dear [Editor],

I'm writing to express my opinion on the effects that computers have on people. Over the last few decades, computers have become increasingly integrated into our daily lives, allowing us to do everything from communicate with others to monitoring our health.

It's clear that computers have had a huge impact on nearly every aspect of our existence, but what I'm concerned about is the potential for devices to be overused and abused. Constant computer use can lead to an unhealthy lifestyle; people may forget to take breaks, become inactive, or even fall victim to their own screens and completely disconnect from the real world.

Although our increasing reliance on technology has the potential to cause issues, computers can also offer great benefits. Computers can be used to stay in touch with loved ones, expand our knowledge, and develop new skills. We must be mindful of our technology consumption and remember to use computers in a responsible way.

Overall, computers can be extremely beneficial to our lives, but they should be used in moderation. We must remember to unplug when necessary and take breaks to make sure that we're staying healthy, both mentally and physically.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
