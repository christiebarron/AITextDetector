The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is reminiscent of a pre-Internet world where online communication is a much more comfortable place â€” people are more likely to report the world around them to their loved ones, who will be prepared for most situations if things do not go according to plan. And unlike other online media that has helped keep the Internet safe and vibrant, the Facebook account that's been launched by David and Sara is different.

David said he's glad he has a place where he can communicate with other people. "I've always been interested in technology because it's always been a hobby. I like social media because it's always been a way of creating something, a sense of humor, so we'll be really good at sharing all the things if we're doing it here," he said.
