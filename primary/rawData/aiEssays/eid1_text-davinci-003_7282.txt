In Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead,” the cyclist is faced with a difficult traverse. The setting is an unpaved road filled with potholes, ruts, and other imperfections that require the cyclist to stay hyper vigilant and extremely aware of the road. The features of the setting create a dangerous environment for the cyclist.

The poorly maintained road increases the physical strain of the ride, as the cyclist must constantly adjust their body and bike in order to maintain balance. He must frequently jump or be quickly aware when a new obstacle appears. The rider also struggles with overheating, as the road radiates heat from its sun-soaked pavement. Even more, the cyclist’s visibility is reduced by dust clouds that kick up as he rides.

The dirt road also increases the physical danger of the situation. The cyclist must be extremely careful and aware of the terrain. The stones, gravel, and dips have the potential to cause a crash or other injuries.

All of these features of the setting create peril for the cyclist and make it more difficult for him to control his bike and sustain a smooth ride. The cyclist is forced to make split second decisions to navigate the hazardous course, each one with potential to lead to disaster. The people who live on the road have eventually adjusted to the conditions, yet they are deeply aware of the dangers of the landscape. The rider must figure out how to navigate this vast expanse
