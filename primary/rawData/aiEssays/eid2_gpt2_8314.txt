I believe that censorship of materials in libraries constitutes an unjust regulation, since what we see and use, we feel, is that we are being made to feel in the very same way," Mr. Wirth said. Mr. Bostrom's statements came on what was then the group's third trip to Ireland last June and at the request of Mr. Cogan, according to the group, who requested anonymity.

The article on the trip was part of a story about the rise in attacks on Catholic libraries by the far-right and the Catholic Utopian movement over the last 30 years.
