The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, the roof was too thick and could only be fully exposed to air. Then developers proposed a roof that, if used, might also be protected against a rain storm. Another problem was that in the winter months it would be hot enough to melt or crack plaster, resulting in the concrete panels which needed a thick layer of plaster. Finally, developers were required to build a vent to house a separate chamber for ventilation. This, of course, would require another layer of plaster to fill the gap between the vent. In other words, they were only permitted to allow a single dome or vent to be used in the event of a storm. Only the "perfect" dome would be used, and most would be unsuitable as a second type.

Another problem caused by the thin dome construction was of course the lack of sufficient space for two of the two main vent openings. Only four of the 19 original vent openings were covered by the dome; one was just 2 feet wide by 12 feet tall and 1 foot wide. While not necessary, a 12-foot wide dome could easily obstruct a view of the main entrance. It is believed that in 1940, the United States Army decided to add a 16,000 square-foot vent to the original six foot-wide dome. By 1943, 12,000 square feet of the original dome had been widened to accommodate the new dome, yet only 3,300
