Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion regarding the effects that computers have had on our lives. It is clear that computers have had a positive effect on our daily lives, enabling us to do so much more quickly, efficiently and accurately.

One of the most beneficial effects of computers has been in the area of communication. Computers have allowed us to communicate with each other almost instantly, sending emails, texts and video chats from practically any location. This technology has helped us to stay connected with our friends, family and colleagues, even when we are miles apart.

Another positive effect computers have had is in the area of education. Schools and universities have embraced the technology, investing in computers and software to give their students the best possible chance to learn and succeed. With the advent of online courses, students can learn almost anything from the comfort of their home, eliminating the need to attend classes in person.

Finally, computers have enabled us to access a vast array of information available on the internet. This means that we can quickly and easily find answers to our queries, which makes research much easier and more efficient.

In conclusion, I believe computers have revolutionised the way we live, work and learn
