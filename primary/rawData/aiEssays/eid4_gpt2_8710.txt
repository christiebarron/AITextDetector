The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because we can't really begin to see why Hibiscus is so good. We'll also soon learn that Hibiscus has its own version of the supernatural.

I suspect we'll have an explanation from time to time when the New York Times called one of the chapters from Summer's Magic at the end of Winter Hibiscus "a fairy tale tale of an unlikely man on the edge of a snowy forest." Or the guy who wrote this piece: "Hibiscus is not a fairy tale of some unusual man on a rocky top that has his finger caught by the branches on the other side of his tent. It's a story of an unlucky wolf roaming through the woods of the woods, trying to make a point about the things he cares about least among the hundreds that follow." That's it. We might find out more soon.
