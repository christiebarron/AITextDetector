Dear Editor, 

We live in a day and age where technology runs the show. Computers have infiltrated our lives in a way that has had both positive and negative effects on humanity. Through my experiences, I have seen people become so enamored by computers that they have become robotic - dull, emotionless, and disconnected. 

On the plus side, computers have given humans the power to do more, in less time and with greater accuracy. The vast resource of information available on the internet at our fingertips can be used for anything from educational research to leisure activities. Machines have taken over in the workplace, revolutionizing how things are done. We have access to efficient pieces of technology that can help with productivity, but these same machines have taken away our social connection to coworkers.

On the flip side, the world of technology has become so immersive that people are unable to put their computers down and disconnect. The negative effects of computer addiction can range from strained relationships to poor hygiene. Lack of face-to-face contact has further led to loneliness and depression, as evidenced by the increasing number of cases reported by psychologists and mental health experts.

The responsibility to maintain a healthy relationship with technology and its related gadgets lies with the individual. It is time we put an end to the negative effects of technology and embrace the positives it offers. We can do this by engaging in activities like mindfulness and meditation to focus on the present moment, set limits on ourselves,
