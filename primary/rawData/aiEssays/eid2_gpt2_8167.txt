I believe that censorship of materials in libraries, as well as some types of speech that occur after library operations are completed, is an intentional form of free speech.

"Many writers and students, for instance, want to change the language of the law. I do not believe it's true that there are any 'free speech' laws in the United States but that people who try to change how the law is done have to be really well-informed."
