Dear Editor,

As computers become more and more a part of our lives, I can't help but recall the phrase, “beware of the technology you create.”

The effects computers have on people have been monumental, ranging from the undeniable convenience to the alarming loss of physical activity. But it’s the insights to our mental and emotional health that draw my attention.

Computer screens can be an isolated, individual activity. Real-world face-to-face interaction - which is essential for emotional growth - is minimal when children are glued to their computers. Online trolling and cyberbullying are insidious, devastating threats to mental health, having yielded depression, anxiety and suicide.

The speed of the internet and computer access can make it hard to step away from technology. Instead of leisurely enjoying a book, many people become exhausted by the information bombardment offered by technology.

I believe that computers have their uses, but balance is essential. We must be mindful of the emotional and mental well-being of those who enjoy our technology; this balance needs to be rediscovered if we are to continue taking advantage of the advantages of computers.

I hope readers agree with me that while technology has been invaluable, it must not be exchanged for connection, or it could potentially be our undoing.

Sincerely,

[Name]
