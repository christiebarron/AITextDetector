The ending of the poem provides a message of hope; the protagonist is facing a difficult situation, in which they must take a challenging exam. However, the protagonist is looking forward to a time when their situation will have changed and they will have the opportunity to take the test again. The imagery of snow melting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding conveys the idea that life is full of cycles and that even difficult experiences can eventually lead to brighter prospects.
