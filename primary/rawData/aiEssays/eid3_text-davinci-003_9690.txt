The features of the setting in Rough Road Ahead by Joe Kurmaski greatly affect the cyclist and his journey. First, the rural terrain leads to many steep hills, which the cyclist must climb. These hills require great physical and mental strength to overcome, and can easily deplete the cyclist's energy reserves. The cyclist must also keep his body in balance with the jerky moves and uneven surfaces that occur while traversing a rural landscape. This makes it difficult to maintain an efficient speed—an issue that could put the cyclist in danger if he is not aware and able to maneuver quickly enough.
