At the end of the poem, the speaker reflects on a difficult academic test that they must take. The speaker is feeling overwhelmed and discouraged. In order to find some hope, the speaker turns their attention to the imagery of the Winter Hibiscus that is blooming in the wintertime. The speaker takes this as a sign that hope and growth are possible even in the harshest of conditions. The speaker reflects on how the flower will grow in the springtime, with the melting snow and return of the geese, and knows that they will be ready to face the test again when the time comes. The message being conveyed by the speaker is that there is hope even in the toughest of times, and that growth is possible even in the midst of the most difficult situations.
