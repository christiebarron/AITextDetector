The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' and released by Warner Bros. earlier this month, and will eventually be released at the same time for a limited series, is reminiscent of a time when filmmakers didn't think that a short film could resonate or be a success. In other words: the genre needed to have a chance to truly explore every aspect of life. But what if we decided to do just that and instead make a short film, the way the studios do and the way the market needs to do it?

I have a little bit of that too — there have been moments in my life and I think you see my situation. I live with this constant urge to follow an outline of what all my choices will be like – whether it's the short or an extended story, I've got to do it, and I'm determined to do it. So when I write, I'm going to do it.

We could have done in the same way with a longer story, but my feeling was that if we wanted to take the longer story, we couldn't do it. The short films were a natural evolution, but they'd be much smaller; they'd have some of the same story elements. We'd be able to follow one movie and just have the thing run as it always has. If we wanted to give it a spin or something, it would be very different.

I think the more the film's gotten away with, the better.
