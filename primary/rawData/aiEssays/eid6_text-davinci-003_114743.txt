The construction of the Empire State Building was an impressive engineering feat in itself. However, one of the most ambitious tasks that the builders undertook was to provide the opportunity for dirigibles - lighter-than-air aircraft - to dock at the building's mast in 1931. But the builders of this monumental skyscraper faced many obstacles in setting this plan into action.

The first challenge was to construct the mooring mast, which was necessary for the dirigibles to dock. The mooring mast was built according to the specifications of Samuel Moore, an engineer who had tested the idea of mooring airships to high buildings, and its design was essential to the success of the plan. The mast was carefully constructed out of strong steel and rose 800 feet above the deck of the Empire State Building. But despite the strength of the mast, it was still susceptible to the dangerous gusts of wind that can buffet tall buildings. To appease these winds, engineers designed a system of cables that were suspended from the mast and connected to an anchoring point up to 300 feet below the edge of the building.

The second obstacle was the weight of the airships themselves. At an incredible 400 feet tall and 200 feet wide, even the largest dirigibles were dwarfed by the Empire State Building. To accommodate these impressive aircraft, engineers had to create a system of movable platforms that was suspended from the mooring mast, which allowed the dirigilbes to swing underneath
