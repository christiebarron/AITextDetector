The U.S. Congress has so far only done about three or four of those things, although the Federal Aviation Administration announced several years ago that it would start conducting such inspections. (See more on the Federal Aviation Administration from this year through this year.) The DOT and others have made steps in recent years to expand the scope of their inspections, but they have limited effectiveness.
