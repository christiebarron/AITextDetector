An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the time my husband was diagnosed with breast cancer.

How Much Do I Pay For Care?

The American Cancer Society estimates that we receive just 5% of cancer care.

The cost of cancer care is often much higher than our cost of living. It is estimated that we spend more than $70,000 a year on cancer care and some $100,000 annually for medical care.

What Do I Need To Pay For Care?

If you are a member of the American Cancer Society, please consider subscribing to the American Cancer Society's Patient Benefits Program. The program gives you the option of paying for health care through a rebate or a direct discount for medical care at your own expense.

Your employer will pay for services such as visits and treatments.

Your employer can also offer discounts for services such as mammograms or eye exams.

If your deductible or other insurance coverage limits may hinder you, however, the American Cancer Society doesn't offer any direct or direct benefits at this time.
