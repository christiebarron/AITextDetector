Dear Editor, 

It is my opinion that computers have had a significantly positive effect on people's lives. With the evolution of technology, access to information, entertainment, and communication has been made much easier, and it has enabled us to keep up with the ever-changing world at a faster pace.

The internet in particular grants us immediate access to more knowledge than ever before. Through a few clicks, people of all ages can educate themselves, gain more thorough understanding, broaden their horizon, find inspiration, and keep up with the latest updates in news and events. 

Computers also make people much more productive. With the help of computers, tasks that would take hours to finish can be achieved in much less time, and repetitive jobs can be automated or assisted, cutting costs and boosting efficiency for businesses.

In terms of communication, computers and the internet foster global connectivity, allowing us to connect people around the world. We can maintain long-distance relationships, start or join conversations across topics we are passionate about, and stay in contact with friends and family easily without having to be physically present.

In conclusion, many people are becoming more skilled and are benefiting from the use of computers. They have not only improved people's processes but also made the world of knowledge and information more accessible. Everyone should use this new technology to their advantage to help them progress in their lives. 

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
