The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. For the building of the Empire State building of 1912 and after World War II, the Empire State Building was erected for use by private collectors who simply wanted to know what the building's exterior was like. The building, which had to be filled, was always the final piece.

Today's building in New York City, however, still has plenty of space to house it. Because of its large scale, larger (around 500,000 square feet) and light-weight construction, this building was built for the private collector. However, the original Empire State Building was demolished at a time when the government was facing economic concerns as well as the growing popularity of digital media and automobiles, so the Empire State building continued to serve the interests of collectors, many of whom now have several different collections of photos and other artifacts.

The Empire State Building is depicted in the park at The National Archives, but its location is not. The park had already been closed for some time and had to be moved up because of construction and safety concerns. In 2001, the National Archives opened an exhibition of photographs. There, more than five thousand images of the building were featured.

Today's building in New York City, in its current form, is still an important building that represents what collectors are after. It is unique in only being unique
