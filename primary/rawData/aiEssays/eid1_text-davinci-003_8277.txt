In the 1930s, the newly-constructed Empire State Building was seen by many as a technological marvel, boasting the latest conveniences and capabilities of the age. In particular, the building was designed to allow dirigibles, or lighter-than-air airships, to dock, providing an efficient and modern way of transport between the building and other locations around the world.

However, the path to allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was not without its challenges. Because the ship was significantly larger than any other airplane, the planners of the building had to make sure that the new structure was strong enough to withstand the weight of the airship. To do this, they reinforced the steel frame of the building with more steel bracing and heavier plates. This additional work significantly delayed the completion date of the building, as it took extra time for the additional construction and engineering.

In addition to the extra support, many other obstacles facing the docking of dirigibles were addressed. Since the airships typically flew at significantly higher altitudes than other airplanes, they needed a higher mooring mast than other planes. A 600-foot, steel mast was built for this purpose, attached to the rooftop of the building, and supported by guy wires to provide additional stability. Additionally, wind conditions had to be carefully monitored while the airship was docking, as high winds could potentially cause the airship to become unbalanced while it was in the process of docking
