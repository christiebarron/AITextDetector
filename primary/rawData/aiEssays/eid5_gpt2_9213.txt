The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' reflects how little attention has been paid to her relationship with the other characters — even as the world sees her own struggles and personal struggles, as well as hers. The characters never tell one another any of their struggles or achievements, even though she says she does want to tell them all about them.

The final chapter of 'From Home is' is filled with heartbreaking and sometimes touching anecdotes, and we get one such story about a group of young students with disabilities who have become close friends and are both curious and excited.

The narrator explains how her parents would never give up on her, and her father would stay around so she could stay in the school. But despite all the ups and downs, her mother always says that they want to "get along". Her grandmother is a bright and intelligent woman who gives young women courage if it's their first love.

'From Home is' is written in collaboration with the Human Rights Campaign:


In a world where the media are reporting on children in such a negative light, the story about a student with a special need is of interest to us. A child born to single mothers does not have to have to grow up and be a mother on a regular basis. No such thing exists. We want a story for every child in this world who is suffering from mental and physical health problems and who doesn't feel comfortable talking about them.

Every child from our country –
