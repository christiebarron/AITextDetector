In Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead”, the cyclist is faced with some challenging and dangerous terrain. The cyclist is navigating an old, mountain bike trail in the mountains, along a craggy, rocky path. The setting of this story is integral to the experience of the cyclist, as the features of this environment cause him great difficulty, despite his endurance and experience.

The cyclist is constantly struggling with the rocky terrain that lies before him. The many ruts, boulders, ravines, and steep climbs in his path make each step of his journey even more difficult than it already is. As a result of the constant terrain changes, he must frequently change his technique in order to keep moving forward. The cyclist must be alert and focused in order to avoid any unseen hazards, which can lead to serious accidents. 

The cyclist must also face changing weather conditions, such as sudden rainfall that makes the rocky path treacherous. He must be prepared for the worst at all times, as he is dealing with a dangerous environment while still trying to reach his destination. His weariness also affects him in terms of making him less alert to the changes that occur around him.

The setting of Joe Kurmaski’s story clearly affects the cyclist and is a major factor in how his journey progresses. The constant changes in terrain, various hazards, and uncertain weather conditions provide difficulties that he must overcome in order to reach his destination.
