I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is the main reason that non-commercial libraries are able to flourish without being blocked from their shelves. Our aim is to make this possible and provide a platform where that will continue," said Al Jazeera's Khalladi. It was not the first time the UK has passed laws to make libraries more free of censorship - the Home Office passed the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FOOPA), 2013.

The online library industry told Al Jazeera it is concerned that the UK government in the past has failed to protect critical libraries from censorship in some of its legal branches.

Speaking to Al Jazeera from London, the executive director of The Library Association said the government "does not intend to make the Internet a safe, stable and useful place for users of non-governmental and non-commercial sources of information".

"People of all ideological stripes must use, use, use," said Al Jazeera's executive director, Nadine Mokdad. "It's clear that censorship of important books and works has the effect of making it more difficult for people to find and understand the text of their books, making it easier for those with a desire for books to discover new and helpful information."
