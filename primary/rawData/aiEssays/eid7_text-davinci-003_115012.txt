I once worked with a customer service representative at a retail store, and I found her to be extremely patient. Even when the customer was a bit rude, she handled it with kindness and understanding. 

The customer was having difficulty finding a product and was getting increasingly frustrated as he asked more questions. Knowing that he was becoming frustrated, the customer service representative handled the situation calmly, asking him all the right questions and searching with him for the specific product that he was looking for. 

She was patient and understanding while the customer was venting his frustration and upset. When she eventually found the product in question, it was a relief for both of us. The customer thanked her for her patience and apologized for his attitude. 

It was a good reminder for me that even in difficult situations, patience is the best way to handle things. That customer service representative was a great example of how to remain patient no matter how difficult things may seem.
