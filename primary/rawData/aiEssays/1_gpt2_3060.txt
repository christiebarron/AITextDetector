Computers have many effects on people. These include the impact on the quality of our lives, as well as on other factors such as intelligence. A recent study by the Stanford University School of Medicine showed that children born to mothers who received care at an early age have poorer health than those born after their birth. The researchers believe that women with early life medical problems may be more susceptible to social outbursts and other problems as a result of their experience, and, furthermore, that they may be more likely to develop a lifelong depression and to have suicidal thoughts. A 2011 study by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health also showed that women who had a high income or a high family income also showed significant physical decline in their brains when compared with those born to poorer families. Although a study by the University of California at San Francisco showed that poorer mothers exhibited slower growth when compared with richer ones, the study found that middle-income families were not less likely to experience any of these characteristics than lower income ones were, especially at the beginning of their lives. And, the "normal" child is a person in distress, and, therefore, has to live with a parent sometimes. Children with severe or life-threatening mood disorders are also more likely to experience the effects of early life medical problems, which may or may not begin life with "normal" and often prevent the process of "normal" functioning.
