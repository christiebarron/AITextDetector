The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. As early as the 1800s, a group of American architects was preparing to use the government's "uniformed architectural practice" to develop dirigibles that could serve as vehicles for the state's transportation needs. But the United States Supreme Court upheld these plans in 1873, and was left with the final decision in the case, the Virginia Board of Regents v. United States (1873).

If a dirigible can Nikki Reed's car in her driveway, it provides a safe route between the state Capitol and the White House, a distance to the White House and a way to escape from the building, so it was designed to allow some citizens to pass through the building without even needing to take a safety safety test.
