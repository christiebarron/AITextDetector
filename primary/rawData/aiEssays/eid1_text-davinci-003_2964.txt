Dear Editor, 

In the last decade, computers have become an indispensable part of our lives. People now rely heavily on them for professional and personal tasks, and the ramifications of this reliance cannot be understated. Despite all of the advantages which computers have brought to our lives, I firmly believe that their effects on people have become far too significant. 

Computers have indeed enhanced our efficiency in completing mundane, time-consuming tasks. Nonetheless, people are increasingly becoming dependant on computers: instead of exercising their own critical thinking, they rely on the convenience of word processing software, Wikipedia, and online stores. Furthermore, the constant presence of computers in our lives often leads to a lack of concentration and a decreased ability to formulate creative solutions.

We cannot overlook the serious health problems associated with computers. People now often suffer from neck and back pain, headaches, and eye strain, as a result of spending long hours in front of a computer. Even worse, many people neglect to get adequate sleep and sunlight because they are so preoccupied with their online world.

It is my opinion, therefore, that we must exercise caution with how we treat computers. We should limit the time we spend in front of our computers
