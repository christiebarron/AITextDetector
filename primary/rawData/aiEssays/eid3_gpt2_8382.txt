Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. When you switch-in between three modes, you'll choose from five different road segments including the 'Bike, Walk', 'Road' and 'Spacewalk'. The 'Bike and Walk' segments are different for the type of rider you see on the bike, and the 'Road' segment is different for the distance the cyclist takes on the bike. Your 'Road' option, if there's one at all, allows you to choose a specific distance, with speed.

A cycling test will happen in March or April of each year and your results will be reported on our bike test website. You can submit your results as part of a separate review of your riding experience on 'Fits for Cycling'.

With your help, the Fits for Cycling Project will begin to increase cycling awareness in North America

Please consider making your ride your own: Bike and Walk tests will take place at Fits for Cycling's offices.

Riders will receive information about each of the three cycle modes, their effects on the body, how they impact riding performance, and a full picture of their bicycle. They'll have a fully-formatted and downloadable file on FittingForCycle.ru, that gives you a visual representation of the five cycling modes as well as their physical characteristics. The FittingForCycle website will also be updated to include a download link.
