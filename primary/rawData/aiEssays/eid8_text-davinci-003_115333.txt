I remember it like it was yesterday: my first date with my now-husband. We'd been chatting online for some weeks, eager to meet in person, and it just so happened that I had tickets to a comedy club that weekend. I decided to surprise him with them and make it a date.

When I first laid eyes on him, I couldn't contain my excitement! His broad smile and twinkling eyes were disarming, and I felt a warmth and connection between us that I never expected.

The show was hilarious. It was amazing to share this experience with someone I felt so comfortable with. We were laughing so hard that tears were streaming down both of our faces! I remember being taken aback by how quickly we connected. It felt like laughter the whole night.

We continued to laugh and joke throughout the night, getting to know each other better, and by the end of the night, I was positive that I had met someone special.

Looking back on that night, I realize what an important part laughter played in bringing us together. Looking back on our relationship, I realize that laughter has continued to bring us closer together every day and will be an integral part of our future.
