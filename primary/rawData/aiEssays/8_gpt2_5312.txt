One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I came out to my family and said that Jesus is my God and that he gave me this money, the money that I needed to live my life. The church is not my family but my church. My God told me that this was his life. He gave me this money so that I had to go forward in life so that I could continue to take the church seriously so that I could be in a place where I could feel supported by God. So after we won our election, we would have more than 50 pastors. And when that number was over I would move all my churches all over the state. It would be so overwhelming. It would be an issue that could easily be resolved. All of those I would think about or ask people or any other leaders could have the leadership and influence I need to come here and be able to do that.

HILLARY CLINTON: And when I get to that point I want to thank the folks of the state of Colorado who donated over $2 million. And when I get to those contributions I'll give to the community, but I want to say from the bottom of my heart. And so there are so many people who support every single person here. That's why I'm working with our community leaders to build trust and trust between the church and each person in Denver and across the country.

JUAN GONZ√ÅLEZ: Senator Clinton, thanks
