The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it makes it true to its core narrative. It's hard to imagine how a book can go from one story (a girl's funeral on Mt. Kilimanjaro) to another, or even more. It's more difficult to envision that these books will become the dominant narrative force on the web. But that's the point of this book: to keep readers up to date with current events. And it's the point of all this: to make them familiar to anyone who has the same love, support, and curiosity for the subject matter that the series has become, and will again become established here.
