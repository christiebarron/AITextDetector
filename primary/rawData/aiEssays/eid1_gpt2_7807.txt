Computers have many effects on people. For my experiment it is very hard to quantify how long it takes the brain to process information or even how much it costs to send information to a computer. So I used a computer called the IBM PARC, which is a digital-signal server in Palo Alto, California and you send a computer or computer system to a PARC server to process information. That takes about 30 second seconds. The PARC sends that information along to a PARC server and once that server receives the PARC information in its packet, it sends that information back to the computer or server which is responsible for sending it back.

What is the difference? A computer sends data through a PARC server. If I was playing chess or a game of chess and the computer says to come to a certain number, say 80, the computer says to come to me. If you're sitting in a chair, the computer sends data about 20 times to the computer, even though you aren't sitting there, say 90.

That sounds like a lot of processing to me. And what you hear in the movie is that the computer will send data about 80 times the time you are sitting in a chair. That's not the case. But is that normal? Of course you're sitting there sitting there. I mean it's normal.

So, in a way it is, I can say this. It is. You don't see a big difference, except
