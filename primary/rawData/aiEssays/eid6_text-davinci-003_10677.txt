The Empire State Building was a revolutionary feat of engineering and architecture when it was opened in 1931. It was, and still is, one of the most iconic buildings in the world. However, what many people do not know is that when it was built, the developers hoped to make it the first building in the world to have dirigible docking capabilities. This was an ambitious plan considering the technical and safety obstacles they faced, as described in Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s “The Mooring Mast.” 

One of the biggest obstacles the developers had to overcome was finding a suitable place to put the mooring mast for dirigibles to dock. Initially, the plan was to put it at the top of the Building, but due to safety reasons, the developers decided to instead place it near the top. This not only posed a major engineering challenge, but also required significant structural changes to the Building, thereby delaying its opening date. 

The developers also had to take into account the safety implications of dirigibles docking at the Building. It was difficult to ensure that the airships would line up correctly for docking, as the strong winds around the building complex could cause them to veer off course. Furthermore, the mooring mast had to be made from materials that were strong enough to withstand the strong winds and the weight of multiple dirigibles landing on it at once. To ensure the safety of passengers, the developers had to
