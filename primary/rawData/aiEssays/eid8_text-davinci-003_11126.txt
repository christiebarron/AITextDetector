I have a great memory that I love to look back on. It was a spring day, one of the first days of the year that felt like summer was around the corner. I was on a spontaneous road trip with two of my closest friends from college. We had just stopped to get a bite to eat when we spotted an ice cream shop.

We all agreed that it was a good idea and got out of the car to go and get some ice cream cones. On our way to the store, my friends and I began discussing something inane about one of our classes. I can’t even remember what it was now but I do remember that I started making some stupid jokes about it.

My friends just started laughing and before long, we all were holding our stomachs and barely able to stand up. It was a silly thing, but it was the funniest thing I had ever heard at the time. We were laughing so hard that I don’t even remember getting the ice cream. When we finally did make it back to our car, it was all a blur.

What I do remember is how good the laughter felt, breaking through the spring air like a lightning bolt. To this day, every time I think back on that day, I have the same reaction of laughter. That spontaneous moment of joy is something that I will always cherish.
