The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' became a source of controversy on the social networking site, with one user commenting that it contained a reference to the "evil emperor, king of the Jews" and it was said it was a reference to the death of Jesus Christ.

An Israeli newspaper also reported that members of Hamas had expressed that they was considering a boycott.

It is not the first time Israel has made such a call. In 2011, it took the law into its own hands. Last year, Israel closed all public schools.
