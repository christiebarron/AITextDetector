Minfong Ho ends Winter Hibiscus with this thought to reinforce the idea that the narrator is hopeful for the future. By tying the momentary success of the hibiscus to the idea of taking the test again in the future, the reader gets the sense that the narrator believes that even hard times can be overcome with enough determination. The imagery of the geese returning at the end of winter also provides a sense of reassurance that the cycle of growth and renewal can always bring new hope. This sentiment is vital to the narrator's message, as it encourages readers to focus on the potential of each new season rather than focusing solely on the difficulty of the present.
