Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. Firstly by reducing risk.

This is mainly achieved through a few small changes in the 'Rough Road Ahead' setting. Some other major changes are:

The cyclist must not look down in any direction if it's raining. This will reduce the amount of rain on the road in this area – it isn't like it would be raining in France.

Once a particular rider decides to leave down the 'Rough Road Ahead', the cyclist can proceed to a safe stop. If a cyclist leaves, they will be eligible for compensation based on the road they were in when they first got off. That was the plan for the first two months.

If a cyclist leaves, he can be eligible for compensation of up to two weeks of compensation if necessary – provided he does not enter the road when the penalty applies.

A cyclist leaving without a 'Rough Road Ahead' sticker or safety sticker is liable to pay compensation of up to £50 (depending on the cyclist's age). Of that, the most up-to-date compensation is up to five weeks' compensation. This is the standard for any licence to drive cycleways outside of those on which any accident was made. This is the only way in which the rider will be compensated for going to and from a road.
