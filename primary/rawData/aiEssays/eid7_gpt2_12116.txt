An example of a time someone in my life was patient was in a local hospital when he was treated for a cold. He walked in (the patient looked like he was just trying to stand) and the doctor's wife asked what type of cold he was taking. When I opened up the lid of the cold bottle, I could see he was very cold.

As soon as it started taking effect there was a big burst of warm water pouring down from the window, and the next thing you know there you're sitting next to us talking about something and you can't talk because suddenly you're sitting on the floor so it's kind of scary. It's just scary.

How do you handle this cold at home?

If somebody can't handle a cold, you need to keep them away from them and try to keep them away from you, so they don't get sick.

My parents and me are all in a relationship right now, with Dr. King and our daughters. I wouldn't have had it any other way.

But our kids could've easily gotten sick if we had waited. We were all so afraid of death or something, but we're all doing what kosher means.

We are like one brother in an extended family today, so we're very close to each other.
