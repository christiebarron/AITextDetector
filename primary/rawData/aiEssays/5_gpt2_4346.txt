The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' for its subjects, also includes her relationship with one of its contributors. She told the author that her relationship with Tanya and her boyfriend, who is now 52 and from China, was "incredibly romantic, with a lot of intimacy."

After two years of relationship for Tanya, which lasted only about a week, Tanya ended their relationship. "My husband and I would sleep on the same bed every day all the time, or at the very least, just bed," wrote the memoir. "He would do something to help me so I would stop eating aloneâ€¦ We also never had a big baby yet, but we were both very excited when I had him," she said.

Tanya, who is currently studying abroad in Germany, told the New York Times that her boyfriend, Jai, had asked me if I would like to marry her. To which she replied, "Well, you can't."

"Tanya was a pretty simple type of person who would be very, very supportive of a kid if they were together," she added, adding, "when I was younger she loved it. In the beginning she even asked if I would love her because she liked children, when she found out that I was going to be a mother and had to work hard, to keep up, make some extra money."
