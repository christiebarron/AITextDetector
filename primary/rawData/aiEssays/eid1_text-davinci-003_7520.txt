The ending of Minfong Ho's poem Winter Hibiscus serves to emphasize the cyclical nature of life and of the seasons. The poem ends with the idea that the speaker will need to take the same test (one based on memorizing facts) over again, despite her struggles and growth throughout the poem. The sequence of the speaker taking the test and then facing uncertain outcomes once represents the process of growth, and also the changing of the seasons. By ending the poem on this note, the author is emphasizing that while life may have ups and downs, things can and will come “back in the spring” - just like the returning geese, and the hibiscus that will eventually be budding. In other words, although life may present difficult challenges, better days are ahead.
