Dear Editor,

As one of your dedicated readers, I'm writing about an issue that many of us may be familiar with: the impact of technology, specifically computers, on our daily lives. We must acknowledge that technology is ever-evolving and is seen as an invaluable asset in our global society.

In many ways, computers have made our lives easier. They allow us to access large amounts of data effortlessly and to accomplish tasks faster than ever before. Furthermore, computers provide us with prompt and efficient communication through email and social networks. 

However, this reliance on technology has some shortcomings. For instance, increased Internet access has led to a decline in productivity and engagement within traditional learning environments. As a result, people have become more reliant on computers to accomplish basic tasks. Unfortunately, the over-reliance on technology has proven to be problematic in our society, exacerbating a lack of personal accountability for our actions.

In addition, studies have demonstrated that an over-reliance on computers can have a deleterious effect on our health. Glare from computer screens can cause fatigue and headaches for extended periods of time. Furthermore, ergonomic chairs and desks are not used with appropriate frequency, leading to conditions such as carpal tunnel syndrome and other musculoskeletal maladies.

Based on this evidence, it's clear that computers have some adverse effects on people. This isn't to say that computers are bad or should be avoided entirely;
