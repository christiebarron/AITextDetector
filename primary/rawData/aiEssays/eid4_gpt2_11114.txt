The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because the story was in a state of confusion — the events that transpired in Winter came at a pivotal point. It is not clear that when and where the last chapters came is a crucial factor. In short, it leaves the reader as they go: "What really happened?"

I'm not sure I was thinking about this post-apocalyptic world first. I mean, I read the book a few years ago and was so excited by it — and this seems like it's a great way to get ready to jump right into something new again. But even with that thought, what I feel is true is the book isn't set just for me. There's a lot of other books out there that, as I'm more interested in science fiction and fantasy, are just as interesting to me as this one.

One person I'm quite excited about is the book. When I was a kid, I liked this story called 'Ritual' and it sparked a bunch of weird reactions and, especially after this one I have read it again and again, "Wow that sounds like something you would expect from such a story. I've read plenty of other bad boy stories and this one looks even funnier." The fact that it has a novel in it feels like some sort of good karma for the publisher of the book or for me.

This one also comes in handy for the publisher as far as the story was concerned
