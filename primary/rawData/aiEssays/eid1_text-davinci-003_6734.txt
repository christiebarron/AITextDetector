Dear Editor,

This is an open letter to express my opinion on the effects that computers have had on people throughout the years.

Ever since the invention of computers, our lives have changed drastically. Now, we can access almost any form of data or information with just the click of a mouse. Additionally, complex calculations can be completed in the blink of an eye, and just about anything can be automated. 

However, despite all the advantages that computers have brought, some of the changes they have caused have impaired our way of life. We have become far more reliant on them than we ever wanted to be, and this can be damaging in certain ways. The lack of physical interaction or communication skills, the inability to approach tasks traditionally, or the decline of traditional studies and skills are examples of how computers have had a negative effect on people.

That being said, it is important to acknowledge that computers are an integral part of our world. We must be wise in our use of technology and be aware of the risks of overexposure to this digital world. Although computers can provide immense convenience and help us simplify tasks, they do not completely replace the traditional means of doing things and thus it is essential that we not become too dependent on them.

To those who agree, let us strive to use technology in a responsible and meaningful way and help preserve the true essence of life. 

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
