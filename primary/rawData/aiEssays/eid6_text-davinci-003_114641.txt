The Empire State Building was one of the most iconic landmarks of the 1930s. Designed by W.F Lamb and Associates, the building was intended to be a futuristic marvel of architecture, and it was designed with the intention of one day hosting dirigibles which could carry passengers and mail between the building and other locations. However, the process of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was fraught with a variety of obstacles.

The most significant obstacle the builders had to overcome was the need to come up with a mooring mast. A mooring mast was an elevated structure upon which the dirigible could be tied so that it could be safely secured. The mooring mast had to be tall enough to allow the dirigible to drop its anchor over the edge of the building, yet it was difficult to create something that could withstand the wind of a dirigible pulling away from a structure. To solve this issue, the builders developed a vertical steel framework, called a spire, which extended 200 feet above the top of the building. The spire was capable of withstanding tremendous amounts of force and could be used to secure the dirigible, allowing it to dock at the Empire State Building safely.

Another obstacle the Empire State Building builders had to overcome was the fear of hydrogen gas. Dirigibles were powered by hydrogen gas, which could be highly combustible. The Empire State Building was already located in one of the busiest parts of New York
