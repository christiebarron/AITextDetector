The author ends the poem with this line to emphasize the cyclical nature of the seasons. The line implies that no matter how often things change, if we persevere, we can see some of the same events happen each year. The line also serves to provide a hopeful message about how hard work pays off, even if the outcome isn't immediately clear.
