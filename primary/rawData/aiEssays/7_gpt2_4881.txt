An example of a time someone in my life was patient was someone calling herself Amy and complaining about how many days she's out in her apartment. The person said that she hadn't lived to see her husband (she probably couldn't be that happy as Amy did when she started complaining), and this person went mad yelling at her for using a condom in her car. The friend then pulled the person up to the apartment, and when the person sat down she immediately began complaining about how many days she was out. It took me until three years later to realize that I was lying about some things in my past and I wasn't really the person that used a condom myself. I now know that I shouldn't be doing something like that because that's when I realized what the "evidence exists" was just a myth that made my life miserable (and my family's) at some point. If they could talk me out of using a condom, or at least talk me out of doing this a friend would have. I would like them to know I am not lying. I have never had the courage to call myself a "rape apologist" and a "counselor" for any of my girlfriends in the past. If they really cared she would just explain herself like that when explaining why I don't like using a condom. We are all human creatures and so if I would just have to give my life back and not "tell them all my lies" I wouldn't have any problems.
