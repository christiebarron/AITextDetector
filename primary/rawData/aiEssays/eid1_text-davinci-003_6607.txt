Dear Editor,

Recently, people have become more and more reliant on computers for work and leisure. While computers have made our lives easier in many ways, it is also important to be aware of the effects that computers have had on us.

It is undeniable that computers have brought about great efficiency, convenience, and productivity in our daily lives. For example, with the help of computers and the internet, we can now look up information, shop, work, and communicate instantly without leaving the comfort of our homes.

However, it is also important to acknowledge the fact that computers have caused an increase in sedentary lifestyles. With the ability to do almost anything from our living rooms, citizens are less likely to leave their homes and more likely stay inactive for long periods of time. This has been associated with an increase in the rate of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease, to name a few. In addition, computers have caused us to become overly reliant, as we come to rely more heavily on technology and less on our own personal knowledge.

In light of the above, it is imperative that we start to pay more attention to the effects computers have had on our behaviors, lifestyles, and mental health. We should strive to find a balance between the use of technological aids and the maintenance of healthy lifestyles.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
 
[Your Name]
