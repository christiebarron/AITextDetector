One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I had to leave the family home after the family got home with my kids. I heard it in their voices saying my wife is getting mad. It got so bad for me I forgot to put an address when I leave, she could see the kids crying. I've had to come back home a lot.


If you were still feeling angry and upset you can go to the store again and ask how you feel at the restaurant. If there is some reason for your disappointment I'd like you to call and ask why you weren't happier with your stay.


Hope this is any help for you getting better at what you do. This is a real life thing. In the past you would see people in your life. Now you just can't. Some people know what you can do, if they don't they end up thinking of trying something and eventually that's not what you're trying. What are you supposed to do? When you feel that you need help you need to take care of yourself and help others. If you do this you can really help others and really help everyone.
