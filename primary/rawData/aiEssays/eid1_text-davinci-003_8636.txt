I was out with my friends for dinner and everyone was sitting around the table sharing stories. I had split a bottle of wine with my best friend and the laughter just kept flowing. We were in stitches over the funny stories and memories when I got the wild idea to start a game. I proposed a game of laughter where anyone could start a laugh chain by telling a joke or funny story. Whoever’s story provoked the most laughter was the winner.

We were laughing so hard it was nearly impossible to pick a winner, but eventually my best friend won the game with an old, outrageous story from college. His laughter was contagious and by the end of the night, we’d all laughed ourselves into tears. Everyone felt lighter after that game of laughter and I knew our friendship was stronger for it.
