I was late to work the other day, and I immediately started worrying about what my boss would think of me and what sort of an impression I had made. I was sure I was in for a talking-to. However, when I sheepishly shuffled into my office, my boss said nothing! I expected for him to comment on my tardiness, yet he simply asked me how my morning was and then discussed our current projects. 

I was amazed by his patience and understanding. Though I was feeling quite guilty, he seemed to put aside my lateness and made no demands of me. He gave me the space I needed to process my feelings without feeling judged or criticized. It was clear that the office wasn't a place where you were looked down upon for making a mistakeâ€”it was a welcoming place that accepted me.

The experience was truly transformative and taught me the power of displaying compassion and exhibiting patience. I now strive to practice that same level of understanding both in my professional and personal life.
