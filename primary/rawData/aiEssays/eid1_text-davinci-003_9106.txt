Dear Editor,

With the advances in technology, computers have become an integral part of our lives. From helping us with everyday tasks to connecting us with the world, computers are deeply intertwined with our lives. As such, it is important to consider the effects that computers have on people.

I am of the opinion that computers are beneficial for people in many ways. They allow us to access information quickly and easily. This is especially valuable for students, who are able to access course material with a few clicks. Additionally, computers can help people stay better organized by allowing us to create and store digital files.

Apart from their use in educational and work contexts, computers can also act as a means of communication and entertainment. Through myriad applications like Skype, Zoom and Netflix, people can socialize and make connections with others around the world. Games such as strategy-based or puzzle-solving titles also provide endless fun and help people develop skills such as critical thinking and problem-solving.

In conclusion, it is clear that computers play a major role in todayâ€™s world and can have positive effects on people if used properly. Therefore, I encourage readers to take advantage of this technology and use it in a constructive and responsible way. 

Sincerely, 

[Name]
