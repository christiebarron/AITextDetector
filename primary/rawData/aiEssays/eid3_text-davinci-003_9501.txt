In Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead”, the cyclist is faced with the challenge of a rough road ahead, complete with “huge ruts, potholes, and gravel.” The main character ventures off the trail and into the wilderness, determined to tackle the rough terrain in order to gain a better understanding of what it means to truly “push and endure.” In this journey, the cyclist faces several obstacles posed by the setting, all of which affect the cyclist’s physical and mental state, as well as their overall performance.

The various features of the setting that the cyclist encounters present several unique challenges. For instance, the enormous ruts make it difficult for the cyclist to maintain a steady, balanced speed. The potholes present another challenge as the cyclist must constantly be alert in order to avoid them. Additionally, the gravel is another hazard due to its unpredictability and the slippery surfaces it creates. All of these features in the setting force the cyclist to make quick, yet precise decisions in order to remain safe and efficient. 

The cyclist must also adjust their technique in order to compensate for the various features of the setting. The large ruts require precise positioning in order to avoid collisions and potential falls. The cyclist also needs to be prepared to anticipate sudden shifts in the terrain, such as sudden changes in the stones and gravel below the tires. These unpredictable changes can easily lead to a loss
