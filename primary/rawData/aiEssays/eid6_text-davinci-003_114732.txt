It was built with the intention of providing a place to moor dirigibles, as airships were gaining in popularity during the 1930s. However, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building had to face in order to make it possible for dirigibles to dock.

Safety was an immediate concern. Airships such as the Hindenburg were incredibly volatile, and the builders had to make sure they could accommodate the size and weight, as well as the fuel and hydrogen needed to operate them. To achieve this, they installed a 200-foot tall mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, the tallest at the time. This was designed to act as a stable, immovable platform for the airship to moor onto, as well as a shelter for the crew to access ground level. In addition, they also had to develop procedures and safeguards to protect against structural collapses and fires.

Other subtler issues also had to be addressed. Primarily, they needed to ensure the mooring mast would not have a negative impact on the Empire State Building’s skyline. The mooring mast had to be carefully designed in order not to compromise the aesthetics of the building. Furthermore, the ban preventing dirigibles from flying within certain altitudes over Manhattan would have to be lifted by the Air Commerce Department. This meant
