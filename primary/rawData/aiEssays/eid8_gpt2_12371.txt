One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I spent a few days doing a math class at work. My classmates came up to me, told me that I was hilarious and asked to come with me. I wanted to know when all the magic was over, how old did I really look, and how much I enjoyed hanging around their house while they were laughing. But no matter how funny they all thought I was, they didn't seem to grasp the significance of my humor.

In 1999, I started blogging and then began teaching. My passion and work ethic began to match my own. Over the years I've learned how to share my life and humor on Facebook or Twitter, and my social media presence has risen. In 2007, my first book was published, I was the recipient of a prestigious $100,000 grant from the Foundation for Children with Autism (F.C.A.), and in 2013 I was named the best-selling author of Girls Gone Wild.

On a personal note, I'm happy that I've become a better writer. As I said in my last post, I started blogging last November after starting off my life in the classroom as a kid. This past summer I took the subject out of my hands, I tried out books from the library, and I created an Instagram series dedicated to blogging.

Today I'm in the process of posting my first post on Facebook just to give a few things to think about when you're writing.
