Dear Editor:

As ubiquitous as computers have become in our lives today, it’s become almost impossible to ignore their impact on people. As technology constantly advances, the impact of computers on people continues to increase. Although they have made tasks and communication easier for people, they are also having an adverse effect.

First of all, computers have drastically reduced the interactions people have with other people. Instead of having conversations in person, more and more people are opting for the convenience of text messages and social media. People have also begun replacing their jobs with computers, which results in many people losing their source of income.

Also, computers are drastically affecting our physical and mental health. Excess usage of computers can lead to eye strain, backaches, and carpal tunnel syndrome. Moreover, computers emit blue light, which affects the body’s circadian rhythm, leading to sleep deprivation and physical fatigue. Furthermore, computers have also been linked to depression, social isolation, and anxiety.

Given these effects, I urge everyone to use computers responsibly and limit their physical and mental dependence on them. Let’s strive to keep conversations alive, maintain in-person relationships, and focus on our physical and psychological health
