The author is using this imagery of the Winter Hibiscus to symbolize hope and renewal. The imagery of the blossoming of the Hibiscus brings to mind not only the promise of a beautiful spring but the chance for a fresh start. The protagonist in the story is preparing to take a test, and the author is using this image of the Hibiscus to show that both the protagonist and the reader can take a chance and try again--no matter how much hope may seem to be lost. The metaphor both reinforces the idea that with time and effort one can improve their circumstances, and serves to give the protagonist and the reader a feeling of renewal and hope.
