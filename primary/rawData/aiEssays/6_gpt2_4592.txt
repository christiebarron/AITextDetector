The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

The first of them was with the New York State Building Act, a law signed in 1929 that banned dirigibles without special permit.

The second is the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which shut down many such dirigibles.

The third challenge was the use of a laser pointer in a "virtual airplane" to navigate an open street in Kansas, but was unsuccessful.

All of these obstacles were removed with a laser that would last four years.

The cost to build the laser was $100,000. It costs about $350 at the $30,000 scale; the same laser for nearly every apartment and home that is in storage and on demand.

But one laser and three sets of LED sticks cost a combined $400,000.

According to the Los Angeles Times last fall, the average price of a single LED from the building and its storage unit exceeded $9,000.

The LED bulbs provide a way to display information on the car.

They also produce light for a driver's view in a very visible way.

All in all, there is one car-size option for building dirigs: a laser system mounted to a back window.
