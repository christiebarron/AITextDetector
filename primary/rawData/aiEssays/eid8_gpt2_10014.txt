One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I ran up to my parents in the middle of the night and they said to me, "You're welcome." And there was so much of that, and then I saw people getting married and everything that was happening in the world. People had already started talking about me getting married in Brazil. And I said, "Yeah, it's right there." And one of the things that happened, of course, was because I'm so into it. I just became really involved with it like some kind of religious community.

As a young mom, I just want to feel loved and blessed and be safe.

Now I've tried several times, and to be an adult I want to feel a gift from God.

Some of the things that I do are really, really goodâ€”I can even really feel my heart getting stronger and stronger and better every day. But God wants me to love who I am. And he wants me to feel love and trust with what I'm capable of and what I love. I can't even get to know my partner like that. But people need to love me, and you're always going to love me.

You have one really powerful friend. She's like me in those ways, and it's like you're just playing along with each other, and sometimes things just sort of get to you, but always doing the right things
