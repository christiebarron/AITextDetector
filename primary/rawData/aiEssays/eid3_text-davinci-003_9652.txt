The story begins by introducing the vibrant and varied landscape, beginning with lush grassy fields, lush trees, and high-reaching mountains. This is a world of beauty and nature, a place of endless possibilities and potential for the cyclist to explore.

Next, Kurmaski introduces the "rough road" ahead - a path of rocky ridges, dangerous streams, and old abandoned mines. This road is a harsh contrast to the beauty of the landscape and presents a challenge for the cyclist. Through obstacles such as these, the cyclist must struggle to make progress, testing their strength, endurance, and wits.

Every bend in the road and every obstacle drives the narrative of the story forward, and it is through this journey that we see a physical journey in action. The setting also provides the ideal backdrop for Kurmaski to explore many themes, such as danger, perseverance, and courage.

The setting in "Rough Road Ahead" is integral to the story and provides an essential element to the cyclist's journey. Through the beauty and danger of each landscape, Kurmaski is able to provide an engaging and unique setting that drives the narrative and adds to the whole of the story.
