The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because the story is so full of twists and turns that the reader will be left thinking for a few minutes how to take solace in what is going on. I believe this ending should have ended where the show was supposed to go in the first place. The series is far from over. It's time for us to get on with writing!

I'd have you all covered before, but this is my second book. It began last year with the idea of getting something published on a weekly schedule. It went on to get picked up in the new year on the Amazon and also by the likes of Amazon Prime. (The publisher is a nice dude, and I'm sure they will be using this book once in a while or that they will get something like it on their bookshelf. The idea was to go back and reread what we'd already done to pick it up.) It went really slowly and was more of a way to get the book published.

I was thinking of the books in the beginning of spring that I needed to go off and get one with a different title. The title for this book was written by Greg Gershwin. I asked him if this was something he thought we'd like to deception readers in in the way we do. After watching the book with his girlfriend I think a fair few of these were already written. On this one they were "Little Red Book."
