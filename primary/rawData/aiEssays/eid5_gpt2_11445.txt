The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' reveals an unending quest for new ways to relate to people about their own lives and also the way to engage as a family as a child.

In 'From Home is' she recounts living as a young nurse for six months in a nursing home in the late 1960s. She has struggled to cope with the loss of two older siblings, while their only means of socialising and seeing parents together has been by visiting relatives living in a different setting.

'I realised that all I ever needed was one person to tell the tale of my family,' she writes.

To cope, she was inspired by the book "Meanings of a Young Nurse," a book she published at the age of 13 in 1990
