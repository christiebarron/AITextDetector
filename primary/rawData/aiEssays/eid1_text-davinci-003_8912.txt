Dear Editor:

In this modern age of technology, computers are affecting almost every aspect of our lives. While I acknowledge that computers can be beneficial in a myriad of ways, I believe it is important to consider the potential negative effects they are having on people.

To start, it is no secret that computers can lead to physical health problems. From poor posture to sleep deprivation, the use of computers has been linked to a variety of physical ailments. Computers can also affect mental health. Spending too much time in front of a screen can lead to anxiety and depression, as well as disconnect from reality.

Moreover, computers are impacting the way people interact. In many cases, we are foregoing real-life contact in favor of social media. We are becoming so wrapped up in our devices that we are missing out on face-to-face interactions, leading to a decrease in long-lasting interpersonal relationships.

Finally, I believe computers are having a particularly negative influence on children. Without knowing how to properly interact in person, kids are missing out on essential social skills to navigate the world. This could lead to more serious issues such as isolation, resentment, and anger.

In conclusion, while computers have the potential to do great things, there is real cause for concern on its potential negative effects on people. As a society, I believe it is important for us to consider these issues and strive for a healthy balance when it comes to using computers.
