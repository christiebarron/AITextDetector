The idea of constructing an iconic building with a dock so that dirigibles (airships) could dock and explore the city of New York is an ambitious feat. The ambitious project of creating a mooring mast for dirigibles was a part of the very construction of the Empire State Building. Although the builders set out with the noble and progressive vision of a space age-like way to explore the city, there were many obstacles they encountered.

One of the most obvious challenges the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the sheer scale of the project and the massive amount of engineering and design that would have been required. Although the conventional attitude of the time was that the Empire State Building was the biggest building on the planet, it was not designed or created with the aerodynamic needs of dirigibles in mind. The mooring mast could not extend high up past the top of the building, and since the building wasnâ€™t aerodynamically designed, a special mast and heavy platform would have to constructed to extend out at the top of the Empire State Building in order to safely dock the dirigibles. 

Another obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in constructing a mooring mast was the potential cost of the project. Air travel had yet to become a fully realized industry, so dirigibles were still thought of as transportation of the rich. Having a mooring mast outside the top of the Empire State Building would have been an
