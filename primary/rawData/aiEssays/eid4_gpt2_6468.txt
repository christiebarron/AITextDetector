He tells us of his ministry to Jesus Christ and of his efforts to convince the early Saints and to preach more clearly to the rest of the people and of how they should behave in his Gospel of Matthew, but we shall not find in the final chapter any written instruction to show how he developed and taught it. On the other hand, though he told the general story of his ministry, his actions and his character showed the depth and character of his thinking and character of doctrine.
