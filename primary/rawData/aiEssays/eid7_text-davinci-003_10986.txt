Sometimes patience can be hard to come by. I remember one time when I was on a fourteen hour flight with my young daughter. We had a layover at JFK airport in New York and since my daughter was only six at the time, it was a real struggle to keep her entertained.

We only had a couple of hours to kill before our connecting flight, but it seemed to last forever. We walked around the airport, went to get lunch, and played some games but after an hour or so, my daughter was getting really restless. She started throwing a fit, running off in the airport, and making a huge scene.

At first I was really frustrated and ready to head home, but then I stopped and decided it was important to stay patient. My daughter was just tired and bored and really didn't know how to express it. I took a deep breath, tried to stay positive and kept her busy until the next flight.

It took a lot of effort and patience, but finally our plane was called and we made it on to our connecting flight. It wasn't the most pleasant experience but it was definitely an exercise in patience.
