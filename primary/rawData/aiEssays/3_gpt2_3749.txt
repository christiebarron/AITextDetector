Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. Not only do the new rules offer for cyclists to use more space, as well as to change the colour of the roads and the conditions for the most common 'road closures', but on a whole-hearted basis, they also allow car parks (and so on) to be constructed within walking distance of each other. Many cyclists don't even have to turn to take the car or bus to go about their lives either. They can still use the standard cycling route of one road where the lights are already on. You can walk or bike along any of the roadside trails you like without having to navigate your way from one location to another. And even if you haven't already put up such big enough signs calling for cyclists to do their part in improving road conditions, just waiting for the cars to get ahead, rather than having to wait until they hit their brakes and head straight home, you can get off the bike and head home free again!
