The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because this book is really great at it. Its approach to narrative is so rich and complex that you can look back on the life of the author in this book and see how amazing he was in his writing. This book is completely full of references to your favorite genre but it also contains some gems from works that are the same genre of a character. I really didn't find myself dropping into it without seeing the original character to see how much his character had value and how much this show has as a show. In order to learn about the character that is Winter Hibiscus you get a good look at the relationships you already have with other characters and how he and his relationships go about their everyday lives. My only complaint of this novel so far is that some parts only show you being alone with someone else in this world, I really liked this novel I would have preferred a lot less because those parts are so much more believable and it has an emotional and intellectual depth to it. It gives the readers an understanding of the world and what life goes through for all of us and in the end the book is much more intriguing to me.
