The construction of the Empire State Building posed a unique challenge for its architects and engineers: finding a way to permitted dirigibles, or airships, to dock safely. With dreams of a public transportation revolution, the architects and engineers involved in the project wanted to make certain that the immense building would be up to the task.

The biggest obstacle faced by the designers was the structure of the Empire State Building itself. As the world’s tallest skyscraper, the building’s 1,250ft height presented a unique challenge for approaches and moorings. To ensure that passengers could disembark safely without risk of injury, the building needed to be equipped with the proper structures and mechanics. 

As outlined in the book The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the building's architects implemented a two-stage approach. The first step was designing a 400 ft mast for the airships to moor upon. This was a critical component, for it provided increased stability and a lower approach point for dirigibles. The next step was building a landing platform at the top of the building, 200 feet below the mast. This landing platform would serve as the embarkation point for the airships, allowing passengers to disembark and board in relative safety.

The challenges weren't limited to the structure of the building, however. Even the smallest mistake could prove disastrous for the airships, and the blowing winds of New York City posed a major threat to
