The mood created in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, is one of nostalgia and remembrance. Through vivid recollections of growing up in Detroit in the 1970s, Rodriguez paints a picture of familial love, faith, and resilienceâ€”all of which is touched with sadness due to the city's economic and social decline during the time period.

The memoir starts off on an optimistic note, with Rodriguez describing his childhood neighborhood as an "idyllic sort of paradise," complete with outdoor activities, seemingly unending playmates, and the warmth of extended family and friends. This idea of a safe havens is further strengthened through discussion of Rodriguez's mother's faith, and his own attendance of a local Jesuit school.

However, there is a darker side to the memory which creeps into the memoir's mood. Rodriguez talks of a building violence and racism, as well as the city's continued decline into economic hardship. Despite this, he and those around him maintain a strong sense of familial and religious devotion. This idea of perseverance in the face of difficulty is a theme that runs throughout the memoir and is a source of strength and comfort.

Ultimately, From Home: The Blueprints of our Lives is a loving homage to both Rodriguez's family and Detroit, a city that has seen its share of struggles. The nostalgia it conveys is one of the warmth and hope amidst difficult times, and a reminder of what is truly important and lasting in
