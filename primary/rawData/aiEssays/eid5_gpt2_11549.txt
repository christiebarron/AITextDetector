The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is a starkly different story to one that is being told by President Trump's first few days in office. A series of emails and calls between Trump associates and Russian officials have fueled outrage, suggesting an anti-American campaign, while also showing the "rigging" done by members of the Trump team, makes clear the Trump campaign is at loggerheads with the Russians. The emails and calls illustrate how both the Kremlin and Trump's team are Possible Trump Campaign Manager Corey Lewandowski.

Trump has been forced to defend himself, saying "The Russians hacked into our election. That's a crime, and I can defend myself!" However, Lewandowski, a former Trump campaign staffer, has denied such claims. Lewandowski is now a top campaign aide.

This email is from April 2, 2017 and is from James Risen, our special correspondent for The Washington Post and a senior adviser to Trump and his transition team while in the government in February 2017. It appears to reflect a meeting within the Trump team at which Trump said that WikiLeaks had an internal investigation.

Lewandowski said his goal was to "get the people down" in Washington, while also admitting that it is harder for "some men and a few women" and "there is a disconnect."

This email was sent out on Saturday, Aug. 31, when another top campaign staffer in the Trump organization was making a major presentation on the future of American democracy
