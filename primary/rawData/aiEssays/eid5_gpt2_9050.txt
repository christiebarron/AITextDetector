The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is a mixture of awe, dread, and hope as people feel their faith and the strength that they have at hand to do better is slowly but surely spreading throughout the world.

The book is a self-contained read that is read through by many people, and I encourage you to try and read this carefully before picking it up. I love to re-read this book.

"From Home is" is available on Amazon.
