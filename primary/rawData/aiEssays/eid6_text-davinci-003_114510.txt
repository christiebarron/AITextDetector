The idea of constructing a mooring mast on the Empire State Building in order to allow dirigibles to dock was a feat of engineering seldom attempted at the time. The obstacle of building a high structure that would withstand the powerful gusts of wind, enable the dirigibles to maneuver precisely and securely, and then hold them in place while docked was daunting, yet the engineers of the mid-twentieth century were determined to make it work.

The first challenge for the architects and engineers was to determine the most appropriate type of mast for the Empire State Building. The mast had to be incredibly sturdy, tall enough to clear the height of the building, and had to be able to secure the large dirigibles in place. Ultimately, the engineers settled on constructing a lattice-work steel mast of webbing and cross-bracing with a large, hinged joint at the base, the mooring bridge.

The second challenge was to make sure the mast would anchor the dirigibles in place. To ensure its stability, the engineers developed a system of interlocking steel pieces—a triangle of steel triangles—that was 5 feet wide and 6 feet tall. This combination of the mooring bridge and the triangle-box securely connected the bridge to the anchor platform at the top of the building.

The third challenge in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was constructing the anchor platform. Since the mooring mast
