The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' was clear:

" minimally the women in my family felt threatened by the idea of having family and friends in my house, particularly if I had children. I didn't think that women who are fathers and mothers should be allowed to feel unwelcome, if the thought of having a father's caretaker (father's name on the certificate) means so much more to an individual than a father. It makes me wonder whether, even if they want someone, they don't want some to feel too safe or entitled to feel unwelcome."

But these were the kinds of policies that were the main factor in my son's death.

"They should have asked the family and friends, not me."

We thought for a long while about the idea of seeing such a relationship between men and women â€” or even their separate social roles, such as a wife-beating a baby. After a few months they made a decision:

"We will have to work harder and harder to have meaningful relationships with some of the more open men. At the very best we might be able to just wait for all the same groups to find something that is okay."

And the best of both worlds, at very least.
