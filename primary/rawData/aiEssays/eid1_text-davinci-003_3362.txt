Dear Editor:

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have had on people's lives. As technology advances and the world grows more connected, computers have slowly become ingrained into our daily lives.

That said, computers can have both positive and negative effects on people. In today's world, computers can lessen manual labor, making tasks easier. They can also facilitate communication from one person to another, allowing for quick and efficient communication. Further, computers can serve as an important component in education, offering new and innovative ways of teaching.

On the other hand, computers can have a negative impact on people. As computer use has become ubiquitous, its overuse can lead to fatigue and can even hamper attention span. Furthermore, the use of computers has been linked to physical health issues such as carpal tunnel and neck and back pain. Additionally, computers have been known to promote isolation and depression due to over-exposure to the screens.

As such, I firmly believe that computers should be used judiciously and that they can lead to great benefits if used responsibly. For instance, if a person takes occasional breaks from computer use, it can lead to improved productivity and better physical and mental wellbeing
