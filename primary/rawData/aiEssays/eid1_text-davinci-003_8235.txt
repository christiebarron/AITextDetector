The Empire State Building was the world’s first fully realized skyscraper when it opened in 1931. Its majestic white spire made it a beacon of innovation and progress, but before the building could truly become iconic, it was missing one thing: an airship docking station. Dirigibles, or airships, had been gaining popularity in the United States throughout the 1920s, and the flying machines added a new dimension to the art deco skyline.

Despite the potential of airship docking, the construction of the Empire State Building presented a variety of obstacles. When dirigibles moored, they could not reach the tower’s roof due to the height of the building and the altitude at which they flew. Instead, a special “Mooring Mast” was proposed for the rooftop of the Empire State Building. This mast, comprising of steel beams topped with a wind catcher, would support the dirigible during mooring operations.

However, there were a number of technical difficulties. Dirigible captain and engineer Dr. Hugo Eckener, who had pioneered the feasibility of mooring a dirigible to a building, wrote to the builders of the Empire State Building to warn them of the needed safety and structural measures. He emphasized the importance of making the mast and its accompanying anchoring systems sturdy and secure in order to support the weight of the airship. In addition, the mast had to be located in a wind-free area and properly
