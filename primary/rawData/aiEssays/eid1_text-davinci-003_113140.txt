Dear Editor,

Throughout the years, computers and technology have become essential parts of our lives. Computers are used in businesses, schools, and homes across the world to facilitate communication and productivity. While some people claim that computers create negative effects on a person’s mental and physical health, I believe that computer use can be beneficial with proper moderation.

There have been some potential downsides to computers, but I don’t think they are as severe as some people claim. Computers can create problems such as increasing stress levels and decreasing physical activity levels. However, these issues can be managed with a balanced lifestyle and moderation. Sitting in front of a computer all day can be a strain on the body, so it’s important to take regular breaks and practice healthy self-care.

On the other hand, computers can have positive effects on people. Users can become more creative and multitask better as they learn how to use various programs and applications. Computers can also be great social tools, allowing for online chat sessions and group activities with friends.

In conclusion, I believe that computers can positively or negatively impact people depending on their usage and moderation. I would encourage readers to think carefully about how much time they spend in front of a computer and to stay active and social with others.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
