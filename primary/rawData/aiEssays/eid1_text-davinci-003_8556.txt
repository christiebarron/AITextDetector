I was running an errand for my grandmother when I stopped at the post office to pick up a package. I could tell the clerk was not having a good day. He was short with me and kept sighing while he sifted through the packages. I was in a bit of a hurry, but I took a deep breath and remained patient. 

I smiled and reminded myself that everyone has a bad day and that being impatient wasn't going to make his job any easier. After a few minutes, he found the package and apologized for the inconvenience. His demeanor changed after that and he was much more courteous. I thanked him and left the post office feeling proud that I had been patient in the situation.
