One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my brother had walked me across the stage to play the video for the film and I was terrified to face him. I remember laughing as he screamed and the sound was so strong that it felt like I was on fire. He was so strong you couldn't hear what he was saying and I was frightened but I got out of there and my brother saw me again and said: 'You mean to tell us to shut our head? You are the greatest!' - I remember laughing more and more.


The film itself is pretty good. There are some fantastic sequences which just go right to the heart of how powerful the film really is. It is a wonderful movie by far in relation to the way that Gollimieux is brought about, but also in ways it just goes beyond any one aspect of its story. I also want to say that its action is quite unique. It never gives enough space to the story because everything you see in the film is actually there. From the way it takes place to the way the actors and film makers interact with it, to the way a large part of the audience reacts, to what the camera does, and so forth. This is the kind of film I would like a sequel to but I am not sure what exactly that would be.
