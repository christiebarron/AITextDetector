I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a serious problem... The only issue with this is that the problem does not actually exist in the first place... It's completely a function of the situation. I have found that censorship or censorship of a type we all live with — whether it's in schools, government or the media — is a terrible thing because what it is truly trying to do is that it encourages a mentality that goes to other areas which would normally be more difficult to enforce.

This was also stated in the first letter to the Department of the Library of Congress by Robert Jackson.

Now, to put it plainly, there is no reason to believe there could not be serious harm from censorship.

I just want to be clear. It is not possible for the Library of Congress to censor information on the Internet

If they're even trying to do so, that would mean it should be very easy to censor them. But that's pretty much what they've been saying for quite some time today.

As for the question of censorship itself, there is very good reason why censorship should not have a great, if any, impact on the amount of information that people have access to the Internet.

I have seen it said in the past that it is perfectly acceptable, and now it's not so much acceptable as downright shameful.

And I will certainly not condone censorship of information that is critical of the culture of the United States
