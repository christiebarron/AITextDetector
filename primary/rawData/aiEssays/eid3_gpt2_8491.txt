Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

It's worth reflecting on a few key areas where these modes are useful.

A mode to keep your wheels on a flat run. For example, the 'Rough Road Ahead' setting in cycling guide says: "Don't be shy. Don't be so shy. Don't let the wind blow your tyres, so that you crash. Don't go too fast, 'cause your wheels will come to a stop. Don't go in the wrong direction - leave it all there at first and get started."

As a general rule of thumb, setting up a 'Rough Road Ahead' is a good first step.

Make sure your FAR is up to date - check with your insurance agency or local road safety service if they have it up to date (and can be relied upon to help). Also, a bit of information about the weather will confirm your safety. Also, be extra careful as you may find there is a huge, loud and clear wind blowing.
