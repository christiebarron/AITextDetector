I believe that censorship of materials in libraries are a criminal act. There is no definition of material.

The law is important, but it is only important enough to protect the public from harm. It has been proven that, contrary to what it appears, censorship is not possible in libraries. For those concerned that the law will harm libraries or that libraries will lose a significant number of their staff, I'd urge anyone who cares about copyright law to consider whether they can apply for a state license to access content stored at private libraries. This would make the process of obtaining the private license very difficult.

There are few things that should stop the collection or destruction of copyrighted material (particularly at the libraries). It's time to stop looking at the situation from the wrong and start looking at the law itself.


I'd like to propose a proposal to clarify the definition of censorship. If a library is forbidden from publishing material within a particular time frame, the right would be limited to a ten minute window. There would be no limit to the amount of time the library may remain free to publish content.

If there are significant, but not permanent, losses of staff at the library, I would prefer to find a permanent solution by either abolishing the library entirely or, in my opinion, eliminating its freedom from all censorship.


This is about copyright and the law. The public does not have an absolute right to express information on copyright. Nor do we have to hold anyone accountable
