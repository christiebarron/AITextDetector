I still remember the moment like it was yesterday. Back when I was a kid, my best friend and I had a great relationship filled with lots of laughter. It was a sunny day in June and our families had decided to have a BBQ together in the backyard. I had brought an old-fashioned kite with me and managed to get it up in the air in no time.

My friend and I were so excited as we tried desperately to keep the kite in the air. But no matter what we did, it just wouldn't stay up. We must have looked so silly in our little kite-flying battle!

I was ready to give up when my friend started to laugh. At first, I was a bit annoyed. After all, it wouldn't take much effort for him to be a little more sympathetic. But then I started to laugh too. His infectious laugh was a reminder that we were just two little kids trying to have some fun, and it was exactly what I needed to keep going.

Our shared laughter made it so much easier to fly the kite and, eventually, we got some great height and got a few minutes of that beautiful kite-flying feeling. It was a moment that neither of us will ever forget, and we still bring up the memory and share a laugh whenever weâ€™re together.
