An example of a time someone in my life was patient was someone on the ground trying enslaved men who did not want to die for our country.

I asked him to let me stay in the U.S. We stayed, and we were still able to survive a horrible situation. We were able to keep out of Vietnam, and we stayed strong in our home country.

Those people made sense, and they were like a hero. We lived a life of strength, living a good life, staying strong for our own country, and they supported us.

In the past 12 years, we have been able to return to a more successful life in our local community, like it is now in the United States.

I love to talk about our history, but I'm having a hard time understanding what our history is. We didn't have those people to make us safe. Those were our children. And those were our parents.

The past 12 years, we have been able to return to a more successful life in our local community, like it is now in the United States. You remember that.

A lot of people are disappointed not to see us back from Vietnam, but to see that we never lost hope. There was so much, so much promise there. This is really our story.

I love our new government, and it has been very inspiring. We're going to be able to return to our heritage of being a family.
