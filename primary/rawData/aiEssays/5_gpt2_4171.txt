The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' suggests, to a large extent, that many members of the military and police feel the need to fight the insurgency now that the US military is not part of coalition operations.

The campaign, which involves US soldiers using water cannon to block Iraqi forces from advancing for months at a time, may well be the most popular way of countering insurgency forces, according to recent opinion polls.

Some 20% of Isis recruits say that, with US involvement, the military could succeed without being involved in the conflict, according to a new Ipsos Mori poll.

The survey of 1,600 UK, United States and other respondents was conducted from May 21-27 by Ipsos Mori (Pew Research Centre). (Reporting by Kate Miller in London; Editing by Alison Williams)
