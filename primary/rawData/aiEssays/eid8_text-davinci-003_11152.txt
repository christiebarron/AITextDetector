 

I remember the first time I met my best friend. We were only children, so we didn’t know much about making friends or having long conversations. When we were sitting outside one day, I made a silly face and he laughed. I had never seen anybody laugh so hard before! 

After that, we started spending more and more time together. Our conversations were always filled with laughter, and I think that’s why we became such close friends. We even started to joke around and make fun of each other in a good-natured way. 

Whenever I was around my best friend, I couldn’t help but laugh. His sense of humor was amazing and I would often find myself laughing uncontrollably. We shared so many funny moments that it’s hard to think back on without smiling. 

Having that bond of laughter has been so important to our friendship over the years. Even when we’re not together, I know that no matter where I am, my best friend and I are connected by a shared laughter that will always be there.
