The author of Winter Hibiscus, Minfong Ho, wanted to end her story with a message of hope. The image of the hibiscus budding in the spring represents a metaphor for the difficulties faced by the narrator's family, particularly in terms of taking the tests needed to gain entry into the United States. The narrator is faced with the challenge of taking the tests repeatedly, as each can offer a different type of opportunity for the future. By ending the story with the hope that they will return in the spring and try the test again, Ho is expressing the idea that the narrator and her family can still reach for their dreams, no matter how difficult things may seem.
