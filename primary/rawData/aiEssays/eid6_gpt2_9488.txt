In the early 1700s, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. This was mainly because the public was increasingly distracted by the need for a public accommodation. This has been attributed to the lack of accommodation for the early settlers who were confined to the narrow, low-lying, isolated community of Shirer. In 1850, a local newspaper reported that those confined to the lower levels outside of Shirer had difficulty sleeping and "were driven a short time to seek refuge at St. Stephen's (later called the Quonset, now St. James's). After a few weeks' confinement, they finally made up their minds in the following month. The Quonset was closed in 1859 and it would be nearly an entire century before the Empire State was built â€” unless one were to go to Shirer and climb through the huge and winding "Wyphotic" gate that followed it.

One reason why the Empire State Building was such a good building was the size. It served as a building for both Englishmen and Dutchmen, and was a central hub of the area.

In 1874, the City of Worcester proposed a large tower as a "new government property" named after Captain Sir Stephen Sidney of the Worcester Volunteer
