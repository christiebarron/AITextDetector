My closest friend and I have been inseparable since elementary school. We can always rely on each other to pick up the phone and chat for hours if we're having a bad day. 

Recently, we had an impromptu Zoom catch up during a particularly stressful week. We had only been talking for a few minutes before I found myself telling her some really dumb jokes that would probably only make sense to us.

Before I knew it, we were both in fits of laughter with tears streaming down our faces. Since we have been virtual for so long due to the pandemic, this experience felt especially special and reminded me how much I cherish our friendship. This laughter brought us together in a way that only being face-to-face can and was an instant reminder of why we are such good friends. 

Later that night, after our call, I still found myself smiling as I fell asleep. This is why laughter is such an incredible force for bringing people closer- it has the power to lift our spirits, spark joy, and deepen our relationships.
