An example of a time someone in my life was patient was me. The time I was the patient was, "Oh, I should do that." "How do you mean? Like a doctor?" "Because I'm from, say, New York City." "Well, when I'd rather be done. I'd rather be dead right now." I'm pretty certain in retrospect, I've said these things so many times, "Oh yeah, I think I should've done this. I thought it would be a great idea." I thought it would've been great when they got all sorts of publicity about it. But I think it was just a case of too many times I think, "You can't get it out there as long as I'm doing it. I'm gonna do it. I'll do it, let's see what happens. Then I'm not going to do it again." I don't think I'd have done it in the way others thought it was, but in some ways I definitely did it. I think I got the biggest hits out of it."

So, with that, I don't know where to start now, but hopefully, in the next couple of years, you'll be on '60s shows that'll be more like '80s but also, like you said, you'll have something of an alternate reality and that will be good for you as well.
