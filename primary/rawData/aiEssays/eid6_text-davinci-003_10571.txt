The building of the Empire State Building presented many obstacles with regards to allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. The vision of the airship docking at the Empire State Building was a bold undertaking and one that could only be achieved by an incredible amount of thought and innovation. In Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s book, The Mooring Mast, she details the many obstacles faced by the builders as they tried to make this daring feat a reality. 

The first obstacle was structural stability. Although the building was designed for flight passenger use, the structure was not designed to hold the weight of an airship on the top. Additional steel had to be added to the building in order to strengthen it enough for an airship to dock. The additional weight had to be distributed evenly so that it would not interfere with the overall structural integrity of the building. 

The second obstacle was the need for a mechanical system that would attach the airship to the mooring mast. The system had to be strong enough to withstand the winds at the top of the building and to control the movements of the airship while it was docked. A system of levers and pulleys needed to be designed and it had to be able to handle the extreme forces of wind and motion of the airship during the mooring process.

The third obstacle related to dirigible airships themselves. The ships were filled with highly flammable hydrogen gas,
