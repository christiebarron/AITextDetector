A few years ago, I was on a road trip with my family. We had been driving for many hours and my siblings were becoming increasingly restless and agitated. My parents, however, remained calm and patient. They kept encouraging us to take breaks, get some fresh air and have a snack.

When we finally arrived at our destination, I couldn't help but notice how organized and relaxed everyone was. I realized that this was due to my parentsâ€™ patience; if they had reacted to our outbursts and agitation, we might have arrived in a much different state.

I have to admit that I was pleasantly impressed and inspired by my parents patience. In situations like this since, I've made an effort to remain calm and patient for the sake of creating a more pleasant atmosphere.
