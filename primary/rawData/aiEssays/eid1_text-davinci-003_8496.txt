I vividly remember the time I was incredibly patient. It was about two years ago when I had just gotten a new job at a large company. I was extremely eager to prove myself but found out that the onboarding process was incredibly slow-paced. Every training session and meeting lasted eternally long, often going well past lunchtime.

I was initially very restless, constantly checking the clock as if I were waiting for someone. All of my co-workers were equally frustrated and voiced their concerns but I held my tongue. Instead, I concentrated on being an active participant and learning as much as possible during the onboarding period.

I began to look at the long meetings and trainings as opportunities to get more familiar with the company. It was like putting together a puzzle for me-one snippet of information at a time. I firmly believe that, by being patient and actually taking the initiative to learn everything I could, I got more of a head start.

Despite all of the seemingly-endless lectures and processes, I eventually became comfortable in my new role. That patience I had while waiting for the full onboarding was worth all of the restless days. It taught me a valuable lesson of hard work and determination that I still carry with me today.
