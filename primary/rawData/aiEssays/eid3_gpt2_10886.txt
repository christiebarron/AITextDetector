Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. For example, at a busy juncture or at a stretch of roads, when a cyclist is trying to walk, the cyclist will see a large number of people in the city, some of whom are already moving. And when a cyclist's ability to walk is reduced, their ability to find safe places to ride and not to have to drive, this can make cycling a more pleasant, safer and convenient choice.

But there is a growing body of evidence that roads in London are far more safe, safer, more efficient and more convenient than the alternatives.
