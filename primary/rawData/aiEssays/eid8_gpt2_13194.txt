One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was living with my mother in Florida who had been a good role model.

I remember saying and her smile was priceless. It was contagious, just like everyone else's. I would talk to her on the phone every day and she would look happy. People would come up to us and ask how we were. People wanted to hear how great she was, and I was there to help them gain acceptance.

It was our time!

Now, I'm back!

I'm back! I'm being treated like anything I've ever been before. I can say to guys, 'Thank you for being so generous and giving you what you deserve!'

I've been working to raise thousands of dollars for my ALS Foundation. In my small capacity, I've worked on fundraisers and events and I've given back!

I've given back more and more.

In fact, I didn't think I could do something like this without your generous and generous support.
