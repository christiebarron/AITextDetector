Dear Stoneham Gazette,

I am writing to share my perspective on the effects computers have on people. While computers have been around for years, peopleâ€™s reliance on them has increased significantly in recent times due to the multitude of ways they can be used.

Computers undoubtedly have many positive effects on people, from increased convenience in our work and leisure activities to the ability to find information faster and more accurately. In addition, computers allow us to take part in exciting new activities such as gaming and video-sharing, helping to make our lives more enjoyable.

However, I also believe that computers have many potentially damaging effects in the wrong hands. For example, people with easy access to them can quickly become addicted to online activities and isolate themselves from the outside world. They may also be exposed to dangerous materials, such as extreme political views, pornographic content, and fake news.

Overall, computers can serve as valuable tools if used correctly, but they can also become a source of harm if misused. Therefore, it is important to educate people about the dangers of spending too much time online and the potential consequences of accepting everything they read on the internet at face value. With this in mind, I urge readers of this newspaper to consider the implications of computers on people, and to recognize that while they can be useful, they can also be highly damaging.

Sincerely,

[Name]
