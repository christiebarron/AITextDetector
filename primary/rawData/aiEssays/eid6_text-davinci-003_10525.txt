In 1934, the world was enthralled by the newly constructed Empire State Building, the world’s tallest structure and America’s first skyscraper. Its soaring height and iconic Art Deco design made it an instantly recognizable symbol of architectural achievement. As such, it quickly became a major draw not only for tourists, but also for the aviation industry, and dirigibles were soon docking at its mooring mast. It was thus the highpoint of the public’s fascination with the technology, and the engineers who helped build the Empire State Building certainly faced their share of challenges. 

One of the first major issues was conquering the architectural mechanics of building a structure that was capable of providing a reliable platform for the large airships. The average exterior wind force the building would have to support far exceeded the limits of any other construction at the time. To tackle this, the engineers employed a unique structural solution, using two thick steel cables intertwined together and then anchored to the inner core walls, offering sufficient stability. To ensure the mooring mast weighed as little as possible, a lightweight metal frame was also used.

The next challenge faced by the engineers was finding a suitable way to get the dirigibles safely latched onto the mooring mast. Other docks employed complex pulley systems, but the Empire State Building required a more efficient solution, due to the sheer volume of ships expected to dock at any given time. To that end, a
