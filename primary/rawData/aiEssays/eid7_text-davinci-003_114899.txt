I remember a time when I was very patient. I was driving to my best friend's house one night and I was stuck in traffic for what seemed like an eternity. Cars were backed up for miles and I could tell that people were getting frustrated and edgy. Despite the situation, I stayed calm and was patient. I cracked the window and cranked up the music to stay in good spirits and distracted. After about two hours, the traffic cleared up and I made it to my friend's house on time. It was a great reminder that no matter how difficult a situation may seem, staying patient and upbeat is always the best approach.
