I still remember the first time I met my now-husband. It was in a group of friends, and I felt so shy that I couldn't say anything. He must have sensed it because he was the one who took the initiative to start a conversation with me.

He looked at me and joked, "If I'd known you were so quiet, I'd have asked you out sooner!"

I was so taken aback but couldn't help but laugh. We talked for hours, and I quickly realized we had a lot in common. We shared the same sense of humor, and we had an easy banter that soon felt like we had been friends for years. 

After that night, we began to spend a lot more time together and eventually started dating. Four years later, we got married and are still laughing today. 

It's funny how that moment of laughter – when he joked at me – was what brought us together. I'm grateful for it every single day.
