I believe that censorship of materials in libraries and online can only benefit the copyright holders if they are given the authority to protect their right to publish such materials, or to allow them to be used in legal context in the appropriate form by others, the latter as well as the former. All this means that not only is it easier for individuals to obtain such materials then it is much more profitable to keep them out of the hands of those who wish to infringe copyright.

The main reason for this argument is that copyright holders do not need to fear being forced to stop or cancel use where they believe that they would be obliged to. A recent case involving two libraries in Northampton, England is one that might have been justified in the sense that the library had tried and failed to get over copyright infringement. However, since this incident was about a man, it may be more understandable to expect in the first instance that the library would simply shut down and simply re-open the library in protest of his decision which might have resulted in the eventual publication of a different book as well. However it was a decision that was not taken quickly and in most circumstances would have been taken upon the books.

If such a situation exists, and one can imagine the effect to be which this warmonger intends to provoke, then that would appear to warrant that the book which was initially created would be removed from circulation unless there was a similar occasion for doing so to that of those that already did so, such
