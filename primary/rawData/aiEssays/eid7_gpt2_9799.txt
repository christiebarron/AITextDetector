An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my own father, father who died as a result of a heart attack in 2007. My father was so shocked and traumatized by that experience, he went to an ambulance. His son was there for over 24 hrs.

His son has been treated at the hospital. I am thinking that a couple of weeks ago when he was in the ICU he went back. In the moment we were at home having lunch, he thought he may have the worst case of cancer. In the end he didn't feel the need to go to the ICU but at the hospital he did.

I think this is perhaps the main story we are dealing with. This is often just a moment that he was thinking of, the next one or two days. There can be times when people can feel things are off for a minute or two. But at the time he was really depressed and there was no way back. This is because he didn't have any sense of life. His sense of life is out.

He's come to recognise he is alive. He doesn't just get up in the morning when the clock is run dry. He can't believe he's come from nothing. It's a feeling he's always had. Because when is he going to come back?

He came out of this coma four months ago and he's on the verge of becoming a man.
