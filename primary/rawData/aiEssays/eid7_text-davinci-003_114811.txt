I had just started my new job and it was overwhelming. I had so much to learn and I found myself getting frustrated with myself. Every day, my boss gave me more tasks and it felt like I could never catch up.

One slow afternoon, my boss asked me to do something that I wasn't familiar with. I was stumped and wasn't sure what to do. Instead of panicking, I took a few deep breaths and asked my boss if he could explain the task to me. He was patient and showed me the steps it would take to complete the task.

I felt so relieved that he took the time to explain it to me, instead of getting angry or impatient with me. Even though I still had a lot to learn, it meant a lot to me that my boss was so patient. He was teaching me, rather than telling me what to do.

I am very grateful for that experience, as it showed me the importance of having patience - both for myself and with others. It is a valuable lesson that I will never forget.
