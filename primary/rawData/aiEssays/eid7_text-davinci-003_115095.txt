One time, my little brother was having a temper tantrum and was being especially difficult. I knew he was tired and that sometimes he just needed to let out his frustrations. Even though I was getting frustrated myself, I reminded myself to stay patient. Instead of getting angry or scolding him, I stayed calm and tried to communicate with him in a gentle manner. Whenever I could see that he was still getting too frustrated, I tried to redirect his focus by playing with him or engaging him in an activity. Finally, after about an hour, he cooled down and I was able to get him to bed without any further disagreement. Even though it was difficult, I was proud of myself for staying patient with my brother in this tough situation.
