The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' â€“ with its clear and lucid narrative, the writing style and characters' reflections of their lives, the book has been very successful, becoming one of the best selling memoirs of the recent past.

Hanging from the cover is the following inscription, from the book: "From Home is my home: an original poem by a writer who loved the poem and knew it intimately. It was created after his illness and that poem never was finished. He wrote in pain, sometimes his life, occasionally his life was long. I hope you enjoy it. All the poems of poetry in the world were written after him but you have to accept the fact he died.

"The meaning of the poem can only be expressed in a short story or two, but I think that at least there is an original text that he left behind, and there are lots of other poems in general. To tell a complete story in this short story is quite nice, and I enjoy writing poems like that, but to write them all in a single page is quite dangerous. You have to ask yourself what the poem meant, and how would you write them, if to do so would take so long, to a point where you can't finish them."
