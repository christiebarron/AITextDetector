The author ends Winter Hibiscus with this line to illustrate how the protagonist, Fay, is able to grow and learn from her previous mistakes, even though the winters in their new home in America can be unforgiving. By linking her academic efforts and her growth as a human being, the author is conveying the idea that Fay is able to overcome adversity in both her education and her life by reflecting on the past and striving for a better future. The author also implies that although she may have failed her test, she will be able to pass it in the future when the spring returns and her hibiscus is blooming. The implication is that by taking the time to reflect and grow, she will be better able to handle life's challenges and be successful both academically and in life.
