I remember the first time I ever really laughed with my best friend. We had known each other since we were 8, but we finally found the courage to really be ourselves when we were around 11-years-old. We were both nerdy and quirky, but it took us a while to realize that was a bond that held us together.

One day, while in the middle of a math lesson in school, I made some silly face on my math paper. I turned to show my friend, and before I could say a single word he burst out laughing. I was taken aback, but soon I was joining him in the laughter. We both thought the part I drew was hilarious!

That moment marked the beginning of a close friendship rooted in mutual adoration and frequent laughter. From that moment on, we weren’t afraid to laugh and make fun of each other in public or in private. Our inside jokes became legendary amongst our peers and we were always there to make each other smile— even in the worst of circumstances.

Years later, I can still feel the warmth of that moment when we laughed together. It was the moment when we both realized that even the silliest things can bring two people together. It’s a lesson that has stayed with me ever since.
