An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when my son was a 12 yr old boy, he was playing in the zoo and the next thing I know my mother came running down to pick him up. My hand fell off with my baby and she went after him to try and bring him up," he said.


He said his daughter had been diagnosed with Down Syndrome.


Police said he was arrested and charged, but he is presently being held in the local police station.

"I've only been here for a year and a half and I haven't had any drug problems," he said.

"I've never had any other problems with my daughter and I'm sure I will make it through this and that'll be my goal for now.

"I plan to go home now and take my son down with me and my family."
