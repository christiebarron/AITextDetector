An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when she was pregnant, so she got the diagnosis, and it said that she was going to have an emergency abortion. She never got to an abortion but she was too ill to look for a doctor because she was pregnant.

I don't want to overstate my gratitude. It's important to know that you're going to have the best care possible, but it's an absolute privilege to speak in front of so many people. And I think that people who are very supportive, like my friend from Minnesota who does health care locale service when I work there, we really do appreciate that.

The fact that I am coming to the stage right now, and I have so many great friends in the industry, and when I came home to Minneapolis and told her that I was coming this year, she laughed and said, "Sure."

She's been doing that since she's been in the US and then her parents moved out. It was just amazing to get that exposure because I never thought anybody would want to make such a big deal about my pregnancy at the end of this season. It's just incredible to see our community, from all different perspectives, come together to do something truly special for the women and girls who live close to our community.

My friend and I are always looking for things to come up in our community, which brings something different to the conversation. It might come out about our health
