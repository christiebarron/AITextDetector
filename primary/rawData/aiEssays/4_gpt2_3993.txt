The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because this is the worst book I've read of all time. You could say that the book was worse because it only has 1 page to read. I understand that you expect to get more on the character's psychology than either the character's background or his training. Also in that book, he doesn't talk much in the book and just seems to be a simple man obsessed to help people find a job. While the book does end up making everyone feel better about themselves, I was really looking forward to seeing a book where he would talk a little bit more and then use that to help others. I found his approach could not have worked if he's doing what he says he wants the way he does. This book has a LOT of action and a lot of emotion all at once so I was happy with that. A lot of that is how I got on my phone with my girlfriend. I think we finally found out about a new author. I liked every chapter and that was that.
