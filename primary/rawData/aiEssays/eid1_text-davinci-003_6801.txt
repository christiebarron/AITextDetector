Dear Editor,

I am writing to address the issue of censorship in libraries. As libraries serve as important resources for accessing information, the availability of a variety of books, music, movies, and magazines is vital. However, I believe it is equally important to consider the impact of materials that are deemed offensive or inappropriate. 

Young children are especially impressionable and should be exposed to age-appropriate content. It is the responsibility of libraries to monitor the materials available, and take steps to ensure that the items on its shelves are suitable for its patrons. In my opinion, specific materials which are found to be offensive should be removed from the shelves, or at least relocated to a section to which only adults can gain access. As an example, books featuring explicit content should not be strung out on the shelves in plain sight where children can access them. 

Furthermore, it is necessary to take into consideration the viewpoints of the various communities that frequent the library. As such, libraries should consider the perspectives of its patronâ€™s diversity of religious, cultural, gender, and racial backgrounds when determining which items should be placed on the shelves.

Censorship in libraries does not necessarily have to be a controversial issue; libraries can ensure the availability of a variety of materials while still catering to the various needs and expectations of the patrons. Taking the appropriate steps to monitor the items available on library shelves is not only reasonable, it is essential. 

Sincerely
