Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. Some are obvious and are obvious in how you move around. However, for those who can handle good pavement or very gentle traffic, a little tweaking may be done to make the terrain a little more inviting. For example, in a relatively narrow section along this stretch of road, the pavement in a single lane can get a little sloped, while along a stretch of pavement which is only a block or two narrower, for instance, the same pavement can get narrower and so on.

Some other variables to consider that are quite obvious to new cyclists, are a good flow of traffic during the day and some driving in the late evening. These are also fairly good indicators of the type of cycle travel to work.

So what is the 'quick fix' to road conditions that most cyclists fall into as they struggle with some of the most confusing roads in America? How about using better riding and a faster pace – a bicycle to stay in good shape, to stay in good and good shape and ride to work, to ride or work where needed and to ride where you want.

In the long run, the quick fix for cycling problem-solving in the U.S. could be quite simple; cycling is a sport and a job – it is what makes Americans good or terrible. However, on more complex roads, there are a lot of places where the quick fix is not an option
