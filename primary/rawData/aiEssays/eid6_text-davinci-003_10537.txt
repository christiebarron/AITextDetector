The building of the Empire State Building was an ambitious engineering feat that took incredible patience and skill to achieve. Among one of the most unique features of the building was the idea of incorporating the ability for dirigibles to dock in order to transport passengers to and from the top of the building. While the idea only became a reality for a brief period of time, the planning and development process was nothing short of a challenge for the builders of the Empire State Building. 

The idea of mooring dirigibles to the top of the Empire State Building was the brainchild of American Engineer Albert Kahn, who dreamed of using the building as the hub for a continental U.S air network. In order to make the idea a reality, the builders of the Empire State Building had to modify the buildingâ€™s structure not only to bear the weight of the ships, but to bear the extreme pressure they would experience while in service. 

To achieve this, the workers of the Empire State Building had to completely repurpose both the exterior and the interior of the building. Firstly, the exterior needed to be modified to include a flat surface large enough for a dirigible to land upon. Heavy cables were affixed to the sides of the building, acting as an anchor and holding the airship steady while in motion. Additionally, the observation deck had to be reinforced to double its original strength to bear the weight of a dirigible.

The interior of the building also
