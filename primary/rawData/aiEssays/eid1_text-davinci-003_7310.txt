In Joe Kurmaski’s story ‘Rough Road Ahead’, the setting of the story plays a pivotal role in conveying the reality of the cyclist’s experience. As the story progresses, the conditions seen by the cyclist become increasingly difficult. 

To begin with, the cyclist is seen riding down a familiar, ‘meandering road’. The imagery of this road gives the impression of a potentially pleasant ride, free of dangers associated with urban settings. Gradually as they climb up the mountain, the road conditions start to worsen, as they become ‘notoriously steep’ and ‘riddled with potholes and cracks’. This creates a sense of tension for the cyclist, as the road conditions become more challenging as their journey continues.

The more the cyclist continues, ‘hesitant in the face of the unknown terrain’, the more intense the environment becomes. There are storms, crashing thunder and the ‘fury of the night [crashing] through the woods’. All these elements together increase the feeling that the cyclist is struggling against both danger and fear of the unknown. This is accentuated further by the dense foliage in the forest, as the cyclist is ‘surrounded by walls of trees’ and ‘thick, smothering vines’. At once the surroundings seem both hostile and comforting.
