In Joe Kurmaski's short story 'Rough Road Ahead', the setting of a deserted mountain road is integral in conveying the cyclist's struggle. The road is long, winding, and grueling, with no end in sight. The cyclist faces a seemingly never-ending journey, made all the more difficult by the dangerous terrain. The wild landscape, with its curves, crevices, and sheer drops, is a constant danger, forcing the cyclist to maintain a high level of concentration and focus. The lack of other people is also an essential element of the setting. The cyclist is completely alone, facing the elements and her thoughts with nobody to help. This utter loneliness serves to increase the difficulty of the cyclist's struggle, the only thing to rely on being her own strength and abilities. 

The setting also serves to evoke a sense of inevitability and dread about the cyclist's fate. The fact that the road goes on forever, and her fear of what might come at the journey's end, serve to create a mood of suspense and anticipation of an ultimate, unavoidable conclusion. This foreboding contributes to the story's central theme of perseverance under extreme difficulty, as the cyclist has to continually work her way through the harsh terrain despite how hopeless it may seem.

Overall, the setting of 'Rough Road Ahead' effectively conveys the cyclist's struggle. The winding roads and wild terrain impose a constant danger and hardship, as well as creating a tension
