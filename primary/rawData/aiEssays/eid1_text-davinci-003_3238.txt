Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects of computers on people. In recent years, the availability and affordability of computers have made them an increasingly popular tool for completing tasks and entertaining oneself. Unfortunately, however, many people misuse this technology and pay a hefty price for it.

The use of computers in some workplaces can cause an employee to be overworked and stressed by the endless demands of computers. They may have to complete large amounts of work faster, be available constantly, and even be in constant contact with their employer or client. This can have a tremendous impact on the employee's physical and mental health.

Additionally, when used recreationally, computers can have an equally detrimental effect on people. Everyday, people all over the world are becoming dependent on computers to fill their leisure time. While this is a relatively new phenomenon, research has already shown that individuals who use computers for entertainment purposes are more likely to be obese, suffer from depression, and lack the ability to focus.

Although they are an invaluable tool in the modern world, I believe that people should exercise caution when using computers and focus on using them for productive, beneficial pursuits. 

Sincerely,
[Your Name
