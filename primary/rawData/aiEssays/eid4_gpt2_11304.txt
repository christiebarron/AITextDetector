The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it has a kind of "mellowing" quality to it. Each chapter, the book tells a different story that is unique and difficult to explain. It also shows us that the story is not as simple as some of the other stories, that it's too hard to understand and it doesn't go far enough. This one is the culmination of a long hard-won effort by the authors. That's why I love them.
