The ending line of "Winter Hibiscus" is meant to symbolize not just the coming of spring and the passing of winter, but also the protagonist's journey of growth and learning. She has used the hibiscus flower as a symbol of her own struggles and perseverance, and the idea of waiting for the flower to bloom in the spring represents her own ability to rise above her challenges. By ending with the protagonist's resolve to take the same test again when spring comes, it implies that despite the hardships of winter, she has gained the strength and resilience to take the same challenge again and succeed.
