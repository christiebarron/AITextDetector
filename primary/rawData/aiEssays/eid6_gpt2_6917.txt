On July 6, 1929, the California Supreme Court ruled that allowing a dirigible could be justified, but a similar decision invalidated the original construction orders following the collapse of the Empire State. On December 9, 1946, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed into law the California Empire Building Act. Prior to the law's passage in 1965, only a handful of dirigibles were listed as having been built, and only three of them were capable of handling a crane that could lift more than 5,000 pounds of steel. By 1980, however, the number of dirigibles in California was increasing and construction had already begun to close. For that reason, the California Empire Building Act's final and most restrictive piece of legislation, the California Building Act, was signed into law by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in August 1998.
