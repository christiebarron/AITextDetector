The idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building was revolutionary when the building opened in 1931. However, this idea came with its own unique set of challenges and obstacles. In "The Mooring Mast," Marcia Amidon Lüsted outlines the engineering feats and creative solutions required to make dirigible docking possible.

The first major obstacle was the inherently unsteady nature of the airships, which made docks necessary. The main challenge here was finding a way to install a dock structure onto the top of the Empire State Building while not compromising the safety or the majestic look of the building. To achieve this, the designers installed a sculptural tower-like mast. This metal mast was designed with a base beneath the main observation deck and almost reached up to the observation deck itself. Additionally, the mast was able to be easily adjusted to provide a way for dirigibles to dock causing minimal disruption to the observation deck.

The mast was also specially designed with a groove to catch the steel cables that would be attached to the airship. These cables were an essential part of the moored docking process. To ensure that the cables could catch onto the mast, the Empire State Building’s designers had to ironclad the metal mast and even hooked up pulleys for the cables to easily be pulled back and tightened.

The designers also had to consider the sheer size of the dirigibles. To accommodate the size of the airships, the mast had
