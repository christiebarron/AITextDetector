I was recently on a road trip with friends and family when a sudden, heavy snowstorm hit making it nearly impossible to drive. Everyone in the car started to worry that we were going to have to sleep in the car. I could tell most of us were anxious and wanted to get home as soon as possible. In an attempt to put everyone else at ease, I adopted a very calm demeanor and reassured everyone that we would find a solution.

I mean it took some time, but eventually we managed to find a hotel that wasn't completely booked and made it safely inside. I'm proud of the fact that I kept everyone's stress levels down by staying calm and patient during the situation. I think that's what ultimately got us in the hotel that night.
