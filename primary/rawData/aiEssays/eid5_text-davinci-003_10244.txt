The memoir follows Rodriguez' journey from his childhood in New jersey to becoming a prominent fashion designer, and celebrates not only the fashionable places, people, and experiences he has accumulated through the years, but also his strong connection to his Cuban roots. Through stories about his family, his formative experience in Catholic Schools, and his influential relationships, he captures a sense of longing for the warmth and security of home.

The book radiates with vivid descriptions of Rodriguez' world—the serene beauty of upstate New York, where he went to get away from the hustle of New York city, the sun-drenched streets of his childhood in New Jersey, and the bond between family, friends, and the Morales family, where he spent his formative childhood growing up around strong female figures.

His memories are infused with a strong sense of nostalgia and longing, drawing readers in so that they truly feel as if they are experiencing the same emotions he is.
