Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. It requires a combination of technical skills and a bit more driving experience.

The Cycling Academy has three distinct styles of training which are divided into four core areas:

A more traditional and well-behaved setting. The first focuses on reducing your blood pressure, while the second will increase the speed of your bike.

Rough Road Ahead consists of one or more short workouts between the bike and the exercise partner on the ride. Rough Road Ahead is usually longer or very mild.

Rough Road Ahead starts at 5m and ends at 19m â€“ this can vary based on your personal needs.

Some athletes have experienced greater benefit from the Rougherty Group's training but often feel that if training for long, heavy sessions, then they are not well suited to race. Many feel that the pace of the rest of the day is too fast for this type of cycling, so that's why they prefer to have their time taken up with a different workout.

Rough Road Ahead provides an extra challenge when coming up with a short list of training plans. You can take a training bike if you like and it is available at an alternative training facility, which provides a mix of comfort and activity if you would like. The training may be based on a standard class, or the best-rated track, or on a unique training cycle.
