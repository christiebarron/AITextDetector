An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when she was living in New Jersey when we had to go to bed at the same time because she got sick of being ill in the car when we could not drive. It was a very nice day and we just let her go and let her go. And it didn't go well.


She had diabetes, got sick of it and I couldn't feel her feet, I felt her feet because I'm diabetic. And I can understand why somebody who had diabetes needs to be treated as a way of life. You don't have to keep them.


One of the things I remember well about she would be sicker than everybody. So I remember seeing her in the hospital and she would be a bit nauseous because she was sick and she was like an old lady who could barely see. She was very sensitive and I can't imagine how she felt at that age, I'm not sure.


And you remember one one time, the woman had a glass of wine and she said, I'm going to eat a lot of vegetables, so I'll eat a diet like this. And she said to me, who's coming over you today today, just go over. I'll get up and I'll get some bread and eggs and a cup of tea. In the hospital, she always would give me some vegetables and I would get sick of it. And she always went over to me every day for another
