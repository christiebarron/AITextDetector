It all started with just a small joke. I'm always the kind of person who loves to make people laugh - it really is one of the greatest gifts. I had just met my friend's brother, who had recently moved to the city, and I had heard he was a bit of jokester, just like me.

So I decided to make a funny comment in the hopes of making him smile. It worked, and he smiled wide.

That smile I had brought out gave me a feeling of satisfaction, like I had just made a connection with someone. From that moment on, our interaction had a light tone to it that kept us laughing, and I felt a kind of ease and comfort with him.

I've never seen such an instant connection because of laughter with anyone else. It's a special bond that we have created, and it only gets better every time we meet. Not a single day with him goes by without laughter, and I'm grateful to now say that we are truly close friends.
