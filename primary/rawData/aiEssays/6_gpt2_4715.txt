The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The State Building code allowed dirigibles as they were mounted on cars. As the air conditioning system of the building became more expensive for motorists, the owner was required to build a dirigible with a low speed limit in the middle of the ride and have it installed on a vehicle of any kind. When the building was demolished, many construction workers tried to revive the plan by making a movie of a dirigible on a car ride using a low speed limit. However, they were unsuccessful because the movie was quite slow and not quite accurate. So, the dirigibles came up with an easy way of showing the traffic while the road is cleared out and making sure that the traffic does not merge. Many builders tried to use two different types of lights to show the traffic while other lights worked better. In addition, the designers at MCA had to change their lighting of the entrance to the structure for the viewing angle of the drivers, since the lights were not that good on cars where the lights were not on.

To help explain this, the designers at MCA worked on a project from the beginning to develop the special mode within the building's building. First, the light of the entrance is changed from a blue to an orange red, followed by an orange yellow and then an orange red. The system was called "Dirignon". The lights at the bridge were made of three different
