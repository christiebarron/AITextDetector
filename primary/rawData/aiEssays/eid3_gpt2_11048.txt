Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

I have some suggestions for you. Do not go too far up road where people are going to have to drive to get there because there are other places we should not go. Have regular traffic lights at any point. Keep the lights on for the next few kilometres and make sure not do things like 'look in to another direction' as the cyclist might be a bit on the straight. Also consider if it's hard for you to do the next few kilometres so make sure it's safe to do the same thing in that direction.

If there are conditions or roads other than high on road:

This would leave you in great danger. Try to get up on this road. Go somewhere safe. Get around to it. Look after your car, even if you're walking in the dark, and don't be too fast or too fast.

Don't push too fast, try to stay inside.

Don't get involved in traffic when running or even when crossing the road. Just try out a few things. Always feel safe.

Keep your legs clear of the road. Even a little bit. This is one way to keep speed in mind - and avoid getting in collisions, or bumping into someone you don't want to bump onto.

Also don't put your foot on the gas.

Keep going until you get the opportunity to brake.
