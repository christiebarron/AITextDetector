The longstanding tradition of libraries has relied heavily on freedom of information as a cornerstone of its operations. Libraries should remain devoted to maintaining the availability of these works in order to uphold the values of a democratic society. When libraries engage in censorship of fitfully offensive material, they are no longer upholding these values. 

When censorship of materials is implemented by libraries, it sends a message that society is not ready to accept certain ideas or perspectives. It is a dangerous declaration that implies that society has passed judgment on the material, and that certain ideas should not be discussed. Censorship communicates a sense of fear or anxiety that inhibits progress within society and free thought.

By censoring works, libraries are also diluting their resources. Many great authors – both past and present – will not be freely available if all potentially offensive material is absconded from the shelves. Removing works of literature, for example, that include certain offensive topics could omit works penned by some of the finest authors in history, such as D. H. Lawrence, Mark Twain, and Henry Miller.

This is not to say that knowingly offensive material should not be regulated in some fashion. If a librarian sees that a material has very low literary, educational, or artistic value, it should not be readily accessible. For example, a librarian can place such material in a password-protected archive instead of having it on a shelf where anyone can access it.
