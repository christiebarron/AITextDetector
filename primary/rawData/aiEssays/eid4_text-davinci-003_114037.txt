The ending of Winter Hibiscus symbolizes hope and renewal. The protagonist of the story is a Cambodian immigrant who is struggling with English language tests. The phrase "when they come back in the spring" refers to the return of the geese and other signs of new life that arrive each spring, a reminder of the resilience and hope that comes with each new season. The hibiscus serves as a symbol of the protagonist's growth and potential; it may be dormant during the winter, but it will bloom again. By ending with this image, the author suggests that even though the protagonist may be struggling with the tests now, more opportunities will come and with them, the potential for growth.
