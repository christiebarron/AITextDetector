I was having dinner with an old friend of mine the other night and it had been forever since we'd been able to catch up. We had plenty of catching up to do, but neither of us knew where to start. The air was thick with anticipation as we ate in awkward silence, that is until I had a thought that sparked one of our most beloved inside jokes. 

As soon as I blurted out the words, we both broke into uncontrollable laughter. We laughed until tears streamed down our faces, and I swear I'm not exaggerating when I say that we clapped our hands and howled like a pack of hyenas. It was as if all of the tension in the air had been completely relieved, and suddenly the conversation was flowing naturally. We talked about everything from work stresses to things we wanted to do in the future, and all the while we mutually agreed not to talk about what had happened in the past. 

But most importantly, we both realized that just a few seconds of laughter had been exactly what we both needed to truly kickstart our conversation and get the most out of our reconnection. It felt like old times, and I was so happy to be surrounded by all of that laughter.
