In the early 1930s, the Empire State Building was constructed with an ambitious plan to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. This grand idea raised many obstacles for the builders of the Empire State Building, as dirigibles presented a number of technical and safety challenges.

The first obstacle was ensuring that the mooring mast could safely hold the immense weight of a dirigible. The workers behind the ambitious plan had to engineer the mast to handle the weight and stress of several large dirigibles. To do this, they had to erect a steel mast with a thin but particularly strong railing â€” strong enough to withstand the force of a dirigible's engine against it. As a result, the mooring mast had to be over 200 feet tall and weighed more than 60,000 pounds.

The second obstacle was providing a safe landing spot for dirigibles. To do this, the workers had to level out a 12,000 square foot landing platform and build a flat surface that was perfectly level in all directions. This platform had to remain within inches of levelness, to within a few dozenths of an inch on the horizon, in order to prevent collisions between dirigibles and the building's antenna or mooring mast.

The last and perhaps most difficult obstacle for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was the technical challenge of controlling the winds and currents around the building. Not only did the workers have to contend
