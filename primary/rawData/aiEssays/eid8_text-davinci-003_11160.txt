We had been friends since pre-school and were always the life of the party when we were together. Even after all these years, I still had to pinch myself to make sure it was real - that I really had such a wonderful friend.

The other day I was feeling a little down and decided to give him a call. We hadn't talked in a while, so I was excited to catch up and hear all about his life.

When he answered the phone, I could tell he was in a good mood and he quickly started telling me all about the funny things he had been up to. I was already smiling by the time he was done, but the real laughter started when he told me about the time he went to the grocery store in his PJs.

His face, although he couldn't see mine, was flushed with laughter as he continued to tell me the story of how he was so comfortable in his pajamas that he got completely lost in the store and didn't realize everyone was staring at him.

I couldn't help but join in with him as we both found it hilarious. Although it wasn't the most original of stories, it was a good reminder that it is those little moments of absurdity that make life so special.

The best part about it was the feeling that I could truly be myself again since I had such a good friend who understood me so well. That was probably the best gift I could ask for
