The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first, built in 1912, was a temporary storage dock for soldiers during the Second World War.

The second problem was the installation of a special motorized trailer on the front lawn of the Empire State Building. This was designed by C.J. Deacon, architect and engineer. The trailer could be used to tow equipment from the building, or from the ground level on to the ground floor.

The most notable defect from the last major build of the building was the failure of the landing gear attached to the top of the vehicle's forward deck, which would often allow the driver to slip under more than one level of the ship (about 80 feet on a side). This problem would only surface during construction work on the tower and on that day, this problem began to become a concern on a number of buildings (for example, the American Consulate and Grand Cathedral Building, under renovation in Sneak, Oklahoma, and the Federal Building, under renovation in Wanda, South Dakota; the U.S. Army Air Force Wing in Mobile, Alabama).

In 1943, the Federal Building was built and built in 1957. This was the first time for the building to have the side mounted. It was the only building in the world to have it mounted vertically under two feet of concrete.
