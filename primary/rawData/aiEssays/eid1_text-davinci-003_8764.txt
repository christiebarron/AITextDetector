I met my then future wife in college. It was the first day of our freshman year and we found ourselves in the same biology class. We had a nice conversation that day, but things really heated up once the professor started talking.

The lecture was about the intricacies of toads and frogs, and it was actually incredibly interesting. But for some reason, my future wife and I kept cracking up during it. We were both stifling our laughter, but it was obviously driving the professor crazy.

It got to the point where neither of us could contain ourselves anymore. We were laughing uncontrollably, and our professor was not happy. He gave us a harsh scolding, but it only made us laugh harder. Our fellow students were in on the joke, too, and the whole room was shaking with laughter.

In the end, we both got an A in the class, despite the professor's attempts to punish us for our shenanigans. But more importantly, we had started a fun and lasting friendship. Every time I think of that moment, I laugh out loud. It was a defining moment in our relationship that has stayed with us our whole lives.
