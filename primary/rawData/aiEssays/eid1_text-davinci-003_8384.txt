I often find myself in difficult situations that require a great deal of patience. Last week, I went grocery shopping at my local Walmart. As I was standing in line to check out, I noticed the cashier was quite slow. I could tell it had been a long shift, as he seemed tired.

I waited patiently in line, as my turn finally came. The man in front of me was having trouble understanding his bill, and so the cashier had to explain it to him more the once. There were some minutes of silence as the cashier thought of a way to explain it.

The man eventually understood his bill, and so I finally got to the register. I could tell the cashier was very grateful when I thanked him for his patience with the man ahead of me. He finally seemed to perk up a bit, and he moved through my items without hesitation.

When I walked out of the store, I felt I had made a difference by simply being patient. It was a small but meaningful gesture that I was grateful to make, and it reminded me of the importance of remaining understanding and tolerant, even in the toughest of situations.
