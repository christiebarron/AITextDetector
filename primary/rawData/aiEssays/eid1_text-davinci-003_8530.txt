I was recently on vacation with my family, we took a road trip to visit a friend of mine who was living in a different state. We left early in the morning and the car ride was about 18 hours of straight driving. It was a long day, and almost everyone was getting crabby because of the long ride. My brother had complained multiple times to take a break and my parents were getting tired of constantly hearing it. 

I decided to remain patient and understanding. Even though I was exhausted and wanted a break, I knew that this trip was important to my family and it was important for us to have a good experience. Instead of joining in on the complaining, I kept quiet and tried to keep everyone's spirits up by playing games and talking. Eventually, my parents decided to take a break a few hours later when the complaining became too much for them to handle. 

In the end, I'm proud of myself for being patient and understanding. Even though I was exhausted and frustrated, I knew that family moments matter more than our own comfort.
