Computers have many effects on people. It is important to remember that there are at least certain effects that affect the human race and some that are completely different from what they are perceived as. You can talk about the effects of tobacco and the "tobacco companies of old," and it's easy when the big tobacco companies come and cut you when you're down, Norm. But one of the things that may influence us is probably the influence of environmental factors. We know that plants produce more carbon, and we've been studying this for three years, and we found that plant production in some plants is almost twice as big as you would expect. If you go with plant production, the size of the canopy is increased because of trees and other natural resources.. At other times it is as simple as going in and out of the forest, and if you look closely at it, this is exactly the same situation with trees, for example. So if you find that there are two different things that affect the effect, one is a change in rainfall, and the other is, well, that doesn't mean that that change in rainfall is bad, does it? That's a new question for us if you read our article "A study shows just how damaging it can be to the environment by making trees grow faster than other plants." So that seems to be another part of the picture for us that relates to all plants. So if you have trees, you might be wondering how the effect of tree
