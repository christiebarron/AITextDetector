Dear Editor, 

I am writing to state my opinion on the effects computers have on people. As I am sure you are aware, computers are everywhere in our modern lives, from running complex business systems to managing our family memories in photos. Computers allow us to connect with hundreds of people instantly, and learning how to use a computer is now a necessary part of any job market.

On the other hand, increasing reliance on computers can have serious negative effects on our day-to-day lives. For example, it is a well-known fact that computer screens can cause headaches and can impact our eyesight. Furthermore, too much screen time can disrupt our natural sleep/wake cycle, making us more prone to feelings of exhaustion.

Still, I believe this technology has other, more positive effects as well. Computers can actually increase our communication and collaboration levels, as well as facilitate the spread of knowledge. Computers have allowed us to access a wealth of information with the click of a button, making us the most connected society in history. Finally, computers can help to streamline and organize complex tasks, allowing us to make better decisions about the way we use our resources.

In short, while computers have their drawbacks, they are otherwise an incredibly powerful tool that can help us in reaching our goals. I urge the readers to keep these effects in mind and to make responsible decisions with regards to computer usage in our daily lives.

Sincerely
