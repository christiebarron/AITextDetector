Dear Editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. With the increasing prevalence of technology and the internet, computers have become a major part of our lives, allowing us to connect with others like never before. 

Many people have become reliant on computers to help with their day-to-day tasks. For example, online stores have made shopping more convenient and websites provide instant access to vast resources of knowledge. Computers are also useful for entertainment, helping to keep people connected and informed about the world around them.

However, there are those who argue that computers have had a negative effect on people. They claim it has caused us to become less active, and that using a computer can lead to health problems such as decreased eyesight and poor posture. It may also be argued that computers can lead to isolation and distraction from real-world activities.

Although these concerns are understandable, I believe that computers are not the cause of these issues, but rather the result of poor lifestyle choices. If used in moderation with healthy habits, computers can provide people with great benefits. They can open up a whole world of opportunities. Whether it be for learning, creativity, or communication,
