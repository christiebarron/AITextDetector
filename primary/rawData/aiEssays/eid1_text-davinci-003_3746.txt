 

To the Editor,

As computers become an increasingly prominent part of our modern lives, one must consider their effects on people. Most see computers as having a positive influence, providing us with easily accessible entertainment, the ability to stay connected, and a wide range of conveniences. While these benefits are undeniable, we should also recognize the drawbacks that they bring.

At times, the convenience that computers offer can lead to procrastination, interfering with our relationships and productivity. Similarly, the hypnotic nature of computer screens can lead to addiction-like symptoms, where users over-rely on them to feel safe and provide an outlet for their stress. Furthermore—through overuse and increased exposure—computers can also encroach upon our attention and creativity, leading to narrower definitions of success and decreased levels of critical thinking.

Maintaining a healthy use of computers is key. Just as our diets should be in moderation, so should our use of computers. Be mindful of how much time you’re spending on them and ensure that you’re doing other things that promote the development of your physical and mental health. We all must remember that computers are a great tool, but they should never be relied on at the cost of our well-being.

Thank you for your consideration, 

[Your Name]
