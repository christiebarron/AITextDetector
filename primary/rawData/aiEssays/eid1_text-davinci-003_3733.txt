Dear Editor,

As technology continues to evolve, computers have become a central part of everyday life. This has led to debate about the effects that computers have on people. In my opinion, computers have both positive and negative effects on people. 

The positive effects are clear; computers have made it easier than ever before to access information quickly and easily. It has also opened up opportunities for people to communicate and stay connected with others across the world. Furthermore, computers have made many jobs and tasks more efficient, saving people both time and money.

Of course, there are some downsides to the increased prevalence of computers. Increased internet usage can lead to addiction and decreased productivity, making it difficult for people to regulate their screen time. Additionally, computers have replaced human jobs that are now automated, leaving many unemployed or under-employed.

In conclusion, computers undoubtedly have both positive and negative effects on people. However, we should not discount the benefits that computers provide us, like more access to educational and recreational content, quicker communication, and improved efficiencies.

Sincerely,

[Your name]
