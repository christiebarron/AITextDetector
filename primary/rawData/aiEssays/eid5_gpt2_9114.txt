The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' has been taken to heart and written with so much compassion.

The book's protagonist is a former student of Oulu's for the first time and she is inspired by Oulu's own experiences as a child and as a teen, she says.

"There are lots of emotional things about the book where you feel like you're about to fall in love or you fall apart," she says.

They are particularly poignant in chapter 17, when the narrator tells her that she no longer belongs in that house, is a "bad boy" and "really had nothing worth fighting for".

She admits in the book's conclusion that "inheritance was a part of me".

The other woman in the novel is one of her students, Kate. She was pregnant when she began attending Oulu's, but her father died, but, like Oulu, she has no idea where it came from. She is now one of 18 adults born to Oulu's for the first time.

"I hope all of us as friends will forgive and forget this book and get on with it," she says.

The memoir was written over eight months and has been produced by two separate studios and is made available for pre-order by calling 00900088 and via the Bookseller's Store.
