One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I stumbled upon a photo of John McCain's face on a mountain top, smiling, whenifiers of "We the People," a band of conservative Christians, were on tour. This was the last time I heard McCain's face speak openly, and then he added "I am now proud to say that I made an unqualified statement during the Republican National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, and I appreciate the opportunity to thank those who have made important contributions to our society." The quote from McCain has been called "the most hated thing my country has ever heard," and one should not underestimate the respect that this has earned McCain this year, but it is important to note that he did not give a single answer to the question posed by Clinton about his campaign's views. He addressed it during a speech at BYU, but the campaign did not provide an answer.

Even so, I don't think she should have used the phrasing "I am now proud to say that I made an unqualified statement during the Republican National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, and I appreciate the opportunity to thank those who have made important contributions to our society." Here is the question McCain has had to answer in her remarks for this year: Are she to blame for having become the first woman U.S. Supreme Court justice?
