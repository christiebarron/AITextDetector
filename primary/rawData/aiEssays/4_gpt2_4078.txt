The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it is true and all the more so because it is in many ways more entertaining than almost any single book I've read about the book. It's got all the facts and evidence available to support it, but there is no one here to argue that the book is an absolutely essential piece.

It's good, but I couldn'tette have more of it.

The second book on the Magician's Apprentice (with more on this later) has a beautiful first chapter, but the story and story is so similar I just want to say this as much...

As a fan, this was a game of poker that I felt I had to see it play on the stage at my house. And as the audience cheered, they seemed to understand and appreciate a player's skill. There is a feeling that contravene other games for me, but not because it isn't an important one in my play... it's much more the game of wits.

I'm always interested in these stories and not in the books I want to read next. This is a great book for a beginner.
