The memoir 'From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives' by Narciso Rodriguez is a thought provoking look into the author's childhood and the journey of his personal growth. Rodriguez paints a poetic flowing narrative which evokes a variety of moods and emotions.

At the start of the book, Rodriguez paints a vivid picture of life in the family’s homeland of Cuba. Through his descriptions, one can almost feel the warm ocean breeze and hear the chatter of the neighbourhood children. The author's vivid imagery creates feelings of nostalgia and wistful longing for the familiar.

Rodriguez then transitions to the reader’s experience of the family coming to America and all of the hardship that came with it. He speaks of feeling like an alien in a strange land and being unable to communicate. These feelings of loneliness and disorientation become powerful throughout the memoir and make the reader empathize with the author's struggles.

The gloominess of the situation gives way to feelings of optimism and eventually pride as Rodriguez adapts to life in the United States and succeeds in his career. Through his trials, Rodriguez shows the reader that trust in oneself is the key to finding your place in the world.

At the end of the memoir, the reader is left with a sense of growth and understanding. Through his story, Narciso Rodriguez has successfully created a mood of introspection, nostalgia, overcoming adversity, and ultimately hope.
