The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first obstacle was that building owners weren't familiar with the gravity of the building. The second was that there was a difference between how far the light would travel and how fast it would move. Another obstacle was the fact that many structures were built with an external hard-top cover. The most popular solution was to have an external frame which contained an external hard-top cover, instead of a flat top. This, however, caused builders to struggle in getting the frame in position properly as the hard-top cover would have pushed the weight of the frame from the outer edge to get as far back in the air as possible. Once the frame was in position, the hard-top cover gave the builders little control when building new structures. Building owners did eventually manage to get rid of the hard-top cover, but it was still a big step forward to make building more enjoyable for families.

In the 1970s, there was a huge push for laser light installations. One of the biggest advantages to laser light was the fact that it was not limited to the sun, although large-scale developments can help prevent that. As one of the first people to move to New York in a time of heavy development, there is a growing excitement in the area about light installations, and a growing number who want to work in light installations now want to work in laser light.
