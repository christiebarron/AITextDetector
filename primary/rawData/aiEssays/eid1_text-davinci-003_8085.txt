From the day that the Empire State Building began construction in 1930, it was the dream of the engineers to make it the first structure of its kind that could dock dirigibles to the top of the building. Although this seemed like a feasible goal in theory, it quickly became evident there were many obstacles to overcome in order to make this a reality.

The major obstacle to the mooring of dirigibles was the mast itself, the device that would support the dirigible during its dockage. The mast needed to be tall enough to make it safe for the airship, while also be reliable enough to support its weight and movement. At first, the engineers envisioned a steel mast that would extend from the top of the building, but this proved to be a difficult and expensive problem to solve and was eventually shelved.

The engineers then decided to create a wooden mast that extended from the roof of the building, or what was known as a ‘mooring mast’. This mast would be suspended in the air with cables and pulleys, and then support the dirigible during its docking maneuver. However, despite the use of the latest technology at the time, the mooring mast still posed several challenges for the engineers.

The weight of the mast had to be calculated to make sure the Empire State Building was able to support it, an issue that was no small task given the mast’s size. In addition, the large mast
