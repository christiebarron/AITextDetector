To The Editor of [NEWSPAPER NAME],

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects that computers have had on people. With the prevalence of computers in our daily lives, it's important to consider the potential positive and negative impacts that they have had on us.

From a positive perspective, computers have opened up a world of new possibilities. With the technological advancements that have been made, computers have helped people to gain access to a wealth of information that was previously unavailable. We are able to stay connected to friends and family members all over the world, often with little effort. We can now study and work from virtually anywhere, thanks to the internet.

On the other hand, computers have also had some negative effects on people. With the majority of our lives now conducted on computers, there is an undeniable digital divide between those who have access to computers and those who do not. As well, there are often health implications from extended use of computers, such as eyestrain, headaches, and even back pain from sitting in the same position for long periods of time.

In conclusion, I think it's safe to say that computers have had both positive and negative effects on people. With the right precautions and education, we can make sure that these effects are not entirely detrimental.

Yours Sincerely,
