Dear Editors, 

I'm writing to you to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. While some people believe that computers have been detrimental to our society, I strongly disagree. As technology advances, computers have actually provided us with increased educational opportunities and enabled us to stay connected with others all over the world. 

Students are able to access materials and resources with the click of a button, instead of having to search libraries and physical bookstores. This means that more people are gaining access to greater levels of knowledge, resulting in better educated citizens. Computers also enable students to collaborate more effectively with their peers and create new connections, which could prove to be beneficial in the long run. 

Moreover, the internet has allowed us to connect with people in distant places. This has allowed social media, web conferencing, and other forms of digital media to spread awareness of important issues around the globe. This has provided us with a greater understanding of global cultures and global affairs.

All in all, computers have had a profoundly positive effect on our society. They have opened up endless educational opportunities, provided us with a better understanding of the world around us, and enabled us to stay connected with those near and far. 

For these reasons, I strongly believe that computers should be embraced, and not feared.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
