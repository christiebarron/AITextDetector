The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is such that some of the former students began talking about having 'lost relationships' with friends and colleagues they might have had through their childhood, and how all these relationships had ruined them because they lost hope and loved them. This is the kind of memoir that has received a huge amount of attention and, if anything, we are pleased to report that our book now contains the best interviews of its kind.

What are some of the people like you who are now at home and where do you find yourself? Where do you find your new friends and colleagues? What are the best places to visit (and which ones are most in your life?) and what do you think are the best places to meet them? Let us hear from you in the comments section below. Thanks for reading!
