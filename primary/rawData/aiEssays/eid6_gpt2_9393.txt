The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The tower was built by the New York Civil War Veterans in 1847, and had been condemned by the builders in 1852, leading to the collapse of the tower.

Facing similar setbacks, the Empire State Building is on the state's list of Historic Places, for it will house any building that's not a U.S. Treasury building, including, so far, the $75 million Lincoln Memorial.

The demolition cost the Empire State Building $200 million in 2010, when it was converted to a $5.0 billion hotel tower, and it's gone on to save $200 million from the taxpayers.

The hotel will be open later this month, but visitors will have to spend more than $400 as part of the process. The rest, most of them tourists who may be waiting at the new hotel, will be staying at the same hotel for three or four days before they return.

The Federal Aviation Administration plans to open some of the nation's largest air and landways in downtown Los Angeles in two years, an effort that's not expected to stop until 2025.
