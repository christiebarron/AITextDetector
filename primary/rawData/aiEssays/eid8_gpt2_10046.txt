One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I told my husband I thought that there was another way to say something. It is not a happy event for us because of some misguided emotion but because of the experience. Now that I have seen it I do not realize how different it is for me to share that moment of happiness with my husband and I am not alone. We have met other children who were happy on many occasions and all I really have of them is a smile on their face and they know I am happy now and I will never find myself in a situation where I feel like there is little to no emotion left in my head (I try to be as positive), but my husband's smile is not as great as his. I have the same reaction back in America when I am sad but there is a difference here. What I am finding now is that happiness doesn't exist when your spouse can use this phrase and share it with you or with your children or people. It does not exist when your spouse uses phrases like that, but you still have your point. A happy day or the morning after that has far more to do with feeling happy then a sad moment, though that may be the reason the moment is not for any of us. I have seen how hard it is to live in a negative environment when you are married and to face that day, but I will try to be as good as my husband when time permits and I know thatahead that day is for us
