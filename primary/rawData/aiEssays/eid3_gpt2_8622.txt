Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

* You can choose for yourself: where do you go, and who do you drive with? There is an 'Rotten Road Ahead' option – so that if you're at the end of a lane on a very busy road you can head home if you can.

* There are also a whole bunch of other options. Here's a rundown: a cycle lane option, a bridge, a fence and road signs; a cycle-climbing option, a greenway and a greenbelt, and that's the one you are responsible for.

* An automated parking lot may only be used by a limited number of people (and if it's not you, there are a lot of people there!) – this may be the one option that you want to try, so get in to let everyone know about it. The next time someone wants to add them up, have you pick out your own parking spot that everyone agrees will save money and speed up your commute!
