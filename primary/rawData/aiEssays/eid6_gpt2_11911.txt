The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The large diameter structure caused them to have to move to a lower, two-floor platform. A separate cable that they did not find, they must have had to cut several times to reach this lower level.


Once the bridge was built, they cut a smaller channel for an external cable. From there, they cut another tunnel.


This tunnel was the final step in the process, as they only had 40 years to complete cutting a whole segment of the bridge.


The entire system required some kind of special special equipment, in this case of a special special gear, they needed to have an even bigger diameter cable that could fit into the lower floor. The diameter of this cable is 1.5mm high and has an extended path around it. It is supposed to provide a connection to the bridge on top of the old bridge which had one third of the span.

Although they used a 1mm tall concrete tube to cut a second tunnel, the construction workers were forced to remove the large diameter cables and replace the original, three-level, three-story two-story structure. Instead of using double the length of the new structure, they constructed two underground tunnels for two hundred thousand yen.
