The motivation to build the Empire State Building is often credited to the booming economy of the 1920â€™s, but it was also in response to the innovative technology available at the time: dirigibles. Dirigibles, or airships, were pioneered in the early 20th century and quickly found a place in the public imagination due to their size, speed, and luxurious appeal. Consequently, the original builders of the Empire State Building had plans to add mooring masts that the airships could tie onto, allowing them an aeronautical waypoint in the heart of New York City. However, this ambition was riddled with obstacles that needed to be overcome in order for it to become reality. 

Firstly, the builders had to surmount the challenge of developing the mooring masts. The mooring mast was a novel engineering concept, and the builders had to construct tubular steel masts on the roof of the Empire State Building that were literally strong enough to catch and moor these 500 ton airships. The masts were initially tested using a streetlight from the Brooklyn Bridge and proved successful, with the weight of the light being equivalent to the drag of a dirigible. With this engineering achievement, the mooring masts had proven their structural capability, and could be put into effective use in the Empire State Building. 

The next major obstacle was the approval from the city of New York. Naturally, docking such colossuses in
