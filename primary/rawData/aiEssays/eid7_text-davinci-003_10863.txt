I was walking to my car after a long day of work. I had already been in a hurry because I was running late, so I was feeling a bit frazzled. As I approached my car, I noticed a large group of people blocking the parking lot exit. I could tell that they were having some kind of dispute and it was clear that I was not going to be able to leave anytime soon.

I tried to remain calm as I listened to the two parties argue, but I was getting increasingly impatient. Even though I was in a rush, I knew that if I didn't handle the situation patiently, it would only delay me further. So I decided to take a deep breath and wait for an opening in the conversation.

After what felt like an eternity, the two parties finally came to some sort of agreement and the group slowly dispersed. Even though I was in a hurry, I was relieved that I stayed patient and didn't make the situation even worse. Finally, I was able to get in my car and leave.
