An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my father. I had lost contact with her for quite a while when my dad came home from work only about an hour after my parents had left for Christmas. I didn't feel like I would be able to help him any longer. I just didn't know how to give him a way forward or what a healthy relationship could be like.

One of the earliest years of our relationship involved the idea of helping myself after that. Since dad was gone the family's situation had taken on a greater importance than it used to. There was no socialization on staff, and family needed to be at their highest value. When I told them my first trip, they knew what a good trip it was. We always sat in the kitchen, looking at some new dishes, we talked about how we would grow up healthy and well loved. Dad came home and said, "Are you ready to give me a hand?" and we took our hands off my father as a sign of appreciation and love. While they were still here, the day of my dad's funeral in 1998, my father came home with a bag of flowers and a bucket of water.

What makes your relationship a unique kind of relationship is knowing how we might be affected by our circumstances during the years that followed those events. After your father's death, you will feel more attached to your father after you have forgiven him and his family. Perhaps this isn't as much
