The setting of Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead" plays a crucial role in defining the cyclist's journey and her experience throughout the story. The fact that the cyclist is on a secluded rural road is highly symbolic of her personal journey and growth throughout the story. The protagonist is in search of adventure and is actively seeking out a challenge for herself, which is what makes the road she has chosen to travel down so important.

The isolated nature of the setting further emphasizes the cyclist's individual journey as she navigates terrain that is entirely new to her. The difficulty and roughness of the road ahead symbolizes her challenge and journey toward growth and greater understanding of herself. Not only is the cyclist challenged by the terrain, but the details of her surroundings also shape her experience. During her journey she is surrounded by an expansive sky filled with stars and a landscape of trees and hills. This serves to further remove her from the technology and distractions of modern day life, forcing her to rely solely on her companions, her bike, and her own mental strength to carry her forward. 

The features of the setting also artistically demonstrate the resilience and power of the cyclist as she confronts the obstacles before her. This strengthened her resolve and allowed her to grow as a person. In essence, the features of the setting effectively foreshadowed the cyclist's struggles and growth throughout the story and ultimately contributes to the astounding victory she achieves at the end.
