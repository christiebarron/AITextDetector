It is no secret that computers have greatly impacted our lives. While it is true that computers have created a multitude of benefits for our modern society, I would like to take this opportunity to express my opinion that computers can also have a negative effect on our lives.

One of the main concerns when it comes to the effects of computers is the isolation they can create. The convenience and capability of computers can lead to excessive use, resulting in reduced face-to-face interaction and social skills. Studies have also found that those spending an excessive amount of time in front of the computer screen are more likely to suffer from depression, anxiety, and other mental and physical health issues.

We live in a world that values technological advancement, and there is certainly no doubt that computers have their benefits. However, it is important that we recognize the potential harmful effects of too much computer use. I believe it is our responsibility to ensure that we can enjoy
