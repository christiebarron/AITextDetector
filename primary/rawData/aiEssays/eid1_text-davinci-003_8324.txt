My old friend Janice and I had always been close, so I was really excited when she asked me to help her move. She had recently got a new job in another town and had to move suddenly, so she needed all the help she could get. 

It was a long and tiring day. We worked hard and had to make several trips. At one point, we lost a few boxes we were carrying and had to backtrack to find them. It was starting to get dark and we were running out of time. 

Janice was exhausted and frustrated, but she remained patient throughout the entire move. She didn't complain or get angry. Instead, she stayed focused on the task at hand and kept a positive attitude. 

Eventually, we got everything done and Janice thanked me profusely for my help. I was really proud of her and amazed at her ability to stay patient despite a hard situation.
