"He kept saying that he wanted to be a better personâ€¦it's true there was nothing wrong with him. But he had absolutely no one around."

Not anymore!

We've had to adjust to some of the changes. I was at war in Vietnam for almost 20 years, and I now go back to live at home, where I'm not going to have to spend as much time as I usually do. I've learned a lot as a man in terms of dealing with people who were actually more difficult toward those who were actually easier. These new soldiers are much more determined and are working harder because they realize that they are not just a bunch of little things like a mother who's got a baby coming up each morning. They are being made by people who are not part of the family, who get all these little things that we are so dependent on that we are more susceptible to the urge to be violent.

I was a little bit shocked when I went back this year. It was just a great moment to go to the U.S. military academy at Brown University. It was literally amazing. I would have never thought there would be this much training there. They have the largest concentration of military personnel at all 50 U.S. military
