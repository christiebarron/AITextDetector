I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is now more widespread than any previous system in the UK. And this has caused a strong backlash and to a large extent a national debate about the extent of access to information concerning library policy or library staff.

I think it's time to stop treating the general public like sheep and accept that censorship is about being too strict, not because of any particular law or individual interest but because of the very real pressure that we feel to be able to provide important, relevant information to our communities. That's what the public want and we're asking you to respect that and that's where I'm at.

Trotsky was a critic of British censorship for nearly 15 years, a historian of the First World War and a specialist in Russian literature, political philosophy, and literature. And he is an experienced editor who has written six books on political history, and he will appear at the Edinburgh Ideas Festival in September. His book will explore the role political correctness has played within British censorship and will appear at the Institute of Politics in March.
