The Empire State Building famously allowed the docking of airships, also known as dirigibles, and this engineering feat was no easy task. As Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted explains in her book "The Mooring Mast: Designing the Empire State Building for Airships", many obstacles had to be overcome in order to make this possible.

The first challenge was engineering a safe way to dock the airships. This meant creating a rigid mast that could handle the strong winds generated by the dirigible while it was mooring. Special spires were added to the top of the building in order to help aerodynamically stabilize the airship and avoid turbulent air currents. Additionally, engineers had to install high-speed elevators that could quickly transport passengers up and down the building.

Second, infrastructure changes had to be implemented to support the airship docks. This included creating a safe landing field, as well as making sure the airfield would be properly managed and monitored. Additionally, new communication and air traffic control systems had to be implemented in order to ensure the safety of those on board the dirigibles. 

The third challenge was designing security and safety features. For this, engineers studied the mechanisms that were used during the docks of the Graf Zeppelin and the Hindenburg. These features included special lighting systems and wind barriers that minimized the risk of fire and collision with other aircraft. 

Finally, the architects and engineers had to consider the
