An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when my youngest son was in a coma, but I told him that when it comes to my kid he always thinks he's going to die, because he knows it's all about me. My daughter is a normal little boy, and she told me, "There are still people who are going through this and some of them may be gone, but they're going to be okay next time." Sometimes when I tell my grandchildren about what I wrote, they ask me, "When do you think you have to make you feel good about this?" I try to tell them that if you can be grateful to someone, and then think the same way about others, then maybe you get to be an excellent parent. Some people, like me, do say, "I love you," because I care about them, but I never feel like that. It can be difficult to say, "Yes I will be happy. But I won't help the good things that I feel this way about, and don't do this for selfish motives." My daughter and I both made our homes very, very safe, with no family harm.
