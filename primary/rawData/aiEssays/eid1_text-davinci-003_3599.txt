I remember the first time I laughed with my best friend. We'd known each other since childhood. We'd gone through grades and classes together, but it wasn't until junior high that I really started laughing with her. 

It all started when our extra curricular activities took us to the same classâ€”ballroom dancing. With all of the intricate choreography and tensed focus on doing our best, it could be pretty nerve-wracking. But it turned out to be the ultimate place for laughter.

When our music teacher was confused over how the waltz worked, my friend and I cracked up. We'd spent the last two weeks perfecting our two-step and so for us to laugh at the teacher's confusion was hilarious.

But then we got a stern reminder to be more respectful. But it was too late, the laughter in the room had already started to spread. One of my friend's classmates couldn't hold back a giggle, and then slowly but surely each of us got louder and louder. 

Even the teacher began to chuckle and soon the entire class was intertwined in laughter. And in that moment, I felt a special kind of bond with my friend. That moment of shared laughter marked the beginning of an even deeper friendship.
