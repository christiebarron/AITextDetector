The builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock due to the nature of the airship construction and the architecture of the building. This task proved incredibly difficult and the result of their effort, referred to as “The Mooring Mast”, had to be carefully designed in order to ensure a safe and feasible docking experience.

In Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s article, “The Mooring Mast”, she explains that the chief engineer, E.R. Boller, pushed for an existing flagpole at the building’s top, the equivalent of an 80th-floor typical antenna, to become a 1,200-ft mooring mast. This mast was designed to be able to withstand the forces of docking a large airship. In order to construct such an apparatus, the Empire State Building would have to be altered.

To facilitate the construction of the mast, the 1-ft thick, 10-ft square, steel frame had to rest on a two-level dwelling which was mounted on rollers. This solid base had to be constructed with caution as it had to support an incredible amount of weight. Furthermore, to ensure the airship docked in a safe manner, levelers and a winching system had to be modified and installed.

Another obstacle builders of the mooring mast faced was the tremendous outside air pressure when the airship arrived. To contend
