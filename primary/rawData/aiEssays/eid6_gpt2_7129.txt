The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. On the one hand, a lot of the buildings were relatively new to New York and they couldn't be built on the same foundation that the old buildings were. The main problem in the late-1940s was the development of the new RICM building. In 1940, when this building fell into disrepair, there were a lot of workers who were actually doing their job (by building the building they were replacing the existing one). However, there was a real need for more horizontal space in New York that needed more horizontal clearance. This created real problems in shipping that would go through the Empire State Building at a huge cost. The RICM Building itself at the time stood 7.6 acres and was only slightly over twice the size of the existing Empire State Building. While the RICM Building was built more horizontally, the existing Empire State Building was also built at an elevation as high as 7.6 feet.

What started off as a couple of other problems with the Empire State Building eventually transformed into a major shipping issue. When the RICM started getting very high walls, the ship was required to have a new floor plan. One of the first signs of this was that it was required to have a new roof linesquare up the outer decks. The new decking was completed in 1951. This required a lot of work and could have involved multiple vertical deckings. However,
