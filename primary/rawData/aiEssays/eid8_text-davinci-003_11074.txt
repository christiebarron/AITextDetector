I remember it like it was yesterday; my wife and I had just moved into our new home. We were settling into the new carpets, fresh paint, and other features that made it feel more like home.

One thing that always put a smile on my face, however, was the sound of my wife's laughter. It was her trademark and it was contagious.

One evening, my wife and I were sitting on the couch in our new home. We were both exhausted from unpacking all the boxes piled high in the living room. At some point during our conversation, I said something that made us both laugh. I wasn't sure what exactly it was I said, but it was enough to get both of us laughing.

The laughter quickly spread throughout the room. We were both laughing so hard that tears started rolling down our cheeks. Minutes later, both of us were wiping away tears as we tried to compose ourselves.

That moment of laughter was a great reminder that even with a house full of boxes, we still had each other and a sense of humor to share. It was a reminder that the most important thing between two people is their willingness to laugh together. That single moment of laughter connected us in a way that words can never express.
