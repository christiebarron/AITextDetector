I was recently in the grocery store, and the line for the register was very long. All of us had been waiting quite some time, and a woman at the back of the line commented under her breath that this was taking much too long. Rather than get angry or impatient, I took a step back and decided to take a deep breath and practice being patient. 

I tried to measure the progress made by the line by counting how much smaller it got. I also tried to distract myself by focusing on the other customers in line and their conversations. Although it was still a long wait, I was able to stay calm knowing that everyone was in the same situation and that eventually we would all make it to the register. 

Finally, when I reached the register, I was thankful that I had tried to exercise patience while waiting in line. It was a difficult task, but one that was worth it.
