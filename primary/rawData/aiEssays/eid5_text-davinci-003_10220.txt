Narciso Rodriguez’s memoir ‘From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives’ is a compelling narrative that evokes a range of deep emotions throughout its chapters. Rodriguez interweaves his experiences, both unique and familiar, as an American immigrant and as a designer living between different cultures. The memoir ultimately paints a picture of Rodriguez’s culture of resilience, resilience in the face of difficulty and personal transitions, resilience to maintain a meaningful connection to his Puerto Rican and African roots. 

The mood of Rodriguez’s memoir is both melancholic and hopeful. His writing is shot through with poignancy as he reflects on his struggles and challenges as he locates himself among two cultures, and then layers his narrative with his inner musings as a designer who sees beauty and inspiration in challenging times. However, the dominant motif of Rodriguez’s memoir is one of hope in the face of adversity. Time and again, his experiences lead him back to the powerful experience of hope and the resilience of striving for a meaningful life. 

Rodriguez’s memoir is heartening to read and feel its inspirations in everyday life. He speaks of reimagining his heartaches and struggles as creative materials, and of the power of drawing on the courage and strength of his cultural heritage. He encourages readers to open their eyes and minds to beauty, art, and design that resides in our environment, that resides within our lives.
