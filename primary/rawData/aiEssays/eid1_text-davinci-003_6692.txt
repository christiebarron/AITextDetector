Dear Editor,


Recent reports have highlighted the potential risks of computer and technological usage, raising questions about the effects computers have on people. As a concerned member of the public, I believe computers have both positive and negative effects on people, depending on how they are used.

On the positive side, computer technology can be used as an educational tool to equip young people with the skills they need in the 21st century. Schools now incorporate technology into classrooms to build students' knowledge and understanding in different areas, providing them with invaluable resources to aid their learning.

Moreover, computers are great for communication. Through online conversations, emails, social media and chat/video chat, adults and children can stay connected with friends and family, even when they are oceans apart. This form of communication makes it easy to keep in touch and stay informed about each other’s lives.

On the other hand, people can become addicted to technology. This addiction can have a negative impact on people’s physical and mental health, and can lead to social isolation if the technology is used excessively. Also, privacy and cyber security are major concerns as online fraud and identity theft continues to be a problem.

Although computers can be dangerous, it is important to remember that the effects of computer use depend on how they are used. To ensure people are staying safe and healthy, they should be educated on how to best use technology and the importance of setting time limits for themselves.
