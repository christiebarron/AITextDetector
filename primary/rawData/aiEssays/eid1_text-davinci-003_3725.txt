Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people and to persuade your readers to agree with me.

In the modern world, computers are a significant part of our lives. We use them for work, school, entertainment, and communication. While computers have certainly had a positive impact, it’s important to consider the negative effects computers can have on people.

The most obvious negative effect is the problem of addiction to computers and the internet. Many people spend large amounts of time on their computers and the internet, and it can be hard for them to break the habit. This can lead to physical and mental health problems, such as eyestrain, obesity, anxiety, and depression. It can also be detrimental to relationships, both by creating a physical distance between people and by taking up all of a person’s time.

In addition, it’s important to consider the effects of computers on our environment. Computers and the internet consume more energy than ever, creating a large carbon footprint. They also produce harmful electronic waste, which can damage our health and the environment if it’s not disposed of properly.

For all of these reasons, it’s important to be aware of the potential hazards of computers and to take steps to reduce their negative impact on people and the environment. I hope that your readers will take this into consideration and act responsibly.

Sincerely,
