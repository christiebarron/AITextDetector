An example of a time someone in my life was patient was me," he says. "I had taken my girlfriend from my parents in the UK, she was born in Sweden, and I found out she had an Irish name, got married in Sweden, was in France and we had kids there. We had a small amount of money. I could not afford the holidays, the kids were so small to spend £50 on food, clothing, and just everything. So I couldn't afford to sit through this, I couldn't afford everything and so I couldn't find my place. I was able to afford three nights bus fare, three nights hotel and then two nights holiday. I just couldn't afford it."

"If someone came up with an idea and I thought, "Do you need the money for that?", I said, "Do I actually need it for myself, but I didn't know you?" And she said, 'No, but you probably need it for that rebound, I don't have any money for that'."

"And I thought 'I guess so, I guess it's going to work out," so I said, "We'll see." And she said, "And then we wouldn't come back for four weeks' on the next date."

That was something you were never going to write about, either. Like, if I came back with £70k I'd love to stay with me or maybe even go to dinner with you
