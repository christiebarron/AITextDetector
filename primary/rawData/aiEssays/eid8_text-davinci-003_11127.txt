I remember it like it was yesterday; the moment when I shared my first real laugh with him. Appropriately enough, it was on a roller coaster.

We had been flirting for weeks - the butterflies were strong, and I was excited to finally be able to have a few hours away from the world, and just be in his company. So when he suggested an amusement park I jumped at the chance. 

As soon as we got onto our first roller coaster, the nerves set in. I had no idea how crazy it would be; I hadn't been on a roller coaster for years. But my anxieties were soon forgotten as we screamed and giggled our way through it together. 

That's what really made me laugh. Seeing him so carefree and free - his whole face lit up with joy, and it was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen. I felt like I was in a dream, my stomach doing flips in a totally different way than before. 

His laughter was infectious and soon we were both convulsing with laughter, tumbling over our words and finishing each other's sentences. In that moment, our shared laughter was like a bridge between us. It was a bridge that connected us in a way that words can't describe. 

That night, we left on a high, taking the memory of that laughter with us. And I've never forgot the unique feeling of that first, real moment
