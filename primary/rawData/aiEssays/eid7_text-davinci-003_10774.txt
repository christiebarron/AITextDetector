I recently had to go to the DMV to renew my driver's license. Although I had made an appointment online, I was still met with an incredibly long line – I had to wait for almost two hours before I was finally called up to the desk. 

At first, I was dreadfully annoyed. Everyone around me was growing more and more impatient by the minute, and I felt the same way. Even though I was aggravated, I made a conscious effort to remain as patient as possible. I decided to make the best of it and instead took the time to catch up with friends and family I had not been able to connect with lately. 

By the time I was finally called to the desk, I was exhausted but feeling a bit more relaxed. The DMV employee told me that he appreciated my patience and expedited the process for me as best he was able. I managed to leave the DMV in a much better mood than when I had entered it – and all due to my willingness to remain patient throughout the experience.
