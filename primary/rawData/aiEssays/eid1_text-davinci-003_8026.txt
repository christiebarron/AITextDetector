The Empire State Building was designed in the 1920s to accommodate the then-popular technology of dirigibles, or airships. However, the builders of this iconic skyscraper faced numerous obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the structure. This essay will explore how the builders of the Empire State Building worked to overcome these challenges in order to make the dirigible docking a reality. 

The foremost issue that the builders of the Empire State Building had to grapple with was the enormous size of the mooring mast needed to support the airship. This was a logistical issue as there was limited space in the city for such a large structure, yet its presence on the building was necessary so that the airships could safely land and moor. The solution to this problem was twofold. Firstly, engineers devised a system of cables to attach the mooring mast to the building; this made it much easier and more cost-effective to install the mast without having to build another separate structure. Secondly, the mast was designed with an adjustable height: depending on the size of the airships, the mast could be raised or lowered to match its length. 

However, this was not the only obstacle faced by the builders. An even greater issue was the danger that the airships posed while trying to dock. It was important for engineers to create a mooring mast that was capable of withstanding powerful gusts of wind and strong air currents. As such, they
