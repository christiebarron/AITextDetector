Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have had on people. I strongly believe that while computers have certainly helped us stay connected and open up possibilities that were unimaginable not too long ago, they have also created some issues that merit serious consideration. 

The advanced capabilities that come with computers can help break down geographical boundaries, and allow us to communicate quickly and efficiently with a wide range of others. Websites can provide people with new opportunities, especially those out in the boondocks who don't have access to the resources of larger cities. Moreover, computers can streamline tedious tasks, freeing up valuable time for the people and allowing them more leisure. 

Unfortunately, the digital age also has its drawbacks - people are now interacting less face-to-face, and more through phones or emails. Instead of engaging with each other directly, people increasingly depend on computers to achieve their everyday goals and activities. Research has suggested that children learn less when they are required to do most of their schooling in front of a computer. It has also been seen that people now ascribe more value to virtual relationships than physical ones, which take away meaning from real-life communication. 

Overall
