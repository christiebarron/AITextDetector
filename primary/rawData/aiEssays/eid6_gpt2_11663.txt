The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, it was impossible for the air-conditioned units to function as two separate rooms in a building, and the rooms were designed to be attached by an integrated cable system, with no separation between the floors. The cables would connect to the ceiling, causing a collapse if a ceiling was broken, and also allowing occupants to sit on the ground between the two rooms, which posed a problem. A new stairway was installed on top of this in 1907, and at least one of the stairways was located in the tower's lobby. It was an ambitious project, and construction was slow. The first couple of years of building saw the Empire State Building being designed on such a short budget that it was quickly replaced with "an actual large piece of work," according to a newspaper column by Frank A. Scherill, and the building fell to its foundations in May 1910. A few months after this, a group of "pioneers" in the architectural consulting firm, Woodbury & Company, tried to buy the building, only to be prevented from doing so by the decision of government officials. The government had an offer, and it offered a series of incentives and exemptions. The government agreed to sell the work back to Bessie L. Williams, who had become a top bidder. Williams took a break from work, worked as a salesman over at the office of the Governor of Rhode Island,
