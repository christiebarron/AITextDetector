The Empire State Building posed a unique challenge for the engineers tasked with allowing it to accommodate airships, or dirigibles. The engineers had to overcome numerous hurdles, many of which had never been encountered before. The most common challenge was the need to place a tall, sturdy steel mast atop the building. This mast, commonly referred to as a “mooring mast,” must be able to support the weight of an entire airship as the vessel docks.

The early designs of the mooring mast were met with concerns from the engineers due to the fact that building such a tall structure posed a significant safety hazard to anyone standing below it, particularly if a gust of wind caused the attached airship to sway. A potentially catastrophic incident could occur if the mooring mast failed due to structural failure or instability in the wind.

In order to address this issue, the engineers consulted numerous aeronauts to develop a design that was both safe and capable of bearing the weight of the airship. They recommended several measures, such as the placement of guy wires connected to the mooring mast, which would keep the vessel stable while it was docked, and the addition of a ballasting chamber at the top of the mast, which would release and collect the water ballast used to keep the airship aloft and stable. Furthermore, the balustrade of the walkway near the mast was widened so that passengers could access the airship without obstruction
