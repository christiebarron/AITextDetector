The setting of "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski is an important feature in this story, as it affects how the cyclist, Scott, interacts with his environment. In contrast to the safe and secure suburban roads he's used to, Scott's experience of the mountains is a harsh and dangerous one.

The topography of the mountain paths and trails creates several difficult obstacles for Scott as he seeks to ascend the slope. Physical rocky obstacles, like outcroppings of rock and acid-washed areas of dirt, are particularly lethal to cyclers, especially on a descent. In addition, the mountains provide plenty of opportunities for Scott to go off course, with winding paths that could lead him in directions he hadn't intended. An unfamiliar environment such as this can contribute to a feeling of disorientation or even emergency.

The weather in the mountain environment also has a substantial effect on Scott's experience. On his decent, the foggy sky and rain dampen the already-treacherous terrain, making it even more difficult to navigate. Further, the unpredictability of the weather in the mountains provides yet another potential hazardâ€” icy patches, deep puddles, and wind gusts that can knock a cyclist off his bike.

Overall, the setting of this piece proves to be an inhospitable and dangerous environment for Scott. The physical and weather conditions encountered in the mountains are much harsher than those encountered in suburban environments, making them more difficult to navigate
