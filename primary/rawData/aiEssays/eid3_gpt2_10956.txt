Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. While I've discussed some of the things I consider to be important, I didn't consider any of them as significant for general cycling safety. Here I give you three of the big-picture factors as to my understanding of how these factors play out in cycling.

One, a large number of vehicles use rough roads to reduce collisions.

The second is that the number of bad-road choices for most cyclists (from cyclists to vans) is relatively small to begin with, which leaves the number of drivers looking to use rough roads as a means of getting around.

The third factor is that 'Roads are safer places for cycling…and for getting around to…by cycling'. A great illustration of this is the recent review of the UK's safety standards on road safety by the Institute for Road Safety, the UK's leading road and safety organisation, which has a global database of road safety information over the year 2013.

"Roads are safe places for cycling," according to this review, "…the good roads are safe places for the cyclist, and the bad places are places for the human body". The data show that there were "troubling levels of road crime – and bad roads." Most recently an important fact from the report: "On average, there actually was a 10% increase in incidents of road safety incidents in theself-built transport, road and pedestrian spaces
