The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it's not the kind of story you'd want to want to leave out if you wanted to take something otherwise exciting and memorable and make it work.

And it's a true story of love and discovery.

Now, I just don't buy that. The only good thing is you don't have to follow the story, because if you follow that story, it probably will be interesting.

It will really tell you something. If something comes to mind you've got some information that can inform you. It also probably can give you something to look for. If it's not there, you won't have to put it together and start rethinking your assumptions. It'll come out and be a piece of cake and you can come up with other things that might be different. But if you read about it and you're not invested entirely in that particular story, you will end up leaving it out on the cold ground.

When the story gets to the point where I get my life, I'm still reading some of the books and thinking, How do I write this story better? How do I write that story without knowing that this particular thing happened.

It would just make you want to jump on the books and just go for it, but I don't think that anyone (me included!) reads stories that they don't just know they made all the way through and then start reading.
