They don't even like us, we're all just too stupid to care about computers and to do something to make technology more valuable and more pleasant for people.

What's the reaction of your audience â€“ both the people who watch TV and the ones who didn't get it right?

It's always interesting what they're getting compared to the other audiences. They get upset and angry about the lack of the technical innovation and they usually say, "Well that was just for nerds, that's just wrong." Well they're never going to fix a problem because there is a certain degree of technical sophistication. It's the computer nerds that are going to care about that, not the techies. There's an awful lot of things they could change, and I'll never know the technical complexity because I'm still sitting there typing it up. I do my own research, but if you go around
