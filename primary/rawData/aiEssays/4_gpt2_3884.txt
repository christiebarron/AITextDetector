The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because of those two words.

The first is, you can't always predict how the next wave of changes will unfold. There are many carefree futures ahead, and even those very young adults may be lucky to be caught out in a world that is still in chaos. As far as I can tell, every other time I talk to my child about the futures of her child's future and how lucky she is, the kids seem to come to terms with that moment and don't get too upset. I don't think it is necessarily a positive sign for the good of a child's future, and the book will continue to push the boundaries of what a good child can hope for all the time they give.

At the same time, there are also other books published in the world of children's books this summer that are good enough to be seen as the next major release from the publisher. I'll keep you posted on what goes down between those books.

So what I have to say is that winter Hibiscus is definitely a great story. It has everything you've seen so far and I'm certainly excited for more to come. I hope it's as good as the initial draft of the season 1 novel that I have to write next. I'm sure that I'll keep telling you what I think will be the most interesting parts of Winter Hibiscus.

This is all very much in my hands
