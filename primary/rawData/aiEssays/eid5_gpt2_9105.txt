The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is to read the story after a week of hard labor on the phone with friends. "It's a little sad because I was trying to keep up with all the different ways we had to make the record," he tells me. It's a great way to help someone in poverty. There are some hard and emotional truths to be found in being an independent person: the cost of living, the health and job insecurity of empowerment.

He speaks to people from all over the world for the first time in a week about how he's struggling to figure out why his faith and spirituality has brought him so much success, how he can be part of a growing movement to build a new religion. The process became a kind of cathartic experience, a glimpse into the lives he has been trying to share.

The documentary about my story, 'From Home,' is more personal than an average autobiography; its themes are rooted and connected to the story, but the message is a reminder of how far we are from a fully independent country. For more about me and the book you've read, here.
