When I first met my partner, there was an immediate connection that was indescribable. It was like the universe was connected by an invisible force and we were its two shining stars. But, I think the moment that sealed the connection, solidifying my feelings for him, was the first time we laughed together. 

We had decided to meet up at a beach one sunny summer day, and as soon as we started talking, it felt like we had known each other for years. We shared stories and common interests, and as the conversation unfolded, laughs began to slip through. 

He began to tell me about an embarrassing moment he had experienced at work the week before and he was soon overcome with laughter. Naturally, I followed his lead and soon found myself laughing too, despite the fact I had no idea what he was talking about. His contagious laugh was infectious, and I suddenly found myself free from worries and all the tension of the day. 

The sun was setting, our stomachs were full with ice cream, and our laughter was ringing through the beach. We had found our perfect groove and the best part? I know that on any given day, despite any problem or challenge we may face, laughter will always be that trigger to help us reconnect.
