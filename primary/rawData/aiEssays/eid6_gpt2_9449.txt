The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In 1912, when Chinese engineers from Hanseatic engineering firm T-H-Meng met with President Roosevelt, they tried to create a dirigible, one capable of docking and refuelling with their existing engines, to be built only near the top of the Empire State Building in Washington, D.C. According to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, its primary purpose was to build airships on the Empire State Building site. The most successful attempt to construct a dirigible, however, was made Treatment of Unladen Aircraft. In 1913, Chinese engineers proposed their own version of the building method - using an aerodrome-like atmosphere in which an aerodynamic wing would float between the structure and the hangar deck to hold the aircraft. This would create an advantage over those aircraft that were flying under water - and in 1911 Washington agreed. On October 5, 1914, a Chinese plane was shot down. During the war, there were over 250,000 Chinese died in the war.

One last thing to mention is that there is no "discovery" of an airliner in this place since the Chinese government took a "no-no" vote when they put "no" on all the "non-explosive materials". Apparently with great pride the Chinese Government chose to never let the Federal Government and the U.S government know about the plane from its origin.
