An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the day her father passed. He and her father went on a trip together but it was only two weeks and she wasn't home. So all I ever did was go to the house, to see the window, to call the police, to get an appointment and get my car. So I spent the rest of my life having to pay for the car which is a car I didn't have because I was too much of a pain in the arse to drive it, because I was afraid they would call their sister, to get out to see her or my sister, and I'd have to pay for a car to put my dad in a car to drive.


That's it. We were out that evening and a man came at me and said I had a car. That was after we had had our beers and then I couldn't care less because I was sick. He said I have no problem paying for groceries. My whole life I was a woman, I wore dresses for all the summer, I wore dresses, it was very easy to carry on so I was very comfortable and took care of things the whole way home. Now I'll be married tomorrow and I'll have no other choice but that's where I am right now.
