In Joe Kurmaski’s story, “Rough Road Ahead,” the features of the setting play an important role in affecting the cyclist. The most significant feature is the steep and winding road that the cyclist must navigate. This difficult terrain affects the cyclist in a few ways. Firstly, it takes a lot of effort to get up the slopes, both mentally and physically. This is seen in the cyclist’s labored breathing and thoughts of a gym workout. Secondly, the winding road increases the danger of a serious fall. The cyclist is aware of this and pays close attention to his skills as the trail twists and turns, tensely preparing for any issues. Lastly, the steep road also causes delays in his journey. As he stops and starts, he is made to reflect on the difficulty of the ride and his reasons for doing it in the first place. All in all, the ruggedness of the terrain pushes the cyclist to his limits, both physically and mentally. It tests his stamina, skill, and patience. The difficulty of the trail encourages the cyclist to be courageous and to persevere until the end. The features of the setting, therefore, have an immense effect on the cyclist in “Rough Road Ahead.”
