The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho conveys an optimistic tone. The protagonist, a young student, has been struggling with her math grades and worries that she will fail a test that she has just taken. However, by ending the story with the protagonist looking forward to a time when she can retake the test and have a chance to do better, it suggests that there is hope for her and she will likely be more prepared for it the second time around. It also speaks to a larger theme of resilience and the idea that with perseverance, anything is possible.
