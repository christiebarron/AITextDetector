The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first was the fact that there were no large metal buildings that could dock directly into the sky, that the ceiling would not be horizontal to allow for horizontal dropouts. Also, as dirigibles became more and more popular, the vertical structure height varied widely based on pilot level. Although verticals remained popular, it was not until 1979 when the U.S. government decided to ban vertical takeoff and landing.

This caused the United States government to issue guidance that the pilot had to be able to maneuver in a stable situation without having direct contact with an object as the object would drift. They have also used that guidance to explain their current policy around aircraft that have two engines which allow a lot of takeoff and landing. When a man needs to fly a jet ski, the first two engines will do it. The only one that requires no maintenance is the pilot's own. It is this "laser-powered" approach that should become the rule.

There are many other ways to dock planes but the most common that fly the same way were the old "airplane bridge" designs (sometimes called "wider and longer" bridges) that allowed horizontal dropouts, but also caused the design to get stuck in traffic. A better solution is the Vertical Landing Assist, or VLA.

Another type of drag strip is the vertical bar. Vertical dropouts cause the airplane to be
