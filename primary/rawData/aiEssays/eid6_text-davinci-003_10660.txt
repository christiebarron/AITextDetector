The Empire State Building, constructed in 1931, was the first ever skyscraper to offer mooring for airships, better known as dirigibles. This illustrious feat was made possible through the installation of a sturdy "mooring mast" on the roof, which allowed the airships a safe and secure place to dock. Despite being a technical success for the time, the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock was riddled with many obstacles that had to be overcome.

To begin with, dirigible navigation was still in its infancy, and pilots were not able to accurately measure height and position, making it incredibly difficult to locate and dock with the Empire State Building. Furthermore, due to the towering height of the skyscraper, winds had to be factored in, as they created a vortex of turbulence at the docking area which could cause the ship to lose control and crash. As such, the navigators had to plan to take a much more circuitous route upwind, which added significantly to the complexity and danger of the process.

In addition, there were a few minor problems associated with the fitting of the mooring mast itself. Firstly, he building was not designed with mooring or landing in mind, and therefore required extensive renovations and safety precautions to be taken. This included covering the windows with protective steel screens so they could not be broken by the shipâ€™s propellers or cables, as well as providing adequate lighting and markers that the navig
