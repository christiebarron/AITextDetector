In “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, the setting is used to bring the cyclist’s journey, emotions, and struggles to life. The cyclist is trying to reach his destination of his father’s house after two days of hard cycling. The setting features rolling hills, a vast landscape, and long stretches of utter emptiness. 

The rolling hills of the setting contribute to the cyclists struggle along the journey. The hills are described as both long and steep and takes a lot of energy out of the cyclist. The fact that his father's house seems to be many miles away also adds to his exhaustion. The barren yet vast landscape serves to represent the isolation that the cyclist feels on his journey as he reflects on his relationship with his father. His loneliness is further emphasized by the long stretches of emptiness which act to make his thoughts of his father more prominent. 

The heat of the setting serves to intensify the cyclists struggle. With no shade from the sun in sight to give him cover, he must battle through the heat of the day. This serves to highlight his determination and grit as he works through the difficult landscape to reach his destination. 

The setting of “Rough Roads Ahead” serves to bring the cyclist’s journey, emotions, and struggles to life. The rolling hills, vast yet empty landscape, and the searing heat of the day all work together to add depth and realism to the cyclists
