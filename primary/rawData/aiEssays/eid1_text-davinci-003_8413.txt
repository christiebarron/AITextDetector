One evening, I was helping my daughter prepare for her second-grade math test the next day. She was struggling to understand the lesson and kept getting frustrated whenever she made a mistake.

I was getting frustrated myself, and I could feel my patience wearing thin. I took a few deep breaths and reminded myself to stay calm. I reminded myself that I was here to help her navigate this challenge, instead of simply giving her the answers. I wanted to help her learn, not just memorize.

I gently encouraged her, and calmly explained the process of finding the right answer. I gave her example problems to help her understand, and eventually, she got the hang of it and was able to solve the remainder of the practice questions correctly. 

I felt proud of her for not giving up when it got tough, and for being patient to understand the lesson. It wasnâ€™t an easy task for either of us, but it was well worth the effort.
