Once, when I was visiting family in the countryside, I had to do quite a lot of travelling to get there. I was used to the fast pace of city life, so being on rural roads, going at a much slower pace, was quite a shock. As my journey went on, the roads got smaller and more winding, and I was getting frustrated. I knew it was going to take me days to get there, so I decided to practice being patient. 

I took a deep breath and reminded myself that it will all be worth it when I arrived at my destination. Reminding myself of this mantra, I travelled for days and enjoyed the stunning views, even if it was from the backseat of a car. It made me appreciate nature and the stillness of life in the countryside. 

By the time I arrived at my destination, I was relieved and took the time to really appreciate being there. I was thankful for practicing patience on my journey, as it helped me to remind myself to relax and be in the moment.
