I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a legitimate matter, and should be regarded accordingly.

I am aware that the English government would like to protect the free expression of information in this country, and that to do so is to take a dangerous road, one that could end all our freedom for generations to come.

If we agree to do not allow content which harms the public interest, then we have a duty to respond effectively to the danger. It is a responsibility we must take seriously, and the Government must be very clear that, while the UK will be responsible for the freedom of information law to that very day, the UK will not be able to take that responsibility or be expected to respond in its defence.

However, I remain absolutely clear that we must not permit content which harms public interests. I must also agree to protect the freedom of content which cannot be censored and which cannot be suppressed.

This Government has already made clear what we think of free speech rights â€“ so this is a good time to give the public's support and to stop the censering of free speech and freedom of expression in the UK.

These are important issues and we should be thinking of them to see whether we can work in close cooperation with other countries and other governments.

This is a key position of the Parliamentary party and we have been strongly committed to trying to work in closer cooperation.

I will be responding to questions from your constituents in the coming days
