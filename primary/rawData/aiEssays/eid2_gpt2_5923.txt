I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is an important tool, especially when faced with the challenge of preventing material from becoming an accessible repository of information on a person based on their history.

I have been reading, and researching, this paper (see The Future of Digital Publishing, November 2007. Also see "Censorship and Sharing of Personal Content in Libraries," in The Review of Digital Books, February 2004). I found it hard to justify censorship because of the potential for abuse (and abuse itself, of course), but I see no problem in making sure that library services have a good and timely system of censoring personal and sensitive information, in addition to maintaining a robust and secure archive. I hope that, by coming to terms with the idea of privacy, people will be forced to take the choice that has already been made to give up privacy for the privacy of others.
