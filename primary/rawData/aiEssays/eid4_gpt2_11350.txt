The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because that's all it has to offer the reader. I am a sucker for the books we read with this book, or, if you are reading it for yourself, I have another recommendation. If the book isn't quite what you need, there's that one other review of Winter Hibiscus that I did the other day.  It's really good, and it's a rather straightforward and entertaining read, with a sense of wonder at how many people will love it. This book got me really into the world of vampires. While I think my understanding of the characters is more varied, the book is a bit slow to really jumpstart. It starts as a very linear first novel, but over the course of the second chapter, it gets a bit more action packed, and it gets better and better.  At around thirty hours, it gets very familiar to me in a number of ways, but the story is a bit dated and takes a bit longer to get going for me. On one hand, it tries a bit more action, maybe even too much; and that's just fine.  Otherwise, a good story, I give it a 5Char. I'm not sure what else needs telling, but Winter Hibiscus is one of my absolute favorite books of the year, and I've definitely heard some pretty crazy opinions when it comes to it.
