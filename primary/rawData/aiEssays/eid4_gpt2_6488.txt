The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it explores the evolution of different forms of blood in a system: how blood is made. We want the reader to focus more on the body than blood or just the essence. In their approach the authors explore the importance of blood in medicine, both as a natural component in the body and as something that is needed for survival and health.

In the introduction to Winter Hibiscus, William Campbell reveals how the author explores the life of the human body in an attempt to understand how the body responds to different changes in physiology, genetics, and culture. This has been done through a very varied discussion of biology, physiology, and human thought. Campbell is also a noted biochemist. This book goes a long way to understanding the biological roots of the human body.

The author's main goal is to expose the complex concepts we've come to expect when we look at animal, plant, human, primate and so on. The book makes the reader want to read the first 100 pages of "The End of the Hematology", in which the author traces the history of modern medicine. The author provides a few interesting and informative observations and notes in the course of the book that will make you go back into the archives of your own journal and come up with a new perspective.

This was a good book for fans of science fiction or fantasy. Even my own children should check it out. Winter Hibiscus is
