The Empire State Building was built with the intention of allowing dirigibles, or airships, to dock on their mast at the forward peak of the roof. While this plan was incredibly ambitious at the time, the builders and designers of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to make this remarkable dream a reality.

The first obstacle was ensuring that the mast would have enough strength to support large airships docking onto it. Engineers began looking into ways of achieving this task and eventually opted for a truss mast, made of steel and strengthened with three longitudinally bracing members. To support dockings of heavier airships, they added extra steel pipes and cross members, taking the strength from 100,000 lbs to 140,000 lbs, making it more than strong enough to handle docking operations.

The second obstacle the builders faced was the design of the mooring mast. This structure developed by the architects and engineers was to include a circular capturing frame and masthead that would be supported by two mooring cables. To ensure the mooring cables would be able to withstand the weight of the airships, the cables had to be made of airplane quality steel strands with a minimum breaking strength capability of 900,000 lbs. Special grips were included on each end of the mooring cables to help keep them in place, while six wind cable assemblies were also attached, allowing the masthead to swing away from the prevailing wind.
