Dear Editor, 

I firmly believe that computers can have both positive and negative effects on people. There is no simple answer to this question as each individual has different reactions to using computers. 

First of all, computers can help boost productivity and performance in various ways. For instance, it assists in making tedious tasks more efficient by automating processes, and if used properly, can help us become more organized. Furthermore, computers open up a wealth of information and knowledge in a matter of seconds. We can now access almost any kind of information from our home or office, leading to greater accessibility and convenience.

However, the dark side of using computers is that they can also cause us to become isolated from one another, as it makes social interaction more virtual instead of physical. Moreover, excessive use of computers can lead to stress, fatigue, health problems and even addiction in some extreme cases. 

Due to these various positives and negatives of computers, I believe that it is important that we learn to use these tools responsibly, setting boundaries and taking breaks when necessary. We should also take time to interact with people face-to-face and get away from our screens.

I hope I have persuaded you to agree with me.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
