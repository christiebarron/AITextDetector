Narciso Rodriguez’s memoir “From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives” creates a mood of nostalgia, family, and love that tells a story of continuity and strength. 

The memoir follows Rodriguez’s own life story as he moves from his working-class Cuban American family behind the Iron Curtain to the US during his teenage years. As the story progresses, Rodriguez draws on specific memories and events in his life that represent a connection to home and family despite all the uncertainty and upheaval. 

One example of the mood of nostalgia that arises in the memoir comes in an account of Rodriguez visiting his grandparents in Santiago in 2003. As he drives by the home where he stayed as a child, he is overcome by a wave of nostalgia that eventually turns into a feeling of hope. The sense of longing for a time and place that he can never have again mirrors the equally powerful emotions of joy, comfort, and familiarity when the two reconnect at their grandparents’ home. 

Other examples of the same nostalgia are Rodriguez’s memories of his parents’ marriage, and more abstractly, his memory of the smell and taste of his parents’ Cuban-style “sofrito” sauce. He remembers these moments fondly and with a fondness that is both comforting and haunting. 

The combination of nostalgia and hope are woven throughout the book, creating a complex and emotionally-charged mood. Rodriguez
