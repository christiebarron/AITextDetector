The ending of the poem Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho reinforces the sense of hope that the speaker has for a brighter future. By linking the hibiscus to a bright summer future, the poem is linking the coming of warmer months to a second chance for the speaker and the chance to learn. This ending serves to emphasize the idea that no matter how difficult circumstances may be, it is always possible to strive and start again, which is also reflected in the poem's title of ‘Winter Hibiscus’, where the idea of a flower blooming in winter serves as a metaphor for achieving success despite hardship.
