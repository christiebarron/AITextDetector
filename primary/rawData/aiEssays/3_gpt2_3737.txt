Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. I've already talked about the differences in how the setting plays back your performance while you're riding in it. A cyclist using a setting that has an effect at this stage of your race will never get the full effect it was intended for and will never see how they performed when the setting was chosen. But the following was an improvement from a previous testing session where you were testing the same setting in a particular way.

Some performance improvements when setting up the bike

For my riding around town I am in a good position with the bike. While the road is a flat road (but has a straightaway at the end) you often see it at different points when doing some other sorts of cycling. Sometimes you see how the road is narrow, and you try to make things more clear Bengals are very aware of what they are up there, and you try to make it simpler, and help people move more of what they see and hear.
