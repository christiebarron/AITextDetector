The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because we're taking your breath away.

How do you respond to people on the internet suggesting you "get out" and "turn you off?"

You know, it's sort of like you're talking to one-on-one, which is my understanding of the Internet. I don't know when or in what context I responded to each person that was. I just sort of think there were some people you liked that had other experiences. And I'm just thinking a personal explanation. I don't think that people have anything against me because I don't actually like you. I just don't like having a bad relationship with them and I'm a friend of theirs, too.

So that kind of thing. One of the people that I've really seen on the internet is someone that's very much a feminist.

The book opens on the topic of rape culture. Does that have anything to do with it?

Oh, I definitely have it. I never really thought to cover that subject from a feminist perspective, I just thought it was very, very interesting. I thought it was quite funny in a sense. So I'm not really concerned about it. I don't know about that. I'd like to focus on the other important issue, women who report getting the same things. I had a little idea in the last year of why rape was a problem, but not quite understood fully.
