An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my husband, who I knew as well as anyone else in our family. His life changed forever. Today we still share the same passion we once shared with our husband.

If I was ever to be in a relationship in my life, I knew that this would be the biggest change. We would work together to create a better life for each other. We would create a way together that is open and compassionate to all but it is not an open relationship. It is a place for pain and conflict and love and all things in between. And we share in our relationship the happiness and passion that we felt in our lives and we also give back the lives of so many others. We are not different. We are not strangers or people in a circle. We share the same love (our family).

So, I think if somebody or me wants to work very directly with you or you need professional help I would suggest you to speak your mind to one or follical who knows about our relationship and want to work together for your loved ones or someone who can help you with any question regarding your personal life.
