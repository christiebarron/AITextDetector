The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it does not say "if" why it did, it simply says "how." So many people are surprised that the book contains information that is not explicitly documented, by a publisher, or in any way confirmed before print. It contains the very things that make the book possible.

My goal is not to "implement" Winter Hibiscus by presenting details and suggestions that may be helpful to others. I'm going to focus most of the time on things I learned from reading Winter Hibiscus. What I'll do is do what is necessary to make these book suggestions meaningful. By doing so I am trying to bring more knowledge to people who are already familiar with the books, and I hope that other people with similar needs would do the same.

Note: I'm currently taking a year off for my education and the author/writer is asking for it, but you can still attend her meetings, and even help out via the following links:
