The story takes place in the countryside, specifically along the roads of Beartrap Hill—a steep and winding road known for its tough cycling conditions.

The setting creates a powerful atmosphere and affects the cyclist in multiple ways. Firstly, the treacherous hill is steep and winding, which increases the difficulty of the ride and places a strain on the cyclist. This rugged road provides a mental and physical challenge that forces the cyclist to push themselves to the limits in order to make it to the top. It also encourages the cyclist to rely on their own strength and resilience, as there are no other cyclists around to motivate them and help them make it up the hill.

The rural setting also affects the cyclist in a more emotional way. Without the familiarity of a city or town, the cyclist is thrust into a world of deep silence, isolation, and beauty. This draws the cyclist further into the moment and allows them to hone in on the challenge ahead. The wind rustling through the trees and the open sky above add to this experience, offering an awe-inspiring glimpse of the natural world.
