Censorship in libraries has always been a highly contentious issue. Libraries have traditionally been seen as havens for knowledge that should be shared without restriction or judgment. However, books, magazines, or other materials that are deemed offensive by certain individuals or groups could potentially be damaging, especially to young minds. 

While I could argue that we should not restrict access to certain materials, I believe that libraries should enforce some measure of censorship in order to protect the well-being of their patrons. By having boundaries surrounding what is available in libraries, they are doing both their existing patrons, as well as potential future patrons, a great service. 

Contentious topics like racism, sexism, and violence should not be presented to young minds in an uncensored way. Libraries should be a safe space and should provide materials that are appropriate for the age of the patron. When considering new materials, libraries should also assess the potential for harm that certain materials could have. Keeping materials off the shelves that could have a positive impact and be seen as useful, but that could also do great harm is important. 

Libraries do a great service to the community by providing educational material to the public free of charge. By enforcing some censorship, libraries are taking a step to discover which materials should be readily available or should not be included at all. This does not mean that those works are forbidden, but rather that their access should be restricted until the patron is thought to be ready.
