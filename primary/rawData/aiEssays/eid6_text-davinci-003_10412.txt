The Empire State Building, located in New York City, is an iconic building renowned for its picturesque view, allowing spectators to view many of the city’s highlights from its observation deck. However, many people are unaware of the effort that went into allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the building.

In “The Mooring Mast,” Marcia Amidon Lüsted details the incredible feats achieved by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock. The biggest obstacle faced by the project team was the wind conditions at the top of the building. With heavy gusts of wind, it was feared that the dirigibles would be damaged or overturned. Engineers had to build a system to counteract the strong winds, and their solution was the use of 125 tons of steel cable, stretching down the sides of the building and attached to concrete blocks. The cables were connected to a powerful winch which allowed the operators to tighten or loosen the cable as needed to ensure the dirigible was steady.

Another challenge faced by the project team was finding a secure location for the delicate airship to dock. After a more conventional attempt to build a reserved landing area was unsuccessful, the team settled on simply cutting a large hole in the structure of the observation deck, 800 feet in the air. Due to the building’s already advanced design, they were able to construct a lightweight metal platform that could be secured to the floor and
