Minfong Ho ends Winter Hibiscus with this line because it serves as a reminder to the protagonist that things can change for the better. By mentioning the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return, it draws attention to a time of new beginnings, after a time of waiting. This signals hope and the possibility of success; this is echoed in the image of the hibiscus, which buds and blooms when the weather changes and the seasons change. The protagonist is reminded that although life may be tough now, with hard work and determination, they can work towards a brighter future. By ending the poem with this line, Ho gives the protagonist a sense of hope and the belief that no matter how difficult the future may be, there is always potential for improvement.
