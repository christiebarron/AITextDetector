Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

Firstly, many bike tracks have the bike path, and some of the trails have the bicycle path leading off the road. As we've seen from a brief report by the UK's leading cycling magazine Cycling, the majority of these routes have some sort of green or gravel track, while some of the trails simply run on 'biker's bib' which gives them access to the road ahead.

If the route follows a bike path in this way, the likelihood that you will experience an accident is very high. A cyclist who falls on their bike is almost always forced into the path, as an unsecured 'biking trail' can easily contain three dead motorists!

One common scenario is a collision of a motorist or driver with an unsecured bike trail or pavement – this scenario can often lead to the risk of death or serious injury. There is much more to the risk of serious injury and the increased risk will be much higher because of the wider road ahead.

Rough cyclists in the UK make up the overwhelming majority of accidents within London. This is due in large part to the presence of safe commuting routes and the ease of entry to any area – the number of cyclists travelling at any one time is higher in the capital than in parts of the London region.

For example, in 2011:
