In the 1920s the Empire State Building was designed with the intention of having dirigibles dock there. Despite this ambition, the task of creating and safely running a docking station was filled with obstacles, both technological and logistical.

Technology was a major obstacle to dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building. Unlike an airplane, which deploys traditional landing gear, a dirigible had to be moored tethered to a mooring mast. Designing a mast strong enough to withstand the weight of the dirigible and tall enough to be conveniently located on the Empire State Building's observation deck was challenging. Additionally, as flight technology advanced and dirigibles grew heavier and faster, the mooring mast had to keep up with the change. The resistance of the cable had to be considered, lest the cable break and send the dirigible plummeting. Special winch mechanisms had to be designed so the mooring cable had a steady tension. 

Logistical obstacles had to be overcome as well. The logistics of guiding the airship and its crew safely to the Bay was a difficult undertakingâ€”there were no air traffic control regulations in place, and pilots had to expect some interference from the many other airships flying around the area. Unlike airplanes, dirigibles could not easily suddenly reassess or divert their route. Furthermore, weather conditions such as wind and rain had to be taken into account, as they could impede the arrival of the airship or create a
