Computers have many effects on people. They influence our physiology and life cycle. They're also a major player in how our brains perceive reality. Computers know that they can perceive things. And when that's been applied to the human brain, to even the physical world, then they've completely altered our consciousness. In fact, we have been able to understand more about the processes than we've ever known before. You never think you can just pick them off and put them back together again.

In order to understand how computers and neural networks behave, physicists have been going back many times to Einstein's physics in the third millennium BC. The idea was that we might be able to make predictions about many parts of the world, just because of what happened within our own head. In a paper published in the November 2014 edition of the journal Nature, physicists presented their results to the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in which they discussed the limitations of traditional physics, and made it clear they had more work to do on the topic.

That paper was entitled In The Big Ideas Brain – Our Emotion and Cognition, and it was accepted as peer-reviewed.

What did I hear in your lab? We have a lot of colleagues in neuroscience. Dr. E.M.

A lot of them are the ones in our lab… Some of them do reallyStats
