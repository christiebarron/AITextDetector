 

It was a warm summer night and I was sitting out on the balcony of my apartment with my best friend.  We had been talking for hours and we had laughed about just about every topic we could think of. We thought we had run out of things to say, so I decided to start the game of truth or dare. 

I started off by daring my friend to do a handstand off the balcony, even though it was three stories off the ground. I was sure he would never go for it, but to my surprise, he stood up and started doing a handstand in the middle of the air. We both started screaming with laughter as he pretended to hang from the balcony.

Once we stopped laughing, we both just stared at each other in awe of what we had just done. I could feel the bond between us growing stronger and greater than ever before. The connection we shared through laughter is something I could never forget. 

From that day on, laughter was the glue that kept us together. Whenever we were feeling down or had a disagreement, laughter was always there to pick us up and bring us back together. To this day, it's one of my favorite memories.
