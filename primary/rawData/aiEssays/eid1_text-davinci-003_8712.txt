I remember the day I first met my now-husband fondly. It was our freshman year of college, and we had just been placed in the same residence hall. We had bumped into each other a few times in passing and had exchanged a few polite smiles, but we had never actually spoken. That is, until the day we decided to head to the library together.

We both needed to get some work done, but the library was so quiet and uncomfortable, we couldn't help but to want to grab a snack and get out of there. So, we decided to head to the snack bar just across campus. Once there, we started talking about our individual backgrounds and hobbies, and we got each other cracking up within minutes. We had so much to talk about, we ended up chatting for hours. 

I know it was that day that we knew we had something special. Neither of us could explain it, but there was an instant connection that was much deeper than you'd expect two strangers to have. It was laughter that bridged the gap between us on that day, and we never looked back. Nearly a decade later, we are still together and laughing, and it's that initial shared laughter that I remember fondly.
