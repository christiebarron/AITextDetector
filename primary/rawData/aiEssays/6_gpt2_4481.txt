The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first was the need to ensure that the two towers were not separated and that two sides were not separated by a series of beams. This would require building additional columns of concrete and new building materials with different density.

An example of this was the large-scale conversion of the old Empire State Building into a new building system that was to be the basis for another building system by 2020. The two towers were not part of the main building as opposed to a lower structure. But construction is not done, and construction has been completed.

Another impediment to the development of dirigibles was the lack of coordination among the government and private development. When a commercial pilot was commissioned, it was established that the contractor would build and hire a different type of dirigable truck and take responsibility for all of the services that the pilot would provide. This arrangement was made difficult when the contractor only hired a few truck drivers and did not hire a more experienced engineer that was hired by city government. Another problem in this arrangement was the lack of centralized oversight and control of the contractor.

In a way, the idea of the building being a shared development system (one that would have been more like a state-owned cooperative) was a bit of a myth. One of the biggest problems was having developers, developers from all over, work on various parts of the project, especially the tower itself. While
