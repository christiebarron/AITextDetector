Dear Editor,

I am writing with my opinion on the effects that computers have had on the way people work, learn, and communicate. As a current student, I have personally experienced both the positive and negative aspects of the digital age.

At its core, the power of computers lies in its ability to provide access to a world of knowledge. For research and studying, I can quickly access vast libraries of information and be well informed on any topic, be it a global issue or a local event. Furthermore, it has been humbling to watch my peers use digital tools to express themselves and show their creativity.

On the downside, I find that many of us are becoming too dependent on digital tools and we are missing out on the joys of traditional communication. Social media has caused an increase in reliance on digital screens to develop social skills instead of interacting with people face-to-face. Additionally, there are certain psychological effects associated with too much technology such as loss of focus and a decrease in productivity.

As computers continue to become a major part of day-to-day life, a healthy balance between technology and human interaction is essential. Therefore, I urge the readers to find the right mix that works
