The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is reminiscent of the character of Dr. Harry C. K. Hall that has a more dramatic side to him.

He was one of a number of characters in the movie that have the most to do with the book series, to have their day as well as their daily lives taken up with the book series.

The way we see Dr. Hall and his family throughout 'from home is the way we see some of the more interesting things in the book seriesâ€¦He is a wonderful character, a fascinating character, an engaging character," said Hall.

Kirk Cameron and Amy Adams will be producing 'From Home: From Home' and will continue production at Empire Books.
