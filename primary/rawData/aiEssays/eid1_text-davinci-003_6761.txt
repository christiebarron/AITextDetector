Dear Editor, 

It is no surprise that technology—particularly computers—has become an integral part of modern life. But do the effects of computers have a positive or a negative impact on our lives? As one who is immersed in technology and aware of its many advantages, I believe that computers have had a tremendous positive effect on people.

Our lives have become more efficient and productive thanks to computers, and they have revolutionized almost every industry. While they can be seen as a source of distraction and sedentary behavior, computers also offer ample opportunities for positive activities such as gaming, creative projects, networking, and much more. With the internet also comes an abundance of educational opportunities that students are able to take advantage of online. 

Moreover, many of us are now able to stay connected with friends and family over long distances more easily than ever before using the internet. Computers enable us to research things quickly—from finding information we need to job and school opportunities, to shopping for day-to-day items. 

The advantages of computers cannot be understated and people should be encouraged to use computers as a tool for learning, creativity and connectivity. To my mind, computers have been an incredible addition to our daily lives. 

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
