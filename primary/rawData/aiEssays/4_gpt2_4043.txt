The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it is much more powerful than any of his previous books, for both good and for bad. It is more readable, more informative, and more complex than other collections of his books.

Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it is much more powerful than any of his previous books, for both good and for bad. It is more readable, more informative, and more complex than other collections of his books. It could be called a 'non-fiction, non-academic collection', but that is simply not what Winter Hibiscus is, and much of what he writes can be understood as an examination of the whole of history. Winter Hibiscus's life is set in the same world as those of Martin Luther, though, with only a small chapter devoted to his first name, Martin Luther. But this is a relatively simple and easy reading, and there are no unnecessary chapters or appendices in the book which give it its unique and unique name, nor is there a huge amount of discussion in the first half.
