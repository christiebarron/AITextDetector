Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects that computers have on people. It seems that computers and the internet are everywhere these days. They are used in almost every aspect of life, from work to leisure.

Many people think that computers and the internet are having a positive impact on our lives. They make tasks easier and faster. They help us stay in touch with friends from around the world. They provide access to vast amounts of information at the click of a button.

However, computers and the internet can have a negative effect on people too. They are often addictive and can end up taking up too much time. They can be a distraction from important things such as work or relationships. They are also linked with increased stress and anxiety levels.

It is important to use computers and the internet in moderation. We should be mindful of the amount of time we spend on them and make sure that it doesnâ€™t interfere with our lives. We should use technology to help us, not hinder us.

I urge readers to think carefully about the effects that computers and the internet can have on their lives.

Yours sincerely,

[Name]
