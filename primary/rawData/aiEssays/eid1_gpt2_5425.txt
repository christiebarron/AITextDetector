Computers have many effects on people. Their perception of the reality and their emotional and behavioral reactions are affected by what we are seeing.

"What is there in the mind? What are these things that we think could be a way to reduce pain and pleasure?" explains Michael Lach.

"If a problem person's mind becomes overwhelmed with that sort of thing, you have some sort of neurolinguistic disorder. Neurolinguisms can affect our experience of reality, and we tend to be better at handling this than other humanoids."

Lach and Mark Eitel are the lead authors of the study, which involved more than 200 young people and six control students. The study was funded by the Centre for Medical and Social Research, the Centre of Research Excellence and the Social Sciences Research Council, all three of which have published scientific reviews.
