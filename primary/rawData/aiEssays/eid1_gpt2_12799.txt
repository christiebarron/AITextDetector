Computers have many effects on people. When someone is doing something that is difficult to control, people usually want to control that and get their act together."

The National Research Council for Human Behavior, which focuses on research ethics and ethics, describes Human Relations as "a society where people are allowed to feel different and express themselves differently." As with all social sciences, for a long time people were the only ones to take that philosophy to heart. But with the invention of the Internet, more people are expressing themselves. Now people like "The One," who has just started a small company for human relations, are taking action.

Many of them have adopted the Facebook social features (see "People for Facebook with Human Relations," March 2). They were also the first to adopt what they call "Social Identity in Computers," which was designed to give people more control by giving them something more than just "a name." According to The New York Times, "The idea is that even if you can't say something, you can still be able to say it, 'I'll keep you updated,' instead of your name."

A study by an international team of researchers led by Simon Schuster found that people who use Facebook had more power over how they felt.

As the study revealed, though, if people were encouraged to interact more as well, they were happier. The research also showed that, though people may think differently to this point, they actually made their own decisions
