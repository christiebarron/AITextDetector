The Empire State Building was designed with the ambitious goal of allowing dirigibles to dock at the top. This idea had been tested on an earlier building in Manhattan, the 51-story City Investing Building, but they were unable to reach the desired results. The challenge of creating a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building proved to be an even greater obstacle.

The building’s architects first surveyed the site for potential issues. They determined that winds could reach up to 34 mph, and that occasional high winds and rains would need to be taken into consideration. They also had to determine the most efficient design for the mooring mast that could work with the Empire State Building.

The heights of the new building walls presented another issue. Though a standard mast design could be used at the top of the lower building, the height of the new building would prevent the use of a conventional air bag, or balloon, to slow the airship during the docking process. Such a balloon was necessary to absorb the force of an airship crashing against the mast. This obstacle was solved by designing a unique “high air bag” system that was tall enough to catch and cushion the force of the airship.

The engineers also had to incorporate cable systems for the airship pilots to use in mooring themselves. They created a pulley system of steel cables that stretched from various points on the building’s exterior to the top of the mast.
