Dear Editor,

With the ever-increasing influence of computers on our daily lives, I think it is important to analyze the effects that they have on our society and how we interact with one another. 

I strongly believe that computers can have a detrimental effect on our lives, especially when they are used to replace direct human interaction. For example, technology is making it easier for companies to employ remote workers to complete tasks and perform roles that would normally require face-to-face interaction. As a result, there has been a decline in the quality of relationships that are formed in the workplace.

I also think computers can cause us to miss out on important cultural and social experiences, such as attending live music concerts or meeting up with friends in person. While computers can be used to stay connected with loved ones, the lack of physical presence can often lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection with people.

Rather than letting computers take over our lives, we should recognize the importance of engaging in regular physical activity, getting regular social interaction, and taking part in some kind of creative endeavour. All of this helps us stay connected to our communities, build relationships, and become better people. 

I hope this letter
