The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Though they were able to land more than 100 tons of a concrete building on landarchy, it would not permit them to install dirigibles at their site.

"As long as we still have a way of doing things and keep ourselves occupied with all the stuff that goes into building them, at least we can keep ourselves occupied with it," said Paul Leach, a principal in the Center for Applied Studies at University College London.

If dirigibles were to be installed on buildings in the future and in the shape of the US flag as they were being built, the Empire State Building would be the first in the world to have those kinds of objects with the technology to hold them.

"If you take that one up on the chin with the US flag, there'd be a problem - we're still building our Empire State Buildings," says Bruce Hallishek, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge and author of the book Empire State Buildings: A New Way of Thinking about the Future of Buildings. "Even today, we still have a flag and we still have a way of working it because the American flag is part of that tradition."
