Building the Empire State Building had many obstacles, one of the most unexpected of which was the necessity to make the building accessible to dirigibles. Dirigibles, as they are today, were the largest airships ever to carry passengers, and in order to be used for commercial purposes they had to be able to dock at the building. This proved to be an immense challenge for the builders, as the men behind this iconic skyscraper had never before attempted something of this magnitude. 

The architects understood that a technical engineering feat of this scale had no precedent, and it was therefore necessary to invent a way to safely dock a large dirigible at the Empire State Building. In the book “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lusted, the obstacles of the task are outlined. Key among these is the fact that the building was not initially designed to accommodate the weight of a fully laden airship. It was necessary to construct a lightweight mooring mast, made of aluminum, steel, and even wooden parts, atop the building at the 101st floor. Such a mast was then outfitted with strong steel cables to safely receive the dirigible.

The bulk and size of the dirigibles also present a problem. In order to dock at the Empire State Building, the airships had to be able to turn in mid-flight and manage tight maneuvers within the airspace above the building. Although some of the airships successfully achieved these maneuvers
