Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have had on people.

In this digital age, computers are an integral part of our lives and have had both positive and negative effects on us. On the one hand, computers have allowed us access to an abundance of knowledge and enabled us to communicate with each other no matter the distance. Computers have made our lives easier, quicker, and smarter in many ways. But the constant use of technology also has a downside. It has the potential to cause feelings of isolation, depression, and addiction. The average person spends too much time in front of a screen and not enough time experiencing and enjoying life.

To ensure that computers remain a blessing, we must be sure to use them wisely and find the balance between technology and other aspects of life. We must remind ourselves to take a break from the screen, go outside, and spend time being active and socializing. This will reduce the risks of unhealthy screen time and help us to remain healthy and in touch with the world.

I hope that this letter will remind readers of the importance of striking a balance between our technology use and other pathways.

Sincerely,

[Your
