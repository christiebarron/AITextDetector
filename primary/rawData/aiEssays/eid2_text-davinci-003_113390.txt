Censorship in libraries is a highly controversial issue. While some people see it as wrong to censor material, others believe it is necessary for the protection of young people or those easily influenced. On the one hand, it is important to acknowledge that libraries are free sanctuaries for people with diverse backgrounds, interests, and beliefs. People should be allowed to read any material regardless of whether someone else finds it inappropriate.

However, this does not mean that librarians should ignore the potential harm that certain materials may bring to vulnerable audiences. The responsibility of librarians is to assess the content of books, magazines, music, and movies in order to make an informed decision about whether it should be on the shelves or not. By doing so, they are protecting people of all ages, such as those who may be influenced or affected negatively by offensive materials.

Therefore, while librarians should not be in the practice of censorship, they should have the right to remove materials from the library when they believe that the content of the material is objectionable or inappropriate. This is especially true for sex, violence, hate speech, or other forms of offensive material that could influence readers negatively.

Finally, librarians should be given the authority to determine if a book, magazine, movie, or piece of music should remain on the shelves. It is important that this decision be based on the quality of the materials and the potential impact it could have, rather than personal opinion.
