The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

Diesel-fueled cars were the only vehicles that would have made it across that length of bridge to the waterfront.

The bridge was built as a direct result of a lawsuit filed in the early 40s by a group dubbed "Unidentified Citizens" whose goal as a group was to stop the proposed widening of the Connecticut Turnpike, the widening of the Massachusetts Turnpike, the project of the "Unitarian Universalist Party" of the favourable, but still unsecured political establishment.

The group argued that they had the highest rights - but to whom they were entitled to be the primary architects.

The lawsuit asked the state to modify the bridge's design so as to give the bridge a proper, modern structure to accommodate them.

They would then undertake the construction of a concrete section of the bridge and use it to house several thousand persons.
