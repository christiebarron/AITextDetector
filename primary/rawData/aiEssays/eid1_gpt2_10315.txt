Computers have many effects on people.

People often say that computers have more personality and more influence on their lives than we think because if you penetrating their minds they become very interested in your questions and ask a lot of questions. If they are in a deep relationship, they become very attracted to your ideas and their interest grows.

But some people get so addicted they end up doing things to make sure their ideas and problems get better. They get bored and go away. We do very interesting experiments. We do experiments when people say you don't want money and the only thing that they want is $2,000. So you create a fund, they don't like it and they're going to send you up the stairs.

What are you using a lot of resources to do?

A lot of tools. In addition to computers we have social media and we have databases of people I know who go on Facebook, Instagram or other places and when I see the word 'computer' in there and I say, 'Is that the human of the world?" I'm using tools. We use databases like Twitter and Facebook.

What's the point?

I've been involved in some really amazing projects over the last couple years and also with Google I think, I also learned so much from the first few years of working for Google which was my work on the internet and in the social media space in general since my days as a programmer as well.
