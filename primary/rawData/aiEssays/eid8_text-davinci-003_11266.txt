As I made my way to the dinner table, I could hear the laughter of my family coming from the kitchen. I paused and took a moment to appreciate the warmth of this moment before I stepped into view. Although I couldn't see it yet, I knew that we would all be seated around the dinner table— Mom and Dad at the head with my sister and I on either side of them. We never had to look for conversation at the dinner table, it just seemed to seep in through the laughter that filled the air. 

That night was no exception. When I stepped into the kitchen I was immediately welcomed by the sound of my parents’ convulsive laughter. It was almost overwhelming coming from both of them at once, and my sister and I couldn’t help but join in. There we were, the four of us laughing so hard I thought tears would start streaming down our faces any moment. 

It wasn't even anything particularly funny— my Dad had just had a particularly bad day at work and had let out a long weary sigh as he started to dish out dinner. Of course, this was all it took for everyone else to set off into a fit of laughter. As we attempted to catch our breath and bring ourselves back to the dinner table we all shared a moment of warmth and connection, something that I now know was made possible only by the laughter we shared. 

We’ll always look back on that night
