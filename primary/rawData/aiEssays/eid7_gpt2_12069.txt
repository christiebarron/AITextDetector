An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my former roommate at the University of Southern California, the great scientist, mathematician, and business professor; he was a man whom I'd known for years. On the day the Berkeley paper turned up, the news got around that some of the folks with the paper had been charged with "insistence in the first place" for their alleged involvement with the publication. It was obvious that it was only a matter of time before all of the news would turn up.

Of course, there were some things I didn't quite know, as it turns out, that were true, and some things that were not, too. My sense was that it looked like some of these folks were going to be held accountable. My suspicions were correct that my friend Bob would have his hands tied. But the whole affair was just a matter of time, and the case didn't really turn out that way.
