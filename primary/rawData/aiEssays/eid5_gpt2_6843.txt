The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' remains somewhat surreal for its writer, who recalls being in bed when "a guy in a trench coat" interrupted the conversation. (The novel does show this, as though we're being pushed out by a car.) But, no matter how we put it, as a man whose life has been a blur, it's clear that I've spent more than a quarter of my life being in the crosshairs of men I love, and to me, this is not about a person. I, in fact, am the very heart of mankind, and I will never be the person who can have my heart broken.

Like most in contemporary feminism it is a very personal thing, the pursuit of a certain view of women's roles, as well as the pursuit of social standing in society. As a result, as feminist activists and commentators such as Germaine Greer, Margaret Atwood, Joan Didion and many others have argued and written about, the way we treat women is shaped by how we feel about them or our experience of them. This isn't just the male gaze facing us. It's also the gaze facing us of the whole people, the men and the women. In a way, this is what makes men different that our other male contemporaries. In other words, because men and women differ in a lot of ways, it makes them more human than our real-life counterparts.
