Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effect computers have had on people. I believe that computers have been a powerful tool, both positive and negative, in the development of the modern world.

On the positive side, computers have allowed us to work with more efficiency, research with greater accuracy, and communicate more quickly. It is difficult to overstate how much technology has revolutionized the way our society operates. Computers have had an undeniable influence in the way we learn, work, and interact with one another.

On the other hand, some worrisome effects are also clear. By spending extended periods of time in front of a computer, we can lose sight of the real world and the value of real interaction. Additionally, computer screens can be hard on our eyes, and using a computer can lead to physical problems if we are not careful.

Despite the potential drawbacks, computers offer remarkable opportunities. They bring knowledge all over the world and provide immediate responses to questions. For these reasons, I feel that computers should not be considered bad or dangerous; they deserve respect and should be used wisely.

I hope that readers of this letter will understand the benefits and drawbacks of computers in our lives and be cautious about their use.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
