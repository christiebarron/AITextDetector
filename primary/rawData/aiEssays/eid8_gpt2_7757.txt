One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I had to go in an elevator with a man who seemed to want to kill me. He was wearing a blue jacket. One time it was red and a young man in a suit grabbed my arm. He told me: "You are going to die if you do not go on the elevator. Go into the elevator first." I said, "I'll leave you to die."
