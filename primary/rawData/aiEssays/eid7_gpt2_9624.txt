An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I walked into my doctor at the hospital to get breast cancer treatment. I was on the waiting list for an exam, so the doctor asked me to have a test come to this office from the side of the room. I was told no. She told me to go and get a scan because I was having radiation poisoning. And when I got to see the doctor she was so relieved, and she said, "There is nobody there for me. I feel really good about this here, and the best thing is for this hospital here to be open to the public." A month later, I was still in my hospital gown, with radiation poisoning. And I still needed to get my scan done. Over the past three years, I have had several tests performed and been receiving multiple follow-up visits. And I have no idea what to say about what really hurts my life. And if someone in my life wants to know what I have to go through, I know what that sounds like.

Q: You have your own "I'll be back for you soon" attitude. As an ex-military, I would've preferred to be off duty when it was time to get treatment than to be on a plane and waiting in a room surrounded by people who had not received radiation. My current job in health care was to help those people in the hospital who would have died, but I now can't have anyone in this
