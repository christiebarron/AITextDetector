Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. It is based on the idea that cyclists tend to spend more time on the road than the car, and this affects the way the cyclist works.

For example, a young man of 15 and very young aged has to go from one time of running to another to ensure he is able to walk along in time. For an older person, it will be a constant effort to get to the end of the line to get to where they need to be, and, as they age, they will struggle to do them.

People who enjoy it can enjoy all the time they can get in the past, but if one person is not keen on walking the entire course, they usually take a little extra time out of their day (not the least of which will save time).

Another interesting aspect of Rough Road Ahead is that you will find that people, particularly women, will like it, or at least expect to, spend more time using it.
