I was sitting in my first class of the semester when my eyes met an unfamiliar face. As the professor droned on, I caught her stealing glances my way, and when I did the same I noticed a bright smile formed on her lips. That's when I froze and quickly looked forward. 

After the lecture, I rushed out of the classroom and walked towards the library. Just when I was about to turn the corner, I felt a tap on my shoulder.

When I spun around, I saw her standing next to me, looking at me with an expectant gaze. After a moment of confusion, I asked "Can I help you?"

She smiled in response and said, "I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm Nisha." Embarrassment washed over me as I realized I hadn't even had the opportunity to register her name for attendance.

I nervously shook her hand. "I'm David. Nice to meet you."

We started talking and Nisha told me she had noticed my boredom throughout the class, and thought it might be a good idea to introduce herself. I soon discovered that she had an incredibly dry sense of humor and I couldn't help but laugh. 

Before we knew it, we had been talking for hours. I later realized that it was the shared laughter that had taken us all that way, and sealed the beginnings of our friendship.
