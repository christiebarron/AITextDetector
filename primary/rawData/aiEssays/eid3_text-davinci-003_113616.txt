The features of the setting of the story "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski profoundly affect the cyclist’s experience. The story revolves around a cyclist taking on a rugged terrain, with a daunting switchback, as he is attempting to overcome and conquer the road before him. 

The cyclist has chosen to challenge himself for the mental and physical accomplishment of reaching the end of the rough road ahead. The road is described as “hard-packed…studded with rocks” and its steep grade is a challenge for even the most experienced cyclist. The cyclist has to battle the physical road conditions and his own mental doubts about his abilities. 

A visual feature of the setting “steep sea of brown hills with gently rolling mountains in the distant background” suggests an image of an overwhelming and possibly never-ending obstacle standing before him. The will and strength it requires to continue despite the fear of the physical exhaustion that may await is an example of the power of the mind over the body.

The setting also serves as a platform for the cyclist’s personal journey to test himself and his abilities. The physical challenge is illustrative of the mental struggle that anyone who attempts a goal they believe may be beyond their reach encounters; the fear of failure or the exhaustion of the challenge, yet the courage and determination to push on no matter what.
