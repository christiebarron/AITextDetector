One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I first saw her. She was kind and respectful but very intelligent. She gave me a good impression of how we interact but there must be a lot more for us to learn. At the least we can show her that she is more in character and we are not lacking in character.

I always wondered when I would be in the future. My younger brother is not in school. We are young enough that we thought we were about to be able to go to another place to go to. But as it turns out, we did not get a chance to see his wife and daughter when his dad died. And I was feeling really sad when he came home. She and his wife made two trips to the same place to celebrate their wedding, but our first trip was a bit more exciting. It was a really sweet evening for us.

The other day I found out that when I was 22, my mum had died. It was our last day at the club. We had always thought she would be home soon, but her parents died two years ago. What I remember most of the time was how much my sister cried. I never knew why it started, but I could hardly believe my sister was leaving. We used to go to the park with the boys and just go out. I remember my dad coming out and giving a speech, and my mum would say something to my face that was just so special
