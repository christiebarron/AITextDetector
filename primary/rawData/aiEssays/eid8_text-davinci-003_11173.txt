I spent the day with my grandmother, a woman with a zest for life that I adore. We'd driven a few hours to visit her long-standing friend and catch up. On the trip home, we decided to take a stop and have dinner a few fields away from her house. 

When we walked in, the patrons laughed in unison at something one of the workers had said. Being the curious person I am, I asked what was so funny. One of the waitresses told me that the man behind the counter had been trying to start a conversation for ages with a tumbleweed that had gotten stuck in the corner of the restaurant. He'd seen it as he was coming in and decided to say hello, thinking the tumbleweed was another patron. Everyone was stifling back laughter, thinking it was an absolutely classic thing to do. 

My Grandmother burst into laughter, which only made the rest of us laugh even harder. I couldn't remember the last time I'd seen her laugh so much. Seeing my grandmother so happy was fantastic, and it was such a great feeling. In that moment I realized that laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people, and it was just what my grandmother and I needed that day.
