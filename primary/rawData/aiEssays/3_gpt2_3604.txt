Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. The setting appears to provide the best possible cyclist feel and reduce vibrations. However, it reduces the overall quality of the cyclist's ride and provides negative feedback, resulting in a lack of balance in the cycling. The setting also appears to negatively impact the cycling from corner to corner. Here are some examples. In the image below, one of the riders' brakes is broken which impacts the bike. This leads to a lower riding speed and higher speeds for the same riding level of the other cyclist. This can result in slower and better quality of ride.


The setting reduces the overall sound quality of your ride and the sound is more consistent as the bike runs.


In the image below the tyre will fall off as if it was on pavement. This can result in a greater amount of noise and vibration in the rider's body.


There is no sound reduction from tyre to tyre, reducing the sounds experienced by a rider (as a result, vibration is also reduced).


The setting in the camera system does improve the sound quality of your bike.


A low vibration setting, whilst not ideal, enables an even more consistent use of the bike.
