Recently, there has been growing controversy regarding censorship in libraries. The debate surrounds whether certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves if they are found to be offensive. This essay aims to present a persuasive argument in favor of keeping these materials in libraries.

First and foremost, censorship in libraries is an extreme limitation of free speech and expression. Publicly funded institutions have a responsibility to ensure that its citizens can obtain access to a variety of materials â€“ no matter how offensive they may be. Removing sources that may be unpopular or deemed offensive sets a dangerous precedent for the way we think about free speech and should not be condoned. 

Second, costly and time-consuming court proceedings often accompany attempts to remove a book from library shelves. This process can become even more expensive and lengthy if the item in question is contained in a larger collection, such as a database. The significant amount of resources that must be devoted to this often unnecessary legal process suggests that free expression should be respected to avoid using unnecessary resources.

Finally, by allowing access to potentially offensive materials, a public library can truly fulfill its mission of providing unbiased, accurate, and up-to-date information. By removing any material deemed offensive by a certain segment of society, we risk painting an incomplete picture of life, preventing us from understanding our world and its citizens. Removing such materials shuts down dialogue that could otherwise prove advantageous and informative, particularly for scholars
