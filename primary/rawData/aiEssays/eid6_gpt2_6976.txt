The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first was the fact that they had done no good and had never done anything to prevent them from building dirigs. The second issue involved the use of propane during transport of the building. The problem was that in the original plans they put propane through a pressure chamber to a level that would have prevented it from being used in transport. In practice they used propane as a high explosive before they built any dirigs.

As the building went through a series of testing, the air pressure in various airbags and compressors increased to keep out the gases from leaking into the buildings. In practice propane continued to leak and the airbags became more resistant to fire than to fire retardants. The fire retardant that is now used in the Empire State Building has a high concentration of hydrogen cyanide which caused the building to crack when burning down. The propane that was used in the process of putting up the building's airbags was so high in the benzene that the fuel that was being burned ignited it as gas. As a result there was an increase in the amount of the hydrogen cyanide produced when the building burned down. Propane was being used as an inert solid during the work and was not being used during transportation of buildings. The fact that it was being used in the building may help explain why the building became hot due to the burning-out of propane, which
