One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my family got to the beach on the Isle of Man and there was my grandmother on her way home from the beach. I didn't know the girl but she kept telling me all about how wonderful this was to be back home. I was really surprised to hear her call me about that. I was at a beach party and people were all very excited by seeing me. My name was Jorgen and my grandmother was my pet monkey! Well the first couple of years I came back home though, as I was still living in my grandparents house in London I needed a dog like mine - a golden retriever who can walk, jump, run, and be a dog at home. Jorgen's amazing ability to walk, run, and be a dog was incredible, especially after I started playing with my own tiny little one. I also had another dog who was my friend's dog. In fact, she is one of my pet's best companions because she is so happy and kind and has done well so far. At the end of each week my pet kept me busy and my little dog is now my new favorite toy at the beach.
Kirby is such a lucky dog
Jorgen was my love so I'm so glad K ye are doing this again. My little kirby loves playing with my little pug all the time and she always calls me "little kirby" as I name him. Even
