Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.


This is the one area I find myself most impressed by, and how different cycling has changed my behaviour over the last decade, while still maintaining it within the current culture of road riding.


I'm sure there are thousands riding around the city every year, but this is where I see most real value - the people I met at some of our festivals and rode with the best.


It could also be said that the way cycling has been changed is that even the elite cycling communities of the state of South Australia do the work, as it is a community where the only people who feel the need to ride are those that are willing to get on the bike.


For my work here it was my understanding that local groups could offer a wide variety of different ride routes and experiences to the locals, and as such this was where I found myself with a pretty decent line-up of what this 'Bike Guide For South Australia' list offered:


A

B

C

D

E

F

G

H
