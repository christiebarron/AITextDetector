I was out for lunch with my best friend. We had been catching up for a while, discussing our lives, when she suddenly burst into a loud and infectious laugh. I couldn't help but join in, not knowing what I was laughing about. 

It turns out that was the joke; she had been tickling me under the table without me noticing and I had instinctively tried to swat her away. We were both so surprised and delighted with the moment that we just laughed uncontrollably until tears rolled down our cheeks. 

Laughing together is one of the ways that I've been able to form such a strong bond with my best friend. We still tell each other stories about that moment when we first laughed together. It's one of our favorite moments to share and always puts an expense in our day.
