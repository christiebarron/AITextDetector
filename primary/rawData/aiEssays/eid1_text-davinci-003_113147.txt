Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my opinion on the effects computers have on people. In the age of technology, it is hard to imagine a life without computers. We use computers for many everyday activities, from basic tasks like grocery shopping to more complex activities like completing work assignments.

However, computers can have a negative impact on people. With computers being used for almost every task, people are losing the physical skills necessary for everyday life. We no longer have the need to remember names, phone numbers, birthdays, or other important information. We no longer must use our brains to find solutions for problems since our computers can do it for us.

I believe that computers should be used to supplement our everyday lives, not to take the place of everyday activities. I strongly urge everyone to find a balance between using technology and engaging in physical activities. We can use computers to provide us with assistance, but at the same time, we need to develop skills that rely on our own initiative and ingenuity.

The impact of computers on people should not be overlooked. We must realize the importance of physical activities as well as the assistance computers can provide. I hope that this letter will persuade readers to agree with me and find a healthy balance between technology and physical activities.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
