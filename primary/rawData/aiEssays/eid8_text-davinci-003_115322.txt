I was out to dinner with my best friend, catching up on all the news from the past few years. We were tucked away in a corner, reminiscing about all the silly things we'd done together in high school. 

Suddenly, we were both hit with the same memory at the same time: the time we were both so eager to impress a group of friends with our goofy dance moves and somehow ended up tumbling into a pile on the ground. We started laughing uncontrollably. We were giggling until tears were coming to our eyes. 

Other diners started to look, and soon enough we had an entire restaurant full of people laughing along with us. We saw an older couple smiling at us and pointing, and we both smiled back. We even got a round of applause. 

It was one of those moments that you know you'll never forget. It was a moment that showed us how powerful laughter can be in bringing us closer together. It was a reminder that no matter how tough life gets, a good joke can always bridge the gap between two people.
