I recently had the opportunity to witness an amazing display of patience. I was out in the front yard with my daughter when the mailman drove by. He had regular mail in one hand but also had a package for us in the other. He stopped his truck and motioned for us to come over. My daughter ran up to him with excitement, but as soon as she got close, he stepped back and told us, "I'm sorry, but I have to stay 6 feet away."

My daughter looked at me, a bit confused and disappointed, but I could see the mailman's determination not to put us at risk. I stepped forward and said, "Thank you so much for thinking of us. We really appreciate it." I walked up and took the package from him, making sure to keep our distance.

The mailman smiled at my daughter and said, "No problem. You have a good day."

I was surprised and impressed by his patience in this situation. He could have easily left the package in the mailbox, but instead he waited for us and displayed such care. His patience was incredibly admirable.
