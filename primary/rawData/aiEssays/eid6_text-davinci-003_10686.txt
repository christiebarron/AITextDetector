The building of the Empire State Building in 1931 reached its zenith when it was revealed that it would be the world's first building to allow dirigibles to dock at its top floors. With plans to have a mooring mast, a high-tower like structure, at the top of the building, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a multitude of obstacles.

The first major obstacle was the limited space available. The original plan had called for a much larger mast, but space constraints in the existing design of the building forced the designers to reduce its size. The resulting shorter mast meant that the airships could no longer simply fly in from the side of the building, as originally intended. This necessitated a switch to a converging path, whereby the airships would have to approach the structure from roughly one thousand feet away before maneuvering their way in at a sharp angle.

The second major obstacle was the risk of conductor fatigue. Although the mooring mast had been mainly designed to accommodate the airships, it also acted as a conduit for the electric charges that were necessary for navigation. The cost and complexity of running the wires up the mast proved too great, as the high voltage currents from the power lines may prove to be long-term harmful to the operators on the ground. As such, the mast was only able to operate for a limited time before the risk of conductor fatigue resulted in the closure of the docking stations.
