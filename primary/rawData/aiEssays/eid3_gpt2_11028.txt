Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. While the bike path has been changed and road surfaces tweaked or added, the way cyclists approach and move is still the same, making for a really interesting and engaging setting for the novice and intermediate cyclists.

The setting also makes cycling a real chore for any young rider in the UK; it's what makes a rider feel as though the road is more open and easy than the past.

There is also real drama and friction between riders as they tackle the bike while holding their bike upright – making it difficult to use your hand, or turn it up and down to the nearest 'right tackle' position (the top of the bike).

We're not really going to cover all the bike paths in this guide – there are very special ways to make your cycling experience as fun and enjoyable as possible for all young cyclists. But here it is: one of the top routes in the country in 'Rough Road Ahead', 'Bike to Start', and others.

The Bike to Start Route

1. A short bike ride up one of the routes above to finish off your first course of oncoming traffic – and you will be in a more open setting as you climb higher and higher. This course will also be part of the main course and will also be your route going up on a path leading up to or onto the road.
