The idea of dirigibles docking at the top of the Empire State Building is a popular story, yet few people realize the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to accommodate them. Marcia Amidon Lüsted's book The Mooring Mast explains these challenges and unveils the story of those who pursued this ambitious dream.

At its aperture, the primary challenge was one of sheer engineering: the Empire State Building was not designed to be a mooring mast. Its structure could not support the significant loads generated by a dirigible, particularly in inclement weather. Without any additional engineering or construction, the building itself was insufficient to provide a viable mooring solution. 

To make the dream of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building a reality, substantial changes had to be made. According to Amidon Lüsted, external engineers proposed extremely costly modifications to the building, such as a new type of metal mast with a unique base and anchor. This mast would extend through steel sheaths down through the building’s top two floors and into the bedrock below. It was estimated that this would cost upwards of a million dollars, an exorbitant figure for the time. 

The complexity of the project was further increased due to the fact that the top of the Empire State Building was crowded. Various infrastructure components and buildings were crammed within the tight area, making it difficult to erect a large mast. This overcrowded area
