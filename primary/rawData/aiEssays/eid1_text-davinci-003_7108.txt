In Joe Kurmaski’s story “Rough Road Ahead”, the cyclist is presented with a treacherous route throughout the Appalachian Mountains. This treacherous road makes it impossible for the cyclist to maintain a steady pace and this reflects in his internal struggle with maintaining his focus and motivation.

The challenging features of the setting, such as the sudden changes in elevation, the narrow paths, and the unpredictable turns, force the cyclist to constantly be alert and prepared to adjust his approach on the fly. Due to the unpredictable nature of the terrain, he is not able to maintain his regular pace, instead forcing him to pace himself and remain in control.

The constant mental and physical struggle of travelling through this harsh environment results in the cyclist questioning his desire to complete the journey. He is filled with trepidation each time he needs to deal with an obstacle, as each one carries the risk that he may be thrown off the bike, or worse. This fear of danger helps to keep the cyclist focused on his goal despite his challenges.

Throughout the story, the setting serves as a source of difficulty and anxiety, as the cyclist constantly faces the challenge of remaining in control of the bike as well as his own focus and motivation. The features of the setting force him out of his comfort zone, as his constant struggles to stay ahead of said features enable him to grow as both a cyclist and a person.
