The last line of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho is symbolic of resilience, courage, and hope. This hibiscus that is buried under the snow is resilient, managing to stay alive throughout the tough winter months. In the same way, the protagonist is encouraged to demonstrate resilience in the face of the challenge of taking the test again and persevere against whatever challenges may come. The last line also speaks to the idea of hope and renewal that is usually associated with the coming of spring: the new growth of the hibiscus flower symbolizes the possibilities of the future and the protagonistâ€™s renewed courage and determination.
