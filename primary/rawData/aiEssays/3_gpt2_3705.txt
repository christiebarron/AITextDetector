Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. As the driver of this vehicle, it is assumed that they have a good, relaxed attitude towards driving, especially a relatively simple one. This is one of the things that can get in the way of a safe bike ride.

The number of cyclists coming out of these vehicles may depend on an individual cyclist's situation and the number of people that have been riding on the sidewalk as shown in the image below. For this, use this range of cycling speed to help determine if you and others have the potential to lose yourself in some of the more difficult terrain.

By looking at Avoidance on the map above, you can see how many more cyclists have come into the city than were seen by some of the other cyclists in this photo.

However, more difficult terrain can be caused by other variables such as pavement presence, road conditions, and traffic patterns.
