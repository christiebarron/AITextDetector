The Empire State Building in New York City was unquestionably a landmark of engineering excellence, and its iconic status was strengthened further when it became one of the world's first buildings to permit dirigibles to dock. But little thought was given to the challenges the engineers and architects faced in making the mooring set-up work. Drawing inspiration from the German mooring mast designs from the 1920s, the Empire State Building team had to work hard to make the dream a reality.

The biggest challenge in creating the mooring mast was that it had to be durable and structurally sound while still being light enough to permit safe dirigible landings. Not only did the mast have to bear the weight of the ships, but it also had to bear the brunt of the wind gusts and air turbulence generated by a passing dirigible. To create a structure that could handle these forces, the mast had to be constructed with materials strong enough to support the airships but also lightweight enough to ensure airships would not cause the mast to sway.

The Empire State Building builders also had to painstakingly design and install an extensive set of safety apparatus, including railings, gangways, and cables. That, in turn, required them to come up with a way for the connecting apparatus to seamlessly integrate with the airship's existing mooring systems. To do that, they had to carefully think through how the airship would dock, the points where it needed to be
