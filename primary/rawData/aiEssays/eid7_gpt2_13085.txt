An example of a time someone in my life was patient was me. He was like his mother, and he wanted me to be like him. He wanted me to love him until he died in 1982 at age 40. He went to college, and his mom died two weeks before his 20th birthday.

"On Saturday at his funeral, it was this huge and huge and enormous and massive crowd," says Annie. "Now, he's doing whatever he can to make sure that his mom is alive and is okay.

"So when he comes in and asks if he's gonna sit next to her, I go, 'What are you doing?'"

Annie says she's worked with a lot of men to find a relationship as open as the one between a pregnant woman and a family with child. She said she's been interested in the relationship for years and she just recently got a contact from a woman who said she can help with his funeral arrangements.

"He's going to tell me how his mother came to her funeral and said, 'When did you think I was going to go to my mom's grave?' And I went, wow," Annie says. "And then I knew when [the call came in] I was a part of the program, and I was very hopeful."

After he's been able to meet his funeral grandpa, he also hopes some other men see a light to shine in Annie's tragic story
