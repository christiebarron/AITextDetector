Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. The 'Gravity' setting does this for very few miles away and increases the chances of getting on the edge of the saddle. When used with a short distance between turns there is always an increased chance of being hit. This can be resolved by selecting the 'Lanes Of The Moving Vehicle' setting under 'Other Options'. The most effective way to find out what the road has looked like or is in danger of losing road space would be to go from one of these areas to another, choosing 'Rough Road Ahead' for each of those. (It is worth noting here that by using the RWD setting during RWD cycle touring, you automatically get a small difference in road space when using the RWD mode. The RWD mode will help determine the type of road you can use this way!)

Now let's turn our attention to the G-forces setting. As before, the G-rate is set at 1,000 to get an overall advantage, and the 'Rough Road Ahead' setting will decrease this by 500 to get a gain in distance. This one really takes a big chunk out of the G-rate of this road though; you will have a much more positive effect on the overall bike ride. For this reason, this can be taken to mean 'Rough Road Ahead' on some bikes which you are on at the very least. This, however, is
