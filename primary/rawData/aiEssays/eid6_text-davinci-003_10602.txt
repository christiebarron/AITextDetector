The idea of using the Empire State Building as a site for dirigible airships to dock was something that the builders faced a number of obstacles when attempting to make happen. The Empire State Building was built from 1929 to 1931 and by that time dirigibles had been in development for decades, yet the size of the building prevented ships from docking onto the roof. 

The primary challenge was the stubborn question of the mooring mast that was included as part of the original design of the Empire State Building. In order for the Empire State Building to be used as a docking site, a tall steel framing was needed in order to accommodate the largest airships. The original idea of a mooring mast was seen as a nuisance by the engineers as it posed an additional building cost and they doubted that it would ever be used.

Fortunately, prominent American businessman and aviator Clarence Chamberlain pushed strongly for the mooring mast. He argued that if the building were to be used to host airships, the mast was a necessary component and that with it, the Empire State Building could serve as the world's most luxurious, secure, and convenient place to stay for the wealthy passengers of these ships. 

To accommodate the mooring mast, the engineers of the building needed to make a number of alterations to the original design. The building instead needed to have an incline surface and a deep enough base to bury the mast. The engineers had to formulate a sturd
