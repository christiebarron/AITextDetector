Computers have many effects on people. People who use computers in a particular way can't take an exam. We need to understand that people who try to teach their kids how to be successful in their professions are very different than people who try to teach them how to do good jobs.

I don't think there's any such thing. People who have a lot of kids can't go to school. So we need to be able to help young people. That's very important. All the efforts we're going to do have to help young people, to help them learn in a more flexible way.
