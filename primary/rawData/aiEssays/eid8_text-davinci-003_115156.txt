I was walking through the park one day when I noticed an elderly man sitting on a bench. He had a large grin plastered across his face and seemed to be enjoying the warm afternoon sun. I couldn't help but smile back. 

I walked up to him and said "Good afternoon, sir. It's a beautiful day, don't you think?" He replied with a hearty chuckle, and said "It sure is, young man". His face was full of joy, and it made me smile.

We talked for a while about anything and everything. He told me stories of his family and his life as a young man. As he spoke, his eyes were twinkling and his laughter was plentiful. I found myself chuckling too, feeding off the warmth of his stories.

We ended up talking for what felt like hours, and when we had to go our separate ways, I felt a sense of loss. But I felt happy too, because it was a conversation filled with lots of laughter and smiling. I will always remember that conversation - that old man should teach a class on how to laugh.
