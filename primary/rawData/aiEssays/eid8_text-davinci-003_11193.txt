I still remember the day I met my best friend, Jill. We had just started fifth grade, and I was feeling a bit anxious about all the new faces I was meeting.

When Jill and I got assigned to the same homeroom, I was relieved to at least have someone familiar with me. She had an infectious laugh and an even more contagious smile that seemed to light up the room.

I was so taken aback by her positive energy that I quickly become intrigued. After class, we started bonding over the most random conversations. Before we knew it, we were talking and laughing about anything and everything from school to favorite foods.

To this day, I still marvel at how much we had in common by talking about seemingly silly things. I knew in that moment that I had found someone special in Jill. She wasn't just my classmate, she was my friend.

Laughter has always been a huge part of our friendship. In a mere matter of moments, we have been able to express our deepest thoughts and emotions to each other through laughter. I now look forward to new laughs and joyful conversations with her every day, and I am thankful for the joyful memories that we have shared together.
