Dear Editor,

I am writing today to voice my opinion on the effects computers have on people. In the 21st century, computers are an ever-growing influence in our daily lives. From mundane tasks like tracking finances, to more complex tasks such as ordering groceries, computers are making our lives easier and more productive.

With technology becoming more and more pervasive, it’s important to recognize the potential for computers to improve our lives. Think about the way computers have increased our efficiency. With just a few clicks, we can do anything from researching a college essay to finding the cheapest flight to the other side of the world. Computers are also playing an important role in the education system, providing students with an incredible range of resources with which to learn and grow.

However, there are also some potential negative consequences of computers. With increased access to more and more information, people can become overwhelmed and even addicted to their devices. Many people also argue that computers are making us more sedentary and less sociable, but this is only true to some extent. We can use computers to connect with family, friends and acquaintances from around the world. 

Ultimately, computers offer us undeniable advantages, and I think it’s important to embrace the positive aspects of computer technology. When used responsibly, computers can significantly improve our lives, particularly if we focus on the ways they can open up new opportunities for learning, growth and connection.

Sincerely,
