Dear Editor,

I recently read an article in your newspaper concerning the effects computers have on people, and I believe that computers have had a huge impact on our lives. In fact, I would argue that computers have been beneficial to humans by making our lives easier and more productive.

First of all, computers have drastically improved our work efficiency. We can now finish tasks much faster than before, as computers allow us to store information and easily access it. This increased efficiency has enabled us to stay more organized and complete projects quickly, leading to greater success and productivity.

Furthermore, computers have enabled us to connect with people all over the world. We can easily communicate with faraway colleagues or family, quickly collaborate on projects, and instantly access information from any corner of the globe. We can even conduct global business transactions and access international data at the click of a button.

In addition, computers have also revolutionized the way we receive and consume entertainment and media. We can now watch our favourite shows or listen to music while we work or relax. We can also access online libraries and educational resources, and even download books or courses for free.

It is clear to see that computers have greatly improved our lives.
