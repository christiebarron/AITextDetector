Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effect computers have on people. It is increasingly evident that computers have and continue to have a significant impact on our lives.

As technology becomes more and more advanced, computers are now used for virtually everything. From banking to entertainment, they have come to dominate our lives. Unfortunately, this dependence has both positive and negative implications.

For starters, they have made many everyday activities faster and more efficient. Shopping, banking, filing taxes, and searching the internet can all be done quickly and from the comfort of our own homes, greatly reducing the need for physical stores and action. This has even helped create jobs in certain fields such as web design and development.

On the other hand, excessive dependence on computers is also linked to many physical and mental health issues. Those who sit for long hours in front of the computer can face health risks such as obesity, carpal tunnel syndrome, back pain, and headaches. Additionally, too much dependence on computers has also been linked to increased levels of stress and anxiety.

At this day and age, it is almost impossible to completely avoid the use of computers, but it is definitely possible to limit our usage to avoid the negative impact they can have on our health. We should embrace the technology, but use it in moderation for better physical and mental health.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
