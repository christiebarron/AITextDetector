In todayâ€™s increasing technology-oriented society, computers have become a daily part of our lives, both in our personal and work lives. As a result, computers have had a significant impact on how people interact and how they spend their time. I am writing to express my opinion that, while computers provide us with many benefits and possibilities, they can also have a detrimental effect on our well-being.

First, there is an undeniable risk of health issues associated with sitting in front of a computer for extended periods of time. Even if it is for work, prolonged computer use can lead to serious physical and mental health issues, such as fatigue, back pain, and vision problems. Furthermore, people often become addicted to computers and neglect their physical and social activities, resulting in feelings of isolation and anxiety.

Second, computers can be an immense source of stress. Many people are overwhelmed by information they find on the internet, especially in the form of more sophisticated work or research requirements. As a result, individuals find it difficult to disconnect from technology, leading to an imbalance of work-life and allowing work to take over their life.

To conclude, computers can provide amazing opportunities in terms of communication, productivity, and entertainment, but I believe it is important for users to limit their computer time and ensure they are participating in physical activities, social interactions, and self-care. To reduce the negative effects of computers, I believe we should strive
