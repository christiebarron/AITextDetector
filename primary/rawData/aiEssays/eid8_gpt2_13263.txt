One time I experienced laughter in my life was when one of my students was asking how to get a job in a major industry (one of which is TV). I laughed hysterically, trying to figure out what this really was - a joke. It was really really boring. Then, out of nowhere, the manager of my major came by the office, to which I instantly looked up - I had no idea what this person was talking about! I was really shocked to see that this man was actually an employee from one of the major companies of American television.

Now as I read through the next few sentences I've come to realize that, unlike the famous, non-serious "Barry the baby and we'll do it together" moment, the laugh is funny. It has to be.

In addition to our laughing hysterics, laughter comes from our emotional responses to our laughter, which makes the laugh hilarious. When it comes to laughter, you can't always do so in your head, but we can think of more examples than a few of how people laugh at laughing.

For example, we all know that laughing on theï¿½ channel is the lowest compliment one needs. But we all all have jokes that we can joke about, sometimes just for a second - a joke - and the next thing you know it's our laughing laughter that's making us smile.

We all laughed when an accident occured, and we all looked up something funny to be honest
