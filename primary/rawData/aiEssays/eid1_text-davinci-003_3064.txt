Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my opinion about the effects computers have on people. As technology advances, computers have become an integral part of daily life. While I believe computers are convenient and offer many advantageous benefits, I am concerned about their potential drawbacks.

Many people rely heavily on computers in their everyday lives, and this reliance can come at a cost. It is concerning how easy it is to become addicted to or dependent on technology. It can interfere with peopleâ€™s ability to maintain relationships with others, and it can deprive people of physical activity as hours are spent sitting in front of screens.

Additionally, the distractions that can come with computers can have an effect on health and wellness. Excessive computer use has been linked to higher incidents of stress, anxiety, depression, obesity, and sleep disturbances.

Though there are negatives associated with computers, they can be beneficial if used correctly. With the right guidance and guidance, computers can teach people valuable skills; improve communication, information sharing, and collaboration; and open up a world of educational opportunities.

I encourage readers to consider the advantages and disadvantages of computers and use them with caution and moderation. We must not forget that we should use technology
