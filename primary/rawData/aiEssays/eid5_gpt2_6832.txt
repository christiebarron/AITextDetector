The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' seems to have been a lot more optimistic in its views of the world and the role of government.

"I was an educated man when I was living in Paris back then, but there was a war a decade ago in the west," she says. "To stay in Paris and to try to make friends is an achievement to be proud of."

The mood also is marked by an appreciation, in this respect, of the cultural role of the state, an experience that some people find troubling and many leave their home. "There's a feeling in certain parts of the world of you can't say no to someone that you love. This is not the place you've made your life," says Ela√Øa Artsi, 23. "No idea for what life could be like in France without this. We're going to keep thinking about it, and see if we can get it right - but maybe I'm not one for the 'just know what I like from the world' ethos, because it seems to have been so hard in the past for me to understand myself."
