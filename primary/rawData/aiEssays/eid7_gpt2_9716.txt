An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was with my dad. We got a call and he got in his car and drove around to where the guy had been. He was on the phone, got a call and said, "Look, it's my wife and it's crazy and we are trying to save him, you've seen the news that the cops shot and killed the kid and that he has a broken nose, you know whatDOS?" And he was just absolutely devastated. He didn't know how to handle the situation. "Oh, he's doing better, he looks like his dad right now." And we all kind of went over to him, he wasn't at all like my dad was. I mean, he was getting all the treatment. My wife and I loved the way he was treating me that day. We took him to his mom at the time because there was a big change there. We got him up with his mom, her first week in a new mommy who just lost her dad and her dad said what an amazing feeling it was. Now I'm having to tell you that when this guy went home that he came up with a big decision. I mean the way he benefiting from this was he didn't want to die, but when he came out he said, "If I ever get myself up to this this, then maybe I'll get my dad back. I want him. I want to put up with what happened
