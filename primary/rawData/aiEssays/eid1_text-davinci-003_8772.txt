My family used to go camping each summer in the same spot in northern California, and it was always one of the highlights of my year. Every year, we would get together and make a big campfire and tell stories late into the night.

One night, we were all gathered around the campfire when my elderly grandmother began to tell a tall tale of her adventures as a young woman. She was the life of the party, and everyone was laughing and having a great time as she regaled us with her far-fetched stories.

At one point in her storytelling, she reached for a stick to illustrate one of the more outrageous moments of her narrative. As she searched for the appropriate stick, I noticed a bug on her arm. Without thinking, I pointed it out to her and everyone else erupted into laughter.

My grandmother stopped her story and looked on with a knowing smile as we all laughed and joked about the bug incident. I felt elated that we were able to share that moment together, and that laughter had been a bridge between us all.

When I look back on that moment, I'm reminded of how laughter can bring us all closer together, no matter what the situation is.
