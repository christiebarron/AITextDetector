It was a cold winter day and I was feeling down. As I was walking home from work, I noticed a familiar face coming towards me. It was my best friend, who I hadn't seen in months. When our eyes met, we both burst out laughing. We were both so happy to see each other, and the laughter felt like a warm hug. We hugged for what felt like forever, and then we started talking about all of the funny things that had happened since we last saw each other. We kept laughing and talking until we reached my house, and then we said our goodbyes with one last big bear hug and one more round of laughter.

Seeing my best friend made me feel like anything was possible and reminded me of the importance of true friendships. Laughter is definitely the shortest distance between two people, and in that moment, it felt like we were two worlds apart, yet also so close.
