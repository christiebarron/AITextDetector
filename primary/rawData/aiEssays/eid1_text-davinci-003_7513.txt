Minfong Ho ends the story with this line in order to reinforce the idea that although the protagonist, Kimiko, failed her test, things will eventually get better. This line reminds the reader that although failure and obstacles are a part of life, they are not permanent. With the return of the spring, Kimiko can take the test again and use the winter as time for growth and preparation. The imagery of springtime renewal is meant to represent hope and optimism and imply that although life may bring challenges, if we persevere we can succeed.
