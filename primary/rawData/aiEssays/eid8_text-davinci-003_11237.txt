I had just moved to a bigger city for work and I was feeling really lonely. I kept to myself mostly, not really feeling comfortable enough to go out and make friends. 

One night, I went out wandering the streets, hoping I'd find something that made me feel a little less alone. I stopped at a small cafe and was about to order a cup of coffee when I heard a booming laugh coming from one of the tables. I was so taken aback that I stumbled backwards, catching my foot on the edge of a chair. 

The laughter only grew louder as the people at the table noticed me enviously looking in their direction. They were so loud and so obviously enjoying themselves. I couldn't help but smile, and soon that smile had grown into a laugh. 

To my surprise, one man from the group called out to me, beckoning me to join them. I nervously complied, and they all welcomed me warmly. I soon found out that they were all industry colleagues, and we talked for hours until the cafe was almost empty. 

By the time I had left, I had made real friends, and I left with a smile on my face. That simple act of laughter brought me closer to the people around me, and I'm so thankful for that moment.
