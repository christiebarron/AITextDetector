I remember when I worked at my old job and the manager asked me to do a task that I was not confident doing. I had just started a few weeks prior and had not been trained in this particular area. I was really nervous to start and even told the manager I wasn't sure if I could handle it, but instead of being discouraged or offended, she just smiled and said "That's ok, I'm sure you can do it with some practice and help from me."

I was so thankful for her attitude and together we went over the process step-by-step. It wasn't easy, and took some time but eventually I got the hang of it and was able to complete the task on my own. I was so grateful for her patience, understanding, and support because it made the whole experience a lot easier and I now have a better understanding of the job.
