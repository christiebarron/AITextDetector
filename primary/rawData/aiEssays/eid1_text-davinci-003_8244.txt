The Empire State Building was a pioneering feat of engineering when it was completed in 1931. Part of the innovative design included plans for allowing dirigibles, also known as airships, to dock with the structure at the structure’s top. The builders of this incredible building faced many obstacles; however, in allowing this revolutionary new form of transport to land on their building.

Initially, the planners of the Empire State Building faced the challenge of designing the building in a way that would allow dirigibles to dock. To aid this, they decided to include a mooring mast atop the building and give it a 200-foot height. Then, an ingenious design of an elevator connected to the mast would take passengers from the mast to the building’s lobby. The building’s central core was also made larger than necessary to facilitate the landing of large airships.

Once the design of the structure was completed, the builders then had to contemplate the safety of the airships. Knowing that turbulent winds caused by the height of the skyscrapers across Manhattan meant the dirigible movements around the mooring mast needed to be carefully monitored. To overcome this issue, the planners proposed a series of cable harnesses in order to secure the airship. This consisted of several suspension masts, which would distribute the load of the dirigibles and a mooring network. This was created using a combination of steel cables to keep the mooring mast and
