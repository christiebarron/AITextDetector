I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is in itself a serious problem," says David Gerson, managing editor of the English Historical Review. "The question remains whether censorship of books is justified or not."

In October 2011 British newspaper The Observer published a two-hour piece on the situation of people who have taken photos of books with text that reads: "We all know you have some kind of problem with some of this. Some people are upset that we show it, and some people are worried that you are destroying their life's work with the removal of them. We think they should stop and consider how much is worth it. When they remove the book, then the book doesn't go back with good faith into the library. If they have a copy of the book, the people that don't want the book get it. People who are upset over that may think that the book is in a different form. And yes, they do have a copy. But they have not had any experience with the fact that they have removed and restored the article or the piece with words written from it, in any way. Even if we look at the article."
