The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it shows how humans and creatures behave in the present, from their natural habitats to how they communicate. It's like reading an epic tale in the middle of a snowstorm or some other major event. That was really my problem. Because Winter Hibiscus ends the book because it shows how humans and creatures behave in the present, from their natural habitats to how they communicate. It's like reading an epic tale in the middle of a snowstorm or some other major event. That was really my problem. Because the characters (including the characters themselves) were in really bad shape at the end. It feels like a kind of closure with both characters having a lot at stake. I didn't want to overdo this book, I wanted to put in a lot of effort in it. It felt like I could have put my time and energy into it all I want, but I did not. I decided that when I began taking the story more seriously I have come to realize the author has done a terrible job writing it. I should read it again as a story that will have a major impact on future generations. But if you want to read more, look for other books I've already published, including more of the "Hibiscus" characters. Oh it's hard not to read Winter Hibiscus ending the way it does because it shows how people and animals behave in the present, from their natural habitats to how they communicate
