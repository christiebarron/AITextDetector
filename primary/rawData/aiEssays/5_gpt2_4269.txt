The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' has become so palpable that I know it's time to go ahead and change my behaviour. But the main reason has to do with my family. We knew some of the things I was in love with when I was growing LEVEL 1.

I was told I was already getting older and could walk in my shoes and act the part of a boy. But my parents took my own life in February 2013 by way of their divorce. I was put in a position where I had a choice: do my best to survive or die. To get that change I needed to face my personal life.

I've had plenty of time to be happy. I met a bunch of wonderful friends and people who I respect who have played a part in my path to success. I have gone through a number of hard times, from being accepted into high school to my death at a young age â€“ those things mean more to me than a certain percentage of people think. What I've suffered in those years can no longer be swept over. I have to give back. And for me it is the love of my life. Not the love of a single child. A love of a husband and wife. And a love of my childhood.

It has taken a while, but I know what a gift that is from my parents and it leaves behind a love that can be shared even while I've been here for 10 years.
