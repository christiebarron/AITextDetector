The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it is too far in the future, on the verge of a major break-up and also because what happens as time goes by will have nothing to do with the characters' relationship. What is clear to me is that Hibiscus is an ambitious, emotionally ambitious series, which I hope was the case with The Wolf Among Us before I gave up on the series, as it is what I loved about the previous episodes, but I found in it that I would want to leave behind everything I experienced when I started this journey, and I did that as much as possible to make sure that I would survive the transition and find what made me who I am, even if it took me ages to realise that.

We work in a relationship and we love each other, we try to be together but we cannot live together just yet. I hope I am not completely alone with what I enjoy about it, I am still very nervous about it but I feel great. Some things I experienced in The Wolf Among Us are as I recall it a couple of years ago: how excited I was to see The Wolf Among Us become another one of my favourite shows.
