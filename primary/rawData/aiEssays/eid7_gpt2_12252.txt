An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the time a local woman in Toronto found out what was going on because she'd tried to talk to us about the latest food we're making because we needed more chicken.

She was just not feeling well so we called our doctor to let the family know and then she was out of town by two hours.

And for over 3 years!
