Dear [Editor’s Name],

I write to express my opinion about the incredible effects computers have on people. As an ardent techie, I have been astounded at how computers have greatly impacted our lives, making things that seemed impossible suddenly possible.

From the medical field to finance, computers revolutionize every kind of work. We now have a better understanding of biology, technology, economics, and many more. Computers allow us to manage our lives more efficiently and effortlessly. People can now communicate with one another with greater speed, accuracy, and convenience. They can also shop, work, and learn online and share ideas, thoughts, and creations with the whole world.

Most noteworthy is that computers enable us to create a global society. With the help of technology, we are able to explore different parts of the globe virtually or known as “cyberspace” – as demonstrated by the internet. This gives us access to information, ideas and resources as if we are right there in person.

Computers also change how people think and learn. They allow us to express and develop our ideas in a more organized manner and provide us with myriad of tools to help in creative processes.
