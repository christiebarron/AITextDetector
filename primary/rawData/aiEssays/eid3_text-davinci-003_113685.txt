The setting of the story 'Rough Road Ahead' by Joe Kurmaski has a significant effect on the cyclist. To begin with, the countryside setting serves as a reminder of the danger which the cyclist faces as he makes his way through the winding, narrow paths that are lined with deep ditches and brambles. The cyclist is clearly aware of the potential danger, especially when he encounters a herd of cows that causes him to stop biking and make a detour, as well as when he finds a squirrel in the path which he carefully avoids.

The setting also serves to motivate the cyclist in his journey. The serene nature of the countryside serves as a reminder that he is on a quest to reach his goal. The cyclist even relies on the hills of the setting to help propel him faster towards his destination.

This allows him to take his mind off of the difficult pedaling conditions and to enjoy the beauty of the countryside.

In conclusion, the setting of 'Rough Road Ahead' serves to motivate, distract, and warn the cyclist of the potential danger he may face. The cyclist is able to use the tranquil nature and beauty of the countryside to help him focus on his journey and to remain safe on the winding narrow paths.
