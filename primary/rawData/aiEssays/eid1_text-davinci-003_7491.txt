The final sentence of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho serves to embody the the theme of perseverance and resilience in the face of adversity. The protagonist has failed his school's entrance exam and is feeling discouraged, but as the story ends, the narrator offers a glimmer of hope that the protagonist can succeed next time when the tests come back around again. The image of the hibiscus blossoming in the spring after enduring a long, hard winter emphasizes this idea that with time, patience, and consistent effort, success is possible.
