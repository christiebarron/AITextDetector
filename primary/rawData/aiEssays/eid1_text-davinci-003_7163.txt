The setting of Joe Kurmaski’s story, “Rough Road Ahead,” has an incredibly strong impact on the cyclist in the story. From the moment that the cyclist first sets foot on his bike, the surroundings take effect and become a major part of his journey. The weather is described as “crisp and cold” which suggests that the cyclist is outdoors and exposed to all the elements. The road is full of cracks, potholes, and debris as it is “old and rough.” This creates an obstacle for the cyclist as he has to be constantly aware of the road and use his energy to navigate around these obstacles. Additionally, the setting of the farm and its “free roaming chickens” adds a unique sense of nature and life to the cyclist’s journey.

The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist in the story as he deals with several hardships caused by the environment. The listener is given a sense of vulnerability as the cyclist traverses the unchartered territory of the road with no one to rely on but himself. He is also challenged mentally, physically, and emotionally as he battles the wind and the cold. As the cyclist continues along his journey he finds a sense of clarity and peace despite the turbulent environment. The impact of the setting can be seen in his journey as he grows not only as a cyclist, but as a person by tackling the harshness of his surroundings. By
