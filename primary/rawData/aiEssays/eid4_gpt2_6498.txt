The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it can, and does, move forward. But as for Winter Hibiscus at its core, I really felt as though Winter Hibiscus was just waiting for God's grace. That it needed to go forward so it could give a voice to its characters if it was to come back and do that. The one thing about that book I loved the most was the direction it changed, and I mean, I've read about a lot of books about this in the past, but the reason this book was so different, was because it was completely open to interpretation on very little of the book. But if I wanted to move forward, that's what it was. It seemed like something that could be done, and I found the characters and the themes to be so perfect together. You really are able to really see who these people are as they're changing and not just at masochistic events. And that is a big part of it. It's like, 'There's this world and there's this character. There's this world and there's this world and there's this character.'

So, as always, I wish these people had come back with something and it looked cool. It's wonderful. It's very much a story about the world itself. The best thing I can do is share it with everybody. And the more I have enjoyed reading it, the better my enjoyment of the characters will be. And
