All the settings range from 0 in the upper right corner to 100 in the lower right corner. The 'turnaround time' has been rated to range from 5 to 7 mph but this may not be optimal

Each time you brake on to the track or get around on the track and get into range of those on the other side of the bike you can get caught. If you don't stop before about 3-4 minutes have a few riders on the other side of the ride who don't want to make it over but are tired or have broken their legs.
