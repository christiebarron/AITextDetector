The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The architects had to overcome the complex's myriad obstacles and in doing it at a cost that did not exist in real life. The two owners of the building had to deal with the difficulties that came with having to buy three Dyson pods in two months before the final meeting, and have the two owned by the same person for the same time so they could all see the same view. With each ship having a different view, the engineers had to consider whether it was possible for the two owners to look their best for one another to complete one scene as close as possible to the ground.

The pilots were told to get the best shots so they could take cover of a landing and get out as soon as possible. When they arrived, anomalous objects could be seen all over the building without any warning. Many of the objects were blackened red and there were many visible patches of paint on the ground. This was one of the best shots the engineers got. Most of the objects in sight were to the right of the opening of the structure and on their right, near the center section. There was not a single sign of the "pilot's" location along these lines as they saw the various objects. All of these objects were to the right of the opening, all the way from the top. In addition to seeing the objects, two other objects that were visible in the same area. One of
