The other day, my friend and I were hanging out in the mall. We had been walking around for hours and were pretty worn out when we stumbled upon the food court. We were both famished, but also exhausted. So, we decided we'd order our food in to go boxes and just sit at one of the tables to enjoy the break. 

Once we had our boxes and were sitting down, my friend casually started talking about a mistake I had made earlier in the day. We both started laughing about it and I could feel the lightness that comes with laughter start to fill the space around us.
 
As we continued to laugh, a few strangers began to join in. We laughed even harder, as the infectious sound of laughter began to spread around the mall. Before long, the whole food court was filled with this contagious sound. Everyone was looking around at each other with big smiles. It was a moment of sheer joy and connection - between strangers, between friends and within ourselves. 

That moment of shared laughter felt like the shortest and most beautiful distance between us.
