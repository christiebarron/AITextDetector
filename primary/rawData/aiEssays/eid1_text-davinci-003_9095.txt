Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my opinion on the effects of computers on people today.

It is indisputable that computers have had a tremendous positive impact on human life. We can communicate with friends and family (even if they are on the other side of the world), access information quickly, and work from home with the help of computers. However, I believe that too much reliance on computers has significant consequences for our wellbeing. 

For example, the amount of time people spend on computers can lead to serious physical ailments, such as back pain and neck pain. Computers can also cause psychological concerns, such as restlessness, insomnia, impatience, and depression. Additionally, computer addiction can lead to isolation and family issues. 

The rise of mobile devices has further exacerbated our computer addiction. Although people can stay connected, this technology is also problematic. Constant alerts and notifications from apps disrupt focus and increase stress. Furthermore, increased exposure to various kinds of media, such as television, radio, and the internet, can lead to a distorted view of reality. 

My point is that our growing dependence on computers has both direct (physical pain) and indirect (changes in social behavior) consequences that could be damaging to our health and wellbeing. Therefore, I urge the readers to take steps to limit their computer usage. 

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
