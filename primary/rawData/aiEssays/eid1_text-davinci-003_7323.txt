In “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, the cyclist is affected by the setting in multiple ways. The setting of the story is in a small city where the cyclist, Brad, is traveling to meet his childhood friend, Sally.

The urban setting of the story influences the cyclist’s experience in many ways. The roads are described as rough and full of many obstacles. This affects Brad’s physical performance as he is constantly jostled by the bumps and he must concentrate more, draining his energy. As well, the yellow bike he rides on is too big for him, making it difficult to maneuver in tight spots and increasing the challenge.

The environment can be seen as strongly affecting Brad’s emotional state as well. Like the urban setting, Brad’s trip is described as a constant struggle. He is weighed down by thoughts of disappointment over not seeing Sally, which makes the biking difficult. As the road’s obstacles symbolize his issues in a way, his concentration and resolve is slowly diminished.

Overall, the setting in “Rough Road Ahead” has had a great influence on the cyclist in a physical and mental way. The rough roads and obstacles make the biking a more grueling task and the poor urban environment, combined with his emotions, make the experience an even bigger challenge. These factors of the setting help propel the story forward by making the protagonist’s journey one
