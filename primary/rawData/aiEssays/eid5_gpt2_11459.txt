The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' has been to be taken into the context of the global conflict with China, and its rise. It is by no means the first time that this has done so. In 2014, after a year of fighting in Afghanistan which has claimed over 3,200 lives, China's government, in response to Chinese aggression and threats to its territorial borders in the West, started a mass mobilisation in support of the Afghan Democratic Forces (ADF) in a major campaign aimed at ending the "disastrous" and "defending Chinese rule in the country".

In 2015, after years of Beijing's aggression, Afghanistan's pro-democracy movement, the Movement for Peace and Peace Now (MPSO) which had already joined the Afghan National Alliance (ANA), formed an Afghan National Alliance, the Afghanistan Democratic Forces (ANC), the "New Afghan People's Army (ENAF)" and the Afghan People's Army (AIM).

This was partly because of the fact that the government in Kabul had been planning an assault from the western side of the country on April 9 to take the city of Kabul the following day. The advance would include fighting alongside ANA and the People's Democratic Party (DPD), a movement which has since been dissolved.

As part of the push towards the end of this year, there was no immediate prospect of the government in Kabul being able to negotiate the terms of a peace deal until a truce was found
