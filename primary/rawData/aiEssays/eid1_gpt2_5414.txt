Computers have many effects on people. They enhance their ability to recognize emotions from different sources, help us see complex faces, help us recognize faces that have a lot of emotions, and also help us identify different patterns in the hair of people with different medical conditions such as AIDS. It helps us to know a lot more about the causes and causes of the disorders that cause them and the ways in which we change the way we think about them.

So one of the interesting things is that we are showing that we can alter how we think about and communicate emotions in people using the same or more powerful techniques as we used to use.
