The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because of the fact that its focus is on both the mythological and magical life of the family.

The book's main theme is also similar to the novel The Tale of Misfits, whose main protagonist is a priest who travels the world for his people to hear the singing.

In one of the two parts, a group of brothers are summoned to meet a priest named Zuko, so when the brothers arrive they are greeted by a strange, wavy-haired boy dressed as a shaman, whose magic is said to give them power over fire and water.
