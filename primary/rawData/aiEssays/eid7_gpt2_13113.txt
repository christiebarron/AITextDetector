An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a fellow blogger who was a great friend and colleague of mine with the American Civil Liberties Union who had been harassed by a group of very angry racists. I met him in his home room, where I had been writing about the case to a journalist named Tom Jones who was sitting there writing about the case before I left. At that point my phone rang, and I called my lawyer, and we went to press. He offered to help me, and I accepted. We were the first American lawyers who had ever heard the story about this, and he was willing to cover me and help us get to our destination.

I'm going to talk a little about how I ended up joining the ACLU, how much more I was able to connect with people who were there before, and to know many more Americans who wanted to help with this case. I've tried to share with people that it was not their fault, that they were trying to make a terrible issue for me, and even though people were talking on the phone, I did not understand why you would want that conversation, or why your legal team was so eager to get to people's homes, but I felt the need to share, and I did. When I began working on this case, I was able to begin to share it with other people who had similar, difficult, and often painful experiences; in some cases, I realized it was very complicated and difficult to deal
