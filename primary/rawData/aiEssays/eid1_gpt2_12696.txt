Computers have many effects on people. They can get in an accident and put you in a mental hospital. They can cause problems for you and your family or at work. They can cause some psychological problems, like hallucinations (the feeling that something happened in the past). They can become extremely frightening.

We can also hear their voice and feel their emotions. But that is very difficult. As it happened, we came across these people and they asked us if we would give them money for the drugs that was sold in our pharmacy, and it wasn't something that we were prepared for at all. And now in some of the patients, there was a pharmacy attendant, and she said, "Don't ask because we're not there." The pharmacist said, "Okay, I'll take you through his program of prescription drugs and that kind of thing." Now our doctor said, "That would be fine. If you can get us a program if we can get you any of the drugs that go through it, that's good with you too." Our doctors felt that this was some sort of relief from reality and they said, "Sure, sure." There was a lot more time.

And then we see these people walk up to us and say, "This is my program." And we just say, "I want you to buy this drug in this program so that I can give you this type of drug every time you want it. You know what else is available?"
