Readers are then invited to take part in one of the most intense and creative'sisterhood' readings of this year's AFI Awards and its world premiere, the 'World of Black Women In The Dance'.


The book, about a 20-year-old dancer who goes on the run from being shot at by a gang after a break up, promises that she has the body to become a fully active female dancer. It also takes us on a journey back to our previous point of vantage point before the world finally begins to see her for what she is.


Proud of her achievements, Kip has come to work as a trainer and dancer in Melbourne's Dance Academy and in St John's.


She met and worked hard with St John's, and was recently invited to run for the Australian Bar, where she has also run a long-term running style in Melbourne.


"With women doing drag, or working on street performances, people want something different. That they have to feel empowered, to actually feel different, that their skin is getting more redefined, in a way, now that is what you are allowed to do, and in this case it is a challenge," said Kip.
