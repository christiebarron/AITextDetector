The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' makes its debut at Sundance on 22-29 June 2015.

The film, produced by Tilda Swinton, and co-starred Natalie Portman are co-stars, as well as Amy Poehler, Tilda Swinton, James Franco and Michael B. Jordan, for which the band also released its debut album Live at SXSW 2014.

The film also was shot at Studio 40 in Los Angeles in a three-day, two-night shoot with B.J Stagg, David Lowery and Sam Mendes.

Stagg was a frequent subject of conversation on Twitter and tweeted "you don't know me when I'm at SXSW 2015" on Wednesday morning after filming 'Farewell' in Las Vegas.
