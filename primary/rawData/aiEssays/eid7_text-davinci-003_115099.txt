I was recently in line at the grocery store and the person ahead of me had a large cart full of items. I was already running a little behind on my errands and was starting to feel a bit impatient. I started tapping my foot and shifting around anxiously, when I heard a whisper say, "Patience is a virtue." I turned around and saw a kind-looking elderly lady smiling at me knowingly. I smiled back and nodded, understanding that she was reminding me that being patient was the right thing to do. As the checkout process dragged on, I settled in and focused on my breath, trying to remain patient. 

Eventually, after what felt like an eternity, the elderly woman finished checking out and I was able to move up to the register. I thanked her for reminding me to be patient and she smiled and said, "Anytime, sweetheart." I remembered her words on the drive home and felt proud of myself for remaining patient, even amidst frustration.
