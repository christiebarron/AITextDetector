At the end of the story, the main character learns that although she may have fallen short on the test, it is ultimately not her primary source of validation or success. The hibiscus at the end serves as a metaphor for perseverance and renewal, and it's a reminder that when she takes the test again in the spring, she will have experienced growth. The narrator's message is that she will never give up and will try again no matter the circumstances.
