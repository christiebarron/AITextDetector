At the end of the poem, the narrator reflects on the challenge of taking a challenging test, and how difficult it is to stay focused and motivated. The part at the end serves as a reminder to the narrator that despite the difficulties, there is hope that things will be better soon. The metaphor of the winter hibiscus blooming serves as an anchor to give the narrator hope and determination to keep striving, and come back in the spring to face the test again. It shows that no matter how difficult things can be, we are capable of persevering and facing our challenges head-on.
