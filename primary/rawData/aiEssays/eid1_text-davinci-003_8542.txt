I remember a time when my father was showing me how to change a tire on our car. He had been through this process so many times before, and I had never done it before. He patiently walked me through every step, never rushing me or getting frustrated when I didn't get it right away. He would show me the steps, and encourage me to try and take it on by myself. I was fairly confident at the end, and was proud of myself for not giving up. My father had showed me the importance of patience and what it can do.
