I am writing today to share my opinion on the effects computers have on people. As a society, we are becoming more and more reliant on computers for completing everyday tasks. From the moment we wake up in the morning to the time we fall asleep at night, computers are an integral part of our lives.

The benefits of computers are undeniable. We can access and analyse vast amounts of information quickly and efficiently, saving us time and money regardless of what industry we’re in. Computers also provide us with the ability to communicate with people all over the world, enabling us to connect and collaborate on projects from different parts of the globe.

Additionally, computers can be used to spread misinformation and deceptive content, which can negatively affect peoples’ opinion and understanding of topics.
