An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my partner (husband, father). As husband and dad we learned to be patient, he looked forward to doing chores, he did very good work on his homework and his car was running hot. We used our time working together and on our own schedules to make him think I was an okay partner.

My own experience with my husband is that being patient when it comes to work is a privilege. Having worked on our partnership and together as family, we would feel at peace about each other sometimes and we both knew there were ways we could work on it together, but we would also learn our differences and make work fun.
