The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because of her work. I just wonder what this book will lead you to do before you read it, or will you continue with this story or just read the book. When I wrote this book I didn't really know this book well, and it seemed to be a work in progress. I'm not getting to any of it, but given it's all good and good, this one seems to be going to be worth reading.
