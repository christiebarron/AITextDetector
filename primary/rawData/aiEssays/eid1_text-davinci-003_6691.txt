 

Dear Editor, 

Over the pasttwo decades, the use of computers has become increasingly popular and widespread. Today, many of us use computers on a daily basis for a variety of tasks from researching, shopping, banking, and even enjoying social media. 

As the use of computers has become far more commonplace in our lives, itâ€™s important to consider the impact they have had on people. In short, I believe computers have had both positive and negative effects.

On the one hand, computers have enabled us to access a wealth of information at the touch of a button. We can purchase items from the comfort of our own home, search encyclopedia-style databases, and even video chat with friends that live across the ocean. On the other hand, computer use has been linked with various physical and psychological issues. The strain on the eyes from hours of hours of screen time, headaches, and a reduction in social interaction are just some of the harms caused by excessive computer use. 

In conclusion, I urge people to take into consideration the positive and negative effects of computers in our lives. By being mindful of the potential risks associated with over-use, we can ensure that rather than damaging our health, computers can have only positive impacts in our lives. 

Sincerely, 

[Your name]
