The Empire State Building was a monumental feat of engineering, but its builders faced significant obstacles when it came to allowing dirigibles (also called airships) to dock. As outlined in "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, these challenges included finding a suitable place on the building to attach the docking station, designing a secure docking system, and ensuring safety during take-off and landing.

The Empire State Building presented a number of issues to overcome before a dirigible could dock. To start, the building was not designed with airship docking in mind. This made it difficult to find a structure strong enough to support the weight and wind forces of the dirigible. Additionally, the airship had to be securely moored to the building – so a safe and stable system had to be designed and built.

Getting the airship safely to the mast was another challenge. The Empire State Building was built in the middle of New York City, where two airports, numerous skyscrapers, and many surfaces and objects posed an obvious hazard to flying vessels. Dirigible pilots had to carefully navigate their airships around the various obstacles, as well as ensure sufficient clearance between the building and the airship so they didn’t hit any of the buildings or trap any bystanders with their down drafts.

Finally, the builders of the Empire State Building had to account for the crashing forces of landing and taking off to ensure the safety of passengers and bystanders
