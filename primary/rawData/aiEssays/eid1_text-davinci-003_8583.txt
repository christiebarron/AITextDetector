 

I was on vacation with my family in the summer, and we had a big day planned to explore the city. We were up early and were excited to get started, until we realized that we hadn't planned how to get there. My dad wanted to call a cab, but I thought it would take too long so I suggested we just take the subway. 

My dad had never been on one before so it was a little scary for him, but I stayed patient and explained things step by step until we figured it out. Eventually, we were on the right train and had no trouble getting to our destination.

The whole time my dad was a little anxious, but I patiently reassured him and eventually he felt comfortable enough to navigate the subway system on his own. It wasn't easy, but thanks to my patience, we made it to our destination on time and had a great day.
