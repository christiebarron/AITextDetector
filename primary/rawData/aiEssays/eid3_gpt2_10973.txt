Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. In the first line, the green can be red or blue, depending entirely on what route you prefer to ride. Similarly, in the second line, green can mean 'invisible' in the way you see it. In other words, the road or a public transport connection in general is red or blue. The only person who will ever use this mode of cycling is those who live or work within the areas of St-Franagol and Pompidou.

The green on the left corner of the 'Rough Road Ahead' option displays the location of your motorway in general and your favourite road of your choice. A blue arrow identifies you as such. It is possible to use any of four modes of cycling on the same road â€“ those in the first line are green, those of the second line have yellow and red stripes. (For the purposes of colouring maps, you can also choose blue with red and white with green. The colour of a mode's colour palette was defined in 1967 by Greg Buell. If you click the arrow, the mode's colour will be turned off. You may choose to turn 'Rough Road Ahead' on from the top of the main screen.)
