I remember the first time I laughed until I cried with my best friend. It was a cold January evening, and the two of us were sitting around a fire in her backyard. We had been talking for hours, about everything from school to our families, to our dreams and fears. I remember being incredibly relaxed, just unloading all my thoughts to her and not worrying about what anyone else in the world was going to think.

At one point, we started talking about an embarrassing moment I had experienced in class that day. I started telling her the story and before I knew it, I was laughing so hard that tears were coming out of my eyes. It started out as a giggle, then quickly escalated into full-blown laughter. My friend broke into laughter too, and I think it was the first time we had ever simultaneously cracked up like that.

It felt like a weight was lifted off our shoulders in that moment. I felt light and could swear I felt myself smiling wider than I ever had before. After that, we laughed every single time we were together, and our friendship only became stronger. From that day on, we remembered the power that laughter had to bring us closer and it became an essential part of our relationship.
