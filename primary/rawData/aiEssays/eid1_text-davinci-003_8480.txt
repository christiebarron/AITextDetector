I recently had to travel by plane for an important meeting. Little did I know that my flight was going to be delayed several times that day. The air traffic controllers weren't giving us answers on when the plane would finally take off and the airline staff left us completely in the dark. 

Rather than getting frustrated and shouting at the staff, I remained patient. I could feel the anxiety in the air but I tried my best to stay calm. I decided to make the most of the situation by having a cup of coffee and surfing the internet. 

Today, the airline still hasn't given us a satisfactory explanation as to why the flight was delayed for so long. Despite this, I'm glad I was patient and didn't let the situation get the better of me. It wasn't easy but I'm proud of the way I handled it.
