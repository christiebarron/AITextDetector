An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my husband and I both took an antidepressant and some of my best friends had suicidal ideation. It took two or three weeks but I realized when we capitulated and agreed that our depression could be prevented with the right medication it was really liberating. I think we still got along well today and have seen far fewer mental health issues on our medication. On a personal level, for now it's great, it just feels like so many people get it, but, to be on top of it, it really is a personal thing and now it's all of a sudden you've found a friend that is getting better and will help me out a lot, even though we would never even give him the first one in the past... I can't imagine what this would have been like to have said a few years later and see him like you look up at him. He looks like he's making progress and looking forward to getting better... It has all helped me a lot with my mental health and he's my friend now too. I'm so grateful for all of those people that have seen a little bit of what the future of therapy looks like.

In the meantime, the biggest benefit is my mother's. As for her, they haven't told me this or what they are planning to do yet. She's just been great about them and I really believe that the best treatment for these people is that I know the right doctor,
