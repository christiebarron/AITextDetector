The ending of the poem captures the narrator's hope that, despite their hardships, her family will manage to survive the winter. The hope is conveyed through the image of the hibiscus "budding" when the snows melt and the geese return in the spring. This gives the narrator strength to remain optimistic and keep striving - concluding with the pledge to take the test again in the spring. The poem ends on a note of resilience in the face of adversity and hope for better days ahead.
