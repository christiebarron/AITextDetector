One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I saw a guy who always wore shorts and a shirt with his shoes on who looked like him. He had a smile on his face and a big head that was going for a laugh. So we went up and played tennis.

I remember sitting in the car the next day and it was just me and my family walking along the road. I said to him, "Didn't you think this guy's like that all dressed up?"

He said, "Yes" I said, "He's in the same boat." We were going to go out on one Sunday and play basketball for a while and he was like, "No, no. I wasn't going to try to take your picture."

When we went out on one Sunday, he said (after a few words), "We like tennis because it's so easy, and this is how you perform."

I said, "I thought you just had to be a guy. I knew you were going to do stuff for a while, man, just go do it."

He said, "Yeah."

The other day I made a good impression on them of me and that was when you realize you've got the guy just like you. But it took me a while to get over the anger, the shock and the rage. I had a few days off but that really helped me, because I was feeling my anger.
