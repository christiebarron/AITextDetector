The prospect of being able to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building seemed like a tantalizing opportunity for industrial New York during the Great Depression; however, it soon revealed a number of challenges. Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted's book, The Mooring Mast, outlines the many obstacles the administrators of the Empire State Building faced when they initially tried to make it a viable option for airships. 

The first challenge was creating a safe atmosphere for airships. While the building presented itself as an obvious choice for a docking station, it needed to be modified in order to ensure the essential safety of the dirigibles. This entailed the installation of mooring masts atop the building connected by cables. The cables needed to be firmly entrenched into the stonework lest they give in to the strain present when an airship of considerable size was docked. The building was already constructed so the installation of masts posed an engineering challenge. This required the support of barges and even an earthquake-resistant foundation to absorb the shock of the dirigible's propulsion engines. 

In addition, according to The Mooring Mast, the Empire State Building did not have the right height to be compatible with the size of some dirigibles. Some of the models, such as the Graf Zeppelin and the Hindenburg, were so large they would not anchor to the building. The captains of the airships had to fly these vessels somewhat lower while maneuvering
