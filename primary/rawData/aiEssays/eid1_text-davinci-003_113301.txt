Dear Editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. In this day and age, computers have become an inseparable part of our lives, which has both its advantages and drawbacks. 

On the one hand, computers are essential tools for learning. They make it easy for people to access information on any given topic, research new topics, and develop valuable technological skills. Through computers, people can read and access educational materials with unparalleled speed and accuracy. Furthermore, computers can help us connect with people from all over the world, creating valuable dialogue and learning opportunities. 

On the other hand, it is no secret that computers can pose significant risks to people’s mental and physical health. Prolonged use of computers can lead to eye strain and bad posture, which can have a negative impact on one’s health. Additionally, too much time spent on computers can lead to a decrease in physical activity, causing physical and mental health issues. Finally, people who spend too much time on computers are often at a risk of developing Internet addiction, which is a serious issue that causes a great deal of harm to people’s lives. 

In conclusion, computers can be both helpful and harmful, and care must be taken to ensure that their positive effects are maximized while their negative effects are minimized. I urge readers to be conscious of the effects that computers have on people and use them with caution.
