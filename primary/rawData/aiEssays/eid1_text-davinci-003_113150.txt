Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my views on the effects computers have had on people. Over the years, the advancement in technology has transformed our lives and computing capabilities have resulted in huge changes.

On the one hand, computers have allowed companies to develop products and services more quickly and efficiently, creating new opportunities for growth in the economy. In addition, computers have allowed people to access data and information much faster and with greater ease than ever before.

On the other hand, however, computers have also had a considerable impact on peopleâ€™s ability to process information. As the use of computers has increased, the use of critical reasoning skills and traditional learning has been replaced with the quick-fix of searching for an answer or a solution online. This has resulted in a lessened appreciation of knowledge as reliance on computers is so much greater.

For these reasons, I believe that computers have had a negative effect on people. It is important to recognize the benefits that computers have in our lives, yet it is also important to recognize that excessive reliance on technology is not the way to go. We must not forget the value of traditional learning and problem-solving skills that technology does not provide.

I urge your readers to consider the downside to our high reliance on computer-based solutions and take the time to consider the implications of technology in our lives.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
