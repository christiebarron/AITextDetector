One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I watched a TV show in 1996 when I was on a trip to Mexico when I saw a couple of guys who looked like the kids from Lost who looked like an old man with dark hair who was walking along some grassy fields in the country and he kept saying "Go ahead and walk your dog" and I ran into him laughing and said "what the do you want?" He said "oh, I go ahead and walk my dog, and I keep putting you guys in a nice place to see the kids" and I said "why would I need to walk my dog in the middle of the wild on the grass?" He said "oh good joke, just do it, if you want then go ahead and walk, make the little guy sit cross legged because that's what I like, and just go ahead and go, let's go, that's all it takes!". That's the funny thing with "The Adventures of Conan Doyle": They've just sort of taken advantage of that a bit.

If there's a child out there who is a successful artist, he would likely not have it any other way. We are very small,
