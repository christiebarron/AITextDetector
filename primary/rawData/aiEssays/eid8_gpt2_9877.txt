One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I met a group of friends (who I have never met before, they were about as friendly as a mother and brother who have all been together for a while).

They gave me a kiss and I looked around Sigma, only one of the group was there. Even though I had met many people for the first time before this meeting, I was never one to get nervous and I was just a bystander. With that, I just smiled, kept my head down and looked in the mirror to see if I could take them. They looked as good as I could have, every single one being taller than me and that is exactly what it felt like to be around those people for the first time.

They went out with a beer and we both looked excited and it was obvious that I was going to be back there for an exciting weekend. I ended up following them back home, not knowing where we were going or what we were doing there. It was my first time getting to meet a group of people who had never been together before.

I think that with all the experience I have had with these strangers, some people like me feel ashamed and some get angry when I try to use the word "different" just so I can go to class again, but I think that with all the friends and new people, it is pretty much fair to say I am all right.

I love the way Sigma looked after
