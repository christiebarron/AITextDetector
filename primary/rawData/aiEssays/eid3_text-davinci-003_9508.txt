The setting of Joe Kurmaski's poem "Rough Road Ahead" is a crucial element in understanding the cyclist's experience and his inner emotions. The poem is set at night, as the cyclist's journey occurs after dusk. The darkness itself creates a sense of uncertainty and fear in the cyclist, emphasizing his disorientation and vulnerability. He is unable to tell how far he has gone or how much further he has to go; the night has obscured all markers and obstacles in the path. 

The other significant feature of the setting is the fact that the cyclist is in a forest. In addition to heightening the cyclist's fear and disorientation, the presence of the forest serves to amplify his physical struggles. The trees obstruct his view, making him strain in order to see any obstacles ahead. Additionally, the trees provide resistance in the form of branches and foliage that can either scratch or catch in his bike. The forest also traps the cyclistâ€™s sound, amplifying it so that he can hear the sound of his wheels crashing against rocks.

The setting of Joe Kurmaski's poem creates an atmosphere of fear and disorientation that allows us to truly feel the cyclist's struggles. The darkness of night obscures the path, while the forest creates resistance and amplifies his physical struggle and sound. Together, the features of the setting in this poem create a powerful atmosphere in which the cyclist's experience is effectively conveyed.
