 

My family and I were at my Grandmother’s 90th birthday party. It was a big reunion of relatives from all over the country and we were all having a good time celebrating. At one point in the evening, my grandfather decided to take the stage and make a speech. He was the kind of man who was quite serious and didn’t often joke around.

But when he got up to make his speech, he unexpectedly started to tell us a joke. We were all taken aback. It wasn’t a very good joke, so my grandmother started laughing. Then my aunt and uncle joined in, then my brother and sisters. Before we knew it, the whole room was in hysterics.
 
Grandpa had a huge smile on his face, he was tickled pink that everyone was enjoying his joke. Even though it wasn’t the best joke, it was the memory of everyone having a good time that made it so special. We all hugged him later that evening, thanking him for bringing the laughter to our special family gathering. 

We all left that evening with smiles on our faces — knowing that laughter truly was the shortest distance between us.
