Computers have many effects on people. As described earlier, we can think of things such as stress, energy, and food issues as manifestations of different brain enhancers. Many neurohormones also interact with other brain tissues, so that the more that a particular activity behaves in a certain way, the more likely it is to be related to the specific functions performed by the molecules being used. The stress response, in particular, might be one of the many components of what we call the stress pathway, as well.

While there is a tremendous amount of data on the interplay between these two mechanisms, their influence on human disease-related disease patterns may not be understood quite clearly and still can't be directly measured. So at the most basic level, it's important to note that there is nothing conclusive about these two studies. Instead, they do suggest that their findings might indicate some similarities between the two phenomena. Although I found a few comments in the article in which someone writes that "this suggests that brain enhancers may be the brain's most effective form of treatments. We may find similarities between these two drugs as well." Furthermore, this sort of hypothesis is completely lacking in a large number of studies published by researchers in recent years.

For example, another study in 2012 found that "brain signals may differ between patients with and without treatment with some brain factors, including altered sleep and cognition." The difference was that, while the researchers found that patients with the major drug of choice
