In the story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, the cyclist is presented with a range of challenges stemming from the varied features of the environment. Throughout the story, the cyclist is faced with physical obstacles such as steep hills and rocky terrain, as well as extreme weather conditions such as heavy rain and lightning. 

The diversity and complexity of the terrain, in particular, plays an important role in exacerbating the cyclist’s challenges. The winding roads and hills coupled with the rocky ground are difficult to manoeuvre and make it difficult for the cyclist to maintain speed, which not only adds to the overall time required to complete the journey but increases the tiredness of the cyclist. 

Further, the changeable weather conditions make it unsafe for the cyclist to continue with her journey, and the environment makes it difficult for her to find shelter. The presence of rain, lightning and heavy winds makes it difficult for the cyclist to find a safe place to take cover, and the lack of trees and buildings in the area forces her to continue on the risky journey instead of finding safety in a shelter. 

The features of the environment, therefore, play a crucial role in making the cyclist’s journey more difficult. The physical obstacles and weather conditions make it difficult for the cyclist to navigate her way safely and add to her fatigue and exhaustion, all of which make her journey more dangerous and challenging.
