The Empire State Building was a feat of engineering that changed the skyline of New York City forever. One of its most impressive features was that, when it was first built, it featured a mountaintop level that was designed so that dirigibles could dock. However, the builders of the Empire State Building faced daunting obstacles in creating a dock suitable for these huge airships.

The most significant challenge was the fact that, at the time, standards for safely mooring dirigibles had yet to be established. To do so, Chief Architect of the building, William Lamb, sought the help of German dirigible expert, Professor Rudolf Kingsford of the Zeppelin Company. Together, they designed a mooring mast as the perfect solution. The mastâ€™s design featured two arms that held a horseshoe-shaped net, which was used to attach the dirigible's tethers. The mast was also designed to reduce the amount of wind resistance, which was particularly important for the lighter airships.

The problem was that the positioning of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building was optimal for dirigibles, but did not meet safety requirements of the United States Department of Commerce. This meant that the Empire State Building was not officially approved for airship dockings. To comply with the strict standards, the building's engineers had to find a way to make the mast stronger and more structurally sound. Hundreds of tests were conducted, weighing various
