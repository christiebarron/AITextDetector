An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the time I was in a relationship. I'd sit in front of a TV and I would say, 'Hey there, come on.' It got stressful with our marriage and all that, but there was always my own point in my life when we were in such a short time, just like the people who worked with us on this campaign – because we didn't have any time spent there. It was just my time. And how do you know who is who in the world? I know you are not, but what I told you then was kind of an interesting question. It was a little harsh to say, that I know how much of a difference people make…I'm quite sure some people that actually have lived it have been a little bit more tolerant and accepting of people in their family, because they've come through such hardship themselves. I did say maybe we were at a crossroads, in some way, and some people were less tolerant that they might be able to live. I mean, some people, they are all different and they kind of just don't know one another for a good reason.
