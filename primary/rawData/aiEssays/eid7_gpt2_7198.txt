An example of a time someone in my life was patient was his sister. I saw her the other day and I said 'Wow, is this your family?' She said yes and she's like 'Well, they're dead now'." You can hear her speak in the clip above.

Maj. Robert J. Kollin of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill called the decision "shocking," noting some might think that parents must be the cause of all the damage done to their children's lives. That, he concludes, is the case. But the fact of the matter is that in many cases that does not necessarily correlate with a parent's moral standing. "Parents who are seen as good parents are much more likely to be aggressive in their behaviour," Dr. Kollin explains in his report. "If parents were seen as a good parent, the people they cared for, the children they cared about, would be most likely to act on this." What is surprising in these cases, however, is the role that morality plays in this relationship, according to Kollin.

In a 2011 study on child psychologist Dr. Elizabeth Moustakas, she found that kids in the top 25% of society were more likely to be moral than the lowest 20%. While this may be true for the children of wealthy parents, Dr. Moustakas found that the highest moral status of children with large families would vary by income, education and personal circumstances.
