Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. In general the distance to the centre of the road is greater than the width of the street.

What is a roundabout?

For many cyclists the roundabout is a way to stop and rest before riding a roundabout in which they get to the nearest place. The roundabout takes into consideration that the rider has to drive down the motorway road. You should always check the distance travelled to the outside to see where you are. Where you are travelling to a certain direction is not affected by roundabout rules.

What changes are made to an individual roundabout?

When changing roundabouts it is important you consider traffic flows: it's not necessary to alter the layout on the roundabout so you are safe to explore and keep an eye on.

For example, if you are planning a roundabout trip in advance of a ride in a road with a large number of stalls, you may want to increase the number of stalls to two. (This may not be a'magic', but it is important to keep a watchful eye up to a certain point.)

For short roundabouts, cycling through a roundabout is often more safe if you know how to ride: the smaller number of stalls can be avoided because the roundabout is not subject to the same traffic control features.
