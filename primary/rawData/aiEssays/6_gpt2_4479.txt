The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One was the legal issue of "unreasonable" roofing. Engineers had no idea that a roofer would not put on a roofer with a roof, and many homeowners said they could not afford the cost of keeping their cars upright.

While the most extensive study of the question was limited to the building at the time, it did show that many of the houses in the building were built in poorly made blocks that often collapsed without the aid of proper construction, which meant that the cost of upkeep for the block was far higher than homeowners were looking to pay for a home. That is when the architects tried to persuade engineers not to put a roof on a house. This led to the decision to allow dirigibles to dock along with other structures that were not constructed in the area.

"In the early part of the 20th Century this was a very big issue," says Charles Diller, who leads the American Institute of Technology's research on roofing. "And it wasn't until the 19th century that the construction was finally made safer."

Building to the Challenge

Diller's study reveals the need for additional projects, such as some that were funded under state or federal contracts. The most significant is a new pilot project that will allow a single house on the city's historic Northside to be built under public-private partnership. Diller says that this project is
