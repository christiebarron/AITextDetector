The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Among them was a law that forbade docking of vehicles at sea. Another objection was that docking vehicles was an illegal act.

The Empire State Building, which had been listed as "national capital of the Empire United States of America" by the U.S. government in 1949, was later renamed Jefferson Memorial Federal Building in 1963. The new name was eventually renewed in 1985, but the structure became a national landmark in 1966 when it was given the designation Jefferson Park in honor of a former resident of Jefferson, Kan., who was killed in a car crash as he drove a minibus.

The last time a dirigible was used by a building was in 1956 when the Empire State Building was converted to the George S. Truman and Empire State Building as the U.S. flag was hoisted in national remembrance of the fallen of the Soviet Union on the 20th anniversary of the Cold War.
