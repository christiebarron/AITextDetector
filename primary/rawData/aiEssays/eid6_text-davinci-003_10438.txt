The idea of being able to dock dirigibles at the American skyscraper known as the Empire State Building was first inspired in 1929 and the project was completed in 1931. Despite the creative idea, the journey to building a docking station on the skyline for these large airships was not without its challenges. This essay will discuss the numerous obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock.

The main obstacle in building a docking station on the Empire State Building for dirigibles was the issue of constructing a solid and dependable mast. As outlined in the book ‘The Mooring Mast’ by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders had to construct the mooring mast from thousands of strands of steel-alloy wire and rubber-covered cable. This became increasingly complex when it came to adding an additional two sections at the top of the mast to create height for the dirigibles to pass through. Once completed, the mast had to be strong enough to withstand both a minimal amount of swaying from turbulent winds and be able to constantly stay taut when moored. This resulted in the builders having to find a durable, lightweight material that could withstand the task.

More challenges included attaining a mooring cable that was durable and pliable enough to be maneuvered around the sharp corners of the Empire State Building but still maintain its strength in windy weather. To overcome this problem, the builders ended up using
