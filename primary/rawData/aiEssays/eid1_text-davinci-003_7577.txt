The ending of Winter Hibiscus reflects the themes of resilience and growth in the face of adversity. By ending the story with the protagonist planning to retake the test in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return, the author emphasizes the idea that no matter what happens, life still goes on and new beginnings start. The idea of rebirth and renewal in spring is represented by the hibiscus that will be budding and the protagonist's decision to retake the test. Through this imagery, Minfong Ho conveys the idea that even in the darkest times, there is hope for the future and the possibility of redemption.
