Dear Editor,

I am writing to discuss the dramatic and varied effects computers have on people in today’s society. While many people believe computers have a positive effect on people’s lives, I believe the negative impacts of computers are often overlooked.

To begin with, computers are contributing to the worsening social isolation of individuals, by encouraging people to be on their devices more and interact with each other less. Furthermore, due to the widespread use of online services like Amazon, fewer people are visiting shops and interacting with other members of their local community than ever before. This has a damaging effect on social interaction and community spirit.

Moreover, the amount of time people spend on their computers is shortening their attention span. Scientific research suggests that using a computer for extended periods of time can reduce the brain’s capacity for concentrating and makes it harder for people to break away from the computer screen.

Finally, work-related computer use can cause people to become disengaged and have less of an appreciation for their job than otherwise. People who spend long hours on computers can develop a feeling of powerlessness and dissatisfaction, which can further lead to physical and mental problems for the individual.

In conclusion,
