As libraries become more and more diverse in their offerings, censorship has come into the spotlight. While some people believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves if they are found to be offensive, this viewpoint fails to take into account the unique purpose of a library.

Libraries are a place where an individual can come to find almost any type of information. They provide access to literature, art, history, and other topics of all kinds, oftentimes expressly so that patrons can make their own informed decisions about what materials they find engaging or appropriate. Indeed, it is this principle that lies at the heart of our First Amendment, wherein citizens have the legal right to know what exists and make decisions about what to use or ignore.

Far from being a place of banishment, libraries should instead be seen as a tool of exploration. Without free access to a variety of materials, even controversial ones, the public’s ability to make informed decisions about the world and their place in it is stifled. In essence, the removal of materials from a library’s shelves would eliminate the very function of a library – to be a repository for knowledge and a resource for discovery.

For this reason, libraries should not be used as a platform to impose the morals or beliefs of certain individuals or groups on those who may or may not share them. Rather, libraries should remain a safe haven to access and discover materials
