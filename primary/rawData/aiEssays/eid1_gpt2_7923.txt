Computers have many effects on people. One of these "otherness problems" is the way people talk or write. If they ask about certain things that are not in the conversation then people who talk and write can be just as ignorant and intolerant as anyone else. In most cases, people will be too quick to assume that all things should be in the conversation.

Let's try thinking about something like this: We'd like to buy cookies this week. Now imagine that you're going to stop by your counter at the bakery. You are going to see the bakery with a sign that says "Don't buy any cookies to begin with" (unless you are eating some sort of food high in fat or carbohydrates). When you enter the bakery, you see that the checkout has expired. You go back and buy cookies, which is a very important step of going into the store. When you stop and try to shop, your order is gone. Instead, you try to buy back your order and this is when this problem is really going to start to get worse for you (you want your cookies back sooner?).

When people talk about eating out and say "well they ate here now that we've paid for it," their assumption is that they are in fact not. In fact, they have been there too long to find out. The problem is it takes a while, especially on holidays, to be able to understand that they are talking about healthy food and not unhealthy food,
