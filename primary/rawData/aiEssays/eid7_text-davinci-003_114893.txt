It was a hot summer day and I was working a double shift at my job. I was really tired but I was staying positive and doing my best to stay focused. As the day went on, customers came in and out, each more demanding than the next. Some customers were becoming increasingly frustrated with the slow service they were receiving and I could tell they were getting really angry.

Despite the rising tension, I remained patient with each customer. I kept my composure and tried my best to talk them through the situation with the utmost patience. No matter how frustrating their situation was, I remained empathetic and understanding.

Eventually, after what felt like an eternity, the lines began to calm down and we finally caught up with the workload. I was relieved that my patience had paid off and that I was able to deescalate the situation and help move things along. Although it was a long and tiring day, I was proud of myself for being able to stay patient and focused.
