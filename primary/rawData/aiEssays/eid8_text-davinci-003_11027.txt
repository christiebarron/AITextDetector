I was on a date with a woman I had recently met, and it was going surprisingly well. We had just finished our meals, and she excused herself to use the restroom. As I was waiting for her to come back, I absent-mindedly started reading a tabloid by the register. It had some absurd article about a celebrity doing something outrageous, and I couldn't help but laugh.

When she returned, she saw me and asked what was so funny. I showed her the article and we both started laughing. We laughed so hard that a few other people in the restaurant even joined in. After we had calmed down, she smiled and thanked me for the laugh. 

That moment of laughter was an unexpected yet welcome surprise, and it solidified our connection. Laughter was the bridge that connected us, and it's been one of our favorite shared activities ever since.
