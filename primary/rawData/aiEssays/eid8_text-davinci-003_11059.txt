I have been married to my wife for twenty years. We have built a life together and have two grown sons. We are all busy in our endeavors and life can be stressful at times.

I recently noticed that our conversations were becoming a bit dull and dry. We were just rehashing the same old topics day after day. We knew that we needed to inject a little something different into our relationship.

One night, we decided to watch a comedy film together. We had lunch first and then laughed our way through the movie.  We talked and joked all through the film. We both found ourselves in stitches, unable to talk for minutes at a time due to our laughter.

We started to laugh until tears were in our eyes. We'd pause the film, and even after the movie ended, we kept laughing. 

That evening, we discovered something special: That laughter really can be the shortest distance between two people. It brought us back to each other and reignited our relationship in a way that nothing else could. We now make sure to enjoy a comedy movie night every month, and laugh our way through the night. 

It's a magical thing â€“ when laughter creates a connection.
