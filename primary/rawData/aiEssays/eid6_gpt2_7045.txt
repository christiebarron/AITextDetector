The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

In 1907, when the Metropolitan Museum on Fifth Ave. was open to the public, the first dirigible was erected in Chicago. Its construction was approved because of a lack of permits and a lack of infrastructure to keep it operating.

"The designers were very impressed with the speed and efficiency of the object construction," said Harold McCay, a professor of geosciences at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. "It's unusual but not unheard of to see these kinds of things go down as one of the most fascinating things about museums (in Chicago)." McCay, who lived in Chicago with his wife and son during the building boom, said the idea of a dirigible was not so new in Chicago.

The last time an elevator was erected around an apartment building was in 1909 at the North East Street Theatre. A carabiner, a folding chair that had no handle, and a sliding chair were the first examples of the use of dirigibles and are said to have had some of the most spectacular moments of their careers.

"The first thing we did was put them over there," said Larkin Kresser, who designed the U.S. Navy's dirigible
