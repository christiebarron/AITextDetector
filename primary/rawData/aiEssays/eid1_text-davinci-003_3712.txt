Dear Editor:

As technology advances, computer use has become increasingly prevalent in society. From browsing the internet to shopping online, computers are present in almost every facet of life. Though handy for daily tasks, the effects of extensive computer use on people can be damaging.

Apart from physical hazards such as carpal tunnel syndrome caused by extended keyboard use, it can cause psychological problems as well. Prolonged exposure to artificial radiation can trigger 'digital addiction,' a catch-all term for the adverse mental effects of excessive computer use. Beyond this, it can lead to a decrease in face-to-face interactions, as well as communication and language skills, stunting social growth and development.

What's more, children are exposed to digital content at a much earlier age than ever before, which can cause issues later in life. This is especially concerning when the content is inappropriate; it can create disturbing mental images or lead to the formation of questionable viewpoints.

To conclude, while computers offer much convenience, it is important to consider the implications of excessive computer use. I would advise readers to find a balance between its use and other activities to better ensure health and wellbeing.

Sincerely,

[Name]
