One of the major features of the setting of 'Rough Road Ahead' by Joe Kurmaski is its obvious harshness and unpredictability. The cyclist in the story is forced to make his way along a treacherous road thatâ€™s full of hazards, such as sharp twists and turns, steep hillsides, and sudden sand traps. This type of environment places the cyclist in constant danger and requires him to remain perpetually focused and alert. This is a difficult challenge for any cyclist, but it is particularly difficult for our protagonist, whose fear of the path ahead causes him to hesitate in response to any significant change in the terrain.

The cyclist's fear in the story is heightened by the fact that the environment is constantly changing. The road is constantly shifting and changing, which means that the cyclist has to be constantly on guard for any sudden unexpected threats or obstacles. This can be quite overwhelming, and the cyclist must expend a great deal of energy and focus in order to stay safe and traverse the track successfully.
