The memoir From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez creates a nostalgic and bittersweet tone that follows the themes of family traditions and childhood memories. From the very beginning, Rodriguez introduces us to his life growing up in Hoboken, New Jersey as one of three children of Cuban parents. Both his loving parents and his city's unique cultural history shape Rodriguez's memories and us as readers.

The memoir captures the innocence and beauty of childhood, but there is also an undertone of sorrow that conveys the fragility of time and family. Throughout the memoir, Rodriguez pays homage to his family in particular his father who nurtured his creative endeavours, but he can't help feeling the pangs of regret for being too busy with work to spend time with him. We also sense the pain of the Abuelitas who, although they light up the faces of their grandchildren, face the heartbreak of missing their deceased family members. 

The poignancy of Rodriguez's reflections on his family's past make up the core of the memoir. The mood created is both a celebration and a lamentation of times gone by. Rodriguez also expresses the joy of his present life and all the opportunities he has been given to create something from nothing. At the same time, he is surrounded by the ghosts of our shared past. 

From Home is a tribute to Rodriguez's home, his family, and his Cuban heritage that resonates unforced and genuine emotion
