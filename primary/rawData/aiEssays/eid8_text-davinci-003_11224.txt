I remember the first time I ever went on a date with my now husband. We had been talking for weeks and I was determined to be perfectly charming that evening but when I walked in the door I started to panic. I knew he was the type of person that loved to laugh but I wasn't sure I could be funny enough to keep the conversation going.

Fortunately, my worries were quickly put to rest as soon as we started talking. His stories of his childhood were so funny that I started laughing uncontrollably. He would look at me with such earnest curiosity and ask me a question or make a joke, and I couldn't help but giggle and smile. Eventually, we both started laughing so hard that my sides ached and tears were streaming down my face.

The more we laughed together, the more I was sure that this was a relationship I wanted to explore further. We spent several more hours just talking and laughing until I had to leave for the night.

As we said our goodbyes, I knew I'd never forget that evening. His ability to make me laugh had made an undeniable impression. We've now been married for 10 years, and that same laughter still makes us giggle and brings us closer together.
