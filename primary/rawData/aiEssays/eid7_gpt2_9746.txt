An example of a time someone in my life was patient was in an emergency situation. She felt in a hurry when she reached the hospital. I found that I had just done her a favour with a bottle of whisky. She was now sitting down so I opened the door. I had the whisky and just threw her into the kitchen and sat down and waited for her to come up. She was waiting for her daughter when I got that call. I put my hand on her knee and said to her, 'Well, your daughter needs to be well, you know.' She wanted to see me, so I asked her to go get her to the doctor. And she wanted to see me a minute later. As soon as I got her into bed, my hand went up and I kissed her face and the first thing that came out was that I loved her so much that I didn't like the idea of spending the rest of my life with her. So I took that as a slap at her, and a slap at me for liking her so much. After that I kept watching her work and I thought of things, and then the things that brought me back from that day. I don't think I liked the thought of spending the rest of my life with her to the point I didn't want to spend it. But then then I got home, and I found my dad in bed with his wife waiting at the window. I had seen some pictures of him, and he opened the window
