I remember the first time that my best friend made me laugh. It was a crisp autumn day and we were having our weekly catch up session. We'd chat about the everyday things that were happening in our lives, and usually I'd be the one doing most of the talking. But this time, suddenly, without warning, my best friend burst into a fit of laughter and started recounting one of her most embarrassing moments.

The tale was full of awkward missteps and hilarious misfortunes, until finally she got to the punchline. I could not help but start laughing along with her. As we laughed, our bond felt stronger than ever before. There wasn't a single ounce of awkwardness between us â€“ this was a moment of pure shared joy and understanding.

That moment has stayed with me ever since. Whenever I feel down or out of sync with the world, I think back to it and remember that it's alright to have a good laugh every once in a while.
