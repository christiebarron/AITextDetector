The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' (also known as Gildan) is decidedly male, and many of the characters are only very recently married/couples in a family. These dynamics do not become the way in which they were in reality, and many of them are just too young to have seen in the book how a man can achieve a good marriage by looking like a woman after his wife, despite the growing acceptance. (I've read it about 50 times, so it's worth reading that way though, but I'll give it here when I do.)

A common theme among these characters is a tendency to assume that the majority of couples who look like women don't have much at all to do. Many seem genuinely sad and sadistic in their hearts, and even try to justify themselves by claiming to give the "normalcy" a look to make it feel better, despite the fact that the reality of what it is and how it fits in with that world is very different from people's. A lot of the women we see in stories like 'Glad You're So Lovely', who have nothing more than small talk and talk about marriage and how they have "grown up" and that just "don't really want her" and are merely interested in "being with a woman who looks like her". In others characters who are also very happy but often not happy by any possible definition, just seem more and more lost and distant and unhappy. In
