I have been best friends with my neighbor for nearly a decade, and we have shared countless laughs. One of my favorite stories involves laughter in a time of need.

One day, I came over to my neighbor’s house with some old furniture my family was getting rid of. I knew he was looking for a dresser or nightstand, and thought I could help. As it turns out, the furniture was in worse shape than it seemed. We both ended up laughing, however, when pieces of wood and metal started to separate and fall off the dresser as we were carrying it into the house! We had to stop multiple times to pick up the pieces and try to repair the broken mess.

By the time we got the broken dresser up the stairs, we were laughing so hard that my stomach hurt. It was a funny and absurd situation, but we were able to laugh together and even ended up bonding over the shared experience. Even though it wasn’t the end result we had envisioned, that moment of laughter between us left a lasting impression and strengthened our friendship.
