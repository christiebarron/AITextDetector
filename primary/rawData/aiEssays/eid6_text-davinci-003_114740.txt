The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of challenges in allowing dirigibles to dock at the building. In their attempt to build the tallest structure in the world, they wanted to include the promise of dirigible dockings. However, this idea presented a number of unique engineering and safety challenges. 

The main problem was the instability of the airships. Unlike airplanes which are more aerodynamic and have wings to help provide stability, dirigible airships are buoyant and feature a flimsy structure. Their large size also caused issues as the upper and lower decks of the Empire State Building threatened to interfere with the airship's motions. This concern was mitigated somewhat by the fact that winds at the height of the building were not as strong as those on the ground. 

A related issue was the need for the airships to remain steadily moored while passengers embarked and disembarked. This required a strong mast structure attached to the building that would not sway or give way under the weight of the airship. It was decided that a mooring mast should be installed on the 72nd floor of the building which had windows which could be opened for passengers. This mast was designed to be highly durable and withstand both wind and the fluctuating weight of the airship. 

Safety was another key concern for the builders. Dirigibles posed an increased risk of fire due to their combination of flammable gases and electric motors. To limit the chance
