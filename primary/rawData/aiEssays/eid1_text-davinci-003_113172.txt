Dear Editor,

I am writing to inform readers of my opinion on the many ways computers have changed our lives and how they have had both positive and negative effects along the way.

Undeniably, computers have allowed us access to immense knowledge through the internet, faster communication, and the ability to perform complex tasks quicker. In this way, they have made life easier and helped to increase our efficiency in all aspects. 

However, computers have also caused a few negative aspects in our lives. With easy access to the internet, social media, and video streaming sites, people have developed an addiction to their devices. This addiction is taking away from face-to-face interactions with family and friends which were once fundamental for our socialization. Furthermore, dependence on computers has caused us to become less attentive when it comes to details and there have been issues around cyber security.

For these reasons, computers need to be used wisely and sparingly to fully reap the benefits that they offer. We can use computers to connect with others, acquire knowledge, and make life simpler but spending too much time in front of a computer can be detrimental. 

I strongly urge readers to be mindful of their computer usage and recognize that while computers are powerful tools, too much screen time can have negative consequences.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
