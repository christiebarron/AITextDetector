The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One was the fact that they needed a way to attach the cockpit to the building. Another required that each of the pilot's windows should be positioned in the same manner. These are the four main problems with the Empire State Building.

In the beginning, the building was designed to house three aircraft.

Two of these planes were the VV-1 and VV-2, the first of which were built during the reign of Emperor Henry II. The other plane was the VV-3, built during the reign of Frederick I. The VV-5 was built when the Empress, Catherine the Great, was crowned.

It was thought that the remaining two planes would be commissioned as the first of two large-scale airplanes.

One was originally called VV-200, which had a total takeoff height of 300 feet (18 m), but was eventually scrapped. The VV-6/VV-9 are the most expensive airplanes of the series. These are produced in both U.S. and New York, and come with a built in control. This aircraft flew over Washington, D.C., from 1950 to 1953. The VV-9 was also designed to work with two-engine planes and other power sources. Both were built on more expensive aircraft such as the B-17.

Another set of aircraft, the VV-12
