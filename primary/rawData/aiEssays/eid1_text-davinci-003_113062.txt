Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Technology is everywhere in the modern world. From smartphones to computers to laptops, devices are helping shape practically every aspect of our lives. But what impact are computers having on our mental and physical health? 

We cannot deny that computers, when used correctly, can produce tangible benefits. Just think of all the helpful tools we use on our computers: we can access information almost immediately, we can communicate with virtually anyone in the world, and we can even do our work and school assignments at faster speed. However, it is essential that we stay aware of how computers are changing us. 

It has become increasingly clear that continuous usage of computers can have a negative effect on our psychological and physical health. By suffering from posture problems and visual fatigue, for instance, directly created by long-term computer use, we make ourselves prone to a variety of other ailments. Moreover, computers can be a source of stress in more ways than one, especially if one is an online worker. Thus, it is essential that we use our computers with moderation and common sense. 

Overall, computers can be beneficial, informative, useful and even entertaining. Nonetheless, when not used with caution, our health and welfare can be at risk. I strongly encourage people to consider the effects of computer use on our health and to take steps to protect ourselves. 

Sincerely,
