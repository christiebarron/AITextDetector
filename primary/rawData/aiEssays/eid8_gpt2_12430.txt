One time I experienced laughter in my life was when the doctor informed me that, despite the great danger from my disease and the pain the body felt, I ought to take all measures against the effects. During such trials I had never felt a bit less sick. I had already given way to the disease, and the other patients were getting worse. The doctor said, `A baffling situation, my friend!' I answered, `What the f*&&^!' he replied, `it is not much to ask! I do not believe it will be over; this would be madness! A very strange state of mind is to be suspected! It is not uncommon for me to be agitated and to be in such a state as to be frightened by it. My heart feels heavy, and my mind is like this!' The doctors were so pleased, they sent me with a white and pale coat and a yellow cap." (1891 London edition)

This was published in the following year: "And by the way Mr. Scholastic wrote: "What to do now, Mr. Doctor Watson.... You will soon perceive what lies in your power and you will know that the patient will suffer immensely and that the doctor is able to bear it." (1894 London edition)

In the same year:

"The doctor asked for a certificate to see me again and for the first time that I had the chance to be with him." (1895 London edition)
