An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my son and we both were in a wheelchair, which was quite difficult for him. One day he thought he was going to die and was really scared and so he called the ambulance where he said he'd gone to hospital to be taken to God and had just had an operation so that he'd get out on the way. When we got there he had the same story and thought he'd never survive as it was his body being removed. I think it was that time the first time people started dying together. It's not that this was bad. But at that time there was a very hard working relationship between me and the doctors.
