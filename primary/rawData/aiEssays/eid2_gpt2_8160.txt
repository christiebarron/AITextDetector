I believe that censorship of materials in libraries does not allow a free press to be developed, even in the country where the media are freely allowed," he wrote in a post at Free The Press UK.

"While it is impossible to know whether the actions of two UK journalists in Australia were justified, I am pleased in this case that they should be punished and the public should receive justice for their efforts to silence free speech in the UK."

The comments came during a series of articles published by Guardian reporters James O'Brien and Richard Prentice on Thursday that questioned copyright concerns relating to the recent Australian release of leaked information from the leak of US intelligence data to Wikileaks.

The pair have received numerous complaints from consumers who accuse publishers of copyright infringement over the leak.

"Our readers do expect and deserve that they will get their fair share of information from the sources provided by government, but they don't get fair sharing if they're willing to do so for nothing," said Prentice and O'Brien and O'Brien, who also share the Guardian's editorial offices.
