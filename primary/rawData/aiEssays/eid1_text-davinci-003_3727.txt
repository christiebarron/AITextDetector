 

Dear Editor,

As technology continues to develop and expand, computers play a larger and more integral role in our lives each and every day. Our world has undoubtedly been positively impacted by computers, however, it is important to recognize the effects they have had on the individual as well. 

The vast majority of people use computers for communication, research and entertainment. We use computers more than ever, which gives us easy access to a wealth of information. Technology has enabled individuals to work more efficiently than ever before. Furthermore, computers have helped bridge the gaps of physical and cultural separation. 

However, computers can be incredibly harmful if they are used excessively. Long-term use of computers can strain the eyes, hands and neck, and can even lead to conditions such as carpal tunnel syndrome. It can also lead to a sense of over-dependence on technology. In reality, an over-dependence on computers can make individuals less independent when solving issues. 

Computers can provide tremendous opportunities and advantages, but they should be used responsibly. Humans are capable of using computers well and a conscious balancing should be sought between the use of technology and the potential negative consequences on an individual. Therefore, in an effort to get the most out of advances in technology, while avoiding the detrimental effects on individuals, the focus should be on the use of computers responsibly. 

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
