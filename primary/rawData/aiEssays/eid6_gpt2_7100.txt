The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They said that if they couldn't accommodate all the passengers, so they were forced to build a huge dome over the building. A building's structural requirements could be different for the same types of aircraft if it did not include aircraft seats and windows. The most recent major change in the building was the expansion of two large, 12,000-square-foot wingspan buildings over a second floor, at the entrance to the upper deck of the Empire State Building, on the site of the building dating back to the 1790 census.

"Those were all the challenges that had to be met before they could build a new flight deck. And for the biggest aircraft carrier in the world to have a wing bridge, those were the challenges," said Hallett.

Hallett says that the big challenges are the size and the design of the wingspan structures and the fact that planes have no structural components at all. They are designed to be operated by three different pilots, with one pilot using two aircraft and one pilot using only one. The only structural components are the fuel and the propeller that is operated by the flight deck. The two pilots and the propeller must be part of the carrier.

According to Hallett, he doesn't think it's safe to fly a plane on a wingspan. As a pilot, he has no one else to fly the two planes and
