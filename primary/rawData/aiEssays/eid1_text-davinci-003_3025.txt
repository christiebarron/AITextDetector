Dear Editor,

It is undeniable that computers have had a massive impact on our lives over the past few decades. Some people may argue that the effect computers have had on our lives has been largely negative, but I believe otherwise.

To begin with, computers have revolutionized the way we work and learn. They have everything from easy online job applications to interactive online classes, providing both convenience and flexibility that would not have been possible before. In addition, the advances in technology have allowed us to become more connected than ever, with access to vast quantities of information at our fingertips.

Not only that, but computers have also provided us with many opportunities for leisure. From playing computer games to streaming music and movies, computers offer a variety of entertainment options. Furthermore, they have opened up new horizons for creativity, allowing us to produce art, create music and design websites.

In conclusion, while it is true that computers can be used for both good and bad, I believe that their ability to provide both productivity and entertainment is far greater than any potential negative effects.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
