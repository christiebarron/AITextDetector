The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. For one, an air conditioner was installed on the tower. So did the lobby, a gutter of concrete with a gutter of steel was connected to a tower's north elevators.

The two most important obstacles were the two main shaft siding, the middle shaft and a staircase. The second is the elevator. There was nothing in the towers that could be done when the gutter had been left out, meaning it would be impossible for the two-stage stairs to connect at all. The main two shafts were not accessible because there had been no elevator in place for many years.

So builders of Empire State began building shaft siding on the eastern side of the building by design. By 1703, some seven years after the completion of the construction, the shaft siding was completely removed, the floor space being reserved for use papers.

For this reason, engineers from both sides of the Empire State Building also started to construct shaft siding. These were usually located in central rooms with one or more windows on each side.

Because of the lack of steel, the steel used on the shaft siding was relatively small in size; only a few tens of centimetres thick. The shaft siding needed the additional work involved in making the elevator to the lower level. The building did not include the required ductwork for a ductwell. Instead,
