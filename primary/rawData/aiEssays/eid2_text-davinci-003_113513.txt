In this day and age, libraries have become essential in providing access to knowledge and creativity. People flock to libraries to study, work, conquer boredom, and explore what the world has to offer. Therefore, it’s critical to protect libraries from censorship.

Freedom of information is a fundamental right, and censorship can be very harmful to our society. It eliminates opportunities to explore and educates us on different perspectives, cultures, and ways of life. More importantly, censorship violates individual freedoms, and takes away our ability to choose and think for ourselves. Censorship can easily be abused and used as a way of control and manipulation.

Removing certain materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines from library shelves based on the opinion of a few does not serve any constructive purpose. It’s simply a form of censorship, and it goes against the spirit of libraries regardless of religious, political, and social pressures.

Instead of expecting libraries to act as censors, the focus should be on providing access to as much information as possible. In this way, individuals can make their own decisions on what is appropriate for them. 

Our society is much richer for the knowledge and entertainment provided by libraries, and it’s important to safeguard our freedom of thought and information. It’s better to provide access to a variety of materials and let readers make their own informed decisions instead of placing limits on what people can and cannot read.
