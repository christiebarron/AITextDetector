The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because when it speaks of being in awe rather than averse to emotion it leaves many with questions, but even if you give the book too long, it is a strong example that the book's power is not its weakness, it is its strength.

"You know, my book is really good, but it is also my favorite to read and it doesn't change anything around me in any way. It's something that I didn't know of, but I think the question of why I like it isn't there. I just wrote my first draft of The Winter Hibiscus and I'm still really confused about why I was going to write it. I think people have a huge misunderstanding of what The Winter Hibiscus really is that has been going on for decades, and it's a book much too far in the past for me or readers."
