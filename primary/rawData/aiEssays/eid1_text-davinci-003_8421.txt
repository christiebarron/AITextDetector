My daughter was having a bit of a temper tantrum in the grocery store because she wanted a cookie from the bakery. All the other shoppers started to look in my direction as her cries got louder and I could feel the pressure to give in to her. 

But I stayed patient and instead of giving in, I knelt down so I was at her level and I told her that I understood that she was feeling frustrated, but we couldn't get a cookie today and that it was time for us to leave now. I took her hand and gave it a gentle squeeze and kept talking to her in a calm, soothing voice while she was still upset.

After a few moments, my daughter calmed down and allowed me to guide her out of the store. Although I was still uncomfortable with all the attention, I was proud of myself for being patient with my daughter. I knew that in the long run it was the best thing I could do for her.
