 

Dear Editor,

As technology continues to evolve and become more advanced, it is no surprise that computers have also become a staple in our daily lives. While computers certainly have their benefits, I would like to draw attention to the many ways they can adversely affect us.

At their most basic level, computers can create a disconnect between people. With so much of our communication now happening over text messages or emails, it is easy to forget that we need to connect with each other through more meaningful channels. All too often it takes crises like a pandemic to remind us of how important it is to meet in person.

Furthermore, computers can also impede our ability think critically. It is too easy to rely on pre-programmed responses or automated search results rather than deducing a conclusion ourselves. As a result, we may end up lacking the skills necessary to confidently tackle difficult problems.

These are just a few of the many issues that computers can cause. Hopefully, we can find ways to better manage our use of technology to ensure that its dangerous impacts are minimized.

Sincerely,

[Name]
