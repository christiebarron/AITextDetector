Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. When we start we are all aware what sort of roads we need to run in in particular and our favourite places. And so if we had decided to have a car we would not have wanted our bikes to have any steering. Well how about we go a step further with a car instead? We decided to change the way the cycling infrastructure works to be able to allow bikes to do this. So I think you will find that although there may be a few bike racks along with the cycling paths and it seems more'realistic' than this, the real cycling infrastructure in many parts of the country is still not very well organised, and a lot of the people cycling to and from work in the countryside are in their early 30's, very young people, many of them are working in public transport. So the next thing you need to do is to change how infrastructure works, and if you do that you may not be completely satisfied with the way it works when it is working. So here is a step by step guide to make this happen.

You need to make sure you see that the roads in every city or town are different depending on where you live. What does this tell you about the cycling infrastructure in your area?

Firstly you don't need to look at what is already running in that city as this means the cities with big traffic arteries and lots of high speed roads are often right
