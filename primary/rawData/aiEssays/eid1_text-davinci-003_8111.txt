The builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles when attempting to accommodate dirigibles or airships docking at the skyscraper. The first of which was the engineering task of adapting the building’s design to receive an airship. According to Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s book “The Mooring Mast”, a mooring mast was designed onto the 103rd floor of the building which would a central point for the possible handling of dirigibles. This air terminal would then need to be connected to the ground with a steel and concrete stair-stepped cableway, allowing possible passengers to board the dirigible within the structures walls.

In addition to the engineering challenge was also the architectural problem of not disrupting the iconic profile of the lush Art Deco building. In order to preserve this structure it was necessary to not permanently attach the mooring mast or cableway. Instead, this was designed to pivot out of the wall, allowing dirigibles to hover close to the building while still remaining independent of the structure.

The inherent danger of balancing such a massive vessel in an urban area was a further concern. Height restrictions were then established to ensure that the airships kept a safe distance from the streets below. The crews of the dirigible also had to be trained intensely in the skill of mooring. Before docking, the maneuverability of the craft had to be tested to make sure that it would not near any wind
