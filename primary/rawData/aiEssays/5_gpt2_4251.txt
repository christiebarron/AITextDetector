The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is reminiscent of the way in which the novel is written, with its emphasis on the family, its history and the importance of the people living there. The characters are always in great danger of turning, and also the characters often make some mistake, for instance when confronted with the same dilemmas.


There's no doubt that from the end of the book, the family of those whose lives are put out of the reach of most people have made some remarkable choices. The father who died, who never saw his own children, and perhaps even worse, who was only 21, whose own grandfather, brother or daughter were involved in a horrific act known as the Bloody Bull's Suicide. They all went on to create a new life. The child who is the most powerful woman and the child who has lost his sense of self. This story is about the children and parents who take care of each other and live a peaceful and harmonious life. The story of the children and parents, 'From Home,' is the only one which has survived its run through the English language. The authors are working under the assumption that there will be no ending to these stories, and that they will simply tell another side story. This is a long-term view of things now, but a long view nonetheless. The novel is a work in progress.
