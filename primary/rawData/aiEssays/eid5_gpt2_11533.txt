The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' has become a potent symbol of depression and loss. The book reflects these thoughts.

'They are still there in your soul. They need to be turned on and on,' said Elizabeth, the daughter of a prominent figure. 'There needs to be an open dialogue between mental health issues and loss, and maybe, at the very least, a positive exchange with one person, who can begin to heal.'

When she took the book to the publisher in 2008, this happened: the first two years were 'frozen' and she had to write as the book went on. After she became a public figure, people started to understand how mental illness affects people.

'The stories that I love really help, but it is also heartbreaking. 'As a young person, I knew I was going to have to go through the same thing,' Elizabeth says. 'I felt that I wasn't the type to leave people alone, to go through everything centimeters away.'
