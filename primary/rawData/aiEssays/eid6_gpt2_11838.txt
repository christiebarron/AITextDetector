The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first hurdle was that they would need a way to attach them to a dock. "I didn't know who I wanted to build," says Toney, "but they said, we might be able to build it into a home or maybe on something."

By the 1950s, the state's architects had established what most people would consider to be a good design: Two horizontal beams at the top of each building. Each of these beams ran off a horizontal line parallel to the surface. The other ran off into the ground, about ten feet below the ground (on one side). In fact, one of the two beams connected two ground slabs and an empty spot, which made it possible to build any kind of an apartment.

The second hurdle came in 1963, when the state made the first proposal, which incorporated horizontal lines and vertical lines at the top of each building down to a central beam. With the state and federal aid, architects used these to build houses in a few months and then built a wall in the front yard. Although the wall never went up to their final height, they retained several elements that could be incorporated into their building.

Then the ceiling for the windows was created. The state wanted windows which could be open only from one side, as opposed to a wall. This led to a wall-mounted porch and other buildings that could be in a courtyard
