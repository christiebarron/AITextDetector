One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I went to a coffee shop for coffee one time and there were literally people staring at me with wide eyes. Not one had noticed me before, but even then, it felt like it was going straight onto the face. I was so excited. I really didn't have any interest in anything before. It was just what I had gotten myself into the habit of getting into. I never want to leave a job. I'm not even afraid of anything because if I do it will make it easier for the person. But that does still have a reason to be. So what does THAT mean for you? Well... in order to be happy, you have to be able to say shit. Do you wanna say that to me again? No... not a fuck! What has everyone been waiting for?! I am an idiot! And I can never get a job just the way I get a job! Or a job! Just the way I get jobs! I can't work hard because of you! Do you know what I say?! I work hard! I work hard for you! Do you realize how much I just said!? No more jobs. I work hard for you!!! I work hard to ensure you have a happy marriage! I work hard to ensure that I am not only able to keep my job but also, for you. Don't you know that for me, if you want a happy marriage then I want you to find every home
