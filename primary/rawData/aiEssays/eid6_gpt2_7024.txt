The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In 1928, the State's Department of Land and Natural Resources (DEN) initiated several changes that further restricted the ability of builders to "mock" the dome. The new devices used an aluminum alloy to form a "faster" structure (to the point that it resembled a real world structure) which was not conducive to the dome's appearance. By 1953, the construction of the building was in the hands of the American Association of Structural Engineers. In 1956, the USACE took up a contract to develop an "Faster Twin," an inter-davo dome that could be retrofitted using the technology of the USACE Standard Building System.

The Dome is the first of many structures to have been developed using a conventional vertical structure and has not been able to take advantage of the new dome technology on this side of Manhattan.

This photo shows the dome as it was constructed in 1978 on a large piece of concrete. The surface of the structure reflects sunlight and the shape of the dome is very similar to that of the dome's surrounding construction. There are multiple views of the Dome at each of the two vantage points, making this photograph the first that shows the dome as it was constructed in
