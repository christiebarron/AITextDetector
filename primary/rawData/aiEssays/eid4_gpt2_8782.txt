The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because, in it, Hibiscus has become an expert. In it, he has been able to prove it to the people of the lands surrounding the land of the Folly. You may not know Hibiscus, but he is one of the great sorcerers of the world, one of the heroes of the world and the leader of a great group of legends. I am looking forward to reading it again.

What are your thoughts on the book Summer Hibiscus, about it's story and its art?

I absolutely love the artwork, as I don't really believe I would make an anime about Hibiscus, but if I did I would happily adapt it as a manga. I really loved the characters, but I also loved to see what kind of a world they're about. How much of the world would be a world without a Hibiscus. I'd love to see the world without Hibiscus, and Hibiscus will be really fascinating!
