I remember when my best friend and I had gone on a road trip together. We were driving for hours on end, just chatting away and having a great time when it happened - we got hopelessly lost! We had no idea where we were going and we began to bicker and get frustrated with one another. 

Then, out of nowhere, my friend made a silly comment to make light of the situation, and before we knew it we were both laughing until tears were rolling down our eyes. I think that was the moment we realized that our friendship was special - it could take any amount of frustration or confusion, but a sense of humour was what could bring us out of it. We continued our journey, not feeling so lost anymore, each of us sensing the closeness that laughter had brought us.
