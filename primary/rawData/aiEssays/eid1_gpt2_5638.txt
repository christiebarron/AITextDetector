Computers have many effects on people. It can cause them to be overweight, to lack weight, to have diabetes, to have heart disease. There is also something called "hyperinflation," where everyone has fewer income, and people have less money to spend.

"People are very likely to take on more debt, or to be obese, than they normally would," says Leland. There is also the possibility that some people, like in the U.S., are taking off because they want to put down a lot more debt. "In addition, people often prefer a higher income in the United States [because] they may gain less [into the market]." The result is "a financial depression, which can lead to less job opportunities, less savings, less savings in retirement."

The study was funded from the National Institutes of Health.
