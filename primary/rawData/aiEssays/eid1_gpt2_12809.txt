Computers have many effects on people. As shown in this study, exposure to a broad spectrum of pollutants is associated with an increased risk of depression. Although depression is associated with decreased fertility and cardiovascular disease [16], exposure to highly toxic materials such as methylmercury and dioxane has been implicated as more strongly linked to mental health problems [17]. In contrast, exposure to pesticides and fungicides does not present a serious threat to agriculture, and is generally considered a safe and effective herbicide [18]. Furthermore, exposure to such chemical pesticides is associated with long-term health problems [19], which may contribute to low nutritional status, obesity, diabetes risk, stroke, and other adverse effects [20]. Exposure to pollutants, while largely not associated with depression, also could play a role in regulating our health and promoting healthy blood pressure and cholesterol.

In a cross sectional study, there was no significant difference in serum cholesterol levels between those who exposed to hazardous materials compared with those who didn't. Thus, the findings suggest that the exposures we described in this study were not more hazardous than those that were not.

In a multi-issue cross examination of a cohort of people with elevated serum levels of different metals in their diet, it was discovered that high metals (e.g., copper, tin, mercury, organochlorine) increased the risk of heart disease and mortality, although there was no significant difference in the amount of mercury in the diet.
