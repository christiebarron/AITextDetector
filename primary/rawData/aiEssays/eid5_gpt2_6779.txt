The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' and a number of other novels, a book released at London's Rotherham Book Festival in January this year, and an exhibition on the books in her new book The Making of Women in Contemporary Fiction, have been viewed, along with countless others, by countless media outletsurers the world over.

In her new memoir she will explain how her character, Zoey, is raised by her older brother and the role she plays in this life.

At a time when many in contemporary fiction still view writing as the means to achieving a certain level of self-actualisation, Zoey is determined to write a book that won't be ignored - not by those who think it's an over-worked, lazy-lipped book or a self-abusing, under-paid affair.

In her interviews with the Daily Mail, Zoey is frank in her description of herself, which she describes as "an introvert and a man" - even though she is aware of how women often mispronounce an appearance as "boy" or "woman".

She says she is not ashamed to describe herself as female - as it is at least a sign of self-consciousness that it's important to keep your image as an attractive and unique individual in mind. And when she says that "my book is my manifesto" she means the personal history, history of the day, history of the book in her language.
