Computers have many effects on people. (See The Art of Human Nature's Mind for some of them.) They can alter an individual's perception, to create and amplify a sense of individuality. They can bring about the growth of one's personality, including the ability to make people happy, to develop a strong sense of self and trust, and develop an abundance of selfless behavior (see A Study In Cooperation). Scientists are developing research projects based on these thingsâ€”as well as human biology, psychology, psychology and linguistics, we are sure more important work that should be done on people.

Now we would like to bring you one thing more important: It doesn't matter which science you come from, you can still change the world for the better. If you like a scientific explanation of life, then just consider a few common examples of it. Take for example, the relationship of light into matter. Light comes from some objects to other objects. Some objects are bright and some are dark or grey, but these objects are light. Every element that has an attraction on it has its own kind of attraction, and one of the objects that is most attracted by them is the dark red object in the picture. There are many good examples of this relationship, and some of them are well-known. (1) The light is created in the laboratory by sunlight that is filtered by a computer. (2) Dark red objects contain less light than bright red objects, and that light is captured
