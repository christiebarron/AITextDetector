To the Editor:

I'm writing in regards to the effects computers have on people. As a computer user, I can say without a doubt that computers have drastically changed our lives in just about every way.

The increased use and accessibility of computers has spawned new innovations and opportunities for interaction and connection with people around the world. On a personal level, computers have enabled us to stay better connected with our friends and family, no matter how far away they may live. Businesses have been able to increase their productivity in a fraction of the time it used to take, allowing them to better serve their customers.

The rapid advancement and implementation of computers also means that technology is constantly changing and it is essential for all users to stay up to date in order to best use their respective technology. This, however, can be a challenge for those who don't understand technology and can cause them to feel intimidated and out of touch.

There are also potential negative effects that computer use can have on people. Computers, along with the internet, can provide too much information or offer users an escape from reality. This can distort reality and lead to people becoming overly reliant on technology.

We must recognize that computers, no matter how essential they may be in our everyday lives, should be used responsibly. The advantages computers offer are evident, but we must also remember the potential disadvantages associated with their use.

Thank you for allowing me to voice my opinion.
