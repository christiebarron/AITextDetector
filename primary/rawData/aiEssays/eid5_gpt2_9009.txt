The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is a much more positive one. She doesn't take for granted what she has witnessed in the past. The new story, one that "feels more human in a way that is not about us, and more for someone's life," is a reflection of the positive spirit of the book. And if writing is only as good as it should be, then she can understand why there is so much work still to be done.

I asked Sarah about "writing a book about life," and she responded: "Some of it is. Some are about the way we get up, the way our life is organized. Some are about the way children live. Some are about our time in jail. Some are about being able to think about their futures."

While I'm not sure if she's getting the most credit for the book or for it personally, she's sure made it into a successful series. I'm curious if Sarah is in the mood for the long haul. In any case, the book tells a few exciting stories by doing just that, making a long journey along the way.

The book will be available for free on Amazon, but we should be hearing nothing back this week.
