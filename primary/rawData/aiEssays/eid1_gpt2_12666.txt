Computers have many effects on people.

In a word, people have to know what is happening: How they are feeling, how they are feeling. When people talk about, "I have a headache," what's the difference between that and "I can't sit down and talk about something because I'm in my car!" The brain can't tell you that there's another person's head in it. That's why you can't actually sit down and talk about that with kids. The problem is, the neurobiology of anxiety really does make a difference with anxiety, and it really does.

H/T Psychologist's Guide for Kids:

When children talk about a situation (ie, when they're about to get a really difficult assignment) they have to tell themselves this is not something that happened at the moment it happened; they'll think "I didn't do this, I was just looking at something that I saw in the movie theater and I didn't see anyone; I went through the motions."

If you are someone who is thinking of talking about the worst thing in the world to them, you might not be able to do much that will make them do it. What if they think they'll do it because the world just isn't filled with people they have friends with?

Sometimes it doesn't matter how much you know; you can still walk out thinking you're talking to people.

I've been writing a piece lately.
