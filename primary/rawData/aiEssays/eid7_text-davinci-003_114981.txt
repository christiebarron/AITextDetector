I was at the grocery store one day, trying to check out. The line I was in was incredibly long, and it felt like it was taking forever. As I was standing and tapping my foot in impatience, the cashier called for a price check. Everyone groaned and it seemed like I was going to be stuck there forever.

However, there was one woman in particular who stayed incredibly calm. She didn't roll her eyes or complain. Instead, she stayed positive and said, "It's all right. These things happen." 

When the cashier finally finished the process, she thanked him and wished him a nice day. It was amazing to see how patient and understanding she was despite the situation. Her kind attitude inspired me to be more patient when I'm faced with a difficult situation.
