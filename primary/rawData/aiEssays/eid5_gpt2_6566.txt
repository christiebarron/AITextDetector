The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' can be seen in the story of an American soldier who works at the Navy's submarine base in Linton, Massachusetts.

His superiors call their son the 'best man' for the job, and he makes their lives better, despite his mother's advice that working alone is best when the relationship with the other man is strong and not demanding.

And their daughter is the'most important person in the company'.

She lives her whole life alone, but with her husband who supports her from the outside in, and a very large family. And when she does need to go out on holiday, her grandmother takes her to visit them every day and she feels free once she goes back to the Navy base. And as usual, even in this situation, her mother and grand-mom are the people to keep in touch.

The wife and daughter are both retired from the military and she feels a little bit isolated right now in the world, but she will keep in touch whenever she wants.
