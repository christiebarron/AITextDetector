I remember one time when I was visiting my elderly grandmother at her nursing home. I'd gone to visit her a few times before, but this time was different; she seemed much more frail and was obviously dealing with a lot of discomfort. We started to talk, but it soon became apparent that she was having difficulty formulating her thoughts and words. I could've gotten frustrated, especially because I knew time was short, but instead I patiently let her take her time and listened to what she had to say.

After a few minutes, she had shared her story and we'd had a nice conversation. I was so grateful that I had been patient. The things she told me will stay with me and I am so glad I made the effort to be understanding and tolerant with her.
