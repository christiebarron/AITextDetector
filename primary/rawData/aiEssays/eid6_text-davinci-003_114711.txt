The builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at its peak. Though the possibility of mooring large airships was considered as early as the 1920s, not all the necessary elements were in place to make it possible. The building’s designers had to consider numerous factors, from the potential impact of the additional stress placed on the building’s structure to the integration of the necessary technology, in order to ensure the safety of the airships and passengers.

To begin with, the building’s structure needed to be modified in order to allow for the mooring of airships. Most notably, the Empire State Building required a specialized mast, able to support the weight of airships and effectively moor them. This structure, commonly referred to as a “Mooring Mast”, was designed and constructed specifically for the Empire State Building and posed a challenge given the sheer size and weight of the dirigibles. Steel cables were attached to the mast to form a strong anchor for the airships, so that they could be quickly and safely secured to it.

In addition to the design of the mast, the engineers had to ensure frequent maintenance of the internal mechanisms of the mast. This ensured that the mast could be operated safely and quite importantly, that it would remain undamaged in strong wind conditions.
