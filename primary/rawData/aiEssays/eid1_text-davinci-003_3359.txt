Dear Editor,

In our modern world, computers are undeniably a major part of our lives. We use them to communicate, get our work done, and even for entertainment purposes. Despite the convenience that computers offer us, there are some risks that need to be taken into account. 

Like anything else, too much of a good thing can have negative consequences. The excess use of computers can lead to physical health effects such as fatigue, eyestrain, headaches, and pain in the wrists and hands. These negative physical effects can make it difficult for a person to lead a healthy lifestyle.

Additionally, there are underlying psychological effects of computers. Excessive computer use can lead to feelings of loneliness, depression, and social isolation. This can be especially true for children and teenagers who rely so heavily on their mobile devices and computers for communication and entertainment.

The dangers of computer use are real, and it is important to be aware of them. We need to make sure that we take the time to rest our eyes, our hands, and our minds. We must also be conscious of our social interactions and commit to spending time with friends and family in person.

By emphasizing the importance of computer use in moderation
