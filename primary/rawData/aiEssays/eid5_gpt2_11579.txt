The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' (2005) and is used in such movies as 'Mads Mikkelsen' (1989) and 'Lucky' (2012). The plot centres around young Mikkelsen, who plays the character of Dr. (Zachary) who was born to a family of scientists but who has a very rare genetic defect, and whose father, Aylmer, is also a scientist. Zachary, an orphan, discovers the cure for one of the most powerful beings on earth. When Aylmer's parents refuse, Aylmer's father, the young scientist Dr. (Dr. Robert) Himmelges, escapes and becomes known as the "Mikkelsen," a mysterious creature that cannot be explained beyond the fact that he can create an entirely new form of matter using the force of his body.
