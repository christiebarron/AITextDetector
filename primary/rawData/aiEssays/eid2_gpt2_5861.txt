I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is very serious, but they must avoid such ideas from the same authorities."

He is prepared to challenge the decision, saying: "The problem with censorship in libraries is that it may lead people, even those who like the idea, to become concerned, particularly if the books you are reading are the work of non non-author authors. So, this is a direct challenge to the censorship of literature, but also to any possible alternatives that might be provided by the government."

He was speaking to The News Observer about the controversy sparked by comments made by the MP David Cameron about the National Libraries.

He said: "I believe in free and open academic debate, but I do not believe that an institution's freedom of expression is guaranteed by the constitution, or by a law."

Asked if he would be forced to defend the Freedom of Information Act and the First European Convention, he said: "No, no. I believe that the law should serve its purpose of communicating public interest. This requires freedom of expression and debate.

"But because the NLAs' work is freely available, schedules for these events are not as restrictive as they may seem and the general public can follow the public interest."
