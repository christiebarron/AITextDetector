An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a young woman from India.

In spite of his very bad mother nature she kept waiting when I needed her a little bit longer, she kept coming back for babies whenever I was hungry. There was a time when her baby was around seven days old. I have not seen her for years. Even her mother once told me she would not let me stay in Bangladesh for a while. She wouldn't let me get married, she didn't even ask me about the matter. The woman who said she couldn't stay in India was one of my best friends. She was my friend.

She always went out whenever this was the case and made sure there were no bad decisions taking place during the time. Maya is the eldest.
