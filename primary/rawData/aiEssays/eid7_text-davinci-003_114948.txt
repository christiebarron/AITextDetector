I was visiting my friend's house and the two of us were playing a game. We were well into the game when I heard a loud crash coming from the kitchen. My friend's mom had dropped a plate. I saw my friend become visibly distressed and I knew that he was about to start arguing with her about it.

I took a deep breath and calmly diverted the attention to the game. I kept the conversation going, making sure to stay positive. I was able to help de-escalate the situation and my friend's mom was eventually able to calm down and apologize. She was appreciative that I was able to remain patient and understanding in such a tough moment.

At the end of the night, my friend thanked me for being so understanding. I was proud that I could stay calm in a tough situation and be patient. It was a great reminder that being patient can make all the difference in a heated moment.
