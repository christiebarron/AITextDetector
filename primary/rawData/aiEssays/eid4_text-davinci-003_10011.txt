The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho serves to provide resolution between the narrator and the hibiscus plant. The narrator has failed a test, and her teacher insists that she retake it before she can move on. He also specifically mentions that the hibiscus plant will be in bloom when she takes the re-test, which leaves her feeling hopeful. By ending with the contemplative promise to retake the test, the narrator is symbolically connecting her own success to the resilience of the hibiscus, displaying a newfound confidence in her own success due to the natural cycle of growth and change.
