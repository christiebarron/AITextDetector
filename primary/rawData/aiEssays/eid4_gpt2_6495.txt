The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it tells us that our hearts and souls may come to some sort of conclusion to the world, but we must find our own life and do something good with it. The book is about the ways that an ordinary human being is free to make good choices, which will save him or her from war and poverty, but it also explores the ways that we are made to care for a variety of human beings. We are not always on that path at the beginning of the story but instead we learn about the choices that we have made in our lives as individuals through relationships, through our relationships as our families, through our love affairs.

The book has a wonderful cast of characters. One of the best that I have read is the narrator in the book, Dorei. While she is pretty easy to get along with and get along with a lot of women, Dorei is somewhat lacking in wisdom and wisdom on what should be done with others, and it isn't unusual for many women to think of themselves as a lot more interesting to them than they are. It has me wondering how important it really is to figure out something new or to understand the inner workings of others before they start to turn against you. In the end, while Dorei and I love each other well, we never learn the truth or the wisdom or what it all means. What do we know that will save us from war in times of need?
