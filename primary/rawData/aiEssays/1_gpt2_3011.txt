Computers have many effects on people. These include a greater likelihood that a child will be more prone to physical injury (i.e., more likely to fall after a hard day), more likely to be physically ill (i.e., greater risk of being seriously injured), and more probable that a minor will make it to recovery in a short time. The more physical an individual experiences, the greater their chances of improving, while their chances of developing improved mental and behavioral outcomes are more or less unchanged. For example, while in the early stages an individual will take a medication prescribed by a hospital (i.e., "brain-injection" therapy), they will continue this medication for 10 years or longer, but at a considerably lower rate after completion of the treatment.

The risk increases when treatment has previously been considered by the family (i.e., the family will have been able to prevent the young person from developing good mental or behavioral health). For example, in a study from 1999, more than one-third of children aged two years and under received a "brain-injecting" treatment.

The likelihood of developing improved mental and behavioral outcomes decreases with age. The more an individual experiences a traumatic event, the greater their chances of reducing their overall ability to function at a level and quality that corresponds to their potential to function well. Therefore, if a child at a younger age receives one-third more treatment from an individual who is currently in his or her third
