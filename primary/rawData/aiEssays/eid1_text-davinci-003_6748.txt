To the Editor: 

As technology becomes more and more prevalent in our daily lives, there is an increasing appreciation and dependence on computers and electronic devices. While these innovations have brought countless advantages, their effects on people cannot be overlooked.

To begin with, computers facilitate socialization and communication. With more people connecting to the internet, it has become easier to stay in touch with loved ones and gain access to a vast array of knowledge and insight from all over the world. Computers also make tasks easier and more efficient. In a matter of seconds, we can complete multiple calculations, access organized data, and create documents for work or school.

On the other hand, computers can also have a negative impact on people. Studies have shown that long hours of computer use can cause eye strain, headaches, and sleep disturbances. Moreover, too much usage has been linked to an increased risk in isolation and sedentary behavior. People have also reported feeling profound loneliness despite increased connectivity.

Though computers offer tremendous potential, we must use them with caution to realize their full benefit. All individuals should actively seek to balance time spent on computers with appropriate rest and physical activity. We can maximize the advantages of technology by responsibly enjoying its conveniences and staying aware of its potential drawbacks.

Sincerely,
