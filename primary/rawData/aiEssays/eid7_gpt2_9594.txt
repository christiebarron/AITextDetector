An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was at college. If I were my age and you were 30, the only way you could keep up with me was by working so hard and then you're 20.

You have all these relationships. You're 20, you work hard, you have this baby, you drive. You're working hard for a paycheck, your life is so expensive.

You're working hard enough for all those people you worked so hard for. And then you turn the corner, a second person is going to call you and there you are. This isn't going to be you, this is how you get to the point where you need somebody to take care of your problems. You're only 20.

As I'm 30, maybe the most stressful time in my life is when I was at the same class, going to his class, and I'm 20. What if I were going to make ends meet and you walked out the door and I was walking out alone? Would you do it?

My life is so miserable that it will cost you at least $4,000 to $5,000 for the first time in Darren's life, like my wife, who has to give up her job all her health insurance.
