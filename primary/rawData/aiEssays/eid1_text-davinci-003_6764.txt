As technology advances, more and more people are using computers in various aspects of their lives. Although computers have helped us to create incredible exploration and breakthroughs in communication, education, entertainment, and industry, it is important to consider the effects computers have on people as well.

The effects of computers on people can be both positive and negative. On the positive side, computers have become essential tools for learning, providing access to vast databases and resources that would otherwise be inaccessible. Networking tools allow people to work remotely, collaborate with teams and contacts globally, and operate businesses without the need to travel or meet in person. Additionally, computers have become an important source of entertainment, providing access to streaming media, online gaming, and social networks. 

On the negative side, though, using computers too much can lead to physical and psychological problems. Repetitive stress injuries and vision problems are common among those who work on computers for long hours, while people can become psychologically dependent on computers for social interaction and entertainment. Furthermore, having too much information available on the internet and being able to access it from the comfort of one's home can be distracting and may lead to procrastination, or even worse, addiction.
