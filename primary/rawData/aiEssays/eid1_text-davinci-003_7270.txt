The cyclist knows every turn of the rough road ahead, but his familiarity does not make the journey any easier.

The setting also serves as a metaphor for the cyclist's emotional journey. The vastness of the desert emphasizes the feeling of isolation and loneliness, while the harshness of the landscape reflects the difficulties the cyclist is going through.
