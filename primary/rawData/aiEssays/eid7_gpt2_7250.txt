An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I'd been involved in a car crash. His injuries were such a relief to me Jude wanted to start work in New York. In 2003, when I was 13 years old, I tried to get his car but no one could get in it. I ran over to him and he drove it down the street, only for me to hit him. He died one night. I remember him saying his daughter gave it to him because he was a good parent.

So I started working as a reporter. I have a daughter and a daughter (laughs). One of the questions I ask is if there are any other children who came out from the hospital in the early 60s who were there when this incident occurred. If there have been other kids who had such experiences here and there I would like to know. We have been contacted and interviewed because this isn't something that would happen to us in today's media, that's a small way to reach people but I want to know people have any information that might be helpful. I can use the same technique that you do.

I know people who say something like that. If I say that or ask my granddaughter, I usually get them to say something nice but she would be less likely to want to go through with it again. So I ask my grandma to say, "Hey Jude, if you've got anything to say that would you like us to read?"
