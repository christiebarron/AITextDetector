One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I thought I could feel a deep sense of connection to something. There was a feeling that it meant that it would allow me to continue as I went, that it would show, but also help my feelings of self-worth and integrity."

Lena Simeon, the woman whose father was imprisoned for being a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, said to me, "That's not really the meaning of humor. I am very, very careful with that. It's probably a metaphor for something else I can identify with, like the spirit or the character. It's not something to judge or to judge or look back onâ€”it's just something I've felt for much of my life. I'm very fortunate that those three things that make my heart happy are coming to me in two days."

"I believe that jokes matter a lot more than that."
