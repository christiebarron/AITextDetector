One time I experienced laughter in my life was when we played a movie. There is something about these little things that are really interesting to me, and this movie has something really out of the ordinary about them. That movie could be one of the most interesting and funny movies in my life, and I don't know if it would have had such an impact. It is the kind of thing people can see after having seen it from my office. Sometimes I wonder what has been going on in my life. When I was around two or three months ago I was getting a couple of visits to my sister's house in Las Vegas, and then I went to school in Las Vegas. In her house you have to walk inside a closet but one of the big windows had been broken. What I find funny here is that a lot of people see it. We have a couple of movie nights. They see a movie at her house, a movie in a movie theater. They go there and it kind of fills you with nostalgia, and it's just very good. In that movie there is a lot of action, and then there's a lot of banter. I think they also felt that they could do that with this family with people in such a different age range. The movie is really not that far back. People love the fact that they've heard it in their dreams."
