The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because most readers do not care to read about it. In fact many of these readers find it difficult to understand what this book actually means to them. I have not yet read this book so I don't know if you are one of them—and the last thing my readers will care to do. You may not read this work because it's an action novel, or because it's about the real world or people or the future or anything like that—you may read it because you care about the future. I think we are here to make progress in all three of our lives, and no matter where we write, we write about our own lives—we write about our own families, our own careers, our own jobs, our own health, our own sense of family. One of the best things that happens to a book is that you can write all your life if you really want to, and people always think they can tell you a lot about them. But you don't have to write all your life; this is where you have to talk about what will happen, what your future will look like, what your family life is like. What your life is like, though, is that you must tell your mother and father and brothers and sisters, and maybe your sister too, why they love you, why you love you so deeply. Then you have to tell every single one of them every day about the things that you love.
