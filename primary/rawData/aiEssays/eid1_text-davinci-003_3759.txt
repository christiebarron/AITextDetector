Dear Editor, 

I believe that computers have had a huge impact on people's lives, both in a good way and a bad way. On the one hand, computers are great tools that can help us to become more productive. They help us to organize our data and automate mundane tasks, allowing us to be more efficient and quickly complete tasks that would otherwise take us hours or days.

On the other hand, computers can also be a major distraction. We can get sidetracked browsing the web, playing games, or messaging friends. This can lead to procrastination and a decrease in productivity. It can also lead to health issues such as eyestrain and it can take away valuable time from physical activities. 

To ensure that computers are used in a healthy and balanced manner, I suggest developing a daily or weekly routine. This can help us to establish healthy computer habits and ensure that computer use is moderate and moderated. Furthermore, it's important to ensure that we prioritize our work and other activities, and that we are disciplined enough to stay off the computer when it's time to take a break.

By implementing healthy habits and setting boundaries, I believe that computers can continue to be a great tool for productivity.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
