One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I saw an American man in his mid-forties drive a silver Dodge pickup. It drove past the house and through town and into the hills. We then started laughing about the man. He was a tall and blond man who looked just like a normal American man who came from the United States and lived in a family in Mexico. He walked around like a normal American and was very nice and professional and well-spoken, I am sure to say. There was one instance where he walked straight up and asked me, 'where are we from?' and I was a little annoyed that I said that. I said, the man was a Mexican. The man was very nice and well-spoken. He could just walk up to me, pull me out of the car and say, 'here's my name. This is your name.' I said, 'I don't want to hear that name.' He said, 'don't worry. Don't worry,' I said, 'just tell me what you wanted to hear.' He was a nice little Indian boy and I was so proud of that man who was kind of American and very warm and friendly and polite and kind to the end of the world. And when I finally did see him and saw his face I knew we were in love, we were just happy. It was so nice to see such an old acquaintance. I am sure it was difficult to say the last time I heard this
