I believe that censorship of materials in libraries may well encourage some to come and watch and to be involved with it," said Srinivasan. He said it's not surprising that there are people working inside the library when there is such a large number of those libraries on the main streets.

"Even small businesses, like those of a university, can become a nexus of information-collection for citizens and society. Many are there for a long time," he said.

In the absence of legislation to regulate content, Srinivasan added that there is likely not much of a problem in keeping people involved as libraries open, since the law does not apply to private organizations. The city will also continue to add the library fees to help fund research and training programs.
