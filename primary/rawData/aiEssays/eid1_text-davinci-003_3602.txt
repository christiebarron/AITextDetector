 

I remember the day like it was yesterday. It was one of those days when nothing seemed to be going right. Work was dragging and when I tried to make breakfast, I burnt the toast! I was having a pretty miserable morning. 

I decided to call up one of my best friends to try and lighten the mood. After a few more attempts at conversation, I eventually heard her chuckle. That chuckle soon turned into laughter and it instantly put me in a better mood. We talked some more and soon, we both were having a good laugh together. 

I soon realized that laughter really was the shortest distance between two people. Despite our different lives, our shared laughter was enough to put the day in perspective and bring us closer together. Laughter has that power to bond people no matter their current situations and it made me appreciate my friend even more. Since then, it's been a reminder to laugh more and enjoy life.
