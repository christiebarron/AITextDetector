The memoir “From Home: the Blueprints of Our Lives”, by Narciso Rodriguez, creates a strong sense of nostalgia throughout the book. It dives deep into emotional territory as it recounts Rodriguez’s memories of his mother’s illness, his sister’s death, and his brother’s sudden demise. These events are contrasted with the happier moments from his childhood in the Bronx, creating a varied but cohesive narrative.

The use of language adds to the melancholic tone of the memoir, as Rodriguez describes in colorful detail his memories from the past. The book is peppered with heart-wrenching, emotional passages particularly as he speaks of his mother. Her gentle nature, strength and undying devotion to her family are highlighted through Rodriguez’s words, making the reader ache at the thought of her suffering. In the same way, his fond recollections of his siblings add an air of fondness and longing; this is intensified as the reader is reminded of their eventual departure. However, amidst the tragedy, Rodriguez’s memories of his siblings’ funny stories and his mother’s devotion provide a glimmer of hope in the darkness of unmerited sadness.

The memoir isn’t solely focused on sadness though; it also includes memories of simpler times, where Rodriguez could get lost in the beauty of the Bronx’s vibrant street life. These moments add a sense of brightness and warmth within
