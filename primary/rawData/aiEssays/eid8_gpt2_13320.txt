One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was in college because I thought I was like a "solo singer". That was such a big deal for me because I could do that. Then when I was in high school, I realized that I was singing at a place that didn't have the resources to sustain me. I began to take care of myself. I've learned so much about myself so soon in my life, that now I want nothing more. I want every person I meet to sing with me and that's not something I care about. There's only one person in society that has the ability to play in the community. That person is the music teacher."

This is the part where you can see how the songs are coming to a close. The group "The New School" has been performing with the likes of Nicki Minaj, Madonna, and other big names in recent months. A few of this weekend's special shows, the most recently airing at E!, will be held April 15-16 at the New School Hotel in West Hollywood.

You can RSVP today to be considered for this year's show!
