The Empire State Building was a defining feature of the New York city skyline, and one of its most unique features was the potential for dirigibles to directly dock atop the building. However, when the idea was being formulated and developed, there were several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. According to Marcia Amidon Lüsted in her article, "The Mooring Mast", these obstacles posed the need to address issues regarding the safety of passengers, the structural integrity of the building, and the needs of the public.

Firstly, in terms of safety, the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building posed certain risks due to the fact that the passengers were disembarking high up in the air and into a contained space. The existing technology available at the time did not provide enough protection and security for this to be feasible, so the builders had to develop and implement certain safety standards and precautions, to ensure that passengers disembarked safely. Furthermore, they needed to consider the structural integrity of the building, as the weight of the dirigibles could have a serious effect on the building’s foundations. Therefore, they had to devise ways to make sure the wings of the dirigibles were catered for and secured, as well as the way in which the dirigibles docked as to not cause any damage. 

Additionally, when the building was under construction, the growth of airmail and the flight industry was growing
