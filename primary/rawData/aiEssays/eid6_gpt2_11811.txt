The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, this prevented the aircraft from landing on the roadway, which was normally lined with concrete. Second, the doors were opened without the required opening signal.

The government later decided that it did not have the required open-ended doorsbill to allow dirigibles. The only loophole was in the form of the new airport. Although it could require a full year in construction to open the gates, the government did not have the budget to pay for this expansion.

"The government of China is taking up arms against dirigibles," explained Liang Xiang, an author on the original "Dedicated, Incendiary Airplanes and Air Traffic Control Centers," written by a former China Air Force chief, "because all planes in China could travel at a speed of up to 30 miles per hour with an elevator, and that will cause a severe disruption and destruction of the flight paths and the air corridors of the urban high-rise where the airplane is located."

The most immediate problems were caused by the way in which the United States could use its massive, commercial aircraft in Beijing. China has long struggled with its international air market, and airlines have never been able to fly dirigibles.

Some airlines began using the technology to launch cargo planes at high speeds on Chinese market routes. However, the Chinese military has not been able to buy enough planes to deliver even heavier cargo vehicles
