Dear Editor, 

I'm writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Over the past few decades, computers have become a major source of communication, information, and entertainment, and in the process, have changed the lives of many.

On one hand, computers have enabled us to become more productive, complete tasks faster and access virtually unlimited knowledge. We now have the ability to work from home, collaborate effectively, and complete transactions from anywhere in the world. 

On the other hand, computers have changed how we interact with each other. We spend more time typing than talking, and conversations are often reduced to emails, text messages, and instant messages. As a result, a great many of our relationships have been reduced to online interactions.

I believe that the effects of computers on people are both good and bad. While computers let us stay connected and expand our knowledge, they should not be used as replacements for face-to-face communication. 

We must remember to use technology responsibly, in order to limit the amount of time we spend behind a screen. Being conscious of carefully balancing the time we spend online and in person will help us maintain meaningful relationships.

I encourage you and all of your readers to share my opinion that computers have both a positive and negative effect on people's lives and should be used with caution.

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
