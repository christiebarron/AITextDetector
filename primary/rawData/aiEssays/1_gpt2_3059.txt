We're going to have to put our kids with us. We have got to be the richest children's family in the world. It's going to be harder for them to get by.

And we're going to have to fix it.

There's no reason Trump, his campaign or the Republican Party should be involved in this. That's how this thing went down all along that it's not right for the planet. We have to make that right. That's what Trump wants us to do.
