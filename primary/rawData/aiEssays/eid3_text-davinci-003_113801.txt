The features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski's short story "Rough Road Ahead" heavily impact the cyclist's experience. 

The scenes of the rural Midwest environment bring a sense of dangerous solitude and isolating desolation. The conditions of the road are described with heavy imagery of gravel, flies, potholes, and bent weeds. This presentation of the road and its constant changes creates a feeling of unpredictability, which is further highlighted by the cyclist’s sparse interactions with the local people. 

The physical dangers of the environment are illustrated in the way the twists and turns of the road cause the cyclist to grip the brakes more tightly, and tense up as he navigates the difficult terrain. The cyclist’s inner fears and anxieties are revealed when he is chased by a pack of dogs, which serves as a metaphor for how the physical journey mirrors and intensifies the emotional and mental one. 

The road itself is seen as a challenge that the cyclist must overcome, and his determination to push through despite its challenges is reflective of his will to power through his emotional struggles. The physical journey of the cyclist is filled with danger, and as he encounters a number of obstacles and set-backs, he is forced to confront himself and his own personal issues. The features of the setting in "Rough Road Ahead" constructs a powerful allegory for the struggles of life.
