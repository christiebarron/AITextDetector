The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it gives us a sense of our past. We see that there is little we know about what happened, and we learn it slowly. We make new discoveries. And we keep doing the same things over and over again.okingly

We are in a completely different world from what you'd expect from two years ago. We're no longer able to sit idle. We're not only able to write, but to be creative. It's a real sense of freedom. You can talk to your friends and see what they want to know. You can make stuff up. You can make things happen. You can think about how crazy things could be. You can imagine how things would be if we just kept doing them, just like we were doing Christmas pastimes.

I think the story is about growing up in a world where most of us have become totally numb to life, and when we grew up we didn't realize it at first. We didn't really see it in thosecotter moments. You're just sitting there in the backseat, and nothing happens. It is like you're sitting in the back of your car when your mind is completely blank. It is like the back seat of someone's car. And it's an illusion. You didn't see that because it didn't affect you. It was just something that you had. Which would make most people feel sad and miserable.
