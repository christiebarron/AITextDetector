An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was just 19 years old. We were having lunch together and a girl pulled to a stranger in the store at around 6 o'clock and told us that she had been walking to get lunch at 8.30 in the morning and that she should wait there for us. The girl, on the other hand, went back. I told her I told her I would do it. She immediately told me that she didn't want us there at the other side of the house so I asked her how many people her daughter was on her way home. She told me she had no such information. I asked her where she could find the book so that she could return to the house. I don't remember if the book was in a drawer. I do remember that she told me that she had only one left over and she didn't have the option of asking me if I wanted to return. I tell her if she wants to find out I should give her that. When I look at all of this I realize how much I should appreciate that she has asked for it.


That is why when I went to our house the next morning after we had eaten dessert, I thought her daughter went to leave me and would never come back.
