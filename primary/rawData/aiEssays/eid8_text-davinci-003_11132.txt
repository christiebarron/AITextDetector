I remember when I first met my husband – it was love at first laugh. His infectious chuckle caught me off guard, and I couldn't help but join in with a giggle of my own.

I quickly realized that laughter was a common language we both shared – one that transcended age, gender, race and language. We laughed at the slightest of jokes, from the mundane to the ridiculous. We found a way to share a lot of joy, without saying a word.

Laughter helped us get through some of the toughest times together too. When faced with a setback or an argument, we'd turn to a funny story or memory and laugh it off. One time, when I was feeling overwhelmed and down about something, my husband told me the most outrageous story that made me break into a fit of laughter. It was a reminder that I could always count on him to make me laugh no matter the circumstance.

Thanks to laughter, I've learned to see things from different angles, especially when things get tough. Laughter has been a key ingredient in our relationship – it's helped us stay close and form an even stronger bond.
