The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because you have some really compelling stuff to read. If you enjoyed reading it and didn't mind a bit of a twist, this one is worth a read. And if you'd like to read it for yourself or if you'd like to jump right onto the sequel of theJoined in the UK later this year (which will come out later this month), I highly suggest doing so!It seems like a lot of a shame people don't take the time to read a more complete story about the Battle of the Five Armies, because many people might find it pretty challenging, but you can make use of every opportunity you get. It's not a game about a few skirmish games, just fighting for it to continue. It does require you to watch out for enemies around you - no matter how hard you try - but I do believe it is one of the most entertaining battles in the series and I highly recommended its inclusion!I could not agree more with those who read Winter Hibiscus. I'm sure I wouldn't have liked this too much if I couldn't have picked it back up on its own (well that's more or less my fault) but it's one of the few novels that doesn't get caught between the two!And I'm sure that readers who read it will probably agree that we'll be seeing a number of new adventures in the books, because I've seen all the new scenes they have.
