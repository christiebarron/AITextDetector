The speaker in Winter Hibiscus is a young girl who is affected by the cultural influences of the school she attends. She has been feeling overwhelmed and uncertain throughout the poem; she is preoccupied with the pressure of school and the expectations of others. 

The ending of the poem is hopeful and reflects the perspective of a young person full of optimism for the future. The possibility of the return of the hibiscus and with it, a second chance, suggests a renewal in the face of whatever obstacles the speaker is facing. It reflects her resilience and faith that she can overcome the difficulty. The imagery of springtime and the melting of snow and the return of the geese remind the reader of the natural cycle of renewal and a reminder of the hope for a better future.
