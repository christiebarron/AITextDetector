The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it really was written by a couple who have been reading it long enough that it's hard to get a sense of how far the story goes. It gives the two the necessary answers, but they also lack consistency and consistency in many other areas of the book. I could write a novel about the story and only see it with the eye towards an urban legend, and when the story takes itself to a completely different level (like in The Night That Went Down to the River), it's difficult to get the emotional weight and warmth to support it. At some point in Winter Hibiscus you also learn more about who these real people are, and the people outside their circle are more human or more terrifying or darker and sadistic or just plain terrifying. Winter Hibiscus's pacing would not have made its way through the rest of the book if it didn't have enough content in it, and it still does not make sense. (See here for more on this.)

It's that Winter Hibiscus doesn't have the same core elements of narrative elements as the previous two novels, and I know I do too. I have to agree with myself that I love Winter Hibiscus for the reasons stated above:
