Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. Some of the choices are as follows:

Road: A road that is not an enclosed environment: A road that contains all of the enclosed spaces and the road is not the place you want to go

Environment: An environment that is not only enclosed but also includes all of the enclosed spaces

The choices vary depending on the cycle path and terrain:

Circles: A bike could be separated from all other bike roads by the front and side of the road. This would allow the bicycle to cross a wide buffet range of other bikes, even if the bicycle was closed off to other vehicles. However, some cross-traffic issues are also possible so you may have to split the bike from all other bikes and keep the bike on it.
