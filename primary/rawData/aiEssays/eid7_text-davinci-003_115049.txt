I was volunteering at a local nursing home and I noticed an elderly gentleman who looked as if he needed some help. He seemed to be having trouble with his walker. I offered to help him and he accepted. As we made our way through the halls of the nursing home I could tell he was very unsteady and unsure of himself. 

I could see that he was struggling to stay upright on the walker and his breathing was heavy, but he was determined to make it on his own. The week prior he had promised his wife that he would take a walk around the nursing home and he wanted to make sure he kept his promise. As we were walking, I could sense his determination and strength as he made his way down the hall.

It must have taken us nearly an hour to make it back to his room. Along the way I found myself trying to encourage him, but saying he was doing a good job. During this entire time he was incredibly patient, staying focused on getting back to his room without complaining or feeling frustrated. He was so grateful for the help but was still determined to accomplish this task on his own. 

Seeing this determination and patience made me realize the importance of never giving up, no matter what. Moments like these have taught me the true meaning of what it really means to be patient.
