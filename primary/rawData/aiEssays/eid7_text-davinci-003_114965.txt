I recently had the pleasure of meeting a newlywed couple that had just moved into the neighborhood. While I could tell they were eager and excited to settle in, I knew that would take some time and patience. As I got to know them better, I soon learned that the wife had a very strong work ethic and would leave for the office very early each morning. That left the husband with the daunting task of learning to handle all the day-to-day household chores that had formerly been in the hands of two people, himself and his wife. 

I was impressed to find out that he was taking the challenge in stride and was handling it with remarkable patience. He admitted that some days were more difficult than others but that he was learning how to adjust. One of his biggest adjustments was to not try to do everything at once. He'd tackle one task at a time and if it didn't get completed, he'd simply move to the next task - practicing patience until he could return to the first task and finish it.

His resolve was inspiring. He rarely complained and rose to the challenge with admirable determination and patience. It was a wonderful example that I'm sure his wife deeply appreciated.
