It's funny how laughter can instantly change the atmosphere and bring two people closer together.

I was out on a date the other day with this guy I had just met. We were both a bit awkward and ill at ease, but we barely knew each other, so it was to be expected.

To break the ice we started talking about something trivial, like the weather, but neither of us could keep a straight face for much longer. Before I knew it I had started giggling and he had followed my lead.

That was all it took to break the tension. We both found ourselves laughing uncontrollably, and no matter how hard we tried to stop, we just couldn't.

We talked until the sun began to set. Our laughter had slowly faded away, but the feeling of connection remained. It was a strange and magical feeling, like we had somehow sparked some form of kinship in our short time together. 

I knew at that moment that two people can become close very quickly just by the power of laughter.
