The Empire State Building is one of America’s most iconic skyscrapers, and it earned its place in history in part because it was the first tall building in New York City to successfully allow for dirigible docking. However, the process to get there was filled with obstacles and challenges. As Marcia Amidon Lüsted recounts in her book “The Mooring Mast”, the Empire State Building builders had to think outside the box to be able to accommodate rigid airships.

The first issue the builders came across was structural stability. The building had to be able to support the weight of an airship docking and hold it in place during the mooring process. After months of trial and error, the engineers designed an entirely new mooring system, composed of four masts positioned at the far corners of the roof. These masts provided the necessary support for docking and allowed the airships to be tethered while passengers and cargo disembarked.

The next hurdle the builders faced was obtaining the right kind of materials for the masts. The materials needed for mooring must have the ability to endure wind and weather, and be sturdy enough to stay in place during a mooring. To meet these requirements, they searched for durable materials that could stand up to the extreme elements of the city. In the end, their search led them to steel and aluminummongers, who supplied them with strong, weather-resistant components.
