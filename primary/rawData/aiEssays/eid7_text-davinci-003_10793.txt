 

I remember once when I was invited to my friend's house for a dinner party. When I arrived, I realized that I was the only guest, as everyone else had cancelled at the last minute. My friend apologized for the change in plans, but I assured her that it was ok. Despite the awkwardness, I attempted to make the most of the evening. I stayed for a few hours, having dinner with her and making small talk. Even though it wasn't the most exciting way to spend my Saturday night, I was determined to show her kindness and be patient. After what felt like a long evening, I thanked my friend for the invitation and left for home. 

Looking back, I'm glad that I showed patience and understanding in that situation. Putting in that extra effort meant a lot to my friend and our friendship is stronger for it.
