At the end of Winter Hibiscus, Minfong Ho is using the symbol of the hibiscus to represent that moment of hope and possibility when a situation or situation appears to be trying. The story is about a young girl who feels pressure to perform on a test, and is anxious about it. The hibiscus in the story is a reminder for her that no matter how daunting a challenge may seem, with enough time and perseverance, she will be able to overcome it. By ending the story with the young girl promising to take the test again when the hibiscus is budding in spring, Ho is symbolically reinforcing her message that when faced with any difficulty, hope is always there if you wait and work hard for it.
