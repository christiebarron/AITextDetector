Dear Editor, 

I believe the introduction of computers into our lives has had nothing but positive effects on us as a society. From working remotely to being able to access an infinite amount of knowledge, computers have improved society in ways humans never dreamt of. 

Computers make life much more convenient in ways most people do not think about. Working remotely has become effortless with the advent of computers. People are able to find their ideal career paths and work at their own convenience, and this has allowed more and more people to lead successful lives.

Computers also give us access to an infinite amount of knowledge. We are able to access information from all around the world in just a few clicks of a mouse. This knowledge has opened our eyes to the world and allowed us to expand our horizons. We are able to make connections in ways that would not be possible with physical connections. This has brought us closer together, even if we live miles apart.

The many uses computers have allows us to live successful lives. From communication to work, computers add convenience to life, making it easier to stay connected and informed. I firmly believe this has had immensely positive effects on society and I am convinced that readers of this paper will agree. 

Sincerely, 
[Name]
