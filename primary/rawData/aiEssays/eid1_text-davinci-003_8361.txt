Today I was running late for an appointment, and I knew it. With the traffic being worse than usual, I was stressed out and worried I would be late. However, when I arrived at my appointment, I was relieved when the receptionist welcomed me with a smile. She calmly told me that they were running a few minutes behind, and asked me to have a seat and wait. I was grateful for her patience and understanding, knowing that she could've just told me I was late and asked me to reschedule. Instead, she was understanding and gave me the time I needed to get there. I'm glad I had the patience to get there, because I now have all the tools I need to succeed.
