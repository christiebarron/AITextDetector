Computers have many effects on people. They help us organize, organize the labor, and you change that and that changes you too.

But that's something that's new and interesting. So how do we make sure that that kind of dynamic doesn't manifest as something we just know but is really happening here?

And I think what we did on that, I guess, was to understand the way the population changes. We studied it and we thought, oh man, could you imagine a world where we don't go out that way where these people don't have access to jobs, you know? There are a bunch of people that have no jobs anymore, and they'd have to turn to Amazon or Craigslist or somebody else to bring them all home.

And so these things do occur, of course, in different circumstances with different people, but all to one another, they happen for different reasons. And, for example, in this country, we have a federal law that forbids people from using government property unless that property is yours in certain situations.

In our case, we were able to understand what we said by comparing that scenario to the United States where a lot of people are using the government property. We could argue that that means that the government is not actually trying to prevent this kind of thing from happening. I don't think they have, actually, in fact.
