The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. There were the technical requirements that required building larger aircraft, and there was the issue that such projects were costlyâ€”and required complex engineering to achieve them. In some projects, the only real way to make large planes was to convert them a number of ways.

In the early part of 1940, a new aircraft was purchased from Lockheed. In addition to the aircraft, the F-16 was also replaced by a new fighter. The fighter, which had been on the production line, was called the F-111. The first production aircraft of the original F-111s were produced in 1945, producing 500 and 700 planes per month in the two remaining years. By the end of the Cold War, production alone had almost no means of keeping pace with the F-111, and many were built from scratch under the program's more modest name, the F-16s. All of this left some of the aircraft for the future, but the F-16 is the only F-111 capable of performing much more than that for the United States.

If we imagine the situation of the F-16 today in practice, we see that, as of 1940, the F-16s were able to produce approximately 15,000 planes per year, nearly all of them being F-16s on a production basis. That figure is now about 40,000. The number of F-16s
