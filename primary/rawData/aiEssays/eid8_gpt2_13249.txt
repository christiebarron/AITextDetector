One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I spent nearly 10 hours in a field filled with children and pets. I had to use their noses, ears and teeth to get that out of the way as they could hear us laughing. They would not hear me saying that I knew I was joking, but they would understand I was. My friend did not. Instead they laughed at me, and then they started laughing in my face.

The other important point is that these people never even look at my face, it never reaches mine, except for a brief moment when it does. As a child I would laugh in my face at my father and at my mother trying to get back in touch with me. And it would always have a great effect on my own heart and soul as I did what was appropriate.

I've been told that my mom is insurance fraud, but I am not actually sure why there's this.

Now after writing my book, I have taken a number of things away from it: I have been told about my depression, my experience before I even knew what was going on, and a little bit of writing on an old issue of my blog.
