In Joe Kurmaski’s story, “Rough Road Ahead,” the setting has a great effect on the cyclist. The setting in this story is at an outdoor cycle route and is full of twists and turns, as well as dips and jumps. 

The setting puts the cyclist in a situation that physically tests him in a way that is both exhilarating and intimidating. The bike is able to move quickly due to the dips, bumps, and curves, pushing the cyclist to his limits. The cyclist must be conscious and alert throughout the whole ride, adapting on the fly to the ever-shifting terrain and its unexpected surprises.

The setting also serves as a psychological challenge for the cyclist. As he becomes acquainted with the terrain, the cyclist is forced to confront any lurking fear or doubt at their every turn. Faced with steep inclines, the cyclist must push through any doubt and overcome mental barriers that stand between success and failure. It is this element of the setting that allows the cyclist to grow and develop, pushing them to the next level of their cycling skill.

The setting of this story plays an important role in the development of the cyclist. Through the challenging terrain and psychological obstacle course of the outdoor route, the cyclist is tested and pushed to become better than before. By conquering the physical and mental obstacles, the cyclist will eventually have a newfound trust in himself and his abilities as a cyclist.
