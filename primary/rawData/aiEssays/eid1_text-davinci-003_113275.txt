Dear Editor:

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects of computers on people's day-to-day lives. With the growth of technology, it has become increasingly more apparent that computers have a far-reaching influence on our daily lives.

From a young age, computers are used to sharpen learning skills and develop creativity. In many ways, they have become a great tool for educators as well as students, allowing for more efficient storage of information and endless possibilities for exploration. Computers help students stay organized, and also give them easy access to resources beyond what is available in their local libraries.

On the other hand, though, there is an important need to emphasize moderation when it comes to computer usage. It can be very easy to become addicted to our devices, to the extent that lives become overrun by an undiscerning need to be constantly connected to our computer or the internet. There are physical, mental, and emotional health risks associated with too much computer usage, that ought to be made clear.

In conclusion, I urge readers to be mindful of their relationship with computers. Computers can provide many advantages, but they also have the potential to become a hindrance to our wellbeing and quality of life if not used carefully and responsibly.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
