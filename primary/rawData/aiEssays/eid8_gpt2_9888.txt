One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my therapist was crying, and I kept coming back for more so I started to cry on her face and started to feel anger like I was an idiot and she was trying to beat me around and my voice came away from my mouth. And my therapist was like, you are the perfect person for her, but for you her voice and everything about you that she does it is terrible. I know that I am not the perfect person to be for, there is no better way than by being what I am.

My therapist worked for me for 10 years to prove that I do not need therapy. I could have used that time to let me come out in front of my friends, maybe let them see what I did and what I was talking about and get better at my craft. It isn't like that at all and I don't feel like a therapist if you don't. And I love myself. But there is a disconnect between reality and fantasy, but if you take it beyond what office jobs I did and what I learned I would eventually be able to get through my first career and to achieve my dream.
