Dear Editor,

I'm writing to you today to discuss the powerful and far-reaching effects of computer technology on our society. Over the past few decades, we have witnessed an unprecedented explosion of computer-based technological advancement that has changed the way we live and do business permanently and irrevocably. 

One important consequence of this technological revolution is the way that computers have infiltrated virtually every aspect of our lives. From the workplace to the home, computer technology has been adapted to help people in ways that we could only imagine before. We can use computers to efficiently search and store data, enhance the accuracy of information processing, and make complex computations much easier to understand. 

Moreover, computers also have a tremendous impact on our educational system. Computers offer students an expanded and more efficient way to learn. With the help of computers, the process of research and analysis has been made easier and faster, making it possible for us to access vast libraries of information quickly and conveniently. 

Finally, computers help us communicate with each other in ways that were never before imaginable. From electronic mail to instant messaging, we can now share ideas and information with people around the globe in a matter of seconds.

While computers have certainly had a positive effect on people, it is important to remember that they can also have negative effects as well. People can become addicted to the internet and their computer technology, and this can lead to a number of serious health and social problems
