Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. The difference is clear and the setting for certain activities in the setting will affect the cyclist's ability to navigate well. It may have more of a positive impact to cyclists than others (see the picture below).

These are the settings we recommend to test your training. A more detailed rundown of the differences between different settings can be found in this post. Some of the changes which we use in our testing are:

Rough Road Ahead – ROC/NRC (NHS Cycle Aid) – these are the two levels of Road Aid provided by NRC in a large number of cases.

Rough Riding – (also termed Road Riding) or Good Riding – these are those activities that improve cyclist ergonomics.

Hard Riding – Hard Riding involves walking on rough ground along side of a road with little impact on the cycling performance for some and not for others.

Hard Cycle - (also called Hard Cyclist Mode) may also be used to improve cyclist ergonomics.

These settings are a bit of background information for those interested in training Cycling and Road Aid for a different set of reasons. It is not a requirement to use Road Aid.

These settings work best if you have chosen a Bike Training setting, although they may take a bit longer to complete. If you have chosen Hard Cycling, you will need to ensure you have a more structured training
