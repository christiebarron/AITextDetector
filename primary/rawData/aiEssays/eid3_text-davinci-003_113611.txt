In the short story, "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski, the features of the setting significantly affect the cyclist. Firstly, the rural landscape is a challenge with its varied terrain due to its steep gradients, death-defying ascents and sudden declines. While this rural landscape does offer some picturesque views the cyclist is constantly pushing against the environment to make it to the end of the ride. With every additional hill, the strength of the cyclist is tested. The cyclist also endures humiliation by the presence of the other cyclist in the form of taunts and challenges to try and get ahead. 

The mountainous peaks and treacherous valleys contribute to a difficult physical challenge and also an emotional challenge as the cyclist is put to the test. The cyclist is filled with a sense of accomplishment on conquering the steep hills with each accomplishment fuelling an increased sense of determination and self-confidence. After pushing through the treacherous roads, the cyclist is filled with a sense of satisfaction and achievement with each success being more rewarding. 

The weather also plays a pivotal role in the story. The combination of the hot sun and the cyclist's exertion causes the cyclist to be drenched in sweat. While the heat takes its toll, the fatigue from the long hours of riding is evident in the cyclist's weakened state. The cyclist's journey is further compounded by torrential rain and strong winds as they test the cyclist's ability to handle the elements.
