I had been friends with my best friend, Max, for years now, but for some reason, we never managed to get together for a proper catch-up. We were always so busy with our lives that the idea of hanging out seemed like a distant dream.

But one night, after a long period of no contact, we did manage to finally get together for a drink. We were both so happy to reunite that we couldn't stop laughing. We both had so much to say that none of us could get a whole sentence out without cracking up in laughter.

It felt like this had been a long time coming, and I was relieved to be able to spend some quality time with Max after so long.

We talked about all the things we’d been up to and the places we'd been since the last time we'd seen each other, but the conversation often stopped as we broke out into laughter at something funny we’d said or done. There was something incredibly special and intimate about just spending time together and being able to share laughter. 

We spent the entire evening like that until we had to go our separate ways, full of genuine and precious laughs. We promised that we wouldn't leave it so long next time. 

It was one of those moments that I will always remember fondly whenever I think of my friendship with Max. To me, it was a reminder of how laughter can truly bring two people
