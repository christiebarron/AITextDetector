I remember one time when I had to wait in line for the grocery store for hours. Everyone around me was getting extremely frustrated, but instead of joining in their grumbling, I decided to take a step back and remain patient. I kept a smile on my face and performed breathing exercises to keep my calm. Eventually, the line slowly moved and I was eventually able to check out my groceries and finish my errand.
