The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first was the absence of an elevator and a second obstacle was the lack of any means for them to launch their vehicles. One way or another, the men and women of the Army of the Republic could not do this. The second obstacle was a lack of a bridge between the buildings and how the people lived in them. Once the Empire State Building came out of the Great Depression of the 1930s, the men and women found that they could not bring their vehicles along without assistance from the Government. This led them to find other means to help with the building. In 1933, the Congress of the Republic approved the building of the Empire State Building for the same purpose. This was because the men and women of the Army had given up on living in and were working in the countryside and were ready to find other ways to help the government provide for them at home and abroad.

The new form of building used in the Empire State Building was a tunnel. This structure contained a double-wall of iron in an iron frame. In 1938, the Army of the Republic had started a long and detailed project to build an intermodal subterranean tunnel that would travel underneath the Empire State Building when the first phase of the Empire State Building was completed. The tunnels were built to connect the two structures, and were constructed from solid concrete, which proved to be a very effective construction material, when they were not used
