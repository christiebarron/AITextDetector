The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho serves to reflect upon the themes of perseverance and hope throughout the story. By ending on a hopeful note, the protagonist acknowledges that no matter how hard something may seem, there will always be a time to try again. The contrast between the winter cold and the return of spring provides a metaphor for this idea and also serves to emphasize the power of nature and its ability to heal and inspire. The promise that the protagonist makes to himself to take the test again when the hibiscus blooms is a reminder that no matter how difficult the challenge may be, one must have faith and believe that their efforts will be rewarded.
