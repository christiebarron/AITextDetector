The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it explores the mystery of the first generation of children's literature, and its origins in his family's "lost and forgotten books." A story that starts, "I remember as a child the days when children were given to the boy by the books themselves," is a classic.

At first the book's central theme appeared to be to offer the stories of children who were in trouble. The stories that follow appear in books, as well as in magazines, to teach kids about important topics such as how to stay calm and stay together. However, as this book shows, this book could be very useful to those who want to become more experienced at thinking critically of books and other books in general, just like it does for most.
