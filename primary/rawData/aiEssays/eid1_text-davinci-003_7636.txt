The narrator, a young girl, is reflecting on the idea of the Hibiscus tree, which is seen as a symbol of her resilience in overcoming difficult periods in her life. The line at the end of the poem is a call back to the beginning of the poem, where the narrator is scared of a math test. The narrator is reflecting on the idea that even when she feels like giving up and despairing, just like the Hibiscus tree blooms in the Spring despite winter snows, she will be able to take the test when the time comes. This line is a way of the narrator reassuring herself that even though sometimes life is hard, she can keep going and does not have to give up, just like the Winter Hibiscus blooms in the Spring.
