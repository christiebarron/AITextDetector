At the end of the poem, the speaker is reflecting on a difficult exam and how he was not able to pass it. He then connects this experience to a winter hibiscus plant he is admiring, observing how it will remain dormant during the cold winter months until the warmer springtime returns. The speaker implies that, like the hibiscus, he too will be able to eventually bloom and take the test again in the future when he is better prepared and emotions have calmed. By ending the poem with hope and optimism, the speaker encourages the reader to see the silver lining in any difficult situation.
