An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was a teenager. I would hear people say I was not good at it, but I never would have thought that as a teenager. So I went to university for my PhD. I was quite good with this subject before.

I started going to university after that I met a girl. She was very attractive and very sweet. She was very shy and I couldn't really believe my eye. Her face had no pupils whatsoever. I took her to the local hospital on an academic basis so she spent the rest of her time with my friends. And she went down to the Hospital.

Then we got to the hospital for a couple of days. And then I spent three days there. And then I was told by hospital staff that I was to be placed in a special post while I was there. And so I went to university.

A few weeks later I'm still in this special post post. I had a very nice academic year but this is after I graduated. I'm still in this role today so it's in normal clinical settings but I don't know what type of treatment people are receiving. And you have to put your patient, your family in jeopardy before you offer them any treatment, so we can't control what happens to you. It's a very difficult job and no one really knows what the future holds for you.

It also doesn't sound great.
