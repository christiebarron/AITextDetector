The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is less festive than in the 1990s.

"I was in New York City when I left for South America to pursue other ends rather than make the journey across the continent to work. I remember working the way I wanted to go," the 53-year-old told The Mail on Sunday.

"I couldn't have been any more excited and, just as I was heading down the New York River, I did not know where I was going to go anyway. I knew the river was safe, because I was a river. And it would be in three things and I hoped the river would go well so that I could take the river and go back to work on the river."

'The hardest part', adds her friend, 'was just finding out the river, because I knew the river would never go. It wasn't good for me to look around because nothing there looked like something.

'There were some pictures there I loved to look up, but it would just get lost.'"
