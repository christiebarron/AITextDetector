Narciso Rodriguez’s memoir “From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives” creates a subtle yet powerful mood of both nostalgia and ambivalence. Rodriguez weaves together memories of his childhood in New Jersey as a member of the first generation of an immigrant Cuban family, as well as his experiences as a young fashion designer working in New York City. In the memoir’s introduction, Rodriguez traces his journey from his arrival on American soil to the present day, welcoming readers into a deeply personal narrative that expresses a deep love for the duality of his cultural identity. 

In many ways, Rodriguez’s memoir conveys a powerful sense of nostalgia. He often reflects on the moments of his childhood with a combination of fondness and sorrow, capturing the warmth of familial celebrations and the sense of being embraced by his culture while acknowledging the emotional and economic hardships of his upbringing. As the story progresses, Rodriguez’s accounts of attending elite fashion events and designing his own signature collections of couture clothing also come with a deep appreciation for the lessons learned in his childhood community.

Despite the memoir’s underlying current of nostalgia, Rodriguez’s writing is infused with a sense of ambivalence as well. Along with the tender wistfulness of the past comes a haunting realization of the sharp contrast between his experiences in his small town and the world of luxury and glamour that lies beyond. Rodriguez writes with a refreshingly honest vulnerability
