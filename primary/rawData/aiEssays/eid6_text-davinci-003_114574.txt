The construction of the Empire State Building was an historic feat that helped New York City to become one of the most iconic cities of the United States, however, one of the most interesting elements of the building is the ability to accommodate the docking of dirigibles. This was an ambitious goal that the builders and engineers of the Empire State Building had to overcome a number of technical and structural obstacles in order to make it a reality.

Despite its ambitiousness, the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was not a new concept. Numerous skylines in Europe, including the Eiffel Tower in Paris, had already incorporated mooring masts for the docking of airships. The challenge for New York was to determine how much wind load the building could take and if the mooring mast could be securely attached to the 102-floor structure.

The strongest winds experienced by the Empire State Building had to be taken into consideration to make sure the building could take the additional pressure of the airships. Engineers determined that they needed to construct a mooring mast that was capable of withstanding up to 60mph winds. The plan consisted of providing a body of steel, “tanked” in concrete, with a chrome-nickel steel cable to attach the airship to the mast.

In addition to the structural and engineering challenges, there were also safety considerations that needed to be taken into account. Prior to the installation of
