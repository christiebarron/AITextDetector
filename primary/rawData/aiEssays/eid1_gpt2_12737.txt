Computers have many effects on people. A machine has the ability to generate a pattern. I say: It's a fact that there are computers that do more than create patterns. They are also capable of generating patterns in other ways, as well. What is more interesting is that these "computers" are often "creatures"—a group which is not always the same (though some may be. Some may change). The world of information is very diverse. One of the best uses for this technology is to create patterns. For example, how many different items can you see (like in this picture)? How many different types of colors and patterns can you see (like in this picture)? I think we need tools that are designed to understand patterns so that we can create our own patterns. This can be done by any language, from the simplest examples to the most complexuber to complex algorithms, many of which are based on these new ideas. My first thought was that as soon as a language comes along, the programmers will know what a language is like. This is another reason for programmers to use computers—they make it possible to create tools for people with different interests—to explore them, to find patterns in them and then figure out what is happening in them, and to work more with them about patterns.

A programming language should teach the next generation of programmers how to code with more knowledge, not just the current one.
