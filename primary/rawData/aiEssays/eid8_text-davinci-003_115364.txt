I love being around my parents. They’re always up for a good laugh. Whenever we’re together, it feels like the best kind of therapy. I remember one time in particular when we were all in the living room watching a funny movie. We had been in stitches for well over an hour until my dad stopped abruptly and said, “Hey, what’s that noise coming from outside?” We all tilted our heads towards the window trying to figure out what it was. That’s when the laughter started. Somehow, during the movie, our next-door neighbor had let their pet squirrel out of its cage and it had stumbled upon our porch, trying to find some food. We were all in hysterics at the sight of it, watching it scurry around in confusion. We continued to laugh until our neighbor came to pick it up, only making it funnier. It was one of those moments that none of us will ever forget. Sometimes, laughter really is the best medicine!
