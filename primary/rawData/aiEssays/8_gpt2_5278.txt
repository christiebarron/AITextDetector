One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I heard one girl say about her former boss' girlfriend. I didn't understand it at the time and she tried to explain. It took a lot of convincing. So then I just said, well I really am sorry and I think that really sucks for everyone involved."

"I don't know if that was true or not and I apologize," said Cyrus, of New York and New Jersey. She added: "I think the whole point that I have was to raise awareness and I did. I didn't want to try and have something as stupid as it is or it's all about money. I just thought to myself I was pretty good at making money and I can't believe, but then one day I see the pictures of the video. Those pictures, I guess that's the last I saw of it. So I'm gonna try to make a video about this shortly."

"My main goal was to get people to listen to the video, if you want to read. It's not to harass any other person, just to talk about it," added Cyrus, who began filming in 2007 or later.

In the end, Cyrus made a name for herself. She went on to star in an HBO film starring Tom Hanks and a number of movies. She earned a Grammy-nominated album in 2009 and a 2015 Grammy Award
