The Empire State Building in New York City was built with a special protrusion on its spire that was designed for airships to dock. Despite being a revolutionary architectural feature, the builders of the Empire State Building experienced numerous obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

The first obstacle was the size of the building. At the time of its construction, the Empire State Building was the tallest skyscraper in the world with 102 stories, making it difficult for airships to accurately position themselves for docking. In addition, due to its height, strong winds often created turbulence as airships attempted to maneuver around the building. The strong winds also made it difficult for airships to bring their propellers to a standstill, which is essential for docking.

A further obstacle came in the form of safety concerns. Dirigibles could only dock safely in calm weather conditions, and so a wind speed indicator was built into the building. Faced with the difficulty of accurately measuring wind speed at that height, the builders decided to employ a pyrometer. This sophisticated device included a combustion chamber in which burning fuel created a beam of light that could be used to measure the wind speed.

The last obstacle builders had to overcome was the structure of the airships themselves. Many at the time were much larger than the Empire State Building and were ill-equipped to dock a single building. Special materials had to be employed to handle the weight of the airships as well as the strain of
