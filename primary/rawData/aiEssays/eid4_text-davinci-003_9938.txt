The author ends the poem with this line to emphasize the importance of time in life. It is also symbolic of the cycle of life and renewal which can be seen as the seasons change.

The imagery is also a reminder that, while it may feel like we are facing seemingly insurmountable obstacles now, with patience and hard work, the future can be brighter.
