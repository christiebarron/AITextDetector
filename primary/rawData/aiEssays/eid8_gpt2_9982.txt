One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I watched the New York Knicks lose to the New Orleans Pelicans. I had a little chuckle while I was talking about the game after my wife's phone battery drained.

"We played a crazy game, and the only game I remember that was more important was Game 1. That night, I went to my bedroom and watched the Knicks put together their comeback game, which went horribly wrong. They didn't win it. I don't remember."

The next day, her last night, I tried on the same shirt and went in.

And while my wife's phone still wasn't on, I remembered, it's the same way it was before, when I turned to my brother. He's the third to drive from New Jersey to see the game. He just had a new outfit: a gold button-up.

'The worst moment that ever happened to a Knicks fan: I was driving to Jersey to watch Game 1 with my brother before it happened,' said my family friend, Daniele.

'It was so much fun. I remember this for a whole lifetime.

'I told my family. He said on Twitter he knows and still doesn't want to hear this. But I'll miss this game. I'm hoping the fans remember it.'

Our friend, an Atlanta United assistant, has a similar reaction: 'Why is it important to see Game 1 like this?'
