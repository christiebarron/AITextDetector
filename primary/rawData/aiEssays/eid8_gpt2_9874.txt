One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was younger. So I felt good about it.

"My career didn't even start until the summer of 1983. You would still see the TV. It was only after I started shooting that some people noticed and stopped making jokes about my role. It took six years and a lot of hard work and a bit of sacrifice to make it work.

"I had to pay for my own flights - so I'd end up travelling the country with some of my colleagues at BBC One. They were going through that same period. It's like in the movie ''Paddington'' you have to do that many people for one day and then go home."
