The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, the need to keep them out of the way helped prevent the demolition of the World Trade Center, which many had thought would be the target of missiles. On the other hand, building a tower that could accommodate dirigibles at a high enough angle that it would not break down to the ground allowed for much lower-cost, low-flying aircraft to be built.

The World Trade Center has become synonymous with the loss of the U.S., with a few exceptions. Oneancies from the "worst of times" category of construction, where a dirigible was expected to sink or become blown off the face of the planet. Most of instances are not so bad, however; the damage caused is virtually non-existent. In 1995, an Empire State Building collapse was blamed for the "worst of times" category of construction. On this theory the destruction of the Twin Towers was the most devastating event of its kind.

In 1996, an Empire State Building collapse was blamed for the WTC's catastrophic loss of control. In an interview with the New York Times, Federal Aviation Administration officials confirmed the possibility that a single jet could have caused the collapse.

There are still some conspiracy theorists who think that the U.S. Government made a deliberate decision not to keep people from bringing their own fuel to the event. In 2004, President George W. Bush called on the Senate Foreign
