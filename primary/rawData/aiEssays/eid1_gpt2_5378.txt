The first effects of chemicals are that they can alter the metabolism of certain organisms such as cells, enzymes, and tissues. It is by altering their genetic makeup that they cause diseases and illnesses. It is also by influencing the chemical composition of the cells produced by chemical signals that they can affect the metabolism of certain cells.

Chemicals can alter protein synthesis, metabolism, and cellular functions of certain tissues such as the heart. As a result, certain biological processes are impaired. Those processes can harm our health and impair our ability to function in our winters.

Chemicals may also be the cause of cancer or heart disease. Chemicals that kill cells or cause diseases should not be considered as a cause of cancer. These chemicals are not a cause of cancer as the risk of a cancerous cause can increase after exposure.
