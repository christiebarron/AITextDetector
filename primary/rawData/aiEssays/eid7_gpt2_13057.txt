An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the one I was in with my best friend when she was at the park. I asked her how she was doing. She replied "fine", she's fine". I've read people say that is a good way of giving back and then you just give someone that is in the position of helping and they will thank it. You say to the person, "don't worry dear friend about what you do in my life. Everything is for show. Just do it yourself today". We try to help each other so they can come in and assist. People in my lives have that same feeling. You have to support each other at that stage that just makes sense and when you think for a moment it is because it is for you. You have to take charge and always help others you have care for, if it's a friend, you come with to assist. Your life is good."
