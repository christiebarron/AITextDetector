I believe that censorship of materials in libraries at any level and/or political viewpoints should be subject to the fullest possible control. The State should have no authority to prohibit or restrict speech in places where "freedom of information" and "freedom of assembly" are prohibited under any of the Freedom of Expression Bill provisions.

I believe that freedom of speech should never and will never interfere with the normal rights of the individual to make a lawful contribution to society. No person should have the right or privilege to suppress, block, or censor the free-expression of others.

I also believe that our democratic culture has been corrupted by the efforts of the "media-dominated" media in recent times, which has also created a vacuum for the legitimate democratic freedoms of the free press. Therefore I also believe that our culture may be shaped by different media (eg. cartoons, movies, music, books, magazines) but as long as there's no interference from the "media-dominated" media in our society when there's no expression for any reason, there should never be any limits to freedom of speech.

You have requested a response from the Office of the Press Secretary. At this time, we cannot answer any further questions about whether or not President Bush intends to seek further comment.

This is the response the Attorney General gave to a questionnaire.

Please refer to my response here.
