The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because you lose everything you loved, which should motivate you to spend more time thinking of a good time. You want to get through those life-time-hacks. You want not to worry about what the future holds—we have an important lesson. You don't need the future (in your life) as a present; you don't feel a need to live it—you want the "true" future.

"To get by, you also must face the reality that there is no "true" future for anyone. You have to work the lives of the people who have lost their jobs and their homes, to see the truth in everything, and to take pride in the work that went on.

These are the lives I want to tell my daughters and sons to know."
