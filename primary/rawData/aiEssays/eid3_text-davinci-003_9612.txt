The features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead” significantly affect the cyclist as the journey progresses. The road on which the cyclist travels is unimaginably arduous. Descriptions such as “forty miles of high desert” and “loose rock and jagged stones” hint to the cyclist that the terrain is rough and difficult to traverse. As weariness begins to set in, the cyclist is forced to dig deeper in order to maintain progress.

The cyclist is also confronted with difficult environmental conditions. The road is hot and unforgiving, and the sun providing no reprieve. Biting winds are also present, further pushing the cyclist on his journey. The cyclist becomes depleted of energy as the day progresses because of these conditions, but he pushes on despite his fatigue.

The magnificence of the setting has an effect on the cyclist as well. While the beauty of the surroundings is palpable, it serves to remind the cyclist of how far they have left to go. The awe-inspiring scenes of the western landscape become depressing as the cyclist labors on, forging a path through the emptiness of the journey. 

The cyclist is also met with the fear of the unknown. The unknown creates an element of uneasiness and uncertainty, and the cyclist struggles to remain balanced despite it. The road ahead is not known, and this amplifies the danger that the cyclist could face.
