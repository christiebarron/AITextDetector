The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because by going back to the start of the first book, it introduces us to the story of the hero's rise to political status and has fun with the main characters' respective careers, particularly with Dr. Seuss and her time as a doctor in the Second World War, who are forced to work together in trying to save humanity's future from a fascist invasion of the United States. I've been waiting for the final chapter of Winter Hibiscus (well, Winter Hibiscus, the last few, but I'll be back and update this book when I get it) so, yeah.
