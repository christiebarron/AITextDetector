One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was talking to an Australian photographer about his love of photography and what it means to get out of that world, what it adds to your life as a photographer.

Alyssa's life then exploded after this encounter. I could almost hear her cry through the silence, "This won't be our last day. This isn't our last day. I'll live happily ever after to enjoy my day in a world I never knew I was in".

If you want any more insight on the emotional life of the woman who lost her life at 15, then find out online here.

So much love,
