The other day, I was out grocery shopping with my boyfriend. We had been together for a few months at the time, and though I had already been laughing with him a lot during our dates, there was something different about this moment.

We were shopping for ingredients to make dinner for the evening and all of a sudden we found ourselves both trying to reach for the same box of pasta at the same time. He ended up facing me and our hands were stuck in the same jar, not wanting to let go. We both started to laugh uncontrollably, and it felt like the awkwardness that can come with a new relationship had suddenly disappeared.

We kept laughing until we both had tears in our eyes. Finally, I broke away from the jar, and we both went our separate ways in the store â€“ still chuckling at our little moment. Even though it was such a small moment, it meant a lot to me that we could laugh together and it made our relationship even stronger in the process.
