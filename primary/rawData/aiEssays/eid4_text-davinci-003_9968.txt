Minfong Ho is emphasizing the growth of the winter hibiscus as a metaphor for what Jing is experiencing. During the story, Jing is studying for a test at school and is hoping to do well enough to impress her parents. Just as Jing's hard work and dedication creates a feeling of hope that she will be successful, the winter hibiscus is also an indication that spring will come, and with it, new growth and understanding. The ending of the story is a reminder that just as the winter hibiscus will blossom when spring arrives, so too will Jing gain greater understanding with hard work and dedication, and ultimately, she will take that test again.
