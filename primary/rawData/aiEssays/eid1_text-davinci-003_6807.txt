Every day in libraries across the country librarians are faced with difficult decisions about censorship and the materials on their shelves. On the one hand, libraries should remain a safe and equitable place for everyone and should place limits on certain language and themes. On the other hand, libraries should be a place of free expression where people can find materials on a wide range of ideas. 

The case for censorship in libraries is that certain materials found offensive could be removed. Banning a certain movie, book, or album can limit the exposure of ideas that may be deemed damaging or triggering for some people. This protects library patrons from ideas that they may find offensive. It also allows libraries to set a certain tone and style for all of their users.

However, in the age of the Internet, censorship in libraries can backfire. By removing these items from the shelves, libraries are drawing attention to them and may inadvertently seed support of the offensive material. This can lead to people trying to access the content online or even to the library itself if they feel excluded from the conversation. Furthermore, libraries run the risk of creating second-class citizens by placing restrictions on certain material, which can limit the fundamental right to free expression. 

Overall, libraries should balance protecting library patrons and free expression when considering book censorship. While certain materials may be too extreme or offensive for a particular library, all patrons should be invited to use the library and express themselves freely without judgement or interference.
