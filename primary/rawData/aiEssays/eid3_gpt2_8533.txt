Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. There are a few subtle things like the "Rough Road Ahead", which is a slight change to the road when not in use, that are less noticeable to the general public. But there is a lot more to the setting.

A more interesting feature is the feature map. This is a very straightforward but effective map that helps to give the sense of geographical location before, during and after the setting. The whole setting can be used to find the right place for an entry (such as after the beginning or end of the day), or for the next entry without spending too much time in an outside area.

The maps used throughout this post are also all subject to change. The following map comes courtesy of Iconshop, an awesome website that can make any map great. Use it and share it without ever leaving a comment.
