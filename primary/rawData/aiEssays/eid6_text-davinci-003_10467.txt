The construction of the Empire State Building in the 1930s was an impressive feat of engineering and innovational architecture. At the time, one particularly revolutionary construct that went into the project was the installation of a mooring mast that would allow dirigibles, or large airships, to dock on top of the building with ease. As Marcia Amidon Lüsted, author of "The Mooring Mast" explains, the inclusion of such a mast was an incredibly complicated task, and presented a number of obstacles that had to be overcome.

Firstly, the Empire State Building was the tallest building in the world at the time of its construction, promising spectacular views from the top, and with it came the need for extra reinforcement. The mooring mast alone added over 300 tons of weight to the building, significantly increasing the strain put on its structural stability. To combat this, the designers used a technique called "beneath-the-ground anchoring," introducing twenty-five steel skeins that sunk 500 feet into the ground, significantly widening the foundation to counterbalance the mast. This process not only increased the security of the mooring mast, but also allowed for a much stronger and more reliable connection to the Empire State Building. 

The next obstacle faced by the builders was concerned with designing a mast capable of withstanding the unique weather conditions at the top of the building. As Lüsted explains, it was essential for a design to be created that
