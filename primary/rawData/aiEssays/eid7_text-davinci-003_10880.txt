I was running late for work one morning and was rushing out the door. Just when I thought I had everything, I realized I had left my briefcase at home. Gently reminding myself to stay calm, I took a few deep breaths and slowly drove back home.

When I arrived at my house, I noticed that the front door was open and my dog was running around on the front lawn. With a pounding heart, I raced inside, hoping that nothing had been taken. Thankfully, the house seemed untouched.

I quickly gathered my briefcase and made my way back to the car. As I drove away, I breathed a sigh of relief that nothing had been taken, and reminded myself to remember my belongings next time.

I was proud of how calmly I handled the situation, and the patience I had shown in reacting to it. No matter how chaotic things get, I'm learning to take a deep breath and try to remain level-headed.
