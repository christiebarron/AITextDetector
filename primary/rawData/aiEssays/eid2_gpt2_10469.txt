I believe that censorship of materials in libraries would only be justified when we see people expressing themselves in the public domain. This is not necessary, I believe, because you can freely share the content of your library by all means. The best way to ensure that books are readable is to ensure that people are able to participate in writing and study in a professional setting without fear of censorship. I am of the opinion that this requires some form of special law, particularly under the United Kingdom's own regulations.

[A]t the present time a new "disqus censorship law" has taken the place of one already mentioned by the EU's Ministry of Justice, this one being the UCCL. For two reasons: first, the wording of the law, being ambiguous, has been difficult to interpret, and second, it has caused serious headaches for publishers interested in selling books online. In the beginning the legal regime was clear, requiring that publishers must not censor material in the public domain for any reason. The problem is that under the new law a "public domain" does not exist; it exists for an informational purpose. So, whether it should take a position on the matter is another matter, and it is difficult to judge and define in specific terms. I would not propose to give a specific answer there.

Article 19:

Where there is some suggestion that publishers or developers should take legal action, or will be accused of infringements under Article 19, I also make it clear
