In “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, the setting plays a particularly important role in the story. The cyclist is navigating a dark and broken road, and the shadowy nature of the setting, combined with the lack of any nearby buildings, creates a sense of isolation and suspense, building the tension as the cyclist rides along. The darkness also limits the cyclist's visibility, leaving them with only their bike and their thoughts, making the journey even more inadequate and solitary.

The road itself is not any better for the cyclist, as it is broken and bumpy, making it difficult for the cyclist to maintain a steady speed. This places them at risk of having an accident due to the unstable road surface and the lack of light. Furthermore, because the road is so poorly maintained, the cyclist is not able to anticipate any forthcoming obstacles as they ride, making it more difficult to anticipate and react to any possible dangers ahead.

The lack of other travelers on this road also increases the feeling of isolation experienced by the cyclist, and adds to the feeling of unknown dangers ahead. Without anyone else around, the cyclist can only rely on themselves to make their way through this dangerous journey. 

In summary, the setting in Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead” has immense impact on the cyclist's experience. The darkness and lack of visibility combine with the broken road to create a sense of danger and urgency for the cyclist.
