I was sitting in my living room and my two-year-old daughter was running around with a toy. All of a sudden I heard a loud crash followed by an even louder wail. I got up to investigate and saw that she had managed to knock a vase off of the shelf and it was now in pieces on the ground.

The first thing I did was to take a deep breath and remind myself to be patient. I had to make sure not to get angry or frustrated, even though I knew the vase was expensive and it was my favorite. I knelt down next to her and in a calm, reassuring voice told her that it was ok. I even managed to smile as I explained that accidents happen and that it was no big deal.

I helped her up and moved her away from the broken vase. Then I took a few moments to re-arrange my shelf and sweep up the broken pieces. My daughter watched quietly, wide-eyed, but thankfully not crying anymore. Afterwards, we hugged and she thanked me for being so understanding.

It wasn't always easy to remain patient in the moment, but in the end I'm happy that I did. My daughter learned an important lesson about consequences of actions without me having to resort to yelling or punishing her. Instead, the moment ended on a positive note and she now knows that making mistakes isn't the end of the world.
