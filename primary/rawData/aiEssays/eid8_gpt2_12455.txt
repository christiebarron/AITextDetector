One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I had to find myself being in the chair for this very reason. So, I always tell everyone that they need to learn how to sit, that is a little intimidating at first, you can walk and stand for hours and if you have to stand like that for days in a row, you should probably learn to stand and that's good. But also you're always in the seat, don't think it's okay to look like that. So, even though I said this before when I was learning about how to sit I didn't think there was any kind of limitation â€“ my face, what they saw is all a bit weird, like if I could see my face, and we had to put clothes on for about 20 minutes it might be OK but then my face would hurt and I wouldn't notice it. That was the lesson because on this day, it only has to be a couple of minutes before I feel the pain and then it's okay to let it off.
