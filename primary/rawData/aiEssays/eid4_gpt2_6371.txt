The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because I tried to keep the characters that make up the trilogy into chronological order. The fact is that we've established those series by looking back at five whole seasons to see how they differ over the course of their lives.

If you want to make a list of 10 titles with a five star rating, you have to make a distinction between them. If a three stars review says that I'm not a top 10 book of every series, then that's okay: I'm not like other authors. I'm a well-known author who wrote a six-part series.

My favorite book is the one about an alternate reality known as the Future, the one where people will eventually go extinct without destroying the Universe.

It's also the one about a group of future explorers who will end up fighting each other at the end of a trilogy.
