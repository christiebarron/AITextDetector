Dear Editor,

With the rapid advances in information technology, computers are becoming an increasingly integral part of our daily lives. Computers have impacted almost every aspect of our lives- from the way we communicate, to the work we do, to how we entertain ourselves, and even to how we think. 

There is no denying that computers have revolutionized our lives. They have enabled much of the progress we see today in industry and medicine, improved education, and increased access to information. Computers have greatly increased our efficiency in communication and productivity in the workplace. 

However, with great advantages come great risks. Excessive use of computers can lead to decreased physical health, fatigue, sleep problems, deteriorating eyesight, and general lack of exercise. Prolonged use of computers can also lead to increase stress levels, distraction, and an overall poor work and life balance. 

Although computers have brought about great advances in technology, the effects of computer usage on our physical and mental health should not be underestimated. We should be mindful of the fact that, while computers can help us achieve much, they should not be overused or used at the expense of our social and physical wellbeing. 

Thank you for taking the time to consider my views. 

Sincerely, 

[Name]
