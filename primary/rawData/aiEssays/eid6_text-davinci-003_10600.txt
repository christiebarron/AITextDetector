In the early 1900s, the erection of the Empire State Building introduced an ambitious plan to enable dirigibles to dock on the building’s top. It was the first idea of its kind, yet its success hinged upon an array of costly and complex challenges. Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s ‘The Mooring Mast’ details the triple threat posed by high winds, congested airspace, and inexperience of dirigible pilots that the builders of the Empire State Building needed to overcome if the dirigibles were to be safely maneuvered to the top of the skyscraper.

Firstly, the winds around the Empire State Building posed an obvious obstacle that needed to be tackled. The turbulent air blew far more fiercely at the elevation attained by the Empire State Building than on the surface. To prevent the dirigible being swept away by the winds, it was necessary to attach a mooring mast to the skyscraper and securely attach the dirigible to the mast when it arrived. Whilst more than a thousand tethers were prepared for the mast, the risk couldn’t be completely eliminated.

The airspace above New York City was also a problem that the builders of the Empire State Building had to consider. With the bustling metropolis teeming with air traffic, from military planes to commercial flights, there was concern that dirigible pilots may not be able to safely navigate their way to the Empire State Building.
