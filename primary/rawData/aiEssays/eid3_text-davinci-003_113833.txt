In Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead,” the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a variety of ways. 

The rugged terrain of the mountainside—with its elevation, inclines, rocky trails, and narrow paths—creates a challenge for the cyclist as they work to navigate the route. The cyclists power to overcome the physical barriers of the terrain and push forward is impressive, and another feature that adds to the difficulty of the climb. The long, winding roads and paths force the cyclist to focus on the ride, utilizing their mental savvy and endurance to conquer the slope.

The abundance of green, vibrant plants serves as a visual backdrop, adding a sense of immensity and grandeur to the scene. The greenery also harbors the wildlife and buzzing creatures of nature, which enhances the cyclist’s experience of being on the edge of the wild.
