The idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was a daring innovation that could have made New York City a hotbed of airship activity. However, in the end, the idea proved to be far too ambitious. Various obstacles ultimately prevented the Empire State Building from becoming an airship port.

The first obstacle were the regulations and codes of the Federal Government in place at the time. These regulations had been set forth by the Commerce Department, which sought to protect the safety of the public with regards to airship activity. Due to the potential risk associated with having multiple blimps docking and taking off in close proximity to one another from the Empire State Building, the Commerce Department would not allow these regulations to be breached. Without the ability to get federal approval, the project would never be able to move forward.

In addition to this, there were a number of engineering and safety challenges that had to be faced before construction could start. A dirigible dock would require a significant number of structural supports and anchors to ensure that the airships would remain secure while docked. Additionally, the mast itself would need to be reinforced to be able to withstand the forces and vibration created by the blimps when docking and taking off. These additional engineering requirements would add further to cost and complexity of the project, and would require a great deal of specialized knowledge to ensure that the plans were safe and effective.

Finally, the financial burden of such a project was
