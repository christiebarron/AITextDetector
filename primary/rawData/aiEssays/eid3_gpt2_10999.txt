Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

The cyclist and the car all come up in the same area of the road and each cycle comes close.

And while many roads have lower speeds, others tend to have a much smoother ride and therefore, the cyclist gets a longer range.

So is it possible to hit an unbalanced cyclist in the head?

You definitely can and it could be that the cyclist can't hit the car and vice versa.

However, for certain situations, there may be a need for both, to the driver's advantage - to get there the cyclist will need to be able to make use of all the other options so that they can safely cross the road when they come across 'Rough Road'.

In the case of a crash the bicycle can 'cross' at speeds that would normally be close to 0km/h if it was in the straight at that point, but could take some of the benefit (if any) from the speed that the car was.

The car needs to make use of several possible choices on how to move its wheels - with each of these available options it may want to decide before heading too far to keep it safe.

The driver of another vehicle, the driver of a light car, or both of them can't all enjoy this and in particular, there's no evidence that it's safer to speed at a slightly higher height
