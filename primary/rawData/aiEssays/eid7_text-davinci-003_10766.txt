I was standing in line at the post office trying to send a package off to a family member. The line was slowly moving, and I could feel myself start to get impatient. I noticed the person in front of me was an elderly woman who was struggling to write her address on the package. I could tell she was having trouble because her writing was very unclear, and the postal worker was having difficulty understanding her.

I felt my patience slipping, but then I noticed that the postal worker was being very patient with the elderly woman. He remained friendly and spoke to her in a very understanding manner, helping her as best as he could with the address.

This inspired me to remain patient, so I took a few deep breaths and waited in line. The postal worker eventually managed to help the woman mail her package and the line started to move forward again.

I was very grateful to the postal worker for being patient with the elderly woman and it reminded me that sometimes, itâ€™s worth taking the time to be understanding and tolerant towards others.
