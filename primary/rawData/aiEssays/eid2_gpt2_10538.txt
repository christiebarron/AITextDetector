The ACLU was among those who said Monday that the government's actions under the "right to information" doctrine are unconstitutional.

Senate Majority Leader Richard Pan (R-Richland, Calif.), D-San Joaquin, has been pushing for a constitutional amendment that would block the government from barring websites that collect government data such as e-mails or GPS locations.

Block did not respond to requests for comment Tuesday.

On Sunday, a California Superior Court judge overruled some of Block's efforts, granting an order blocking Google from blocking some web search "pics" at the time Google was first reported to be involved in a case challenging the constitutionality of such a measure
