In Joe Kurmaski's short story "Rough Road Ahead," the cyclist must face the challenging physical conditions of his environment that pose potential risks to his safety. The features of the setting play an integral role in the protagonist's journey and his ultimate fate.

The protagonist is initially described as being in "very strange and unfamiliar terrain." This speaks to the idea that the cyclist is deliberately pushing his boundaries to take on more extreme roads and potentially increase the risks given the limited knowledge of what lies ahead. This sense of uncertainty and risk lend to a certain level of vulnerability that cannot be overlooked. Such dangers may include poor road conditions, wildlife, exposure to the elements, or even mechanical failures due to the prolonged rugged terrain.

The unforgiving nature of the environment is further reflected in the extreme weather conditions faced by the cyclist. With temperatures reaching “freezing in the winter,” the cyclist must dig deep in order to keep moving forward and stay safe. Additionally, intense downpours of rain and heavy snow further illustrate the unpredictable challenges that may stand in the way of completing the journey.

The setting of the story captures the essence of challenge and hardship that is often associated with long-distance cycling. By having to battle a variety of forces, both natural and man-made, the protagonist is faced with difficult obstacles that lend insight into the strength of his character and his drive to succeed.
