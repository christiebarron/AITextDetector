The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because of the way it has managed to connect with those who are most affected by winter events. Winter Hibiscus is full of hope, but it feels more vulnerable than its predecessor. I love the hope for theptr, especially the "what ifâ€¦" part, but this book will also open me up to this story-line it takes place in, which is very interesting as the ending of Winter Hibiscus means I just can't do anything about our heroes. And at the very, very end of Winter Hibiscus, the protagonist is suddenly revealed to have been the main character. As a result of this new twist, it was hard for me to get used to the ending of Winter Hibiscus as it only really brought out some of the more sadistic aspects of the first half of the book. It was the one moment at which all of the other books made me feel very sad.The plot and characters are all fascinating, but they are all poorly placed at the beginning. This isn't bad stuff. It's a very simple, well paced and interesting story in the final half of the book. Winter Hibiscus is a very difficult book to follow, and it just doesn't work. There are lots of spoilers and it's only good to have an excuse to get started and learn more.I hope you enjoyed it! If you have any questions, leave me a comment.
