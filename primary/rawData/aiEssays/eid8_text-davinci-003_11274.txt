I was at an outdoor dinner party with my closest friends when I suddenly heard a loud laugh from one end of the table. I looked over and noticed my friend Sophia holding her stomach, laughing uncontrollably. It turns out she had dropped her fork and it had landed in her lap while she was talking. We all started laughing at the silly situation and it was one of those laughs that just seemed to go on forever. All of us tried to compose ourselves but it was nearly impossible! We were laughing so hard we were crying. 

The whole dinner party was full of joy and it was nice to make memories with good friends. That day, I learned that laughter really is the best medicine. In that moment, all of our worries melted away and were replaced with laughter and pure joy. We were all happy to have experienced that moment together, and even now, when I think back on it I canâ€™t help but smile.
