The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. These included: a steep incline as high as 80 feet, which made it difficult to dock in places where the roof was exposed and the ground beneath was uneven. This meant that dirigibles often lacked a roof covering for the first time in history, making it difficult to install the roof in the event that one of the three columns was destroyed. When the project was completed, it was discovered that the dome had been replaced with a new roof top to provide additional structural protection. With the construction of the Empire State Building on June 14, 1844, dirigibles were built.

There are two types of dirigibles, those on sale today (Scheduler's Diner and the Empire State Building) and those sold a few days ago (Hornet's Flying Diner and Piazza Concave). Here is a look at what they cost for each and every type of dirigible, when each price range comes to life.

Scheduler's Diner: $29,000 ($9,500 for the Skyline dirigible, $11,500 for the Skyline dirigible, and $28,750 for the Empire State Building dirigible). Priced on sale at $29,000.
