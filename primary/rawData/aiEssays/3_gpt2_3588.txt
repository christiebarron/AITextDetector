Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. It creates a space inside the track where you can look out and around and change your route to avoid being involved in the collision.

If the setting is a set of wheels with the corresponding amount of traction, you will notice on the front wheels the car tends to get more traction, hence putting the brakes less, thus turning you off.

However, if you have a set of wheels or tyres (also known as "soft"), you will notice the car starts to brake more, so to maintain braking power you must increase the number of wheels, tyres, or soft tyres, to balance the tyres on top of them.

When braking oversteer, you will experience a bump that is more noticeable, so you must increase the amount of the soft tyre, so that the impact on the road surfaces gives you a bigger bump.

The car should turn faster and stop slightly at a time so that it doesn't impact you.

The 'Tire Weight' may be the biggest factor in causing crashes â€“ the weight of the road, the amount of traction they produce, how much traction them generate and how fast and short the wheels.

In contrast, when braking oversteer, your tyres (and even the soft tyres) are quite fast too and the bumps that can occur cause you the most crashes.

This affects the amount of traction you experience when
