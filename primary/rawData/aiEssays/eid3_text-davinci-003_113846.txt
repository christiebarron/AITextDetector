The first feature of the setting is the presence of a steep and unforgiving hill, which is described as “a wall” that was too much for the cyclist to contend with. This steep hill serves as an obstacle for the cyclist, a physical impediment that they must try to overcome. It also serves to symbolize the difficulty of the journey, and the struggle that is inherent in life. The landscape also includes a “ribbon of road” with a path leading to the cyclist’s destination. This road serves as a symbol of the journey, and it provides the cyclist with a sense of hope. The road also symbolizes the hard work and dedication required to succeed.
