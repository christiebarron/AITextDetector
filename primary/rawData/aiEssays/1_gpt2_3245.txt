One of the most successful trends of our time is the use of artificial intelligence—a phenomenon which has caused great success in all areas of life—OLD and HARD.

Many of the problems I am about to address in this article are simply out of our control and are so large that we may not be able to bring them to an adequate resolution. I will provide some examples of work that I can work on to illustrate. For example, one of the most notable examples of working on a new project in computing is a
