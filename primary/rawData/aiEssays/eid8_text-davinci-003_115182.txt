I remember the first time I saw him, and how we both just started laughing. We had met at a mutual friend’s gathering when I tripped and almost fell on my face. He caught me in time, but I was so embarrassed that I kept my head down and started murmuring apologies.

But he just started chuckling, and it was contagious. Before I knew it I was joining in witrh his laughter, shyly at first. He was smiling, and I couldn’t help but feel that I was blushing. It was a truly magical moment, that made me feel so light and free.

We talked later that day, and the laughter didn’t stop. We talked for hours about anything and everything, sharing about our lives and the funny stories that came with them. We both kept laughing and somehow, I knew then that this was the start of something special.

Laughter has been such a wonderful part of our relationship. We’re both willing to be open and goofy with each other, to express our feelings through laughter and to bring joy to each other’s day. We understand that laughter can bring us closer together and help us appreciate each other’s company in a much more meaningful and lasting way.
