The idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building - a prominent and iconic New York skyscraper - was met with considerable obstacles. From the time the Empire State Building was first constructed in 1931, the plan to accommodate dirigibles frequently encountered pressing logistical and safety issues. 

The plan for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building required the building to be equipped with a mooring mast - an 18-story steel spire to which dirigibles could attach. This was an innovative idea as there were only a few other mooring masts ever constructed. The challenges the builders of the Empire State Building faced in completing its mooring mast were formidable. With a need for precision and exact measurements, building the mast was incredibly intricate. Further, the obstacle of having short-lived dirigible supplies posed difficult to handle, due to the cost effectiveness of the materials required for the project. Additionally, as dirigibles themselves were incredibly volatile – and could easily be set ablaze without warning – the task of providing adequate safety measures to the public was paramount.

Fortunately, the builders of the Empire State Building persevered. The mooring mast, equipped with a unique lighting system and an emergency system of anchors, was completed in 1931 and successfully linked to the aircraft’s airframe with gas hoses, allowing dirigibles to dock. The mast, though, was never put to use, as dirigibles
