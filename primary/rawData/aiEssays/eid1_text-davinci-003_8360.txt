I remember a time when my young son had an epic meltdown in the middle of a store. We had just started shopping for groceries and he wanted a toy that he saw in the store. After I explained to him that we couldn't buy it he completely lost it. He was screaming at the top of his lungs and throwing a fit.

At first, I was embarrassed and frustrated. I wanted to just rush out of the store and put an end to it. But then I remembered what my mother always told me: always be patient. So, I took a deep breath and got down to my son's level. I looked him in the eyes and told him that I understood he was upset but that we couldn't buy the toy right now.

With a calming voice, I encouraged him to take a few deep breaths and talked about the plan for the rest of the day. Eventually, he calmed down and apologized for his outburst.

I was so proud of myself for staying patient in the moment. It took a few moments of panic before I remembered to take a step back and take a breath. My patience ended up steering us through the situation and we were able to go on with the day, happier and calmer.
