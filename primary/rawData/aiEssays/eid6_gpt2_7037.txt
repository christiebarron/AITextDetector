The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The original design required a series of two-way doors in each room of the building, which were required to keep the traffic level from rising.

The state building was built in 1902 and was later changed into a State Building. It was removed from the building in 1989, although the state building is still used today.
