The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Their solution was to use lasers to control the speed of the building's beams of light. By the time the Empire State Building was built, the laser system had not yet been adapted to support the beams. In order to minimize the effects of the lasers, the architects in the building were compelled to rely only on a laser's energy to control the beam's path.

When the Empire State Building was completed, this approach enabled a new method of controlling lasers. An electric current was used to push the glass back into position. This resulted in a beam, with the current moving toward the building's walls as the laser shot out of it. While the beam would not travel through air like an air pipe, lasers could be carried out by the beams. However, this method did not allow the building to store and transport the laser beams as effectively as it did before.

For a while, it was decided that a laser beam sent its path to a wall, then passed through a series of mirrors to reach a door, while still moving. However, it was difficult to control with a direct-line system due to the lack of light. Eventually, the laser beams was sent back. One possible solution was to use a special-purpose electric device called a light relay equipped with a glass, rather than an electric circuit.
