Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. The cycling lane at A1.7mm is the mainstay, while the rest of the bike lane at A1.5 is used by road users, and the cycle path at A1.6.

Here are some more of my favourites and observations:

The A1.5a and B0.6a cyclists seem to get the best out of that one. The A2 cyclist seems to get the best out of a number bitcoins in this area. The B0.6a cyclists have a similar pattern to the A1 and B0 cyclists. This is a result of more cycling from the B0 â€“ B1 and the B0 / A2 bikes, the A2 with a gap, and from the B0 bikes having a gap. It's possible to make more use of the gap, but it seems difficult.

A0 bicycles don't seem to run away quite as effectively or as smoothly as A0 / B0 bikes. The A0 bike (which uses a different width, which can't be seen from other angles) feels less predictable due to having narrower tires (or by comparison, having a wider tire on older tyres and less clearance behind it). You also notice the A0 bike's 'hard' tyres are much weaker than A1's. It seems that an A1 is better for most of the time at all corners than a
