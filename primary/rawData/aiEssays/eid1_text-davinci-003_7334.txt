The features of the setting play an integral role in establishing the story’s theme of perseverance and determination. From the very beginning, the cyclist endures a rural landscape with a grueling terrain. The cyclist has to travel over mountainous terrain and rugged paths, where their bike tires become stuck in the mud with rocks and tree limbs that create obstacles. The cyclist also has to cross numerous creeks and rivers, and face the wildness of the dense forest. With no other land routes to take, the cyclist must think quickly and carefully when confronted with unexpected issues that arise.

The geographical features of the setting only provide additional challenges to the cyclist’s journey.
