I’ll never forget the first time I met the love of my life. We had decided to meet at a little café just off the main street. I was nervous, excited, and trying to figure out what to say, when suddenly he began to make funny faces at me from behind his menu. I couldn’t help it, I burst out laughing. He had made me laugh when I least expected it and in that moment, I knew that he was the one.

The laughter continued for the rest of our date. He’d make silly jokes and we’d tease each other about nonsensical things. Somehow we managed to connect on a level that I had never experienced before. We shared the same sense of humor and it was like we were already a team.

That’s when I realized that laughter really was the shortest distance between two people. Sure, communication is important, but laughter is what really brought us together and continues to be the glue of our relationship today.
