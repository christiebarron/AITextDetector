The setting of Joe Kurmaski’s poem, “Rough Road Ahead,” plays a significant role in the poem’s interpretation. The setting is described as a long stretch of “rugged terrain” with “rocks, trees, roots and ruts.” These features of the setting make the road particularly dangerous and challenging for the cyclist.

The cyclist’s experience on this road is characterized as a physical and emotional battle. The cyclist is exhausted both mentally and physically. The “rugged terrain” and the “ rocks, trees, roots and ruts” of the road create a struggle for the cyclist as he is forced to navigate the treacherous road.

The cyclist is constantly aware of the environmental obstacles that he must overcome in order to reach his destination. The lack of a steady bike path is a difficult hurdle as the cyclist must messure up each and every obstacle in order to determine the best route to take. This requires the cyclist to be constantly aware of his physical surroundings and always alert to the potential dangers ahead.

The obstacles presented in the setting also affect the cyclist emotionally. The poem begins and ends with the phrase “Rough road ahead,” emphasizing the fact that the cyclist knows the journey is not going to be easy. As he attempts to finish his journey, the cyclist is met with an increasing sense of dread as he realizes how difficult the terrain is.
