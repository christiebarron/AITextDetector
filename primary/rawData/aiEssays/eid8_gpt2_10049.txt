One time I experienced laughter in my life was when a man I loved came to see me and begged me to marry again. But I decided that I hated him and he would never come back since I didn't want to be a wife anymore.

You're right. People die and there are probably some people who will do it. Maybe you're right, and maybe not. But the truth is, if you don't live like these people, you can probably do better than these stories. I thought a lot of people did it because some people told them that if they just keep living, others can never do it, and most of them didn't feel guilty at all about giving up their life so many years (maybe even five) ago. So in a nutshell, people don't want to kill each other and so I thought this might work. I would say a lot of the people who were sadder than I am probably just too drunk to die, and it's probably because they thought that people aren't good enough or they want to be a different kind of person. I think someone who has died and lived for many years will see how far along there are people in the world and say "Hey I'd really love to be as good as you are. I can live for a long time so I might be like [my brother] and you have to live forever so maybe there'll be something great to think about. But, I don't know. I'm not sure
