I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is necessary, in the view of those calling for it, but I personally did not believe that these were censorship for the purposes of public libraries," she said.

The move by the Public Library to keep information about the state books available to students in public libraries is in line with what they have said are basic guidelines the state should follow to protect its own books.

In 2004 after many years of legal battles, state and federal judges in the lower courts and Supreme Court refused to block all books from being available under the state's Book Act, which began in 1999.

In 2000, the state's law finally became law, banning bookstores from selling books that contain nudity from schools.

But the New York University Law School professor and the Library Association of New York President John Oates said he was concerned about having to make this decision.
