Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

Calls to help cyclists on rough roads or to the local police are all a matter of emergency.

Many people will use the road to walk, jog, or cycle to make a safe or comfortable life-time.

However, there should not be any rush on one of the roads.

There should be enough time for the city to respond.

The roads around the site can, with a little luck, be made safer for the cyclist by using pavement markings designed to encourage people to use the roads to get on.
