The Empire State Building was designed to be a premier destination and one of the most iconic projects of the 20th century. The buildingâ€™s height made it an ideal location for passengers of dirigibles to dock and begin their journey around the world. However, this goal presented numerous obstacles to the builders.

Firstly, the architects had to make sure that the building could safely withstand the gusting winds that often occur at high altitudes. This requirement was addressed by selecting a design that featured a streamlined steel frame, wide-flange steel girders, and metal rods. The Empire State Building was tested to ensure that it could withstand gusts of up to 125 miles per hour. This allowed the building to remain secure against the wind forces generated by the dirigibles.

Additionally, the architects had to find a way to equip the building with a docking port for the dirigibles. To meet this goal, the engineers included a mast that extended 700 feet above the building. This structure, called the mooring mast, was designed to restrain and secure the dirigibles as they docked. The mast featured powerful cables that interfaced with the airships, and a protective cage that surrounded the dirigibles to prevent them from being damaged as they were hoisted.

Finally, the engineers faced the challenge of devising a way to allow passengers to disembark the dirigibles. To make this process smooth and efficient, engineers designed a French window
