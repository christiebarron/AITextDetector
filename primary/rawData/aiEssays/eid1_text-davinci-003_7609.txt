The poem's narrator, a student of Chinese ancestry, is reflecting on her experience taking standardized tests. She reflects on the 'Winter Hibiscus' plant she sees blooming through the window and the resilience of the plant versus her own struggle to pass the test. By ending the poem with a visualization of the snows melting and the Hibiscus returning in the spring, the narrator is expressing a sense of hope, resilience and determination to try again in the face of adversity. The metaphor of the Hibiscus is used to depict her own inner strength and perseverance, and the image of the plant returning in the spring serves as a prominent reminder that, no matter how many times she fails, she can always try again.
