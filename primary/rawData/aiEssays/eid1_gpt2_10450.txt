Computers have many effects on people. One of your own thoughts is why you're writing in the first place?

I think I write as much on the computer side as I can. In some ways, writing my script isn't as important as the script itself. So I look for things that give me an idea, but you can try to solve the problem (and I think that's what my most common role is) as a reader. When you're making a call to a meeting, it's important to let that person know by asking if he can do something and maybe what, if anything, you can do on a day-to-day basis or in short, by giving him some ideas and trying to make sure he's ready for it. You can't just start off with "no idea what..." and make those statements every day as if they were written by you. There's something to be said for that. As far as learning or improvising, it's hard to make such a statement. It's kind of like a puzzle that a person has drawn yourself, and your solution looks like it came from this. You're also going to get frustrated and go, "This is so stupid that it's hard to understand what I'm seeing."

We'll see in a bit, maybe we'll eventually get to a point where you start to recognize how different the language is from your own. Maybe your whole idea is to try to do something useful and interesting
