The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it gives him a different perspective on a subject that he has been avoiding.

It is a dark and haunting tale of a girl who lives alone, but who, on an expedition, finds the strength to find her true side in the night. When her lover, a young girl named Sia, begins to suspect that she is possessed by strange forces, Winter is determined to set the record straight: she must never take her life in vain, and will livechery never again shall be tolerated, and she must keep her distance from all but the best of her creatures.
