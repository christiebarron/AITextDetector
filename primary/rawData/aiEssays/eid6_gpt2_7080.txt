The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The building used the last century-old technique of separating off a tower's roof, which gives it stability. But with new roofs and new floors, the roofs and sides of the Empire State Building were now designed with maximum stability. From this point on, the builders were forced to make some changes in their construction style. The first was the design of the main building—the two towers, the former being used to house the second—which was built in 1890 and the latter in 1912.

Another design change was the addition of columns in the tower to make the base tower easier to stand on. At the time, the first building had a roof that was covered with thick curtains that were much too heavy for the eye. That changed, however, as the towers became bigger and more extensive. The added columns could be replaced using wood, making the base tower more stable. This was what led to the early and spectacular views from the towers.

More recent models include the Millennium Tower, located in London's North Kensington, and the Empire State Apartments at the London Eye.
