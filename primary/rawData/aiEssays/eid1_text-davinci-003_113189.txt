To The Editor,

As a resident of [YOUR COMMUNITY], I have noticed a marked increase in the dependency on technology in our lives. Computers have revolutionized how we live, work, and communicate, but the effects of their presence can be both beneficial and detrimental.

On the one hand, computers have undeniably opened up many doors. We can access vast amounts of information, make global connections, and navigate new items with ease. We are more educated, connected, and have more information at our fingertips than ever before.

On the other hand, computers can have their downsides. Many people have become so dependent on these devices that they forget how to live without them, hindering their ability to interact with people in real life. Additionally, computer the use can have undesirable effects such as stifling creativity and critical thinking skills, leading to short attention spans due to a reliance on instant gratification.

In my opinion, computers have been a net positive in terms of how we live our lives. We can continue to benefit from their uses if we practice responsible use and set boundaries. I encourage all readers to embrace the advantages of computer technology but be aware of the potential drawbacks that come with their use.

Sincerely, 

[YOUR NAME]
