In addition, about 13 percent of the passengers seated on the first-floor balcony (or three-quarters of the total) were under the age of five years, while 18 percent were younger than five, in a pattern that persisted even though more than two-thirds of them had never been passengers. SafetyNet found:

Most people took the opportunity to stay in the lower levels of their homes; more people in their bedrooms, than in the basement, did so (Figure 5.2).
