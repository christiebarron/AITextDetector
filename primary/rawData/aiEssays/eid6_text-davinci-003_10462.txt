The Empire State Building was one of the most iconic structures of the early 20th century, and the architects wanted to make sure it was fully equipped for the ever-evolving future. To that end, the architects of the Empire State Building planned to build the worldâ€™s first mooring mast--a space for dirigibles to dock--on the 80th floor of the building. Initially, this seemed like it would be a straightforward process, until a number of unexpected obstacles began to present themselves.

The first obstacle was the limited vertical space on the building. In contrast to a traditional landing strip, the mooring mast was intended to create a limited airspace within the confines of the building, which inherently limited the size of the dirigibles that could dock there. The engineers estimated that the mast had to be tall enough to allow for the dirigible to descend safely, but not so tall that it would impede the structural integrity of the building. 

The second obstacle was the lack of modern technology available at the time. When designing the mast, the engineers had to take into account the available technology to make sure the mast could adequately support a full-size dirigible. This was no easy task given the technologies of the time. In addition to the obvious challenge of ensuring that the mast was strong enough to support a full-size dirigible, the engineers had to account for the fact that the existing technology would make the mooring mast more difficult
