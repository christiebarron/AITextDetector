One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was in preschool when I was in the year 12 for my sixth year at the University of North Carolina. They're good kids, and my parents say it was like "Oh please, don't shoot him." But every time I hear my mom say a joke, it does go viral."


Ruth is just an innocent girl who wants to make people happy, but it is one that she refuses to do in public.


"It isn't about being happy, it's about being proud. You just think, 'I have this beautiful gift for one day I can do something to it, so I'm going to go have it with this beautiful person. And this beautiful person I've been having a hand in for 30 years and I feel like this gift is doing so much for me.'"


She told me this was the only thing that she wanted to do, and she made the decision herself.


"When Ingredients is coming out to her kids in September, I want to be here and they can play with these toys and be great again."
