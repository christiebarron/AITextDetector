I was out for dinner with my best friend when all of a sudden he burst out laughing. I wasn’t sure why he was laughing. I asked him what was going on and he said that he had just remembered something funny that had happened to him earlier. 

Then I started to laugh too, and we couldn’t stop. We kept looking at each other and then laughing more. The food arrived but we barely touched it – we were still laughing too hard.

Eventually we calmed down but every so often one of us would just start laughing again, and then the other would join in. We ended up spending far longer at the restaurant but it was totally worth it – it was so nice to laugh like that together.

That was one of the best nights I’ve ever had with my best friend, and even just thinking of it now brings a smile to my face. Laughter truly is the best medicine and it’s one of the best things to have in any relationship.
