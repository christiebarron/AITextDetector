In this day and age of readily accessible information, censorship in libraries has become a hotly debated topic. While it is true that certain books, music, movies, and magazines may be deemed offensive by some, it is important to note that censoring these materials is a form of intellectual repression. As such, it should not be carried out in any of our nation's libraries.

It is not the responsibility of libraries to impose moral judgments upon library users. Generally speaking, library collections include books, music, movies, and magazines that represent a wide range of viewpoints on many different topics. Imposing censorship upon these materials, no matter how offensive certain parties may find them, will limit the vast amount of knowledge available to library users and potentially prevent such individuals from forming their own opinions of the matters at hand.

Censorship may also violate a library user's right to information and knowledge. As the American Library Association puts it, “the freedom to read is essential to the democratic way of life.” Libraries that practice censorship may deny individuals the right to acquire information central to their life goals. This could be in the form of a student who needs access to certain materials for a school assignment, or a teacher seeking information for instructional use. It could even be materials that are beneficial to a person's mental health, or those needed for materials of historical value.

It is clear that censorship should not be practiced in libraries, no matter how offensive certain materials may be
