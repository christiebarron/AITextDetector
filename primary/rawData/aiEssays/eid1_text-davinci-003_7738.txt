The memoir ‘From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives’ by Narciso Rodriguez creates a unique atmosphere which captures the author’s lived experience. It showcases how one’s own culture and heritage can shape and define their identity. Rodriguez is the son of Cuban immigrants who moved to the United States when Narciso was young. He grew up in New Jersey and attended Parsons School of Design in New York City, eventually making his name known in the fashion industry.

From the start, Rodriguez befriends the reader and invites them to become intimate with his story. He delicately describes his journey: from his childhood in New Jersey to his acceptance at Parsons and his breakthrough in the world of fashion. The memoir confidently moves through tinged emotions of nostalgia, faith, joy, pride and ultimately, a feeling of home. 

Throughout the memoir, a melancholic mood is skillfully woven into the narrative due to Rodriguez's subtle references to the difficulties of enduring as an immigrant in America. Themes of fear and loss are depicted as Rodriguez openly shares his experiences of growing up in two different cultures; often feeling between two worlds and rarely feeling fully at home. This solace of a search for home is made evident through the poetic beauty of his writing; Rodriguez creates a powerful presence in the memoir with his gift for imagery and reflection.

Above all, Rodriguez’s memoir conveys a strong sense of nostalgia, reminding us of our relationship to home
