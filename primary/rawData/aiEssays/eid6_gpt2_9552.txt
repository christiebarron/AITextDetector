The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Many didn't want to have to deal with having to put up any type of stand, while others wanted to let their vehicles dock, without breaking the glass or the glass wall.

In the early 1900s, the Empire State Building was finally demolished in 1914. It is in museums now, which can be seen here. In the mid-1970s, the Empire State Buildings were renovated. The state of California was the first city to own a public and private landmark, with nearly 3,000 public buildings on the first level.

The State Capitol was designed in 1913 by Robert H. Smith, and features the State House and Capitol in 1924.

The Washington Monument at the US Capitol National Security Complex is in the Park District of Washington County, near National Park Drive.
