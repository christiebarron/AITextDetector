The architects of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when they decided to incorporate an airship mooring station into the plans for the world’s tallest building. The so-called “mooring mast” was a daring endeavor, as most other buildings were afraid to attach such a device to their roof. 

The main obstacle for the architects was utilizing airship docking technology in a way that was suitable for the Empire State Building. In order to do this, architects relied on the newly-invented skyhook system, which was originally designed to stabilize and maneuver aircraft during war. This system relied on several cables connected from the airship to the roof of the building.

The process of attaching the cables and hooking them up to the Empire State Building was a laborious and arduous task. The thick cables had to be secured to the roof without damaging the building or risking the safety of those installing them. Additionally, workers had to ensure that the cables were securely attached to the airship as well. Every detail had to be carefully monitored in order to ensure the cables and airships were held in place.

In addition to the technical difficulties, the architects also had to face the potential risks of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building. The frequent and unpredictable weather patterns and strong winds that accompany tall buildings could potentially cause an airship to lose balance and crash into the building. This posed a serious threat to the safety
