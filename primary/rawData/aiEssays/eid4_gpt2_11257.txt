The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because the author is not giving anything up for the reader; there is no magic. It's a lot of magic, but it's not magic that you find yourself using after you've done your homework. There's nothing going on because you have no reason to try to stop the magical stuff you're about to do! A book like Winter Hibiscus can't help you if you're caught up in your own personal quest for the same thing.
