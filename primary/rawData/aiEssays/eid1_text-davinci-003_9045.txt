Dear Editor, 

I am writing to address the effects computers have on people today. With the advancement of technology, computers have become part of everyday life in the 21st century, and it is nearly impossible to escape it now. Although it has significant advantages, computers can also have detrimental effects on people. 

The ever-increasing usage of computers has caused health issues, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, eye strain, head, neck and shoulder pains, among many others. Furthermore, cyber-addiction is on the rise; many people rely too much on the internet, social media, and online gaming, and this leads to people neglecting their real, social relationships and spending too much time in front of computers. Additionally, people today are more inclined to use Google and other search engines to find answers to their questions, instead of exploring and searching for the answers themselves. This ultimately reduces the will of potential innovators; it is a disservice to the scientific community. 

Therefore, I urge the readers to use computers wisely and limit screen time to gain the most out of it. There is an overwhelming variety of opportunities and information the internet has to offer, but we must take into consideration the negative effects it can have and how to employ countermeasures. 

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
