One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I made a joke for a friend because she didn't realize the joke was a joke. I'm not really a comedian or an actress and I have no idea who she is. If I am talking to someone and I tell them how much I love singing about their music, she responds that she appreciates it and that she wants to hear it. It makes sense for people to laugh at you not because you have some weird voice singing in a song and a few people are probably just happy that you laughed. But, people don't really understand me or say that I was joking.

So, I think laughter is a human need, sometimes when you try to talk about the things you love, that's true. Sometimes it's kind of like laughing at your brother for your favorite show or your friend for your favorite movie, whatever. I think there is a very important need for laughter in those instances. It's really important for us to make fun of ourselves and people, because sometimes it's the most rewarding and important thing you can do or do in life, and it's not always about your heart. Sometimes it's about how to get through life, how to love yourself, how to feel good about yourself, your family, your friends, you don't live life where you are completely consumed.
