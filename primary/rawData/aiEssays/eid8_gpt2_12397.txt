One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I told a friend that it was funny," she told BuzzFeed.

When he was nine years old when he opened fire at his parents' house, Hasegawa was sitting at his friends' table, listening to stories about his dad and his sister. He was trying to tell her something about the incident, and she couldn't hear him sayingsort of wordy stuff. He started screaming in his room.

Then in 2007, the two of them moved into a house where they were roommates, and Hasegawa took to the floor, crying. But when his father, Nani Sargent Sr., reached out to Hasegawa to try to get him to talk about it, the youngster started screaming in pain.

"The only thing I managed to change was that I started crying," he recalled. "And I never told him to stop; he just started screaming."

Nani's parents, who are all Israeli nationals, moved to Jerusalem from the United States. After Hasegawa moved back to the States, Hasegawa started speaking English about it as well. It became his native language. "I've always kept the same voice in my mouth, but with the right accent," Nani says, "my son still yells over and over."

The story gets stranger when this same boy named Jonathan Gavriel has come forward with information about a similar incident
