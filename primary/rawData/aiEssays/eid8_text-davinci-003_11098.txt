It was the middle of summer and my best friend and I were hanging out in my backyard. We were gossiping and chatting when, out of the blue, I suggested we have a water balloon fight. We started to collect water balloons that I had stored away from a previous game and in no time, we had dozens of water balloons at our disposal.

Before the fight could begin, we both started to crack up laughing uncontrollably. Suddenly, my friend ran up to me and without warning, threw a balloon at me as nonchalantly as if she had just handed me a piece of cake. I was taken aback. I couldnâ€™t help but retaliate by throwing the balloon back at her. And with that, the water balloon fight was momentarily halted as we both burst into laughter.

A few minutes of laughter later, we agreed that instead of a fight, we would start throwing the balloons at one another in a manner of a playful game of catch. We ran around and played like two little kids. Every time we would throw a balloon, or catch one, we would laugh so much. I realized then just how easy it is to connect with someone else when you laugh together and how meaningful that laughter is to any relationship.
