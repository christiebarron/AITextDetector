The setting of Joe Kurmaski's “Rough Road Ahead” is an immense factor in the cyclist's success. The features of the setting play a vital role in the cyclist's physical and mental state as they attempt to confront and conquer the difficult terrain.

The greatest physical challenge the setting presents is the terrain. The “steep slopes, craggy descents, deep ruts, and rocky patches” all test the cyclist’s strength, endurance, and skill. The rough road ahead tests the cyclist’s mental determination to take on the challenge and even more importantly, persevere. 

In addition to the physical assertion of the setting’s features, the climate of the region can also have an effect on the cyclist’s progress. A cold, wet climate can sap the athlete of warmth and energy. On the bright side, a sunny, warm day can give the cyclist an extra boost of energy.

Lastly, the atmosphere of a place can have a great psychological impact on any person. The cyclist’s attitude is dependent on the atmosphere they’re in. If the atmosphere is oppressive or depressing, the cyclist’s mental mood can match the environment. On the other hand, if the cyclist is in an atmosphere of camaraderie and positivity, the rider can use that to push forward and conquer the “rough road ahead.”
