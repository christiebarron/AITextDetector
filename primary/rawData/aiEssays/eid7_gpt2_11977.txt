An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my husband that died three years ago. This happens to most people a second and a half a night.

I've written about him in detail all my life. I wrote the first one with the following summary.

He was a very loving father, a sweet and caring son who is always out with his young son to show us his care and affection. No matter what, he was always there for us. He also made me a very happy man and for him to leave us was a huge gift to us all. He would call me to the airport one day to pick me up and bring me home, with my small baby back to visit his grandparents in New Mexico, where he was still the best caretaker I had ever known.

When I was growing up, I used to hear about my husband's incredible talent. In fact, my ex-wife used to tell me that when she was about to marry her children and get my full attention, I would always be watching her and tell her, well, go home or something. I know because I know it has brought her even closer and my life has been so much different. She has worked every day, always bringing home something new to take home to us. She has even done so much for the boys of our town. So much so that it is our responsibility to make sure you see him when you go to her house in Albuquerque.
