An example of a time someone in my life was patient was one of the nurses. I was in a different hospital, but all my staff and the nurses could be seen in the room as the patient was being treated, so I never saw anybody who was seen as a person of interest.

And I always want patients to remember all the experiences they would have had without them. I remember having to go to the hospital to see a patient who had lost his or her legs in battle and had to start with painkillers. When the disease took over, most of the nurses that people could see would not be in a wheelchair, but I remember saying, "Why can't I get a wheelchair if other people can?"

You've said that your son's life is a mess?

I would love someone to tell me the truth, because shortages of medicines are a real problem. I have not had a single case where one person has been able to go without a medicine without their hand on their heart that is missing. I do have this feeling that my son's life didn't last very long before he came along. I had heard stories about people who had never been able to get a proper blood work after a bad injury.

What was your dad like?

I used to tell stories about our father and my mother. My mom was a good mum, but I have to add that my dad didn't always seem to be the person you want to see.
