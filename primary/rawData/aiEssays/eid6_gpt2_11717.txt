The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Each set was designed to run at least 3,500 feet, but when they built several, most of them were too close to a wall to be fully accessible. "For the people of the lower tiers, a good way to get around on one of those was to use elevator doors or the use walkways," explains Mike Seiler, vice president of the Construction Construction Association.

Another impediment was the problem that "slop off of an elevator would destroy the structural integrity of the structure." A small section of the roof had to be pulled down, but in the end it was only about 10 feet of sloping material. The Empire State Building, as built, is the only one of its kind in the world that is completely under construction. The elevator, which opens to an open platform, was installed with "an elegant design of the highest order." Since the elevator is designed to take place horizontally, the architects built a vertical span with 5,000 feet of vertical support. That meant the elevators needed a higher height to ensure the vertical support provided sufficient lift for a wide, vertical platform.

A portion of the new building in Manhattan, built in 1931, is now just a small section of one tower. The tallest section is 439 feet and the lower will be a total of 4,600 feet. The Empire State Building, with its many elevators and wide wings,
