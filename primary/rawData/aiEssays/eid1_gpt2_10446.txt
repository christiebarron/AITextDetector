Computers have many effects on people.

A recent study in the journal Psychological Science notes that computers that can read a speech program, such as the speech recognition system that we use to read the real world. In the study, more than 1,500 users of the technology at the University of Southern California (UCS) in Sacramento were shown a video of two-second dialogue by a machine and asked to perform two tasks: read it aloud or send it an email or send another message. This computer then interpreted and responded accordingly, producing a program called "sentencing." The results showed that people were significantly more likely to respond to a speech program that could read a speech program, while machines were significantly more likely to read text that included words that appeared to be spoken by human beings.

The researchers say computers like ours can do more. But they caution that many of the software that we use daily to perform these tasks may not be able to predict outcomes. For instance, because our communication systems can't take all of your personal conversations and turn them into conversations we want to read, "we don't have a good way to detect and interpret the message sent to someone else," says senior author Eric Healy, a behavioral scientist at the University of Iowa in Ames. And that could lead us to the point where some people could just listen to their computers.

"We need to recognize all the signals in each of these different communication systems," Healy told Live Science. "
