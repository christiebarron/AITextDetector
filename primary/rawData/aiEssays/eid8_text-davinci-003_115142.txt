It was one of those silly moments when I was laughing so hard I could hardly breathe. I was visiting a friend from college, and we were catching up when out of nowhere she made a hilarious comment and we both just started cracking up. 

It felt like the room was alive with laughter. We laughed until our stomachs hurt and were embarrassed when our outburst drew the attention of other customers in the coffee shop. But I couldn’t help it. I just remembered how much we used to laugh together back in college and how it felt like nothing else mattered. 

We wouldn’t stop until tears were streaming down our face, and we eventually had to pause just for a moment to take a breath. Then, we just looked at each other, smiled, and started all over again. 

It reminded me of how important it is to be able to laugh with someone and just let go of all the stress and worries in life. It felt so good to be able to share that moment and still be able to laugh together. 

I’ll never forget that moment of pure joy and friendship, all held together with one thing — laughter.
