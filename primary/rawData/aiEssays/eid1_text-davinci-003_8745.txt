I will never forget the first time my fiancé and I laughed together. We had barely known each other for three months before we started dating. We had just been on a few dates, and I had already fallen for him. One night he arranged a picnic for us in a nearby park. 

When we arrived, I couldn't help but admire how well he had planned everything. There was a blanket, a basket with sandwiches and drinks, and a small chess set in the middle. We propped ourselves up on the blanket and began chatting. He talked about his family and his passions, and I shared stories of my travels. 

Then, he kind of hit me with a surprise. He took out the chess set and explained that he had a bet with me. If I won the chess game, he'd take me out to a restaurant the next day. I was so excited to prove my knowledge of chess, but I finally lost to him after an intense game. 

That's when we both started laughing. His laugh, warm and cheerful, filled the park. I was happy—happy that I connected with him that way, happy to be in his presence and just simply happy. It was one of those moments that felt like it was meant to be. 

From that day onwards, we always laughed together and it became our bond, uniting us no matter what. Even after years, we both still remember that moment fondly
