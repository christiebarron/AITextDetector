An example of a time someone in my life was patient was one day when she was running along a creek, she had fallen asleep. Her family was walking in the distance when suddenly she suddenly became conscious. She started to die."

But her death can only be described in the phrase "weird". In this instance a second, more subtle expression, or "weirdness", comes to life.

"It means she needed to carry oxygen; she couldn't. As if she had died in a bucket that was filled with sugar," says Mr. Litt, a professor at The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore who studies health promotion issues in an open source approach to health care.

This "weirdness" came from a man who knew his wife who had recently become ill and was now dying from a disease, Dr. Litt says.

"He was in the position that when he got to a doctor, he would ask her, 'Could you help me?'

"He didn't know about the problem but he said 'We could do a little with the oxygen,'" he added.

Many people believe that when a patient dies for reason alone, they die of respiratory failure, or the loss of blood supply to their heart.
