One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was 10, and I saw the face of someone from an orphanage that looked like the cartoon frog (or perhaps they were an orphan. I don't know. But then I saw the face of a teenage girl in a candy store that reminded me of my childhood). I remember it because of the face my grandfather held.

So many things in life are important, not only our own lives. But it all involves making a choice. So this blog will continue to be a forum where you can do that. I don't know if it will help other people understand what they are about and make an impact. But what I do know is that it's important that you do what you love to do.
