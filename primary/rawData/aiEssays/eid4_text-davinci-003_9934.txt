The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho brings a sense of hope, renewal, and redemption. The protagonist's final line uses the idea of the spring and the renewal of the hibiscus flower - a symbol of perseverance - to emphasize his hope that he can also persevere and pass his test. It also suggests a metaphor for the idea of making mistakes and learning from them - the past will die and give way to the future with new opportunities. The final line serves as a reminder that with strong determination and bravery, anything is possible.
