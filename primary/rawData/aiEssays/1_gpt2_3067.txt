Computers have many effects on people. One, they get so far ahead in their training that they don't care about the actual training. They are constantly learning to run and play computer games and learn to take classes and to play games. If the training is too expensive, you get bored and end up spending the money to keep working. But when you're not being paid as much as your coach would like to keep you in the system, and your work has been in a different company, and your work is in the hands of people that are still teaching you what software does, then you end up bored and you quit.

Another issue is a lack of money in computer programming school. No money to make the most out of your time. And they have to be paid out of what you give them. That means if you pay 100 or 150% of the cost of the software you are working with, which means that your teachers don't think much of your progress and you will have to work for less money! That means that your work has to be the most important piece of computer programming work that you have ever done, that should be on computers, and that means no computer program work can teach you the right way to work if you are working in a room or something. And then you have to think about the people you are working with and the computer programming experience, and that's really hard.

And I don't want to sound like I know why and how it
