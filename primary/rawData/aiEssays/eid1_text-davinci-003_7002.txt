Dear Editor, 

It is a known fact that the role of libraries is to provide patrons access to a variety of materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines. Libraries should provide individuals with unique perspectives and ideas in order to promote independent thought and debate. Unfortunately, many libraries have become notorious for their censorship of certain materials that may be found offensive. 

As Americans, we pride ourselves on the freedom of choice and expression. Libraries should respect this freedom by providing access to all kinds of materials. It is not right to remove certain materials from the shelves simply because someone finds them offensive. If a patron wants to access certain materials, he or she should be allowed to do so without interference by library staff. 

The protection of minors is an important aspect of our society. Nevertheless, library staff should not limit access to certain materials by adults due to views of what is appropriate for minors. Library staff should guide adults in understanding what materials are appropriate for minors and should allow adults access to whatever materials they wish to access. 

Libraries should promote the freedom of thought and expression. They should not be limited by what is deemed offensive or inappropriate. Instead, they should promote the importance of debate and open discourse. 

Thank you for your consideration. 

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
