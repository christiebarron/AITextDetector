The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho is meant to provide hope and reassurance. It reminds us that, despite the challenges faced, there is always hope for a better future. In this case, the protagonist is determined to retake a difficult exam, and the hopeful ending suggests that with the changing of the seasons (the snows melting and the geese returning) he will be able to find the motivation and courage to take the test again. It is a reminder that the future is not predetermined and that, even in the face of adversity, there is always a chance to make things better.
