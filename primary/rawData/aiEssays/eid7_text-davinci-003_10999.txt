 

I remember the time when my five-year-old daughter wanted a new toy from the store. She was adamant that she had to have it and started acting out in the store while I was shopping. I could tell she was getting more and more frustrated, and it wasn't helping that the store was out of stock. 

I tried my best to remain calm and tried reasoning with her, but it didn't work. However, instead of getting angry and punishing her for her behavior, I embraced her and told her that it was okay and that sometimes things don't always work out the way we expect. We ended up leaving the store without the toy, but my daughter seemed to appreciate my understanding and patience. I remember how it took all my self-control not to get angry with her, but it was more important to me that she knew I was being patient with her.
