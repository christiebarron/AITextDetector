I recently had a friend staying at my house for an extended period of time. It was a stressful and difficult situation for both of us. We were both trying to adjust to the new living arrangement and it took some time to work out the kinks. 

I could feel myself getting frustrated at times. We had different opinions on how to keep the house neat, when to do the dishes, and how to respect each other’s boundaries. But I kept my patience and did my best to listen to my friend and work through these things together. 

I didn’t jump to any conclusions, I took the time to really hear and understand my friend. We might not have agreed on everything, but I was able to be patient and show understanding and compassion towards my friend. 

Eventually, we were able to come to a place of understanding and compromise. We both had to work to be patient and tolerant. But by being patient and willing to reach a better understanding with each other, we made it to a place that was workable for both of us.
