I had a neighbor growing up who always found the perfect balance between being laid-back and responsible. I'll never forget the patience she had when it came to her little brother.

He was only a few years younger than us but had a lot of trouble following directions. She was so patient when it came to the times he didn't listen and would just laugh it off. She would repeatedly tell him what to do with kindness and understanding, not anger. 

One time we were playing basketball in the driveway and he kept running out to grab the ball and take a break. She could have easily getting mad at him and yelled at him to stay put, but instead she smiled and called him over to her and explained calmly why we had to take turns with the basketball first.

That example of patience has stuck with me ever since. I try to use her lessons to make me more patient with everyone I come across.
