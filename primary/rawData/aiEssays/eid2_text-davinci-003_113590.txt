It is my opinion that censorship in libraries is a danger to society that should not be taken lightly. Libraries should be places of learning and open-mindedness, where people can discover new ideas and grow as a community. However, should certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? 

On one hand, it can be argued that censorship in libraries helps in protecting vulnerable readers, such as children, from exposure to materials which may contain explicit content. However, it has been proven that erasing books, or other materials, from the library, does not reduce access to it as people can otherwise find copies of the material online. Therefore, censorship in libraries should not be viewed as a viable strategy to protect society from offensive material.

Moreover, if libraries censor materials, it undermines the Freedom of Expression and could lead to the elimination of works which challenge the status quo. Libraries should act as hubs of discourse and provide free access to various forms of literature regardless of the opinion behind them. The challenge of censorship is that it begins to blur the lines between what is and isn’t deemed acceptable to read, and the community as a whole should not have the right to dictate what should and shouldn’t be read.
