I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is detrimental to the intellectual property rights of other authors and the freedom to use their materials. In the United States, public libraries have a very strong tradition of not banning any material that might be used on their network, even though it can be a pretty alpha version."

The move comes less than six months after the government issued a warning that the National Security Agency monitored digital media as part of its bulk collection of metadata. The FBI found no evidence that it spied on the government because it would likely be too late.

The US Information Sharing and Protection Act (ISA), enacted in 1986 by Republican President Bill Clinton in response to the growing Internet freedom protests, had given the telecom giants and the government control over all communications in the country.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was a vocal opponent of the legislation in Congress in 2015 after it was exposed as the NSA's massive domestic spying program.

The president says the legislation will provide much broader powers to the NSA thanks to its power to gather Americans' phone records, because they can later access those data through a secret court order.

He is also opposed to an order to give the NSA access to American information on every American without even calling the Justice Department to obtain the information. The law would also allow the FBI to get secret court cases before reviewing FISA orders.
