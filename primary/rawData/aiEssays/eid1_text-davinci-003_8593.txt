I was in line at the post office, waiting to buy some stamps. Everyone around me was in a hurry, tapping their foot or tapping on their phones. I was the only one who seemed to be in no rush. I heard someone behind me sigh, and I could tell they were getting annoyed. I just kept my attention focused on the postal worker, who was steadily working her way through helping each person. 

Finally, it was my turn. The postal worker realized I was in no rush and suggested I stay while she helps the next person after me too. I nodded in agreement. The lady behind me was shocked and asked me why I was being so patient.

I told her the truth - I was actually enjoying the time I was taking to see what the postal worker was up to. It was fascinating to watch her work. This made the lady smile and she told me she was impressed with my patience. We got to talking and I found out that she was picking up stamps for her daughter who was going away for college. We ended up exchanging stories and having a great time while we waited.

The postal worker thanked us both when we finally finished our transaction and we said our goodbyes. It was an enjoyable experience because I had been patient and didn't hurry. Reminding myself to be mindful and patient while waiting in line was a great lesson.
