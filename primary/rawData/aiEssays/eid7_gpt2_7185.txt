An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the time I was on the phone with him one day when he woke up. I was in the car with him for hours and then the phone suddenly rang and Shrine said, this's my friend, this guy was there. One day that week a friend of mine started an Uber, he said "hi," I said "hi, sorry." God, my whole life is going to be so bad, man.

And I was there when he called and said, "Hey, I really appreciate you guys for coming see the man I just met a couple weeks ago." And then that person said, you're welcome to come along and share his story and we all just got like "excited to see you."

But I said, that's not who I am, that's not what I am. And then I said, I really appreciate him for coming and I love him so much because he makes me feel so close to everybody and he really understands how important I am to him. It's great when people say, you have somebody like him who doesn't just want to help you be happy and you want your life to be right because you put yourself through some difficult times. It's amazing.
