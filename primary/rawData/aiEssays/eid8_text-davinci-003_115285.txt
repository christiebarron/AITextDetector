I remember the first time that I ever really bonded with my father. I was visiting from college, and we were out running errands together. We decided to stop at a grocery store to pick up some snacks for our family. We were shopping for tortilla chips when I saw a strange-looking item on one of the shelves, and I asked my dad what it was. He said "I have no idea," and then he started to chuckle. I asked him why he was laughing, and he said jokingly, "That's what I get for not being familiar with Mexican cuisine." 

That made me laugh, and then my dad started really laughing and it was contagious. We were both laughing so hard that other people in the store were staring at us – but I didn't care. I was enjoying myself and connecting with my dad in a way I never had before. 

That moment made me cherish my father and the bond we share. Every time I laugh with my dad, it reminds me to cherish those moments – and the laughter we share.
