Dear Editors,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. I strongly believe that computers have had a positive impact on our society - particularly in terms of opening up new avenues of communication, allowing people to learn and explore topics they never would have discovered without access to computers.

One of the best aspects of computers is that they allow us to stay connected with family, friends, colleagues and even strangers. We are now able to check in on what people are doing, discuss our favorite topics, and even collaborate on projects. Computers also provide access to unlimited amounts of knowledge and resources. Whether itâ€™s school assignments, keeping up with current events, or researching a new hobby, computers open up a world of information to anyone with access.

Usage of computers also have direct impacts to our economy. From streamlining business processes to allowing companies to reach a wider audience, the impact of computers is immense. Companies can now develop products and services faster, more efficiently, and for a smaller cost. This ultimately means that more people can enjoy the fruits of technology.

I understand that there may be concerns about the potential harm in overusing computers. However, the positives far outweigh the negatives. Computers have opened up new horizons of communication and learning, as well as providing substantial advances to our economy.

I urge your readers to see the numerous benefits computers have given us - both in our personal lives and in business.
