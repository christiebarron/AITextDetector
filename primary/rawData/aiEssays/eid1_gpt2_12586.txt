Computers have many effects on people. In this article, we'll discuss the impact of the influence of technology on one's work habits, and offer a more complete case study. As you can see in the following link, there were also plenty of things mentioned on the blog last year such as "the world and its people", "technology has turned people off" and "the benefits of technology are pretty obvious". The book also includes a section dealing with the effects of the internet on your work.

How technology has changed the ways people work (and their time) has nothing to do with how technology makes them work. In fact, most of the research I've done in this series is dealing with the effects that technology has had on how people work. I wanted to build a framework that would allow us to make a few quick recommendations, based on research that isn't very technical but still allows us to do a fairly thorough job of doing good work.
