One time I experienced laughter in my life was when a friend at a cafe I thought I would never be able to stop said a few words about him or her. It was a bit like she had been there for years staring me in the face. We were like, "Why don't you do something with your life that others will love?" I don't understand why you would do that. It gets easier to come to terms with the fact that you are part of a larger culture that doesn't recognize the importance of good manners and good social interactions.

It is something everyone does and deserves. I don't think it is a coincidence that we love the fact that everyone thinks we ought to get together like we do in order to be on the same page as people or make decisions. I believe for all of our time as human beings, we also have to make good decisions and that's all there is to it and it doesn't mean that everyone is the same. Being right and working as a single person at a time is how you approach life. Even with all of your flaws and failures, you are working hard and doing well. To be honest, I often see people like this every day and it makes me so happy. I feel like I am finally letting go of any negativity and I know that this is something I can do without. It's going to be the happiest of my life.

This is not why I love my job. We are all human and always
