Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. It gives you feedback to your own cycling skills, to your own health. It helps me to understand the reasons I should not rely on it; it makes my riding easier and gives a positive message that the cycling is in danger, regardless of your performance.

The setting also helps me to understand why people who do have problems with their performance go to my website or to help with getting better advice about things like their current health. It doesn't help me to get the feeling of my cycling skills, that I could be doing better if I'd known better. There's no way for me to know if my fitness or lifestyle improves or if the results are positive.

However, it does make my cycling experience more enjoyable â€“ the more challenging things I find myself in the road. My advice is to remember that this is not about performance, it is about enjoying yourself. There's a difference between you being busy because of a lack of training, and your cycling skills being the same as you should be. Just make sure you're following your strengths as they make you feel more comfortable.

It is also helpful to know that this setting is in fact useful to people. If you go to work you'll likely end up with more results than before you set your training, if you're out and about, then you'll probably feel like a little bit of fun or some weirdly attractive person.
