The ending of Winter Hibiscus conveys the message that the character will persevere and face her difficulties head on when the oppression of winter fades away. The character's attitude towards the test at the end of the story conveys a stronger determination than before, as she is looking ahead to when she will take the exam again in the spring. The imagery of nature in the line also adds to her resolve, with the snows melting and the geese returning representing optimism and hope for a better life. The line thus serves to show how, despite the hardship and oppression she faces and the difficulty of taking the test, the character is still hopeful that she will succeed if she continues to work hard and never give up.
