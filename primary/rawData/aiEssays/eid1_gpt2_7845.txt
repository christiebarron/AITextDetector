Computers have many effects on people. A person's mood, mood, and so forth. If they're busy, they can cause problems. So when you have that in your mind, and your brain really is going off the rails, you might want to try these and see what happens. I have a good group of people who have an hourwork day, a weekwork day, and a short workday, and they feel better, but in the end it's not worth taking anything off the table, because if a person does something right, and if his or her mind wanders, it can lead to bad results. How much has the person changed? Have you ever noticed a person's mind wandering after going to work and hitting something? But if you take a look back at research done on the brains of different athletes, it's probably much different. How much are players more prone to have mental whiplash? Does it take more mental damage? What are the consequences of that for the sport? How does coaching actually benefit the mind? How does coaching help the brain, and have it become more responsible for decision-making? Is there something missing with the ability to judge the person, to analyze how best to respond and be the best of the best, to do what's right on both ends of the spectrum, when there is a need to take something away from our bodies?

I can't give you all the answers, but I can give you some suggestions:
