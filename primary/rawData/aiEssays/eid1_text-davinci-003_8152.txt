The Empire State Building was the pinnacle of engineering achievements when it was finished in 1931, and it was the first skyscraper in the world to incorporate a docking station designed specifically for mooring airships, or dirigibles. Despite the revolutionary nature of the structure and its original purpose, the docking of a dirigible to the Empire State Building was never successfully accomplished due to a number of obstacles left unaddressed.

First, the technology behind airship engineering and construction was still evolving and growing at the time, so ensuring that the airships could safely dock to the building was a serious challenge. Additionally, the method of mooring needed to be established—a technique called "masting"—which was not common at the time and would need to be successfully applied before any airship could be moored at the Empire State Building. 

The mooring mast itself posed challenges as well, given the magnitude of the task it was meant to serve. The mast was to be designed in such a way that airship passengers could access the tower from the ground— a difficult feat given the size, shape, and weight of modern airships. It was for this reason that the mooring mast was made of two sections: a steel mast jutting from the roof of the Empire State Building and a wooden mast strong enough to support the airships at the ground level. 

Complicating matters further was the wind. The presence of high winds at
