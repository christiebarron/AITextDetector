In recent years, debates over censorship in libraries have been gaining traction. The issue divides public opinion, as some individuals believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. As a concerned citizen, I disagree with this viewpoint, and I urge our local newspaper to investigate the truth behind this issue.

The greatest proponents of library censorship argue that inappropriate content should not be allowed to corrupt the minds of impressionable young readers, and should be kept away from the general public. Those in opposition claim that it is the parentsâ€™ responsibility to determine what their children should and should not have access to. 

The availability of certain materials does not mean that everyone will have access to them. Library staff can, and should, enforce policies of proper conduct in libraries, and be vigilant in picking up any material that may be undesirable. They can also take measures to ensure that children are not exposed to materials that go against the values that their families may have. Anything that could be deemed offensive for any particular set of values should be clearly labeled as such, leaving it up to individuals to decide whether or not they want access to it. 

By completely banning certain materials, libraries are going against the very sense of which their existence is based upon, namely freedom of speech. Studies have documented that censorship has historically been used as a tool to suppress ideas and limit the growth of knowledge and free thinking. Therefore
