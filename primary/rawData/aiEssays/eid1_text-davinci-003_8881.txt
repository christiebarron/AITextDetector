I was visiting friends in another city one weekend and, while out to lunch, a funny joke was told at our table. We all laughed and it struck me suddenly how good it felt to have that moment of shared joy and connection among us. It was as though in that moment, we were all connected, regardless of our age, gender, or background. 

I never forgot that moment and the reminder of how something as simple as a shared laugh can bring us so close together. Laughter truly is the best way to bridge any gap between two people.
