The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is extremely depressing.

It was my first serious book since 2009: my first single in 15 years. Since then I've spent more time in the West Country. The country has shifted in my mind that 'We live in a nation, and that means we should think about how we move abroad. I hope to make the most of a chance to look beyond the United States so that things grow out the way I expect them.' (*takes out the cup of coffee while reading this piece of advice)

We are all trying to move out and I hope that they will.
