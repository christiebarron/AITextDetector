Dear Editor:

I am writing to express my opinion on the impact that computers have had on people's lives. We have all seen the just how powerful these machines can be, and their capability for world-changing advances continue to evolve. 

But, I feel readers should be aware of the individual effects that computers can have on people. Computer usage amongst all age groups has substantially increased. Children who have never been without a computer are emerging in groups. Increased computer usage can lead to a decrease in physical activity, leading to a lack of fitness and obesity. There is also the risk of addiction, especially for those who use computers for gaming, gambling, or internet browsing. 

But despite the risks, it is clear to see that there are a lot of positives to computers; after all, the world is more connected than ever before. Connections that used to take years to make can now be done in minutes thanks to computers. Businesses utilize computer technology to maximize efficiency, while educational institutions use computers to create new ways of teaching and learning with interactive software. For those living with physical disability, the computer can be a source of independence, freedom, and connection.

So whatâ€™s the answer? To me, computer usage should be a balance of both benefits and risks. Education on appropriate use for all age levels will help to minimize the potential risks, while allowing us to continue getting the most out of the advances in technology.
