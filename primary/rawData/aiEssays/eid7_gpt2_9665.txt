An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I visited her over a few days. I spent one hour with her there as he was performing surgeries as she suffered from respiratory problems. She said I was right.

I thought she'd always gotten better, and I'd become a happy wife and mother. In the end we won and we had our daughter.

But in the end these days we know we are not getting good treatment. While I'm writing this I want you to know there are many reasons why I'm moving and trying to get more help. If your problem is any of the above, please tell us your story and ask for help.
