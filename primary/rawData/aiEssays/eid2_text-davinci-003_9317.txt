Our libraries are a place of knowledge, creativity, and culture; a place where we should feel comfortable to express ourselves and explore new ideas. However, when it comes to materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines, certain selections can be deemed offensive and are fated for censorship.

The issue of censorship in libraries is a controversial one. While some believe that certain resources should be censored to ensure a safe and civil learning environment, it is also important to recognize the consequences of such a decision. First, limiting access to resources prohibits individuals from learning and engaging with potentially different views than their own. This not only affects our ability to make informed decisions but also our own appreciation of our diversity of opinion. Censorship also impedes our creativity, since pairing certain topics that might be deemed inappropriate together can spark new ideas. Finally, without access to potentially offensive material, our understanding of a variety of topics is limited and we are unable to gain insight from their contexts.

It is vital that we allow individuals to engage in open and unrestricted discourse. Therefore, unless one is under the age of 18, resources should not be censored. This obviously does not include materials that are deemed illegal according to the law. Otherwise, even potentially offensive materials should remain accessible, considering that we are a free state with the liberty to express ourselves. 

At the end of the day, public libraries should be places of knowledge, inquisition, and appreciation for our differing opinions.
