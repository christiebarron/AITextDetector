The construction of the Empire State Building in 1931 was seen as a symbol of progress and innovation. It stands as the first building with the capacity to allow dirigibles, or airships, to dock. Despite the feat being a marvel of engineering, constructing a skirt on top of the building to act as a docking station for these large airships was met with numerous obstacles. 

The first problem encountered by the builders of the Empire State Building was one of weight. The sheer mass of the airship demanded a skirt structure of tremendous material strength, yet must not be so heavy that it reduced the structural strength of the building itself. Constructing the skirt to exacting engineering standards was a difficult feat, and forced the engineers to work within tight parameters. 

The second challenge faced was one of safety. The Empire State Building had to provide a mooring mast which was both strong and secure enough to secure the large airship, yet flexible enough to give in the event of strong winds. The mast was constructed with a base which could provide the initial shock of a dirigible dock, while the top of the mast featured a swivel joint to allow the dirigible to move with the wind. This was complemented by a number of cables that could securely hold the airship in place. 

The third and final obstacle came in the form of weatherproofing the skirt and mooring mast. The airship docking station had to be able to withstand
