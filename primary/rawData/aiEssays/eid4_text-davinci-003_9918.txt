The last line of Minfong Ho's "Winter Hibiscus" is a reflection of hope that through the cycle of nature the speaker will have the strength to take the difficult test that they are facing. The ending of the poem also looks ahead into the future, with a reminder that the test will be taken again when the blooms of spring return - conveying the idea that despite hardships, there is always a chance to have a better future. The idea of the bloom of the hibiscus also symbolizes renewal and rejuvenation, signalling the hope that the speaker may find that strength in time.
