The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because of the sheer weight of the book that it will pull. The reader starts off with a nice collection of stories; it will take about five to ten pages to do so. Winter Hibiscus is a book that will be read, not burned down, as happens to some writers in the publishing world.

Winter Hibiscus is a collection of stories. It takes place between 1939 and 1941. It will be published in the fall of the year. Winter Hibiscus was published in Japan between January 1st and 12 September 1951 and is expected to be available until next year, as I've mentioned before. I hope you enjoy it and help us continue to produce a great collection of beautiful, diverse, and enjoyable fiction.
