An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was taking some of my friends into the studio with me. I had about 20 people waiting for me downstairs, because I was late to class, but I could hear the other two, and maybe one took off and then the other two followed her down the stairs and onto the sidewalk. I never felt the pressure of being up there in front of anyone but myself, nor was my friend at that time, but I didn't want to put myself in the way of what others did all of the time. I didn't want to lose that sense of humor. So I was able to live like you do, to not make people feel like they were being punished to something that I had no control over. As such, it changed my perception. You know, after these six months, I made my decision to move back into class and start working on my studies. I was living on my own for the next 6 months, so at that point I got better.

Q: Did you have any problem being at school when you worked out on those plans?

A: My teacher told me, "You can only get into the program if you have a sense of humor." But it's what a high school student needs, I know that's what I've learned. I learned that I could be into doing classes for a year or two while I was in middle school, and there wasn't an excuse to work
