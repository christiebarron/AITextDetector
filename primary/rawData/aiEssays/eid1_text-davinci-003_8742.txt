I remember the first time I truly laughed with my husband. It was an early summer evening and my husband had just come home from work. It had been a long day, and I was feeling worn out after battling a cold. I had been looking forward to relaxing with my husband. As soon as he stepped through the door, I sprang up in excitement, my yawns forgotten. 

I ran over and gave him a big bear hug, which was quickly answered with a tight squeeze and peals of gentle laughter. I had never before felt so much love and joy emanating from one embrace. The warmth of the moment was overwhelming, and it felt like our connection was transcending the physical. That's when I knew this was the man I had been looking for. 

We stepped away to look at each other, still laughing. Our eyes sparkled with delight, and I felt like we were alive in that moment. It was such a beautiful thing to feel our bond deepening as we both started to cry happy tears. That special moment of laughter and sunshine will stay with me forever.
