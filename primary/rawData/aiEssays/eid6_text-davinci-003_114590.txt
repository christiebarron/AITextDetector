The Empire State Building may be an iconic symbol of the 20th century, but it had an additional purpose when it was completed in 1931. As part of the original plans, the tallest building in the world was designed to be the final destination for a revolutionary form of transportation – dirigibles – when they arrived from Europe. Despite great enthusiasm for this grand idea, the builders of the Empire State Building faced significant obstacles as they attempted to make it possible for dirigibles to dock on the 102nd floor of the building.

One of the most pressing concerns was creating a framework for the mooring mast itself. The 400-foot-tall tower, which would function as the anchor point for the dirigibles, had to be strong enough to withstand the pressure from the balloons, as well as the wind that would buffet them when they flew in. Despite numerous attempts, engineers were unable to adequately reinforce the structure, and they eventually had to settle for a bridge-style mast that hung from the tower instead.

The biggest challenge for the builders of the Empire State Building came in the form of providing a safe and efficient system for docking the airships. To that end, the engineers had to invent a way to hold the mooring cable in place, allowing the dirigibles to descend slowly and safely to the rooftop.Unfortunately, they were unable to find a viable solution, forcing them to abandon the idea of airship docking altogether.
