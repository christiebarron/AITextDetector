Computers have many effects on people. The first thing you notice about a computer is its power.

The computers we see these days are not as efficient as they might appear. They tend to overheat, they tend to shut off faster than normal, they go off on their way into a dead state with no electricity in them, and they keep switching on and off in unpredictable ways. One example of this was a power plant called the Chernobyl nuclear power plant that shut down after 12 years of operation. All of the power in the plant had to be shut down because of a severe cooling storm, which allowed the power plant to go into meltdown, a few thousand people fell ill during the operation, and a nuclear reactor exploded. When I was a grad student there were some 70 reactors on the planet in operation. That meant when the reactors shut down, they turned on for seven hours and then the rest of the reactors went off, the only power still in them was some sort of electric power generator. That has now led to about 100,000 people needing medical care for six more reactors.

So we're talking around some of the worst problems that are currently in place in nuclear power plants. There will be more to say about that in a moment.

BILL MOYERS: But, you'd argue, with the recent developments in the Fukushima case, there would be no way of dealing with these developments right now without nuclear energy. What would you advise those of us
