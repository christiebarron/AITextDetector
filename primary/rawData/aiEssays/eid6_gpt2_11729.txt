The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development proposed a $4.5 billion plan, which failed to come up with its name. The National Transportation Safety Board, which oversees building safety, gave a $9,000 bond. The FCC also recommended $3 million a year to upgrade and replace outdated, outmoded towers (a process that would lead to an explosion of new ones).

But the towers in question weren't built before World War II, and that's not a problem anymore. Today, building companies can make what was considered by them the best kind of car: A high-performance, high-volume, low-volume, fully-electric light car. It costs $10 million to build an old airplane, and a little less for a new airplane: The average American can afford less than $75,000 a vehicle, according to the Consumer Highway Association.

In fact, the last time any vehicle was in service was in the early 1900s. According to the Government Accountability Office, an additional $18 billion cost would have been applied to the federal government through the end of World War II. This, the report finds, would have been a significant expense for U.S. automakers.

The U.S. Department of Transportation also projected that a $3.2 billion investment in a new, more advanced electric light car line could save the government
