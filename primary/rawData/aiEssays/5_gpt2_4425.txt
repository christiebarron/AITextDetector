The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is that she was "pretty happy" with a few changes. The book contains the following highlights:

– More than 20 changes throughout the book show she became accustomed to it. Instead of keeping a single line on what happens on the beach with her, she writes down what happens on the phone and keeps herself in her post (which has been used as a guideline or shorthand for many of the changes she's made along those 10-20-year stretches).

– The book contains detailed descriptions of the changes that took place, along with some suggestions for how to re-write them.

– The book says the edits she did would cost more. She said she needed to find a better way to handle it. "The hardest part of it would have been changing every 12 weeks."

– There's a lot of detail in the book about an incident that has taken place over the years where her husband (who spent much of his days as a carpenter), took her car out, threw it onto her car park and destroyed it.

– Her mother claims that she did this for her two sons and has also been telling people, over the years, that she has had to get out as soon as she could find work.

– She is very well known for her hair being kept longer. This change has left her wearing a long ponytail and long blonde bra.
