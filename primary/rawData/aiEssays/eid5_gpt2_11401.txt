The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is one that you and I are both glad for. It feels liberating to live among the poor, yet we know that our plight isn't really well understood by those who would have taken up the cause of the family, such as my parents.

I do feel that my father was not only wrong and misguided in his approach to politics but also wrong at the time. I have long wondered why he and his followers continued to live with so many orphans in their home. I know so little of the poor or what is going on in their lives, that I am in need of comfort from people who knew their way around.

When they arrived to see I was 16, they asked me, but what is that? My parents did not know me, and told me they would send me to the orphanage only if anyone gave them a name that I named.

Then I became really close to them, knowing that I would never see them again. I never had reason to worry if things looked bad for my parents. I was grateful that they were making me choose between one of them forever and that they had let me know about the dangers involved in this matter. But they also took no action to make me decide, because nothing happened until I got home from school at one of their classes in the summer.

As they told me I would have a better life if I would join my father's team in the army
