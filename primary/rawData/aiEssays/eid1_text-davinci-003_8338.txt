I was placed in an awkward situation when my best friend asked me to come over for a big birthday party. Even though I knew the event would be incredibly crowded and overwhelming for me, I forced myself to attend in order to support my friend. Throughout the evening, many of the guests made assumptions about my reserved nature and even dismissed my input in conversations. As the evening progressed, I had to face feelings of insecurity and judgement.

To make the evening even worse, it started to downpour unexpectedly and almost the entire party had to move inside. I could feel my chest tight, as I knew I would be surrounded by overwhelming amounts of people in the small interior. Again, I forced myself to stay put and remain patient.

I was extremely thankful for my patience that night. Despite the chaotic atmosphere, I was able to locate a little corner in the basement and manage my anxiety. I made it a point to remain kind and understanding towards everyone in the room, even when common courtesy wasn't returned to me. Although it was challenging, I'm still proud that I was able to stand my ground and be patient.
