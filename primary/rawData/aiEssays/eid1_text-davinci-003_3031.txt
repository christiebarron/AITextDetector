Dear Editor,

As a member of the community, I write to express my opinion on the effects of computers on people today. In my view, computers can be incredibly helpful in our daily lives, yet they can also be extremely harmful, affecting our lives in countless ways. 

On the bright side, computers have made our lives much more convenient and efficient. We can now access information and communicate with each other from any location in the world. We can also work remotely and have access to countless resources at our fingertips. Computers are an invaluable tool, and as such, they have made our lives easier in many respects. 

However, computers may not always be beneficial if not used in moderation. People may become overly reliant on computers for their daily tasks and forget how to carry out simple activities without them. This can cause people to become isolated from their own families and communities. It can also cause physical and mental health issues. Therefore, it is important to use computers responsibly and in an appropriate amount.

In conclusion, computers can be very beneficial to our lives. However, it is important to be aware of the potential negative consequences of computers and take steps to ensure that they are used responsibly.
