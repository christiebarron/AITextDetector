The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Unlike many other commercial space travel projects, dirigible-equipped structures require considerable investment.

Famous commercial builders include:

Richard M. Anderson, a Boston real estate mogul who built the State House and Capitol that he designed and built with his wife, Mary Anderson, in 1928, and who built the Boston Public House and then renovated the Metropolitan Life Building in 1960.

James M. Wertheimer, a pioneer and inventor of the electrical power railway who built the Central Market and Boston Business Center in the 1950s.

Charles F. Baudelaire of New York, founder of the electrical railroad company, who built the city's Central Station and the Washington Heights Transit Building in the 1960s.

Henry W. Wright Jr., founder of the railroad firm and pioneer of the railroad line to New York City from Newark, N.J., in the 1930s and '40s.

William A. P. Lippman Jr., chairman and CEO of the New York Department of Transportation (NYDD) based in the 1940s; and John W. Ostrom, who owned C.W. Reuther in the Uptown building in 1947 and worked in transportation engineering at L.L. Bean in the 1950s.

Dove Crenshaw and her son, Eric Crenshaw, built the Lincoln Tunnel near Brooklyn in 1884
