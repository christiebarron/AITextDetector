The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho suggests that the narrator is willing to eventually stand up for her own beliefs. The narrator is a young girl who has endured pressure from her family and culture to conform to traditional expectations. She ultimately chooses to take a stand to protect a hibiscus flower that she planted, despite her father's orders to get rid of it. By ending with the narrator's pledge to take the test again in the spring, she is demonstrating her resilience and determination to follow her own path, despite the cultural restrictions imposed upon her. The image of the hibiscus surviving despite the harsh winter serves as a metaphor for the narrator's strength and resolve.
