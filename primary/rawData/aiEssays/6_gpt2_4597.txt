The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Because of their small size (about two-thirds the width of their own) and lack of a single mainboard, they were forced to rely on a huge crane to support them.

It was completed in 1926 â€“ but still at a high cost (up to $1.25 billion) and the state still had to bear costs of building new bridges (mainland workers would have to provide their own roof and maintenance).

The city of Minneapolis, after having built two main roads around its borders to connect the city with the Twin Cities, opened the Minneapolis Intersection from the Mississippi River's North River onto the St. Paul River in 1951 for the first time. (An area has a high-density development called the Tapan Expressway or the Yonge Expressway.) The building was opened in 1961 as the Empire State Building by W. E. Howard, a local businessman.
