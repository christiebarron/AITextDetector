Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. What changes should you be making when entering the city? Should you be making a shift off the left bank and on the right bank, and at the intersections? This could be something to consider as long as you are aware of a change happening. What can you do if your shift is interrupted? Do you have to pull over? If you feel a traffic light can't be seen, a camera could be able to identify your change. How do you make sure the changes are made at the same time, as Division of Roads Services Chief Constable Mike McManus said?

The change that affects drivers under this new scheme is intended for an 18-month period starting at July 1st 2011. The decision to stop enforcement to the right or onto the shoulder will not be reversed until after that time. This change is designed to make road users safer and reduces accidents.

Can I call it what it is:

Rough Road Ahead?
