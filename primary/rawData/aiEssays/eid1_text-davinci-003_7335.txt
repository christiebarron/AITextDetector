The features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski's 'Rough Road Ahead' heavily affect the cyclist's experience. Set in an isolated, rural region of northern Wisconsin's woods, the cyclist tackles a mountainous terrain, experiencing the brutality of the elements. The mountainous terrain, comprised of extreme elevation drops, sharp turns, and barren tree-dotted landscapes, challenges the cyclist's physical and mental capacity. The rocky roads and sharp turns make navigating the course a challenge and require careful maneuvering. Furthermore, the cyclist must grapple with the gnarled roots that litter the ground, running the risk of a nasty fall. The athlete is also at the mercy of the rain, cruel winds, and bleak landscapes, resulting in a dreary and physically draining experience.

At the same time, despite the difficulty of the terrain, there is a beauty to the isolated setting that the cyclist appreciates â€” intense moments of sensory joy that make the journey a worthwhile struggle. The conquering of the wilderness and the physical journey through it are invigorating, a challenge that offers enough reward and an intensity that could be found nowhere else.

The elements of the setting ultimately contribute to the challenge and pleasure of the journey. The physical, mental, and emotional effort required of the cyclist are an essential part of what make 'Rough Road Ahead' such an exciting and rewarding experience.
