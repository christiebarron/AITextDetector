The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho serves to emphasize that the main character of the poem, Yee, has grown personally since the beginning of the poem and is using the hibiscus to symbolize this growth. Yee has faced the challenges of her refugee life and her parents' expectations of her, and the poem ends with her understanding that those challenges might occur again when the winter ends and spring returns. The poem ends with the hope that Yee will approach these challenges with a newfound strength and resilience, symbolized by the hibiscus which returns from dormancy every spring. By choosing to end with this thought of perseverance, the poem emphasizes the value of determination and hope in the face of adversity.
