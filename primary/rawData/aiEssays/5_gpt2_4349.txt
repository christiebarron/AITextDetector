Why we should read that about Caitlin JFK

The Ebola virus was initially described by doctors in Sierra Leone as a disease of "explanatory significance". The current case rate for the virus is 20 per cent per year. It is still being treated at the West African centre in Freetown.

Caitlin, who has a history of Ebola at the hospital she had chosen, said she was left "very shaken".

During her speech in Sierra Leone on Monday, President Kiir "Jeblah" Kabila said those who had been diagnosed with Ebola were among the "victims" to have failed "on important occasions".
