I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a legitimate exercise of the free exchange of ideas for self-expression.

My thoughts are with the library staff responsible and if you have any questions about any of this situation, please contact them. My name is Daniel Reardon and I'd like to speak with you because I've been a longtime fan and a collector and friend of the archives and you can bet I'd never stop wanting to know more about his work or get his attention (I'd just like you to know that this kind of person is just as important."

A spokesperson for the Library responded that the library is investigating "recent concerns about the issue of censorship of materials in libraries."

The Library of Congress has opened an internal investigation into the issue.
