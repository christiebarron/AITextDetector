To the Editor of The [Local Newspaper], 

I write to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people today. Computers have revolutionized the way we communicate and stay connected to the world. From simple tasks like achieving information to more complex ones like designing graphics and gaming, we are increasingly relying on computers. 

The availability of computers has improved people’s lives in a variety of ways. People can use them to do research for school projects or work-related tasks more quickly and efficiently. They provide an opportunity to socialize, for some in way they wouldn’t be able to do without them. Computers provide entertainment and freedom from the mundane tasks that are integral to many of our lives.

But despite the obvious advantages, there are some drawbacks to over-reliance on computers. With increasing dependence on computers our physical and mental activities have reduced significantly. This can lead to physical ailments due to a sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy posture. It can also lead to mental problems such as anxiety and depression due to overworking or lack of proper socializing. Therefore, it is important to strike a balance and use computers in moderation.

The effects of computers on people are both positive and negative, depending on how we use them. But, it is worth considering the potential problems that computer addiction can cause and to be aware of the risks so we can get the most out of our computers without the danger of overuse.
