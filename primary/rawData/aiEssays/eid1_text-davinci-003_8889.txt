I'll never forget the day my best friend and I discovered one of our favorite pastimes â€“ making each other laugh. It was a typical day in sixth grade, minus the fact that school was canceled due to a snowstorm. We had left school early, and taking advantage of the unexpected day off, we decided to hang out at my house with some of our other friends. 

It started when we were having a heated debate about the latest video game for the Nintendo. It was getting intense when someone made a funny joke about a purple dinosaur character. We all started laughing, and the next thing I knew the whole room had erupted into an uncontrollable fit of laughter.

We noticed that the more jokes we told the harder we laughed and soon we began focusing on trying to make each other laugh even more. Suddenly it was a game for us, and we started competing to come up with the most outrageous or funniest scenarios.

After an hour of some of the most side-splitting laughter we'd ever had, the snow had stopped and it was time for us to leave. We talked about our jokes all the way home, and I still remember it all so clearly as if it were yesterday. It was that day we realized just how important laughter was to our friendship. And it has been a common thread between us ever since.
