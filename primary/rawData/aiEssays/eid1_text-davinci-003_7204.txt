In Joe Kurmaski's poem "Rough Road Ahead," the cyclist faces treacherous terrain, highlighted by the harsh environment of the setting. The dark and jagged shape of the mountains illustrate the trek ahead, while the sharp wind and merciless sun symbolize the uphill battle to be endured. The physicality of the setting emphasizes the difficulty of the journey, despite its uncertain future.

The cyclist's lack of control over their surrounding elements drives home the message that this path will not be an easy one. Rainfall, frequently mentioned in the poem, blurs obstacles that can easily slow down the cyclist. The personified wind, that pushes back and shoves the cyclist with a cutting chill, further emphasizes the cyclist's desperation for success. This unpredictable nature of the environment makes it harder for the cyclist to traverse the terrain with ease.

The geographical features of the setting also reinforce the idea of obstacles and difficulty. Rocks and stones that jut out of the path add another layer of difficulty that must be navigated in order for the cyclist to reach their destination. The slopes are steep, with sharp turns that test the cyclist's balance.

These are the forces that the cyclist must overcome in order to reach their destination. All of these features of the setting contribute to the difficulty that the cyclist must overcome in order to reach the end of the road.
