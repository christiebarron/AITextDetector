Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

The "good" cyclist will be given a clear warning not to be around cars as they're "too bright," a warning you might pass to your partner. You might even even see your car's "white flag" flashing.

There's a good chance that you will probably be fine while you bike, so be warned.

In fact, the better it is in the morning, the higher the number of warning signs. You will probably need to take those down soon rather than waiting for the "good enough" signal to take them down.

But in some places (like here in the USA), road rage is not as intense and deadly as you'd think.

That is because the warning from the officer and/or public are almost always correct.

You would never risk that if anything was going on in a car.
