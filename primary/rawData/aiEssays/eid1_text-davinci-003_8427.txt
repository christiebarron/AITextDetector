I recently encountered a situation where I needed to be patient. My friend and I had planned to go out to dinner at a restaurant that had recently opened. We both had high expectations, but when we arrived the wait was almost 2 hours. It took a lot of willpower for me to not be frustrated and think of an alternate plan. However, I knew my friend had been looking forward to this dinner and that she was as disappointed as I was. So, instead of giving in to my frustration, I took a deep breath and calmly said “Well, we can either wait it out or go somewhere else.” I suggested a few other location options, but in the end we decided to wait. Sure enough, after 2 hours, it was our turn to be seated. The meal was actually worth the wait - it was delicious! I learned a valuable lesson that day - patience truly is a virtue.
