The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it presents a story on both sides of "the war of extermination" which took place to create Nazi Germany.

The main question is, what if Hitler has been driven out? The book asks us to imagine the horrors that had happened to the rest of humanity and how you would see them. The book says there is no way Hitler, not under a different government, would have won a war of extermination.

What does winter mean? And what if it was only the result of the Nazis having decided on using industrial technology to build a new war machine. Of course you could argue that Hitler was only allowed to kill for political gain, but no. The book also acknowledges that the Nazis had built only one machine at any one time and this device was useless. They had enough problems to produce a new war machine but without having to manufacture the next one. They were also able to make some of its parts in great numbers and did in fact use some Nazi machinery.

The book tells us that Hitler was forced to make a major decision over the last 18 months, the question is whether there was ever a good way forward. Winter Hibiscus explores the "Nazi war machine" situation and how such an endeavor could fail if the war plan was to be put into place or as scholars consider in our history course Winter Hibiscus. What about "new Hitler" in this case?
