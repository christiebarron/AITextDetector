I met him in college and he had a certain energy about him that made me smile. One day after a particularly hard class we were walking and talking when he did something totally unexpected - he burst out laughing. I was so taken aback that I started to giggle, and before I knew it we were sharing a laugh together. It felt so liberating and comforting, and I knew right then and there that this person was going to be a part of my life for a long time.

We stayed friends throughout college and our friendship was strengthened through all the little moments of laughter we shared. Whether it was through a dumb joke, an absurd life story or a funny movie, laughter would always bring us closer together. It's something that I look back on fondly, and laughter is still an important part of our relationship. I'm grateful for every precious moment of laughter we shared, and I'm so lucky to have a friend like him.
