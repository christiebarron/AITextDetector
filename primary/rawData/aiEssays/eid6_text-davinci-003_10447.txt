The building of the Empire State Building in 1931 was a remarkable feat, and the possibility of allowing dirigibles – lighter than air vehicles – to dock was a welcome prospect. However, its lofty height, more than 1,300 feet, meant that it faced particular issues when it came to the mooring of dirigibles that exceeded those of any other buildings in the world. 

One of the main obstacles faced by designers was the task of providing a mooring mast that was reliable and strong enough to weather the elements. It was necessary that the mast be able to withstand the strong winds that would buffet the top of the building, as well as any turbulence that might be created by dirigibles and other craft, such as airplanes. The designers of the Empire State Building ultimately chose to construct a steel mast with a height of over 100 feet that was both flexible and capable of withstanding a significant amount of stress.

Another major challenge faced by the architects was the need to determine how dirigibles would dock in relation to the mast. An investigation into the types of lines and cables suitable for the task revealed that ordinary steel cable was not able to handle the tensile forces generated by the mooring of an airship. Instead, they settled on a type of cable known as ‘Bergins’, which allowed for far greater tensile strength.

The situation for mooring the dirigibles at the Empire State Building was
