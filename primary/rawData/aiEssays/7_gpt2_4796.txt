An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a few years later.

The last person I talked to when he was working on his PhD was an English professor who was working on a postdoctoral work with my friend. He thought I was being very critical of the project and I just said that I wanted to hear from him better than that.

It took me a couple of minutes to get out of the interview, but that didn't stop him from bringing me up in conversations with people he knew who wanted to see his work. He offered to send me a series of letters he wrote to other scientists. When I responded that none of his letters were on this topic, my friend said, "Do you want to read them?" I said no I didn't have time for reading them.

He told me that if he knew what was going on with me and I wanted to read them he'd get me a job at a startup. He was already writing to other students and I already had a job. If I ever find out what was going on with the funding he was proposing, then I'd be doing well in the fields of public relations, management of public schools, economics, philosophy, etc. My friend agreed and promised to follow some of the research he wrote and help him find a job on the project. This was only the start; I needed a big break, so I started writing. I did some of the writing for the last few weeks
