The construction of the Empire State Building in New York City during the 1930s pushed the boundaries of architecture and engineering. The ambitious plan to allow dirigibles to dock on the top of the newly constructed building posed a unique set of challenges. The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted provides an insightful look into the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock.

First, the designers of the Empire State Building had to construct a concrete mast positioned high enough in order to allow the mooring of the dirigibles. This meant that they had to design and build a special platform located on the 102nd floor of the building that could support the added weight of the mooring mast. This platform had to be reinforced and made of highly durable material, as it would be exposed to the extreme weather and stress of the Manhattan air.

Second, the mooring mast itself was not a simple undertaking. Stretching up 800 feet above the ground, the mast had to be durable enough to withstand the elements and the strain of mooring the dirigibles' lines. It was finally decided that the mast would be made of steel bolted together in two sections with a black and yellow striped design at the top.

Third, the mooring mast would need its own apparatus, such as an electrical system that would deliver power to the dirigibles. This included sophisticated devices such as a tilting
