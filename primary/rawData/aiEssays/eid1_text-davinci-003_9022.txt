Dear Editors of The [Name of Newspaper],

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. I believe that advances in computer technology have improved our lives for the better.

The integration of computers into our day-to-day lives has made many aspects of our lives more convenient. Whether it is researching a book at the library or transferring money online, computers make things happen quickly and accurately. Besides being a practical and helpful tool, computers can also be used for creative endeavors. By utilizing record keeping software, graphic design programs, and web development tools, computers can help us to express ourselves in ways that we once couldn’t have imagined.

Furthermore, computers have also helped to create and maintain connections between people. Social networking websites, video chat, and email set us up with a platform to communicate when face-to-face interaction isn’t feasible. Without computers, those living far away from each other could not stay in touch as regularly as they do now. Additionally, internet forums and book clubs allow us to connect with people of a similar interest and share ideas and experiences.

In conclusion, I believe that computers have significantly improved our quality of life. Computers have increased our productivity, allowed us to stay connected with others, and have enabled us to express ourselves creatively. Therefore, I believe that computers have ultimately enriched us as individuals and as a society. 

Yours faithfully,
