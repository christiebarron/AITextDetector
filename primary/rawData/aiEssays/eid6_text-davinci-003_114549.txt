The construction and opening of the Empire State Building marked a great feat in human history—the building, at the time, stood as the tallest skyscraper in the world. However, the empire state building was also built with the capability for airships, or dirigibles, to dock and carry passengers. This was an unparalleled feat of architectural foresight, considering the difficulties in design and construction associated with such an effort. 

According to Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s book, “The Mooring Mast,” the engineers had to design the building to accommodate an air mooring mast, a 140 - foot tall metal structure designed to serve as a docking station for airships. This required the engineers to plan the building not only with the necessary structural integrity and solid steel framework to support the large airships, but also to ensure that the elevated mooring mast had a secure and stable foundation. In addition, the building had to be tall enough to ensure that the mast was tall enough so that the doors of the airships were able to reach the mooring platform.

The design of the mooring mast was also meticulous; it had to not only support heavy airships, but also the weight of passengers and baggage that disembarked onto the platform. Additionally, the mast and its foundation had to be strong enough to withstand winds and gusts without bending and providing a stable environment when mooring. To further complicate matters,
