I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a fundamental right," wrote the letter, according to the Post.

"In the coming years, both universities will be required to issue the best possible education and to ensure proper access for all students. Such changes should be accompanied by public interest education and an end to the threat to free expression."

"While there is a need for changes in the way these libraries operate, I believe those who want to ensure fair and effective education have got to the middle ground in the pursuit of a more just and accessible future," reads the letter, published Friday, according to the Washington Post.

Baroness Bercow, a member of the House Public Library Board, pointed out that the letter included a quote from the school's own report on what it called censorship and "deceptive" materials posted online after September 11.

"By and large the [library] board doesn't want to see an impact on the school's core academic mission or the quality of services provided there or any kind of change that might have an impact on what would otherwise be a vibrant, inclusive community," she wrote.
