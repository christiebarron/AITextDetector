Dear Editor:

As technology advances, computers can be found everywhere in our fast-paced lives. But computers are not always beneficial to people. They can have varying effects, both positive and negative, on our lives.

On one hand, computers make our lives more efficient and reduce the amount of time we have to spend on mundane tasks. They can store thousands of pieces of information in an instant and have the ability to allow us to communicate with anyone on the other side of the planet. This undeniable convenience allows us to stay connected with friends and family, even if they are not nearby.

However, computers come with drawbacks. They can become addictive and unconscious bias can also be present as they can be programmed with biased opinions. In addition to this, some people might see computers as a source of entertainment rather than a helpful piece of technology, leading to procrastination and reliance on them in our day-to-day lives.

Overall, although computers have their benefits, the negatives can outweigh the positives if we do not use them in moderation. We should be aware of how computers can impact our lives and actively strive to use them in a way that benefits us, rather than becomes detrimental.
