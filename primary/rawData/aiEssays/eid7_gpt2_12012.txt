An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my little sister who was in my class at the time and when I saw her it was like she was a real human being. I couldn't have imagined how much she would have done to change the world and I think for a man she was a real blessing. I think her sacrifice gave her a lot of strength and happiness and she really did have a heart I'd never had in a woman's life.

So if you're ever on Facebook you will usually see pictures of a woman and a friend who was a part of someone's lives because if you could identify the one person you would always like the people who know and want to improve, when you have someone of your own. And it really isn't until you're really lucky that you have a person who is really close to you who comes out of the blue.

So I think what is actually the challenge for women on Facebook is is the fact that this is being shared. If we do our job and if we are really strong and that's what we're doing, it has to be something that women are doing, something they are capable of. Maybe this is something women feel maybe they feel more secure than their partners are doing. And my wife is an amazing support person, she's doing the talking and she's giving me that Payne is not one of the men I've seen on Facebook do.

And I know she's still very young,
