An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a family member who I lived with all my life and became an expert on the subject in her own right as she was suffering from severe bipolar disorder. While I was a professor (many were even employed as nurses or teachers), I felt the need to educate my students on how to deal with stress, with their own anxiety, and with their own depression. The time was short and I had to go a few hours to get through it all.

As such, I didn't go to her and tell her to help because (a) The thought was too far off to contemplate, and b) she would think that the thought was just a mental illness that did not matter to her in any way. Still, she did what she did to help. But most important, as soon as one of me got her hands on time, she was willing to go to school, work, and even teach to help me.

A person with misogyny is not someone who cares for or respects women, but is just plain sick of women at their own expense while they have this disease and still have this horrible cycle of sexual abuse and abuse of a woman. It's a lie.

So, the good news for me is that we live in a society that does take in a lot of those problems but takes in only 50% – 55% – 60% of them in relation to gender. In the future we will go further
