Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. In today's world, computers are increasingly becoming an essential part of our daily lives. They are used for everything from work and education to entertainment and socializing.

I believe that computers have had a largely positive influence on our society. Computers have made it easier for us to access information and have enabled us to more easily and quickly communicate with each other. They have also helped to level the playing field; small businesses can now manage complex operations with little more than a laptop, and students can access information from anywhere with an Internet connection.

However, there are some potential downsides to the use of computers. Children and teenagers, in particular, can get lost in the world of computing, spending too much time playing video games or browsing the Internet. It can prevent them from developing into well-rounded adults.

Overall, I believe that the advantages of computers far outweigh the potential drawbacks. They have opened up a world of knowledge and entertainment for us, while also helping us to stay connected with each other.

I encourage readers to take a look around their communities and appreciate the positive impact computers have had.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
