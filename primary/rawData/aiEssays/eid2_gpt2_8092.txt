I believe that censorship of materials in libraries, but without proper control of this content, makes it hard to promote the arts. A general theory of this objection is that the arts are, as such, subject to censorship. In other words, it is the general view of the public, as a whole, that we may never possess any right under the Constitution for the right to print any thing: a right we would never have in our own country under our own laws. And it, I must remind the Court, is not the view of most artists. Of the many people who have had a chance of being inspired to take the action of being a patron of free and open-access books and the like, the great majority have chosen to avoid that subject. The great majority, not because they want books, nor because they want to stop reading them, but because by a "moral judgment," "a free choice," or even simply because others cannot afford to, they have accepted and acquiesced to this censorship, as a natural and natural feature of the American social system, even as much as the whole of humanity does. It is, rather, an appeal to the "rightness" of a people to make use of the freedom of others, and to the "rightness" of the "right" to public education, even as to say publicly that any public or private teaching is "right," even as to say that it is necessary and necessary, and that free speech is a right,
