The project of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building in New York City has long been a vision of architects and builders alike, yet the road to realizing said accomplishment was wrought with obstacles that needed to be surmounted in order for it to become a reality. The mooring mast erected atop the Empire State Building was not only an extraordinary feat of engineering, but it was also a testament to the resourcefulness and dedication of those that designed and built it. The engineers behind the project faced numerous challenges in bringing their dream to fruition.

One of the largest difficulties faced by the Empire State Building builders was the logistics of bringing the dirigibles to the top of the building. To accomplish this feat, the engineers designed a large, heavy steel mast that needed to be constructed and raised piece-by-piece from the top of the building to the roof, before it could be attached to the observation deck. The mast was over 300 feet long and weighed more than 4,000 pounds, so the feat of transporting it to the rooftop was an accomplishment unto itself.

Another obstacle faced by the Empire State Building builders was the Strength of the mast required to safely moor the dirigibles. The weight of a full-sized dirigible was considerable and the mooring mast had to be able to withstand the stress placed on it when a dirigible was secured. To ensure the mast was able to safely accommodate the dirigibles, the engineers had to use
