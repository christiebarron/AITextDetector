Narciso Rodriguez’s memoir From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives is a passionate ode to the everyday people, experiences, and places that have molded him into the celebrated designer he is today. Through vivid imagery and storytelling, Rodriguez creates a mood of tenderness, nostalgia, and appreciation for the small details. 

The memoir’s pages are filled with remembrances of Rodriguez’s childhood growing up in Hoboken and Long Beach, places with which he is still deeply connected today. He recounts the vivid colors of his family’s garden, the warmth of his grandmother’s embrace, and the clanking of silverware and conversation at the dinner table. Through these details he vividly recreates the fondness he feels for his family’s home, creating a sense of sentimentality and nostalgia. 

Rodriguez also creates a mood of appreciation for the artisans and craftspeople who shaped his life and career. He writes of the women in his family who were his earliest teachers in the concepts of fabric and texture, and of the apprentices and ateliers from whom he learned the fundamentals of high-end design. Rodriguez pays homage to the countless individuals who were such an influence on his development as a designer, the people who have gone from being nameless inspirations to friends and collaborators.

From Home also celebrates the diversity of the places and cultures that make up the tapestry of Rodriguez
