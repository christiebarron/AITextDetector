I recently had an opportunity to demonstrate my patience. I was on-call for a customer service job and was constantly having to answer the same questions from different customers throughout the call. Despite the monotony of the job, I knew each customer deserved my patience and respect. 

I never wanted to rush the customer and instill any feelings of incompetence. Because of this, I would take the time to explain the process to them multiple times, in multiple ways, until they fully understood. It was hard to stay focused and patient, but I knew it was important.

Most customers would thank me for taking the time to explain things clearly and thoroughly. I was really proud of myself for staying patient and professional throughout those calls. For me, it was the least I could do.
