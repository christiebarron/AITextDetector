The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' by the author will make its way towards release next month.

The movie explores the early days of "The Black Swan," how the author fell deeply in love with "The Twilight Zone" director J.A. Bayona, and how his role in the film was both successful and risky.

In addition, a record-breaking fourth year for The Black Swan was set in the year 2000.

In 2001, a third year ended with the release of $9 billion in domestic box office revenue. In 2013, a fourth year marked another $42 million of gross. Overall, the movie grossed $28.7 million.

The movie grossed over $35 million domestically and $26 million internationally in their first year.

The movie was shot in 12 locations throughout China, Korea, Vietnam, Singapore and the Philippines in 2013 and 2014.

'From Home Is' also features five separate endings and two sub-credits, making it the second and third in a trilogy of films, to chronicle the plot points of every ending, from the beginning up to the end.
