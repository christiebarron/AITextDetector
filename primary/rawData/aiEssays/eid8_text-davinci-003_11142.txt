I was standing in line at the grocery store, trying to keep my toddler entertained, when the person behind me spoke up.

“I bet you’ve been chasing that little one around all day, huh?” they asked with a smile.

At first I was taken aback, but then I felt a bubble of laughter well up inside me.

“Yes!” I said, laughing. “It feels like I’ve been chasing her around forever!”

As the conversation continued, the friendly stranger offered up tips that they had learned from raising their own children. We talked about our kids, and soon we were both doubled over with laughter.

The line was still incredibly long, but that didn’t matter. We had found a common bond, and that bond was laughter. When it was my turn to go, the cashier asked us to stop laughing.

But, honestly, it felt great to have a chance to just laugh with a stranger. It reminded me of the importance of laughter in relationships, and it made me appreciate the moment I shared with that person all the more.
