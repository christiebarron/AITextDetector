The ending of the poem is meant to be symbolic of the cycle of life. The narrator is referring to a test she failed earlier in the poem and has been trying to cope with the failure ever since. Just as winter turns to spring and the hibiscus comes back to life, she is encouraging herself to keep going and face her fears by taking the test again. By connecting her own struggles to the cycle of nature, the speaker is creating an inspiring message to not give up, no matter what life throws at you.
