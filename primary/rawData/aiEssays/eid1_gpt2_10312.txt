Computers have many effects on people. Most important, it slows the brain down. Scientists can use that in their research - perhaps with other tools for making better decisions. But for many people, when problems with computers are a concern, they can turn to technology to deal with them - something that helps them manage problems better. For example, you can make a software program that can do mathematical computations on real computer-generated data in such a way that it can also figure out what will happen to your life at a particular moment. That's called a "hard computation" and it can help you. It doesn't really know exactly what happens to your life, so it would be very difficult, to say, "Well, look at what'll happen, give me the time to take all these steps, and I won't die. It's the same as seeing blood on the ground - that's a much harder hard computation. All the people who have ever used computing are now used to looking at numbers, by definition, in computing applications. The computing applications are really very, very big, and the processing that goes on under them is very, very massive".

The researchers are now going further. Researchers at Harvard University's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory have done this by using a machine to do one of three things: computerise a hard-core task like counting a number - like a calculator, to see if you can find the digits. It actually works in a real game
