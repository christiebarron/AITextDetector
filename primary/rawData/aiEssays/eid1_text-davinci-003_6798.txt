Dear Editor, 

I'm writing to share my opinion on how computers have impacted people's lives both positively and negatively. 

Computers are ubiquitous in the modern age, and there is no denying their usefulness. Computers make it easier to communicate with people around the world, share resources, collaborate on projects, and gain access to an immense amount of information quickly. Additionally, through the internet, computers provide entertainment such as movies, podcasts, and games. 

On the other hand, computers can have a detrimental effect on people's lives. Too often they are turned to for entertainment or distraction, leading to a decreased quality of life in comparison to meaningful activities that don't involve screens. Additionally, increased use of computers may lead to an increased level of disconnectedness from the environment and nature. Moreover, issues such as cyberbullying, online predators, and cybercrimes can become serious issues if people do not take the necessary precautions when using computers or online. 

In my opinion, computers can have a valuable impact on people's lives, so long as they're used in moderation. It's important to recognize the potential risks and remain conscious of how much time is being spent online so as to avoid a negative effect on one's mental and physical well-being. Balancing time spent online with meaningful face-to-face activities is a smart way to reap the positive benefits of computer use while avoiding the potentially detrimental effects of too much screen time.
