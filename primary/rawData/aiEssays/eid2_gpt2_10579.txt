I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is not a solution or appropriate policy for the freedom of speech and expression and those who use it, should stop doing so altogether," Filippo told the Vatican website.

The pontiff also criticized "anti-communist and anti-globalization [and] political-social policies and policies," particularly by Israel.

The Pope said that a world divided by economic conflict, social discord, and racial and religious tensions should not be allowed to lead to a world without free expression.

"The truth is that free expression is not a luxury in a free society. It is necessary to the human well-being of everyone, and we cannot allow a nation of people led by individuals to allow the political will of the people and society to dictate to others how citizens are supposed to see things," Pope Francis told his group at the Pontifical Academy for Religious Studies in Rome.
