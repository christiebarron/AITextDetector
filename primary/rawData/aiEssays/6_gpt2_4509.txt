The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. It is one of the few types of vehicle that cannot reach a crane's control section. To the delight of the authorities, building authorities decided that the controls and brake system had to be moved so that the aircraft could move in the exact same direction.

The second obstacle was the lack of an elevator shaft, which could not even open. The elevator had no air shaft; it was covered with steel bars and wheels. The builders had previously seen how an engineer would use a steel spring. Now that they were able to control an elevator, why bother taking the trouble of opening it and lowering the car to get on? It should have been simple. Building a horizontal bar from your car's right-hand end to your vehicle's left-hand end would have helped. The problem was that when one of the bars goes up in space and out to the left, one of the sides is left-hand, creating a potential vertical error of 90Â°. Therefore, you had to go a certain way to get the bar in the right position.

The engineers were able to correct this problem by using an air intake duct to cut out a hole through the car's left engine shaft. However, it is still unclear how big the hole was and why it was so large. The engineers found a better solution, and decided to add a gas exhaust to the engine compartment. Once this work is completed,
