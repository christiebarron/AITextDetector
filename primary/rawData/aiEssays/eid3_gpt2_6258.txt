Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

The settings in this page will set various "rough" roads by the distance travelled if an accident occurred in the riding area.


The rough roads in this page are not "rough", which includes roads that are very busy with traffic and roads that cannot be run for a week. Examples of roads with roundabouts are marked for road closures, or closed roads and they are not as closed as a roundabout.


The rough road in this page was first introduced in 2012 by J.K. Meegan and was introduced for road safety. We also update these pages regularly to improve the ability of cyclists to maintain safe driving and using road surfaces safely.
