The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Most of these obstacles stemmed from the sheer size and height of the building, as well as the fact that the interior of the building was not well-suited for accommodating the large airships.

The first challenge the builders of the Empire State Building faced was finding a place to house the mooring mast, which was necessary for an anchor point to accommodate the dirigibles. In order for the mast to be effective, it needed to be at least 300 feet high and have a wide enough radius for the airships to safely approach. Doing so had to be done in a way that would not interfere with the existing infrastructure of the building, and the builders were unable to install it on the rooftop due to the structure’s height. The builders of the Empire State Building also faced the challenge of accommodating the airships in the interior of the building. Dirigibles were too large to fit within the building’s framing, which presented a number of safety hazards. Finding a suitable place within the existing building or new space that had to be added to the building for the airships to dock proved to be an arduous task.

The builders of the Empire State Building met these challenges head-on, installing a mooring mast along the north side of the building’s exterior and allowing interior space to accommodate the docking of dirigibles. This
