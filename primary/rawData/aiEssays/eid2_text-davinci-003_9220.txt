Dear Editors, 

I am writing to express my views on censorship in libraries and whether certain materials should be removed from shelves if they are found to be offensive. As a supporter of the principles of free speech, I believe that censorship of library material should be avoided where possible.

Though some may argue that materials like books, music, movies and magazines that contain offensive content should be removed from library shelves, I disagree. In an ideal world, we would all not be exposed to offensive materials, however, I disagree with the practice of censorship because it undermines the fundamental freedom of speech that underlines democracy. Censorship limits the freedoms of literature, and by extension, the arts as a whole. Furthermore, it undermines the basic principles of library work which is to preserve and make accessible the cultural and intellectual record of our society.

There are other ways to address the challenge of offensive content in libraries. It is not necessary to ban materials in order to protect readers from offensive content. Library staff could, for instance, provide guidance on reading materials, more carefully regulate the types of material that are available for loan, or display a label indicating that the book contains offensive content. 

Outright censorship of library materials undermines the knowledge that should be shared and preserves. It is my hope that censoring library materials can be avoided, in the interest of a healthy practice of democracy.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
