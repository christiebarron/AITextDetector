I remember one time when I was grocery shopping and the checkout line was extremely long. I was getting frustrated and anxious as I watched the slow moving line grow longer. I was about to give up and leave, but I decided to try and remain patient.

So, I took a deep breath and reminded myself that the line was moving along as quickly as it could and that everyone was just doing their best. I began to focus on the positive; like the beautiful music that was playing in the store and the friendly laughter of those around me. 

I eventually made it to the front of the line and made my purchase. I was so proud of myself for being patient and not allowing my anxieties to take over.
