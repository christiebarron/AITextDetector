I had always considered myself the opposite of an entertainer. I was more reserved and never the center of attention. But this changed when I met Jake. He was the life of the party and always had a joke or two up his sleeve. He inevitably brought out the life of the party in me, too. 

One night, we were out to dinner with a few of our friends. We had all been having a good time talking and catching up. But then Jake cut loose. He did an impersonation of our waiter that had everyone laughing uncontrollably, and as the night went on, he kept everyone in stitches. I loved it and joined right in with the laughs.

As the night progressed, I realized something. Jake had not done his impersonation so much for entertainment; he had done it to bring us all together and make us laugh. He wanted us to have a good time. I felt a powerful connection to him in that moment and a deep appreciation for his ability to make everyone around him feel less like strangers and more like friends. 

In that moment, I realized that laughter really is the shortest distance between two people.
