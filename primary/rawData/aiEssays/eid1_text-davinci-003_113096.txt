Dear Editor, 

As computers become increasingly ubiquitous in our daily lives, there has been much debate over their effects on people. I believe computers can have both positive and negative implications for our lives.

On the positive side, computers have become a powerful tool for knowledge, communication and entertainment. Computers can help us find information instantly and increase our productivity. Furthermore, with the development of social media, people are now able to connect and communicate more frequently and easily online.

However, computers can also be detrimental to our lives. Too much time spent on computers can lead to health ailments such as eyestrain, bad posture, and carpal tunnel syndrome. Additionally, excessive use of computers can lead to increased levels of stress, loneliness, and even depression.

In my view, computers should be used in moderation in order to optimize their positive effects while minimizing the negative. We should be aware of how much time we spend on computers and make sure we get enough exercise and socialize with friends and family.

In conclusion, computers can have both positive and negative impacts on our lives. It is important that we use them in moderation in order to reap the rewards of their many benefits while avoiding their negative effects. 

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
