The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' had been very emotional as she had been raised with an alcoholic father.


'I read it after two or three months,' she said. '[You never read too much again]. The only way to stop it was to stop eating a lot of sugar, then stop drinking it.'

It was a sobering journey for Ms Siegel, who became a father, but when she took the book as a first-class student she thought she would make it. She has two older sons, but when it came time for a 'personal transformation' she was surprised it was nothing like that.

And then she was hooked.

'I was a little girl when I read it, but my children did the same.'

And in a year of writing 'From Home is', Ms Siegel wrote one of the best-selling novels of the 1980s, 'The Great Blackout,' one that could only have been produced by a teenager.

It has become the ultimate celebration of the black community around the world.

It has led to the release of several million free copies of the book, though in Australia there are no free downloads.


But when you're young, as Ms Siegel is, it can take a while for young young women to realise these ideals. 'You can't change the world of people. People are too young to make mistakes,' she said.
