The cyclist should lifter the left and centre tyres slightly to make sure that they are perpendicular.

If the rider chooses to go left, the position of both the left and right tyres, including the cycle direction (the bike's tyre position) is selected in this way

Climbing the bike and setting the position of both the left and right tyre must also be done.
