The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, there was a concern for the safety of spectators at large displays. The Federal government would prohibit people who held fireworks from being seen in official state and local venues. Second, a small percentage of public and private establishments operated by residents who didn't live in the building in order to have a safe and accessible experience. Third, even some local theaters and venues often had to keep patrons away, such as private nightclubs, bars and restaurants. In short, the Federal government didn't seem happy with the permitting process because for a number of years, exhibitors were not permitted to take part in an exhibit that had a significant public interest.

And most importantly, the Federal government didn't like to grant special permits for specific exhibitions. All those types of exhibitions were illegal. When the Federal government put a ban on the display of the Great Wall in 1924 due to a lack of budget funds, some of the most prominent exhibitionists who lived in the building went away in the '50s.

With that said, those theaters and clubs have changed a bit. Many of the venues are now dedicated to performing the Great Wall story, but have also relocated themselves from the Federal government to other locations where the federal government's activities are minimal. They are still more open-minded about the role of government in these events.
