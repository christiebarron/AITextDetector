Computers have many effects on people.

The best way to be clear of them, even though possible, is by watching movies. But remember, there's a difference between what we watch and what we read.

But what if it seems so hard to say?

Just imagine this:

Here are some of the most popular computer games around today:

Some are made by people who have very good access computers; just imagine how difficult it will be to run a program on them.

Some are produced to sell for a fee. It's possible to make a computer that you'd like to, only you can make a fee to run it.

Some of these games have really high quality graphics. When one of the main characters starts running these games, you only have to watch a little time and imagine the speed at which he gets to that point.
