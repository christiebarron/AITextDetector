I was in the long checkout line at the grocery store feeling really impatient. Everyone was moving so slowly and I just wanted to get my food and get back home. I noticed an elderly couple at the end of the line and as soon as I saw them, I noticed how fragile the man appeared. The woman carefully helped him out of his coat and he slowly stepped forward. The line was moving so slowly that it took them a really long time to reach the checkout stand.

As I watched them, I noticed how patient the woman was with the man. He fumbled through his wallet for his payment card and she gently helped him out. She asked the cashier to take their time and to help them however they needed. Even when the man got confused by the payment, she reassured him and kept going until the whole process was done.

In that moment, I realized that one of the most important things in life is being patient. The woman's patience and kindness had a real impact on me, and I vowed to never forget it.
