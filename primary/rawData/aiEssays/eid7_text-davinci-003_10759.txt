I was recently in line at the local grocery store waiting to check out. The cashier was having some technical issues with the scanner, and it was taking a very long time for her to get each item through. As other customers began to get impatient, I decided to take a deep breath and remember that these things happen. 

I made small talk with the woman behind me in line to pass the time. We talked about the weather and shared stories about our lives. I could feel the frustration in the air, but I did my best to reassure her that these types of situations are to be expected.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the cashier was able to complete the transaction and the woman and I exited the store. I was proud of myself for remaining calm and patient during the ordeal, and I realized that it was an important lesson in taking things as they come.
