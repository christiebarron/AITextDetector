Computers have many effects on people. It's common sense that when one gets to where the majority of the software is coming from it is probably most effective if you are the author of it. For software, you need to learn what the people are trying to understand and then to make the best use of that knowledge to create good software. It's just not done well. It's done well in research because you need all the people involved in it to understand the problems, to understand the technical aspects and then to make the best use possible. And you need an understanding of the problems you're trying to solve and not too many people have that knowledge.
