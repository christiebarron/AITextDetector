I love to laugh and so does my boyfriend, Bob. We often joke around and enjoy each other's company whenever we're together.

One of our favorite memories happened while we were out at a restaurant one night. We'd been there for a while, enjoying our meals and catching up on life when I noticed something funny. I'd gotten a chip in my food and it resembled the shape of a turtle.

As soon as I saw it I started to laugh, which soon enough caused Bob to start laughing too. We just couldn't stop and pretty soon everyone in the restaurant was looking at us. We were both embarrassed, but it was truly a special moment that I'll never forget.

We eventually settled down, but a few times during the meal Bob would glance at the chip and start to chuckle again. It was a simple, silly moment shared between us that brought us closer together. 

Laughter may be the shortest distance between two people, but it can build a bridge between two hearts, too.
