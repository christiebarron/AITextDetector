I was at my grandmother's house for lunch one Sunday, and the food wasn't quite ready yet. Everyone else was getting antsy, but I knew that my grandmother had been up since dawn preparing the meal and it was nearly done. So when my cousins started to complain, I stayed silent and just waited. I was patient, understanding that the food was almost ready and that my grandmother deserved a break, not the added pressure of trying to hurry up. I could see it in her face that she really appreciated my patience. After a few more minutes, the food was ready and we enjoyed the delicious meal.
