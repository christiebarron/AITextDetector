In Joe Kurmaski's poem, "Rough Road Ahead," the features of the setting have a significant effect on the cyclist. The setting of the poem is a forest road, which serves as a metaphor for the cyclist's journey. The road is described as "treacherous and winding," and these adjectives suggest the difficulty and danger of the cyclist's journey. This implies that the cyclist will be facing a great challenge, which could mean both physical difficulty and emotional difficulty. 

The poem also mentions nature's elements like "the fog and the wind," setting a mood of ambivalence and uncertainty. The fact that the cyclist is on an isolated, forest road also establishes a sense of solitude, as it suggests that the cyclist is all alone in their struggles. This further implies that whatever the cyclist is facing, they must face it alone, without the support of others. 

The features of the setting represent the obstacles the cyclist will face. The dangerous, winding road serves as a challenge, a test of their strength and capabilities. The fog and wind represent the ever-present uncertainty that will accompany the cyclist. And the solitude of the road conveys the idea that the cyclist must face their struggles without external help. Taken together, these elements show that the cyclist is facing a difficult journey, and that success will only come through perseverance and determination.
