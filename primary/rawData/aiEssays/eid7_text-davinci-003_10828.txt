I remember a time when I was in kindergarten and I was very excited to go to recess. Everyone was getting in line to go out and I was standing there with my friend, talking and laughing about a silly joke. Suddenly, Mrs. Dorman, my teacher, called my name loudly and let me know that I needed to go back to my desk. I was confused and felt embarrassed in front of my friends, especially as my teacher wasn't being very kind in her tone. My friend and I had forgotten to take care of an errand that my teacher had asked us to do while we were getting ready for recess. 

Despite the fact that I was embarrassed and confused, I tried to stay patient and composed. I didn't let my emotions take over and I kept my composure. I calmly walked back to my desk and did what I was asked to do. After taking care of the task, I was allowed to return to the line and join the rest of my friends for recess.

That experience taught me the value of showing patience and understanding, and of staying composed even when things don't go as planned. In the end, it worked out well and I was able to go to recess anyway. I'm glad I was patient, because that was an important lesson I learned that day.
