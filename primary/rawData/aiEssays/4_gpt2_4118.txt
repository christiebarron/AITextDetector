The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because the characters grow as characters start to look at their own past lives and they are not afraid to bring up some of their previous lives for fun, something that is the reason they begin the whole thing with the title. The author's tone works great for introducing new characters to the world and for introducing new people to stories in a meaningful way.
