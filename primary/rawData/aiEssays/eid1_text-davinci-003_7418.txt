The ending of Winter Hibiscus reflects the themes of hope and perseverance that are present throughout the story. The protagonist is looking to her hibiscus flower as a symbol of all the struggles she has to go through while enduring a school year. This metaphor allows her to use nature to represent her inner strength and resilience. Every spring, the snow melts and the geese come back, representing a fresh start for the protagonist. She uses this imagery to illustrate her own desire to keep trying and not give up on her studies. Thus, the ending of the story conveys the idea of never losing hope in difficult times and always pushing forward to better oneself.
