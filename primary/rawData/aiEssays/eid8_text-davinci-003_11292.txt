I was on a flight from London to San Francisco when I saw an elderly couple sitting down in the row across from me. To my surprise, they seemed to be talking to each other in overlapping sentences, finishing each other's sentences with joyful laughter that spilled into the aisle. 

It was an undeniably cute and infectious display of companionship that I hadn't seen in some time. After a while, I couldn't help but to inadvertently eavesdrop on their conversation, which was mostly filled with reminiscing about all the things they'd experienced over the years. 

I was especially taken aback when the elderly gentleman started singing an old tune. His crooning was a bit off key but that was part of the charm. Both the man and his wife were laughing and pointing at each other while singing snatches of lyrics. 

As I watched their silly antics, I couldn't help but crack a smile. Pretty soon I was chuckling along with them from my spot in the plane, invited to join the conversation albeit from afar. 

When the man and his wife eventually settled down, a few other travelers in our section of the plane had started joining in the merriment. We all exchanged cheerful smiles and waves, grateful for the shared moment on a long flight.

Laughter really is the shortest distance between two people. And that plane trip definitely proved the power of laughter and how it can bring unknown strangers together.
