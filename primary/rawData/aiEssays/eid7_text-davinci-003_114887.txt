I remember a time when I was waiting in a long line at the grocery store. It was a particularly busy day, and I had to wait in a line of over fifteen people. The line was barely moving, and I thought it would take forever to get to the front. 

However, despite the long wait, I chose to remain patient. I didn't let my frustrations show, and I stayed in line in good spirits. After a few minutes, I noticed that a couple in front of me were also struggling with the wait. They were tapping their feet, commenting on how long it was taking, and I could tell that they were growing increasingly agitated.

Rather than getting annoyed as well, I decided to help them out. I started a conversation with them, asking them how their day was going so far. We discussed the weather, and which items we were after in the store. The conversation helped to pass the time, and distracted us from the length of the line. 

By the time we got to the front, we were all in much better spirits. I felt proud of myself for staying patient and helping the couple out. It was a reminder that sometimes the best way to deal with difficulties is simply by being patient.
