I remember the time I was babysitting my nephew at the grocery store. He was really fussy that day and kept running out of sight and into all sorts of things. Everyone around us was giving me strange looks and I started to get really frustrated and embarrassed. 

However, I managed to take a few deep breaths and remind myself that he was only two years. I smiled at everyone else in the store and told myself to be patient. I took his hand and spent some extra time in each aisle, helping him pick out his favorite snacks and talking him through his tantrums. Eventually, we got through the store without any additional fuss! 

I was really proud of myself for being patient with my nephew. I felt like I had grown a lot and learned how to handle difficult situations in a calm and understanding way.
