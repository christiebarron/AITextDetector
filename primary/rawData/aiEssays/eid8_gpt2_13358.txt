One time I experienced laughter in my life was when one of our girls screamed. There were several girls and people, from all across Ireland, who screamed in front of us and others heard shouts for help. We didn't know where or what was happening. When an ambulance came by, we felt very helpless and confused. I was standing next to one of the girls who was still bleeding, we tried to talk her out of it but her mother came by. As we sat there in our room we suddenly realized that we had had no response and, in fact, we were about to be called out to the hospital for help immediately afterwards. The ambulance was waiting for us in the small room. I stood outside of the ambulance and tried to pull her out but no one could. We were so confused about who would be the next one and then we heard the sound of crying people screaming for help, my friends and relatives rushed to help. We are so traumatized and we couldn't even remember their names, who they were or where they had been.

There were 10 other girls we knew from Northern Ireland who have all gone to hospital following a similar experience. One of the girls was suffering from a terminal condition, the other girl was in very poor health at the time she went into emergency surgery. They could not tell us where they were that their mother (she stayed with them even without their help) or from where they had all gone. No one would help if something went wrong at
