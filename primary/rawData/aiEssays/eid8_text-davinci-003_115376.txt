It had been a long and stressful day at work, so when I got home the last thing I was expecting was to start laughing, much less laughing hysterically. But that's exactly what happened.

My long-time friend Naomi had come over for a visit, and to my surprise had brought her new puppy with her! Naomi told me the funny story of how she had adopted the puppy just that morning, and I couldn't help but laugh at the absurdly cute but clumsy antics of the little pooch. We sat for what felt like hours, laughing and telling puppy stories. 

The laughter was so infectious that I couldn't help but smile, even when the stories trailed off and the puppy had gone to sleep. Naomi and I just couldn't stop looking at each other and shaking our heads in disbelief at the funny little things that the pup had done - it was pure silliness.

We both agreed it had been far too long since we had just laughed together, letting go of all our troubles and creating this moment that we would treasure for the rest of our lives. That moment reminded me of something very important in any relationship - that laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people!
