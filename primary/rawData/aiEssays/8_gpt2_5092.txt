One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I witnessed the destruction and destruction of Auschwitz which was taking place in the prison camp, in the early morning hours. When I first walked to the edge of the camp, I saw the whole building, and the barracks, before and after the explosion. There were enormous houses and buildings and columns which were all engulfed in smoke. We did not see that from two stories apart. I couldn't stand any more of the smoke. Then I saw the smoke pouring out of every one of those buildings that had fallen into the air.

Then I went to the gas chambers, and I saw an enormous, terrible mass of corpses lying there. At the time of the first day of execution, in the fall of the camp, about 50,000 people died. And that was around May 4th. The day of the second place, on May 17th, 1943, at the beginning of May, they were 100,000. That was around August 4th, 1944, and the first post-war camp was set up for 528 people.

In 1944, on September 10th, 1944, at the beginning of December, they were set at about 500,000. That was in 1944.

So it was not really unusual that we had so many people. There were only 25 or 30,000, maybe 60,000 people there. And it wasn't even unheard of that we saw so tremendous bloodshed in the camp.
