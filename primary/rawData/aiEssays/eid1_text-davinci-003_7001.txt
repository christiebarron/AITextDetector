Dear Editor, 

As a librarian and a devoted patron of this community’s library, I feel obliged to weigh in on the debate about censorship in libraries. Do certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, deserve to be removed from the library’s shelves if they are found offensive? 

Public libraries play a vital role in society as a bastion of information and an access point to different perspectives. By stocking materials some may deem offensive, this provides readers with the opportunity to critically engage with the subject matter and form their own opinions. Not only that, but libraries serve as a platform for authors and creators to share their stories—stories that could challenge readers’ views, or even inspire them.  Restricting access to certain materials, even if they are offensive, has the potential to suppress the open exchange of ideas. 

There are some who would argue that access to these materials aren’t crucial for education and intellectual growth, but that is simply not the case. In fact, many controversial materials such as the now-infamous “Harry Potter” series have poured tremendous amounts of both financial and critical success into libraries across the world. In educational settings, access to different perspectives can help introduce students to more complex topics, cultivate critical thinking skills, and develop an understanding of the nuanced world of censored and oppressive societies. 

I understand that some material might be deemed as offensive or obscene
