The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

The government in Rome, for example, did not consider the idea that some parts of the building could become so rigid they would interfere with navigation or air traffic. In Britain, on the other hand, the British government saw the use of dirigibles as part of its policy for transport, and thought that the government should make it a priority for all planning purposes.

In addition, it had a large number of "stereotype" cars, which could drive away from any particular locationâ€”some of which could make the trip from nearby London without leaving the buildings at all.

This was all the more baffling to the planners since there were other routes to visit that could be mooted in the future, including to China, where some areas were already used as a major hub for travel and trade.

But the plan worked well to gain approval to build a world-class hotel, not only for the imperial city, but also for the Roman Empire. The hotel was built in one of the most luxurious cities in Rome, and was constructed in a similar way as the Empire State Building and is available in the capital. (For more on the architecture of this building see "The Roman Empire in Modern Buildings").

As for the dirigibles themselves, it appears that the designers have been working carefully at the beginning of the development cycle, with the first models being laid
