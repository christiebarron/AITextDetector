The builders of the Empire State Building faced daunting obstacles in responding to a seemingly simple request: allowing dirigibles, or airships, to dock at the building’s mast. The vast majority of engineering plans at the time simply could not accommodate the new form of transportation, raising several critical questions. These obstacles included the engineering of an acceptable mast to accept a mooring line, developing a safe landing procedure, and the downstream effects of increased traffic on the building itself. 

The first obstacle that architects and aviation engineers had to surmount was the engineering of the mooring mast itself. The ideal solution was to create a 100-foot mast at the Empire State Building. This mast needed to cary a large mooring ring that could effectively carry the force of the airship’s mooring line. Multiple designs were created, but all had to resist the strain of the wind and the tethering loads of the airships. 

A second obstacle was developing an effective landing process. The Empire State Building was located in the heart of Manhattan, an incredibly populated area. Keeping the safety of the public and the passengers in mind, it had to be guaranteed that not only could the building moor the airships, but that it could also do so without the danger of any crash landing. It was determined that the airship would have to settle slowly down onto the roof of the building. 

The last obstacle that had to be
