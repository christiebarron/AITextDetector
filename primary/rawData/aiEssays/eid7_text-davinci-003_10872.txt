I remember one time, I was attempting to teach my younger sister how to ride a bike. She was having a lot of difficulty getting the hang of it, and kept falling off. I could see she was getting frustrated, but I stayed patient and gave her lots of encouragements and tips to improve her technique.

Finally, after a lot of practice, she was able to stay upright and peddle a few feet without toppling over! She was absolutely beaming with pride, and I was so proud of her for not giving up. It was a great moment and made me realize how important it is to stay patient when teaching others something new.
