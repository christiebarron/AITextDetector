The construction of the Empire State Building was an ambitious feat for its time. The building was intended to have the capacity to dock dirigibles, making it an even more impressive achievement. From the start, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

The first obstacle was the structure of the building itself. Standard dirigibles of the time were large and filled with potentially combustible hydrogen gas, which required the mooring mast to be strong enough to support the dirigible without damage. To avoid the risk of fire, the mooring mast also had to be constructed of non-combustible materials that were also structurally sound. Steel was chosen as the material to build the mooring mast, as it was strong enough to withstood the weight of several dirigibles at once. The challenge was to make the mast high enough to accommodate even the longest dirigible, yet small enough to fit on top of the Empire State Building.

The second obstacle was meeting the safety requirements of the aviation industry. Both the mast and the Empire State Building needed a reliable and dependable system for mooring dirigibles. A key part of this system was the Empire State Building’s specially designed anchorage system, which was designed to hold the dirigibles firmly in place without damaging them. The mast also included several safety features, including an “interlock mechanism” which prevented the
