The Empire State Building was envisioned as a skyscraper unlike any other, with the ability to essentially become a modern-day docking station for dirigibles. Despite the novel concept and exciting possibility, the ambitious project was faced with several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. This essay will explore the various difficulties faced by the builders of the Empire State Building as described in Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s The Mooring Mast.

The first major challenge faced by the Empire State Building’s constructers was constructing a tall enough mast on the skyscraper’s roof. Lüsted’s text states that masts reaching 400 feet were needed for larger dirigibles such as the Hindenburg to dock safely. Furthermore, the sheer height of the mast posed its own safety concerns, as calculations had to be done to ensure it would stand against strong winds.

The second obstacle was to determine the cable anchoring system to be used for the mooring mast, as it had to be strong enough to be able to anchor large dirigibles securely and safely. In this case, engineers had to find a way to compensate for the force of the dirigible’s wind pressure against the mast. This required further calculations and adjustment, and involved using strong anchoring cables to steady the mast and hold the dirigible in place.

The most difficult challenge, however, lay in the complexity of engineering a proper mooring station
