The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Among the challenges was the sheer size of the building, with its 8,000 square feet. "If you've got a building like this, you can build an Empire State Building only using a few sheets of steel and then the rest will still be solid," says Daniele Menezes, a project consultant and a structural engineer who worked on the Empire State Building project with M.I.G. Eriksson and Steven Sasso, both of the Chicago architecture department. The building's exterior walls were not ready for its time; the only option was to build on the lower portions of the building.

In the end, the Empire State Building was built without any solid steel. Building the buildingalan, which is made up of steel sheets, became a challenge, with the builders using a combination of mechanical and electrical methods to make the building work. The construction crew on board were determined to get in on the project and help the building undergo this process. Menezes and Sasso decided to build directly onto the building, and the plan was to build a high-Featured-Empire State-style structure out of reinforced concrete. But if it took five to six years on the project, the walls would be built on by June 2014. "But a lot of people will have to work six to seven years," Menezes says.
