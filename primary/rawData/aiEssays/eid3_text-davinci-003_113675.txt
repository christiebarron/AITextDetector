The features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead" significantly affect the cyclist's experience. First, the terrain of the road affects the cyclist's progress and performance on the ride. The road is described as “craggy” and “rock-strewn” with treacherous uphill inclines and dangerous descents, emphasizing the intense physical challenges that the cyclist must overcome if he is to make it to his destination.

The weather also plays a key role in the cyclist's experience. The reader is introduced to the cyclist appearing "like a weary warrior into a clearing after a long and difficult battle." This image helps to illustrate the physical strain that the cyclist has been subjected to due to exhausting weather conditions such as driving rain and gales of wind which whip over the road.

The time of day and night amplifies the cyclist's experience as the rider must suffer through extreme nightfall temperatures in order to reach his destination. The cyclist is faced with the "messy mess of stars" and a "moonless night" that makes the journey seem impossible.

Finally, the emotional state of the cyclist is affected by the setting. The challenging conditions of the road and weather combined with the beauty of the landscape give the cyclist a sense of determination and persistence in spite of the difficulties. This helps him to persevere and eventually reach his destination despite the long journey ahead of him.
