Computers have many effects on people. The first, known as Brain Drain, has resulted in a major increase in neurocognitive ability across the developing brain. The second, known as Hyperactivity Disorder, has resulted in heightened levels of negative energy-trapping chemicals in the brain that are known to interfere with the body's natural behavior, such as sleep, sleep in, emotions, sleep problems or anxiety. Most of these "hyperactivity disorders" can be identified because such chemicals are seen as an important tool used by the brain to help it to function better.

Many of the brain chemical changes linked to hyperactivity—such as changes in levels and behavior—are also known to affect how and when cells in the body develop energy-trapping chemicals called neurotransmitters. In particular, such changes interfere, in part, with the way certain tissues, such as the brain, "reproduce or activate" the energy and chemicals of cells, as well as with the release of them into the bloodstream. This causes brain changes that may be less disruptive than changes in the way parts of the body develop and respond to these chemicals.

Dr. John L. Rivey, a psychiatrist at New York University and author of "The Brain Works: Overcoming Deficits: Brain Structuring, Health and Stress in a Crisis," wrote in his book "Brain Works: Overcoming Deficits: How to Stop Your Brain from Compensating You for It," that "
