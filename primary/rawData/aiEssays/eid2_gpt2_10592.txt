I believe that censorship of materials in libraries and newspapers would not be tolerated. Those that are censored are those for which the public may be offended, or those who wish to share information with others."

"Censorship does not exist because it serves the interests of the government -- it doesn't exist because it serves the public safety, or because it is politically motivated," said Mr. Nafemi. "Many people, as well as some people who have read my blog, have questions, and they must ask the question of how the government could justify its actions to citizens who do not see it as a legitimate purpose."

Mr. Nafemi also noted, however, that libraries have often encouraged free expression for political purposes. He said libraries were open for business with a few exceptions. The government has sought to regulate their websites without any restrictions such as "personal expression."

One library library in New York City was forced to pay over $100,000 to cover a legal battle over political messages. When Mr. Bloomberg went to court on January 1, he did not defend the library's stance.

In April, New York City Public Library Director Projects and Advocates, Michael Ostrom, said that libraries were allowed to sell material in the library's collection that did not violate them, such as pictures of nude people or children, but, he added, the library did not "have such rights of political expression as the right to publish material in our collections."
