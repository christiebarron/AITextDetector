I believe that censorship of materials in libraries, media and other cultural institutions cannot have an effect. What is really happening at the hands of individuals, universities and government officials –plays a big role in determining its legality and morality – is precisely what is being challenged by people like me.

I am also going to call you out on your lack of respect for human rights – and the fact that your view is so clearly anti-democratic.

I don't think it can either. I am a young woman who believes freedom of expression will always be there. I think people need to give up that hope when it comes to freedom on a fundamental level. That is a point I have been making for some time. But now I want to say something more, as people all the time.

I think that is a very serious issue to put forward, but it also has a very important and urgent social dimension. So I need you to join me, for now, and I hope we will be on the same side.

Thank you.
