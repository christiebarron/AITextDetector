The Empire State Building was a major engineering feat of its time, and the addition of allowing dirigibles to dock was all the more impressive. However, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a great many obstacles in doing so. 

To begin with, there were the formidable structural challenges. Building an appropriate mast for the dirigibles to dock at was going to be no small feat. The structure was going to be incredibly tall, and also needed to remain stationary due to the nature of the docking procedure. As Marcia Amidon Lüsted describes in her book, The Mooring Mast, the “building’s chief engineer, Severin S. Svenson had to take several factors into account: the size and weight of the airships, wind direction, and the chances of a collision course” as these factors could all have disastrous effects on the docking procedure.

In addition to the engineering challenges, the builders of the structure also faced great financial obstacles. This was something never before attempted in the United States, and as a result they lacked much in the way of viable financial incentive. The cost of creating the mast, producing the necessary amounts of steel and other materials, what with the potential of the project to fail and the lack of promise for a return on investment, this was a necessary hurdle the builders had to overcome. 

The challenges also extended to the political sphere, as the Empire State Building needed permission from the state in
