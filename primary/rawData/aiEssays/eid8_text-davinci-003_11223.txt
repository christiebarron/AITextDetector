When my brother and I were children, we were both pretty mischievous and were known to get into mischief from time to time. We both loved practical jokes and were constantly trying to outdo each other with creative pranks.

One of our favorite pranks to play on each other was the old sneeze in the face trick. It was always funny, but things got out of hand one day when we were in the car together.

My brother began the prank by pretending to sneeze right in my face, but I wasn't having it. So I retaliate and let out a really loud, exaggerated sneeze in his face. We both erupted in laughter and good-naturedly teased each other for the rest of the ride. The tension that had been building between us due to our playfulness was instantly resolved with our shared laughter.

Laughter never fails to bring a little joy into our lives and strengthen our relationships. To this day, my brother and I always laugh whenever we recall the time that I sneezed in his face.
