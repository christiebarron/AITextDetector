The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho implies that the protagonist is taking an important test, likely namely the college entrance exam. Rather than focusing on the looming test, the protagonist has chosen to slow down and appreciate the beauty around them. The return of the geese in the spring, the melting snow and the budding hibiscus signify the passage of time and the blossoming of new life that comes with it. The protagonist appears hopeful that they will do better on the test after taking a moment to appreciate the beauty of nature.
