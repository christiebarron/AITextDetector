I remember the first time I met my husband. We were both attending a work conference in a small Italian village and were seated beside each other in one of the meetings. I noticed him right away, and we had a bit of a flirty conversation during the break.

When the meeting started again, he said something that made me laugh uncontrollably – I couldn't help it! Everyone stared and I felt embarrassed, but he just cracked up too. We both couldn't stop laughing, and I knew this was someone special.

We talked for hours that night after the conference. He said he felt the same connection that I did and that’s when I knew I wanted to spend more time with him.

We've been married for five years now and our relationship has only grown stronger. I'm so glad I laughed that night, it was the start of something great.
