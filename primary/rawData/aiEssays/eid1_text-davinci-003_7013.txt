The public library is an invaluable resource for education, entertainment, and community engagement. It is also an institution that should remain open and receptive to the publicâ€™s needs and desires. However, some people believe that books, music, movies, and magazines should be censored in libraries to protect people from potentially offensive content. Although a good intention, this kind of censorship is ultimately damaging to our community and its libraries.

Firstly, censorship in libraries goes against the fundamental principles of democracy and freedom. The public library should exist as a safe and welcoming space, where people can access a range of materials without fear of moral judgement. It is a place where the community can make their own decisions about what is right and wrong. By censoring certain materials, we would be denying this fundamental right to choose for ourselves. 

Secondly, libraries are more than just a place of entertainment. For many people, libraries are vital sources of information and knowledge. Censoring materials could deny access to information which would be invaluable to understanding a range of topics and issues. Removing certain books and magazine could also limit our access to different perspectives and ideas.

Lastly, censoring content in libraries often serves to protect those in power, not protect the defenceless. It creates an increasingly unequal society, where certain socio-economic groups have access to information that others do not. It has been proven that this kind of censorship can exclude the most vulnerable from understanding the issues and developments in society.
