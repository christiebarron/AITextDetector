The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it is still a work of fantasy and fairy lore. I know of no known stories such as it has yet to be written, but this book tells the way we need to live in the present. We are in this alternate future where we are given the power to change the world we live as we wished.

In the book. It is a story of people called, "Sisters of the Sun." The books tell us the truth and we as we live will choose, by what do we do, who we love and whom we want to be with the light. This is the beauty of The Winds of Winter. It is impossible not to ask, "why do they like these people more? How far do we go from these people without getting too close?" It is the story of how we can change, to change the world, the world of us. The sun is not just what the books say but more.

You will see all that is necessary for survival. The children who go to a family or college do well in school except in the fields of science, art, medicine, and religion. Children who are brought up in this future have the opportunities to develop and to learn from these people and change the world. I love writing my own stories and there are many books I would like to see published. I love my work and the love for stories from all the generations that I serve. I hope every
