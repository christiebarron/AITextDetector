It was the kind of joke that had us both doubled over with laughter. My friend and I had met up for lunch at a restaurant, and when the waiter delivered our food, he quipped something about "hope you enjoy your meal more than the last diners." We both thought it was hilarious, and it started us off on a shared laughter-filled lunch.

As we both finished our meals and put aside the leftovers, we couldn’t help but notice a couple at the next table. They were tightly holding hands and looked content in each other’s company. Without warning, my friend’s rib-tickling joke had both of us laughing too loud and too long, as we tried unsuccessfully to stifle our own laughter.

At first, we felt self-conscious, thinking that we were disturbing the couple at the adjacent table, but then I noticed that the man was looking at us with a mischievous twinkle in his eye. We soon discovered he was laughing too – it was just that the couple had been together for so long that he had simply forgotten how to laugh loudly.

The four of us then ended up in a great conversation, swapping stories of our own relationships and shared moments of joy and laughter. It was a wonderful afternoon, and I left feeling thankful for the reminder of how laughter can bridge any differences or distances between two people.
