Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people today. Although computers provide many benefits, I believe that computers can be a dangerous distraction if used irresponsibly.

It is undeniable that computers have improved work, made tasks more efficient, and broadened the capacity for communication. Positively, computers have opened opportunities for everyone to learn and to benefit from increased access to countless different types of information. However, the excessive use of computers can also take away from spending quality time with family and friends, leave people vulnerable to cyberbullying or online fraud, and lead to mental and physical health problems such as eyestrain, headaches, and poor sleep habits.

Therefore, it is important to responsibly use computers and to be mindful of the amount of time spent online. We must encourage balance in our childrenâ€™s lives, and create an environment where families and friends can still be deeply connected without computers. Technology should be celebrated, but it should also be managed with caution.

I sincerely hope that readers agree with me and make a conscious effort to responsibly use computers.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
