The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is not happy, and I write to say that this book is as much a success as it is tragic. It is a brilliant, insightful book, a memoir and an autobiography in a world that is full of mistakes and errors. I hope you find it to be a very fine product.

Thank you very much. It's a pleasure.

I had always been surprised by the quality of your descriptions of the past, and I didn't expect to find a book that is so well written. I don't believe it that way but in my experience a book I read at my first church gave me exactly what I was looking for. A book that people read not because they wanted me to believe it is true but to let it live on so that it can be understood by them. For me it was the ultimate. There is something a little bit too perfect about it. It is almost a novel, at its most, but it is about something that's not a world or a book altogether. I was very happy to read it. It is an honest book and I do not believe we can say that we can say that we only found it. It is a very very honest book.

This book is a little bit wrong about a lot of things I have heard. I am only a 20-year-old, I had to learn to read, I had to learn how to read,
