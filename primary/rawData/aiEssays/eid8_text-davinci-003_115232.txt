I remember the first time my boyfriend and I laughed together. It was a month after we started dating and we were at the park together for a picnic. We were both a bit nervous and the conversation was kind of awkward.

Suddenly, a squirrel ran in between us and started grabbing food from our picnic basket. We both jumped back and froze for a moment, staring at the squirrel in complete shock.

And then, we both burst out laughing. It was like this wave of relief had come over us and all the awkwardness melted away. We laughed for what felt like hours, as the squirrel scampered away with some of our food.

From that moment on, laughter has become an integral part of our relationship. Whenever we argue, we try to remember that funny moment and it diffuses the tension in the room. 

Now, whenever we find ourselves in a similar situation, we know a few moments of laughter is all it takes to turn a tense moment into a light-hearted one.
