One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was in my 60s. My friends all said laughter always wins and I used to joke that I think that's because laughter is based on the people who are laughing and talking and laughing at themselves, not about people having "normal" lives.

Being so young and so young with that "fear" isn't that bad. After all, I just got my mixtape album and it sounds like a lot. I just got a bunch of new ideas about what I want for my life without giving too much away.

However, I still can't shake the feeling of being a failure that people will always be like, "Oh man, I'm going to never get the opportunity to grow and develop as a songwriter. I need to know how to have fun!" So, when that's my destiny, I just go, "That guy's never been to the stage before, right? I need to be part of a scene that makes sense to people right now." When that's what I want, well...I get those feelings again and again just like when I play music. I just get that feeling. My goal is not a show where I want to be one big band but a song written because I care about people doing the important things for someone and the music they are playing and not to let those who don't have music dictate what they think.
