Minfong Ho ends Winter Hibiscus with this line to signify that all of the hardships of winter will soon be over and Spring and new beginnings will come. By having the main character promise to take the test again in the Spring, it shows that she has hope that everything will be better when the snows melt and the geese return. This provides a sense of reassurance that despite the struggles and difficulties of winter, some things will always remain the same and that the good times will be back eventually.
