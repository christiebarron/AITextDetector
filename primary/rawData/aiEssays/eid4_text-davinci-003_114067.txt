The ending of "Winter Hibiscus" by Minfong Ho serves to tie the poem's metaphor of a winter hibiscus plant standing for a student's failed exam back to the exam itself. The hibiscus is associated with winter, and thus struggling and failing, but is contrasted with spring, which symbolizes a new beginning and a hope for success. By ending the poem with a reference to the test, always present in the background, the reader is reminded that the exam is an opportunity for the student to improve and succeed in the future. The hopeful ending emphasizes that the student has the power to use this experience to achieve success in the next exam.
