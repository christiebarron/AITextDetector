In the 1930s, the idea of having the world's tallest building offer space to dock dirigibles was a revolutionary concept and a potential game-changer in aviation. From the moment ground was broken on the Empire State Building, the architects and builders had a challenge ahead of them to make this dream a reality.

The main obstacle to accommodating dirigibles at the Empire State Building was the lack of technology for a safe and effective docking. Although the idea of enabling dirigibles to dock atop the building had been around since the 1920s, it would take decades of engineering and innovation to make the dream a reality. The engineering of a safe and practical mooring mast for the dirigibles could not be hurried, and there were several critical questions to be answered.

Firstly, the mast had to be strong and sturdy enough to accommodate the weight and power of a dirigible. This was solved by designing a steel framework capable of supporting the massive size and weight of the airships. Secondly, the mechanism required to successfully tie the airships to the mast also had to be designed, tested, and implemented. This was eventually accomplished by installing a steel cable, strong enough to secure the airship, which ran up the mooring mast.

Thirdly, and possibly the most difficult obstacle, was finding a way to allow the dirigible to safely attach to the mooring mast without damaging the building. This was eventually solved by installing an eye
