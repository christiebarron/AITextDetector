I remember it like it was yesterday. I was out on a date with my now husband. We had been together for a few weeks, and it was our second date. I had decided to take him out for dinner and a movie at the local theater. 

We started talking about funny moments from our past, and soon were laughing together. We couldn’t stop! Pretty soon, we had the whole theater laughing at our silly antics. Everyone around us in the theater seemed to be enjoying our companionship and I felt my heart swell with joy. 

Finally, after a few movies and lots of laughter, we finally had to take our leave. The drive home felt like nothing compared to the night. I remember the joy I felt when we laughed together and how it made us feel so close and connected. 

Since then, laughter has been a part of our relationship. We still laugh together about the silliest of things, and it always pulls us closer together. I wouldn’t trade that night for anything!
