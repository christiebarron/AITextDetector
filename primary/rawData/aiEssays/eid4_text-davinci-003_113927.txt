The final line of the poem is a metaphor for hope and renewal. The speaker in the poem recalls the resilient hibiscus flower that blooms, despite winter's icy chill. The poem concludes with the speaker expressing their own hope that, when nature bounces back and the flower blooms again, they too will have the strength and courage to try again. This ending is meant to be uplifting and emphasize that each winter, or difficult period in life, eventually gives way to spring and a better tomorrow, if we have the courage and fortitude to face future challenges.
