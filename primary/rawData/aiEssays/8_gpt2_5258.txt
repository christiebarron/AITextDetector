One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my wife was with me for dinner on the morning of my 8th birthday. She had come in from her home at the local pub in Birmingham to pick out a few small items for kids to help in the garden. She said my husband was there and when we were all seated I heard a laugh for some reason. I looked over at Dad who was just standing there looking confused when I saw a laugh and then looked back at him and said: "what's wrong? I thought he was sorry." He then went on to ask me to follow a picture of him to the house in which I was seated and when I wasn't I looked over at my wife as she continued smiling to herself. It's really been an amazing experience, it's been a real roller coaster in my life. The next day I decided to ask my husband if he could have known about me at the time. We didn't need to go too long before he started saying that he didn't know. I'd been asked several times about my wife and he had responded on the spot that he doesn't remember her at all and had even admitted he didn't know her at all as she did with me before. I started to make the decision myself I decided it was best to leave and get my car instead of trying to stay in a nearby pub.

My house, as a single person has become a much bigger place for two years now for me as well
