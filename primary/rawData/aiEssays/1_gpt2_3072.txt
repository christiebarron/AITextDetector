Computers have many effects on people. They alter the way we think about people. They alter the way people see us. They change the way we think about our bodies. And some of them are very, very real to us."

Even when many scientists agree that machines are not the problem, others challenge the consensus. At the meeting, he told the crowd that, "if it's possible for humans to do things and think differently, then do it. If you can do things that are beyond your control and are just a result of that, then do it. If you can't do it, do it. The only solution then is to stop tinkering. Otherwise, you keep doing it."

But at an earlier conference on "Hype-Warm Communication," published in the Journal of Human Behavior by the Institute for Social and Behavioral Sciences, a group of university professors, researchers, and psychologists conducted experiments with the most prominent people in the room, and concluded that some aspects of technology can change how people perceive and act in complex ways.

For example, at a recent discussion on "Hype-Warm Communication," one participant commented, "I am so happy when I have a computer to talk to people. I have no idea how to deal with it. As soon as I understand their voice or my position, the computer starts talking. All I ever hear is that there's a computer there. Then I just do things and the computer stops talking.
