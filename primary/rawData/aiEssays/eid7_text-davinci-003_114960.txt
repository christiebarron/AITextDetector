I was sitting in the waiting room of my doctor's office, watching the clock tick as I was told I would be running late for my appointment. I had already been sitting there for over an hour and didn't think it was fair that I had to wait any longer. 

I could feel my anxiety growing and my patience wearing out until I noticed an elderly woman who had been there when I arrived. After an hour and a half of waiting, she was finally called in for her appointment. She simply brushed it off as if it was no big deal and calmly followed the nurse inside. 

Her act of patience inspired me to try and be less frustrated with my long wait. I reminded myself that the doctor had to be taking good care of her for it to take so long, and that it was important for her to get the help she needed. Seeing how patient she was, I really wanted to be more like her and try to remain calm and understanding rather than complaining about the wait time. 

Eventually, I was called in for my appointment, and throughout the rest of the day, I kept the elderly woman in my mind and tried to apply her patience to my everyday life.
