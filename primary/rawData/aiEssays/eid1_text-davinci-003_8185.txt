The Empire State Building in New York City was an incredible engineering achievement when it was completed in 1931. Not only did it become the tallest building in the world at the time, but it also made history by being the first building in the world to have a dirigible docking station at the top. The process of creating a docking station for the dirigibles, however, was anything but straightforward. 

The idea of docking dirigibles at the top of the building first came from entrepreneur Captain William E. Meyers in the late 1920s. Capt. Meyers felt that the amount of air traffic would increase over the years and the Empire State Building would be the perfect place for these airships to dock for refueling and maintenance. Unfortunately, the idea was met with a lot of resistance from both the public and the Empire State Building Corporation, who feared the dangers and liability of having dirigibles flying around their building and their customers.

Despite these obstacles, the Empire State Building Corporation eventually agreed to construct a docking station for dirigibles due to the sheer number of airships being used at the time. To address the safety concerns, the Corporation made sure to hire the best engineers and designers for the project. These engineers had to develop an intricate system for laden dirigibles to safely dock and undock from the mast located at the top of the building. 

In addition, the engineers had to account for the significant winds that are common in New
