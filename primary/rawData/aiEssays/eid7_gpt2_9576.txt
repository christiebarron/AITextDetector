An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when he was a child, she had been abused by her father. It was hard not to think of her as a person who lost everything. She died a horrible death in her arms, but it also meant much changed for her mother, who was very proud of the child.

"I do believe in forgiveness, but for the first few months after her death he seemed to take off heru'alg, when I was out in the street his friends thought he was having a bad time, but after a while they stopped it as soon as I came home in September, when I could say'sorry.'

"I feel like the world has changed a lot now, and I still am a little confused about the world itself. I still love life, I still want to be an adult, and to love myself. So please, I'm really sorry for this mistake, and I have a very good chance that I can live out that happy life this way. Hope you could take my advice and put a stop to these terrible things."
