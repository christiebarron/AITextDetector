 

I recently had to wait in line at the grocery store for what felt like an eternity. It had been a long day and I was tired and irritated. Just as I was about to give into my frustrations, I observed an elderly gentleman in front of me. He had difficulty standing up straight and was carefully counting out his change to the cashier. A few of the people in line behind me were becoming impatient, but I knew that rushing him would only make it harder.

I took a deep breath and instead of tapping my foot or sighing loudly, I smiled politely. I gave him words of encouragement and, sensing my patience, he smiled back at me. After he made his payment, I took his spot in line and continued the shopping experience.

It felt good to show him kindness and understanding, especially on such a difficult day. Patience is something I hope to always strive for, no matter the situation.
