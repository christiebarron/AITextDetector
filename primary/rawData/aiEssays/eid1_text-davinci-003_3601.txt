 

I am the type of person who loves to make others laugh. To me, laughter is a beautiful thing that can bring people together no matter the circumstances.

So when I was stuck in traffic the other day, I decided to make the best of the situation by trying to bring laughter to an otherwise unpleasant experience. I reached for my guitar that I had stored in the backseat and began to play a jovial folk tune that I had recently learned. 

As I was playing, I noticed some of the people in the car next to me smiling, tapping their hands to the tune and genuinely enjoying the music. Before I knew it a small crowd formed on the side of the road, and people were actually singing along with me! Even the driver of the car I had originally been playing for was directly next to me singing.

It felt incredible to be able to spread joy and laughter like that, through music and people coming together. And while it wasn't a long lasting joy, it was a reminder that laughter can bridge a lot of distances and bring people closer in the most unexpected ways.
