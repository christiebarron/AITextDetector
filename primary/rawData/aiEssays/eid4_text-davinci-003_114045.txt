The author is reflecting on the idea that it isn't the outcome of one event that ultimately matters, but the journey one takes in life. In the story, the protagonist, a young girl, is studying for her citizenship test and worrying about whether or not she will pass. The author uses the closing imagery of the winter hibiscus as a symbol of hope and renewal, as it will bloom again in the spring. By ending with this sentiment, the author is signaling that no matter how the test turns out, the most important thing is that the girl continues to grow and learn, and that she should trust that no matter what, the winter will pass and something beautiful will start anew.
