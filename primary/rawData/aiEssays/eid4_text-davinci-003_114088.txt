Ho ends Winter Hibiscus with this line because she wants to convey the idea that the protagonist is determined to overcome obstacles and try again. The imagery of the melting snow and returning geese symbolize the idea of renewal and hope; that although the protagonist may have failed the test, she is not giving up and will take it again when the circumstances are right. Ho's use of this imagery serves to convey an uplifting message that no matter how challenging the situation may be, there is always hope for a brighter and better future.
