The construction of the Empire State Building posed an unprecedented challenge: designing a building that could facilitate the docking of passenger airships, or dirigibles. Construction of the building began in 1930 in midtown Manhattan, and engineers faced a number of obstacles in designing a docking facility that could accommodate airships. These obstacles, once conquered, enabled the Empire State Building to be the first skyscraper with a dirigible docking facility.

The engineers designing the Empire State Buildingâ€™s docking facilities were tasked with solving unprecedented technical challenges. For example, the airship mooring mast had to be tall enough, secure enough, and flexible enough to mitigate the impact of the strong winds that would buffet the deck as airships maneuvered into place. Additionally, the engineers had to design a complex elevator system that could lower a steel cable from the mooring mast to the deck, with the cable in turn anchored to the dirigible itself. After spending months on design and testing, engineers finally perfected the mooring system that would enable airships to dock safely at the Empire State Building.

But solving technical problems was only half the battle. In the 1930s, airships were relatively new technology, and their safety was a major concern. Because of this, the Federal government imposed tight restrictions on dirigible flights and landings. To gain all necessary safety approvals, engineers had to conduct multiple tests of the mooring mast and deck facilities. This process included running simulations of various
