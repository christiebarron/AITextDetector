The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because the writer knows what he's doing in advance and he knows how to keep it fresh. It's the most straightforward of the several titles, but the pacing can feel forced, since many of the other adaptations feature flashbacks and flashbacks of events and locations that have never been done before, or have been cut off, so the reader feels the reader has to decide right away what to read. Most of the world in the book is familiar, and the narrative does its job, so I can't really say that this is the best book from the Winter Hibiscus line. If you think it is, but feel like you won't like it and might just like it (or the rest of you), you're probably not going to read that many of these books, and you can skip to the very end.


All of Winter Hibiscus' other recent incarnations—Ceremonial War for The Hunger Games, Tales From The Black Cat and The Godfather—are either the worst or the most interesting of all these adaptations. So if you've seen the others, it's probably because they were all the worse.


It's really hard to say whether this is The Witcher at its most enjoyable, though. At first, The Witcher was one of the few adaptations that looked a lot better than the others. The plot and combat feel the same as The Witcher, but the pacing doesn't feel that different from The
