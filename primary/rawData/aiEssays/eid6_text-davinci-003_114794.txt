Throughout history, there have been many challenges which engineers have overcome in their ambitious building projects. One example is the installation of a ‘mooring mast’ on the Empire State Building, which allowed dirigibles to dock there. This was a complex and challenging operation that required solving a variety of problems. In her article, ‘The Mooring Mast’, Marcia Amidon Lüsted outlines the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building when they were working to make this mooring mast a reality.

The first major obstacle encountered was due to the size of the Empire State Building. It not only extended to unprecedented heights – dwarfing every other building in the city – but also covered a large area of Manhattan. The engineers had to design a mooring mast that was both secure and flexible enough to support the dirigibles while also leaving them plenty of room to maneuver around it. As a result, the mast had to be located in a way that allowed the dirigibles to dock without causing damage to the building itself or to the surroundings.

The second challenge was finding a material that could handle the strong winds at the Empire State Building’s height. Since the mooring mast was to be made of a metal, the engineers had to consider the effects of wind on the metal and try to limit or eliminate any potential damage to the building or nearby trappings. 

The third problem was designing the
