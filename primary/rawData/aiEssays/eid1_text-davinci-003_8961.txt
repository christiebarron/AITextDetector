Dear Editor:

In today's digital age, computers have had a major impact on people's lives. As technology advances, the effects of computers can be both positive and negative. Therefore, it's important to recognize the overall impact of computers so we can all get the most benefit from this technology.

The most immediate benefit of computers is convenience. Computers help people to interact with each other quickly and efficiently. Through email, social media, and other online services, people across the world can connect in a way they could not before. They can also easily access a wide variety of resources, allowing individuals and businesses to find the information they need in moments.

However, computers can also have a negative impact on people when used excessively. They can cause physical strain from sitting in front of a monitor for extended periods of time. Additionally, people can become overly reliant on computers and neglect other tasks and activities that are important for both physical and mental wellbeing.

In conclusion, the effects of computers can be both beneficial and detrimental. It is important to recognize both sides of the issue so that more people can enjoy the advantages of this technology without creating an unhealthy dependence.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
