Dear Editor,

I write to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. There is no doubt that computers have become indispensable tools in our modern lives. However, it’s important to understand the potential risks they can pose to us. 

As computers become ever more prevalent, it is becoming increasingly difficult for individuals to interact with one another in person. With social networks and communication platforms such as Skype and FaceTime, it’s now easier to stay connected without ever having to meet in person. This can be detrimental, especially when considering the important connection we form by being physically present with one another. It’s much easier to developa real relationship when in the presence of the other person.

In addition, it’s evident that computers can be used to access dangerous information or materials, and can be used as tools for cyberbullying, making it difficult for children or teens to establish healthy relationships with their peers.

To sum up, computers have made it easier than ever to communicate, but we must take into account the potential risks of becoming too reliant on them. We must ensure that we still have meaningful interactions with one another in person, and be aware of the potential risks that computers can pose. 

I hope that I have been able to make you consider the effects computers have on people, and that I have persuaded you to agree with me. 

Yours sincerely,
