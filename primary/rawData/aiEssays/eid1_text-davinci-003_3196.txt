Dear Editor,

The advent of computers has been revolutionary, and their use has become integral to our everyday lives. With the increased reliance on this technology, however, comes a noticeable effect on people that ought to be discussed.

I believe that computers have had a mostly positive impact on our lives. From the convenience of online shopping to access to huge archives of information, computers lift a significant burden from our shoulders. Furthermore, as technology advances, user interfaces are becoming simpler and more intuitive, making it easier than ever to use computers.

At the same time, however, computers and the internet open us to the risk of fraud and cybercrime. We must also consider the severe impact that too much usage of computers can have on a person's health. Furthermore, excessive use of computers has been linked to a decrease in focus, and some people have even been known to suffer from “computer addiction”.

Overall, the use of computers is invaluable, but we must guard against the potential negatives that its use can bring. Therefore, I strongly urge readers to use their computers responsibly and monitor their use to ensure that the effects remain positive.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
