One time I was at the grocery store with my mother, and we were browsing in the canned goods aisle. My mother wanted to take her time looking through all the different options, but as usual, I wanted to get out of there as soon as possible. I was about to say something that would push her to hurry up when a man entered the aisle. He was looking for some specific canned tuna and couldn't find it anywhere. After about five minutes of him searching with no luck, my patience started to run thin. But I managed to resist saying anything and instead just stood there and waited. 

Eventually, my mother found the man a can of tuna and he thanked us both for our help. In that moment, I couldn't help but feel proud of myself for being so patient. I was glad I didn't rush him out of the aisle, and instead let him take his time looking for the right product. It was a valuable lesson in being more patient in difficult situations.
