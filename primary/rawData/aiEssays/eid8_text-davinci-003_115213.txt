I recently had one of the most enjoyable nights of my life. It all started with my friend sending me a funny video of cats in boxes. We laughed so hard, we almost cried. Neither of us expected to find such humor in something that seemed so mundane.

But it was only the start of the night. We decided to go out to dinner, and the entire time we were cracking jokes and laughing. From sharing stories to impersonating each other, laughter kept us going all night.

We finished dinner and decided to take a walk. Along the way, we shared jokes, made funny observations, and kept each other in hysterics. People probably thought we were a bit crazy, but we didn't care. It felt so good to laugh with somebody who shared the same sense of humor. 

Towards the end of the night, we stumbled onto a playground. We played tag like two kids, jumping on the swings and slides like we were 6 years old again. We were able to let go of all our worries and just enjoy each other's company.

That night, laughter was the best thing my friend and I could have shared. We bonded over an experience that will stay with us for a long time. Our friendship flourished that night because of our shared laughter, and I will never forget it.
