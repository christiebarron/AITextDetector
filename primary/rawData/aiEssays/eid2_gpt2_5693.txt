I believe that censorship of materials in libraries should never be tolerated in any form. The fact that publishers have been allowed to profit from these books is a violation of the spirit of openness to the public and I have opposed censorship everywhere I have seen. I believe that books should be free and open for public communication.


The first sentence of this speech is Rubin's comment below:

There are three reasons for censorship:

First, what they are doing is a blatant form of censorship and censorship is, well, censorship

Second, it's true that there are "anti-censorship" labels used to label the books. I've personally heard that, as with any form of censorship, there is no "anti-censorship" label placed on the book.

Third, these labels are used for all sorts of things, and you would think that you would use things in libraries all the time, just because they are deemed relevant and relevant.


Now let's say that they were called "anti-censorship." And you read the above excerpt, you say that I wrote of those books when I was writing them, where they have made huge headlines at schools, and people have said this "censorship" label was a bad idea, because they were reading it, that I was saying that censorship, when applied to non-educational libraries, is a bad idea, because for those books, these labels "antiseptic" because they are deemed relevant
