The ending of the poem is meant to offer the narrator hope for the future â€“ that eventually, after the long winter, spring and summer will return, bringing with it the potential for a better future. The narrator can look forward to having the chance to take the test again, and this gives her something to look forward to and strive for. The poem is thus an uplifting reminder of the power of nature and how it can bring about new beginnings.
