The poet wanted to end the poem on a hopeful note of renewal and recovery after a difficult winter. The poem focuses on the idea of resilience in the face of adversity. The poet is implying that, as with the hibiscus, if you survive the winter, there will be hope and new opportunities in spring. The imagery of the snow melting, geese returning, and hibiscus budding serves as a reminder of the promise of rebirth and reinvention. By ending the poem with a reminder of how if one survives and overcomes a difficult winter, a new season can bring fresh opportunities, the poet encourages the reader to stay hopeful, no matter how tough the circumstances.
