Dear Editor, 

I am writing to share my opinion about the effects computers have had on people. Technology has changed the way we live our lives, and computers have revolutionized the way we interact with the world. 

The ability to access information from anywhere has allowed people to become more independent and learn on their own. They make it easier to connect with anyone, anywhere in the world, and that has fostered our understanding of different cultures and beliefs. Computers also allow us to quickly and efficiently search for and share information. 

On the other hand, computers have had some negative impacts on people. With the growing popularity of social media and the easy access to information, our lives have become filled with distractions and false narratives, at the expense of forming meaningful connections with the people around us. Additionally, they can lead to isolation and loneliness as weâ€™re less likely to engage in meaningful conversations with family and friends. 

Overall, the effects of computers depend on how they are used. With moderation, consideration, and the right kind of engagement, computers can provide many blessings to enhance our lives.
 
Sincerely,
