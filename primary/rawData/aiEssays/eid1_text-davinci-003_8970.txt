Dear Editor,

I'm writing to express my opinion on the effects of computers on the population. Computers have undeniably become an integral part of our lives and many people are now inseparable from their laptops, tablets, and other gadgets that keep us connected. But while technology can help us stay informed, connected, and entertained, there's also a downside to its prevalence.

It's becoming increasingly difficult for us to focus and concentrate on tasks without the constant compulsion to check our phones and computers for notifications. With so much available information and entertainment, it's no wonder that concentration has become a lost art. Constant engrossment in gadgets has also led to physical inactivity, resulting in additional health issues.

The reliance on technology has also taken a toll on our social interaction. While social networking sites can help us stay updated on our friends' lives, the necessity for it means that we are missing out on real life connections and conversations.

On the other hand, when relied on responsibly, technology has the power to increase productivity, open new doors of communication, and even safeguard our private data.

I urge people to take a step back, disconnect from their digital devices once in a while, and think of the consequences of letting technology take complete control of our lives.

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
