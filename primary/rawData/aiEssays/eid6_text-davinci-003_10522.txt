The task of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was a daunting one. In “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the challenges builders faced in building a structure designed for the purpose of docking airships are thoroughly explored. The builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome many obstacles in order for this project to be achievable, and these hurdles all had to be overcome in a relatively short period of time. 

The first obstacle the builders had to deal with was the need to find an appropriate structure to accommodate a mooring mast. Most large buildings of the day did not have a suitable structure to use for this purpose; the Empire State Building was chosen for its ideal height and width. Once the location had been determined, a frame for the mooring mast had to be constructed. This frame had to be specifically designed to be stable enough to handle the high winds that accompany airships, and it had to be raised to the top of the building. This was obviously a difficult task, as the mooring mast had to be high enough to ensure that it would not interfere with the flight path of the dirigible.

Another obstacle that the builders faced was constructing a manual system. Because the airships of the time had to be manually guided for docking, the builders had to find a mechanism for controlling the mooring mast. This mechanism had to be both safe and reliable, as the movement
