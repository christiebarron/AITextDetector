An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I saw an 18-year-old girl with an eye disc and her father's back. It was a terrifying sight.

When I'd see pictures of family members there's a memory of how they looked like these things. And so they are like the ones we always are now. Every day, I feel a little bit more like they were there before, but we are so much happier in our times

As a psychiatrist in Manchester, where I was born on 1 December 1961 and grew up in Northampton, England, he's taken a more optimistic view on the afterlife.

Mr Oates: I would say it's a wonderful sense of relief and peace to be here and to feel like someone's alive somehow, but one can only see it through so often.

The other way around is that it's as if we've moved on. The sense of purpose is fading. We have been gone so long, we're not as happy with their condition, or with our lives.

When I think back to them, the life I lived I didn't make it a life.

So I think there is a greater sense of relief. The thought of their suffering is wonderful, and so much of me feels like it will come back.
