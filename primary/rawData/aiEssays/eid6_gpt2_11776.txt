For the most part, the nation's airships remained within the confines of their original design. In the mid-1950s however, the idea of using traditional, "in-flight" airships took off. While the idea of a dirigible was later revived by a commercial airplane manufacturer by the time of the Boeing 747, by the mid-20th century it was not asocolonial as it used to be. Most notably, dirigibles could be used during the early years of a pilot's career. A single person named Robert James had his D-2D-1 airship, which he built as a private pilot with his brother Henry. While at the National Airshow in New York in 1962, James showed off his D-2D-1 (along with his sister) on his pilot's side. The D-2D-1 landed safely at an Air Traffic Control station in Los Angeles and, with some assistance from a pilot-submersible, used the pilot as a pilot's assistant until he returned to flight.
