The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' was even more striking. "A sense of melancholy that I've never experienced in any other book I've done," said author David Erskine. "It is something that my writing and my life have never matched. It's something I don't have the guts to do, and I know it will make me regret it, but it's my book."
