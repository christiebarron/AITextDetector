I recently had an experience with a close friend where I had to practice being patient. We had made plans to take a trip together and I was really looking forward to it. However, they changed their mind and decided they weren't going to be able to make it. 

I was really disappointed, but decided to be understanding and not show it. I didn't want my friend to feel bad about their decision, so I simply accepted the situation and told them I understood. I reminded myself to remain patient and be calm in this situation, and that helped me a lot. 

We eventually ended up making other plans to hang out together soon, and it all worked out. I'm glad I didn't get frustrated or angry and instead was able to remain patient and understanding towards my friend.
