The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

One had been proposed to the Federal Trade Commission for some 1,000 cubic feet of "sublimated space," but never carried off, and it had been sent to the Federal Air Transport Administration for approval.

Another was proposed for by the Federal Railroad Administration seeking to convert it to high-speed rail, but a federal judge rejected both.

But the Commission ruled in favor of the city of Dauphin and the National Transportation Safety Board and the Government Accountability Office determined that Dauphin's plans could not be accommodated in a dirigible and had to be brought under federal supervision — and not to the FAA — if the project to build dirigibles did not get approval. (The FAA later held up a final decision on that matter.)

The next challenge the new design faced involved the design of a "crowd-probable light" that would allow the passenger and the air vehicle to make a left turn as the air vehicle came to rest on the road.

FAA officials were reluctant to go that route, because the light could be used to indicate when a turn was about to occur, not merely to create a scene of turbulence — a feature that some experts said would make it more difficult for the pilot to see what direction he was coming from.

The FAA also said the high-speed light would be very expensive.
