They were doing well. This patient's name was James from Iowa. I sent them back what he had to his doctor but his name was not on the package. They said he had a big lump in his mouth and said it looked ok that he had lost consciousness and he was being evaluated today. He said that doctors needed to see him tomorrow to determine a course of treatment.

I said maybe there were more prescriptions they needed to know and we made their plans.
