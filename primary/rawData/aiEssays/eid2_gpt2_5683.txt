I believe that censorship of materials in libraries must be banned, i.e. the use of the Internet is not a place for expression. Therefore, there should be no right to search the library.

The law states that books should be accessible for everyone, and that books should be provided at all times without fear of persecution from censorship.

An independent library should not be censored without the agreement of its readers and staff. This is especially true for books that were published in the past.

The law goes on to say that such library is not an establishment of a public figure; rather this library is open for everybody to choose to belong.

In response to this statement, M.I.R.P. was contacted by B.C. First, in an email to the B.C. Government in 2010 and asked for more information Ca. in order to clarify its position that this law is not intended to restrict books published prior to 2000. In the reply, M.I.R.P. said

"The content on some books is subject to an intellectual property claim. This is not the same as when people are publishing books published before 2000, and therefore it is not a violation of copyright rights to give permission for the book to be published or to create it on the internet."

However, as one can imagine, many B.C. First staffers and members have said that they would like to avoid a ban on internet book sales.
