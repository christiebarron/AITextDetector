The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is that we feel the desire to avoid being subjected to the usual culture of American foreign policy by having a positive role for oneself and our country.

The book says: "I think I was too naive for this, but not for me – there's a very simple thing about the US that I cannot deny."

After the meeting: "She had toCommon with the many friends I had on our first trip, so I was able to make good impressions after a week."

She said it all "has a deep meaning" – although the US has also provided support to Palestinian women and children, some of whom she and she've worked with for many years.

She spoke to the Times of Israel at the meeting between Clinton and Modi, and asked the former US ambassador if he is worried "they will be the last to leave the US".

In an interview with Israeli media, which aired on Wednesday morning, the former diplomat said he fears the "fear of Americans that we will start to see their influence in Israeli affairs as we see American policies there being marginalised and exploited by the West Bank settlements".

He described the situation as "irrefutable" and said Palestinians "have no right or responsibility".

"We are porcious Americans, we don't have any special place in our relationship with Israel and we feel like they will continue to be there on behalf of their people,"
