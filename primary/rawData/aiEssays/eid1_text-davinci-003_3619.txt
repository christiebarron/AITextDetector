Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my opinion on the effects computers have on people and to persuade your readers to agree with me. In a world that is becoming increasingly driven by technology, computers are becoming a part and parcel of everyday life. Within a few decades of their use, computers have changed the way we live, work, and interact.

As computer use has become ubiquitous, the use is often seen as having both positive and negative effects. On the positive side, computers have made it easier for people to share information and collaborate on projects. They have also made it easier for people to access educational materials from anywhere in the world, which has extended educational opportunities to those who would not otherwise have had them.

On the negative side, computers have been linked to a variety of health problems, including eyestrain, carpal tunnel syndrome, and neck and back aches. They can also be a major source of distraction that can lead to decreased productivity.

In conclusion, while computers can be an incredibly powerful tool, they are not without their drawbacks. I hope your readers will see the importance of balancing the use of computers so they can better enjoy the benefits while reducing the potential risks.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
