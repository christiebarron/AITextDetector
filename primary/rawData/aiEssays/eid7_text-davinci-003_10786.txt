I recently encountered a situation that required a great deal of patience. During a recent visit to the doctorâ€™s office, there was an issue with the electronic health records, and it caused a long delay and a lot of frustration. As people began to let out their frustrations, I stayed calm and waited patiently. 

I reminded those around me that this was an issue that was out of our control. I urged everyone to keep in mind that the staff was doing their best, and gave them some time to sort out the issue. Other people began to follow suit, and soon the atmosphere was very serene.

The problem was eventually resolved and my patience had paid off. I'm proud to say that I was able to stay patient and help the others around me maintain a peaceful atmosphere, even in the midst of difficulty.
