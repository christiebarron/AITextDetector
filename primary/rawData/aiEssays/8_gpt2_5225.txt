One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was young and someone told me how I looked too much like a big boy. Suddenly I grew up with a sense of shame for this and I went to the gym on that occasion. You know how in school you would do your job, and I did my job. At that time I was a little older, but I knew the person who taught me how to dance and how to play football. Now, when I think of his football background, I have to admit that I know he is a bit off-putting but I was always able to relate to him and I feel it was by that point one of the greatest qualities that he could have.

The two most fascinating things about Arsenal were how well they did at the World Cup in Germany and how well they played at the World Cup between Belgium and Germany. The first thing they did well was they won the game in the first leg against Panama for the first time and you looked at those pictures and there was nobody like them. They won the tournament. It was really quite the tournament for them.

Arsenal have been consistently very good on the transfer market. Even with a few bad teams that didn't have a lot of success, you had to go against a lot of good teams to secure a deal. You had to go up against the good ones to get a good deal. There was no team with very good quality they had to compete with the good ones.
