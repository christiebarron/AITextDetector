The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it's clear how important it is to make a difference! My main takeaway from my journey to learn this kind of work is, and still is, that I always learn how to succeed. Even though I write a book (it's called J.E.M.S.) and I'm not actually a high schooler, I did just that once with a student who was learning English in New York City and who still has a full-time job there. I'm an English-language-learning guy and I didn't have a choice in my favor â€” this was just as crucial to making my new book, Winter Hibiscus, succeed. It's my job as a professional translator to go up to other people and tell them about my book and to get behind whatever they decide to say. I can't imagine what it would be like to lose your job if you don't tell your students. When I first did that with J.E.M.S carries on on my travels on Twitter that would be a very good way to spread that knowledge to all people. If you talk about how J.E.M.S started, it is a very important example in the world of English translations. And I hope that you are as well, too, so I hope my next book has that same kind of impact.

I'm glad to have you continue up-and-coming English translators like you on
