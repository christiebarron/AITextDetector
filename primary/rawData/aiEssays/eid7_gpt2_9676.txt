An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the man who was diagnosed with pneumonia (he died in 1992 after having suffered from pneumonia but was still receiving treatments that weren't well thought out, so he was sent for specialist care later). I have been fortunate to help raise funds for a number of people reincarnated as well, so I am grateful for the support provided.

I don't know if these people should be named, and that I'm missing the point. I would also like to include them in this list. One of the greatest joys of being a part of the community is seeing others that share their unique experiences and love so much. Thank you.

Sincerely,

Janice
