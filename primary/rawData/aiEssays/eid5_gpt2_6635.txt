The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' by Hadi, a member of the Al Qaeda's affiliate Ummah, seems as if it was driven by the Islamic State's desire to impose its rule over western Europe. He calls the group's violence "a jihad against Jews".

But as he discusses his personal background and experiences abroad, Hadi stresses not to forget that there were Arab Spring revolts in Tunisia in 2011 and Libya in 2012, and that he was a part of the revolt in Libya when he participated in the uprising against President Omar al-Bashir, the first Libyan dictator to face arrest for the crimes of the uprising.

"My life is now in jeopardy in the face of Islamism - Islamism from the West", Hadi concludes by noting that his personal faith is "not the way to God, but Islam". His parents, he says, and his brother, were "very brave, courageous rebels of Islam against a fanaticism that has had its inception in the Middle East and Europe".

Indeed, most of his life has felt like an ideological war between Islam and the West: his school days had been interrupted by violent demonstrations, but he is confident he is capable of changing that in the next decade's Middle East.

With no further ado, Hadi details his experiences in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan and concludes by outlining the challenges his family faces with the world we live in.
