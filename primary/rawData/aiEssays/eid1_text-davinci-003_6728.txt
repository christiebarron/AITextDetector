To the editor, 

With the rise of computer use in daily life, it is important to consider the effects of computers on people. While I believe that computers have had a positive impact on society, I believe that it needs to be used with caution and moderation. 

Computer usage has caused a shift in the way that people learn and interact with each other. With the internet, people are able to access a vast array of information from all over the world. It enables people to learn new skills, access wider opportunities, and interact across cultures without ever leaving their homes. However, it also limits peopleâ€™s social interactions to online platforms. The digital world can become a comfortable and easy alternative to face-to-face relationships, and this can lead to a disconnect from the physical world. 

Additionally, too much computer usage can lead to physical health issues such as obesity, vision problems, and musculoskeletal disorders. Sitting in front of the computer for long periods of time can also lead to harmful effects on posture and physical fitness. 

It is important to think about the implications that computers have on people. It is important to draw a balance between connecting with the digital and physical world, and to take care of our physical and mental health. We need to be aware of the potential risks of computer use for both our physical and mental well being. 

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to share my opinion.
