One time I experienced laughter in my life was when, after I did a lot in life's projects, I thought, "I wouldn't ever do this kind of thing again," or "I probably wouldn't go further than this one." I know my future is still uncertain, but I know that this kind of journey may be a good thing for myself. I never had a life when I could do things much better for myself. I've always felt like this is a life worth living.

I have a feeling my life is going to be better than ever before.

I will continue to strive and build as a father to my daughters, as part of my family, and for the rest of my life. I look forward to the good times ahead.

My hope and prayers are with you all.
