Computers have many effects on people. They have their own sets of consequences, for example, an increase in an employee's workload or a lack of money (a problem in business and for individuals). One way in which their effects may be taken together is through the cost of their research or development, which is not so much a concern in the business because they have significant effects on the overall productivity of the individual unit or group, as it is in education.

Why does this matter?

These factors have not been explained as factors in isolation, but instead as factors which play a small part in an interdisciplinary enterprise. For instance, in a business enterprise, the cost of the products and services, the development of expertise, their development and training, the costs of other forms of production, their use of human resources (such as consultants) and other external costs do not affect the effectiveness of those products or services. However, the impact on the business organization will depend, for example, on each individual unit, the technical nature of the work and the level of education, and other factors, both external and internal, might also impact the quality of that experience.

These factors, although not always causative in their effects, have to account for the different effects of all individual units on an organization.

It is important to keep in mind that some of these reasons may seem surprising to some, particularly those who follow in the footsteps of other researchers and entrepreneurs. However, they
