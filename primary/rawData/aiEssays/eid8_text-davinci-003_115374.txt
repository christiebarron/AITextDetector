I remember the first time my wife and I laughed together like it was yesterday. We had just started dating and were out to dinner at a nice restaurant. We looked over the menu and joked about all of the different dishes. We tried to guess what ingredients were in some of the meals, and neither of us really knew what some of them meant. As we continued to joke back and forth, I could feel a soft warmth emanating from her.

We started to burst out in laughter, and the other people at the table glanced over at us. I felt embarrassed for a brief moment, but then I saw the huge smiles on their faces. We continued to talk and joke the evening away. It was the first time we felt a real connection with each other, and I will never forget the feeling. 

From that day forward, we never stopped laughing together. No matter how serious the situation, we were always able to find some humour in it. We valued and prioritised our laughter even more than before, often letting the trivial issues take a back seat. Through our shared laughter, our bond became even stronger.

Laughter has definitely brought us closer together over the years, and I can't express how grateful I am for it. It always finds a way of brightening the darkest days, and I wouldn't trade it for the world.
