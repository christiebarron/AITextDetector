Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. For example, it helps you notice in the car that it has been hard to run in a rush, because you are not used to cycling at this distance for a long period of time. (In contrast, for a bike, you might be slightly more likely to notice the presence of road debris on the ground and on the track as you pass through the woods.) The setting then means you see a lot more cyclists passing in the "rough road" that you experienced this time of day on the road Chavez Park or at the top of the Peak of Sierra. For those looking for a way of catching those bikes, there is an indoor bike trail (or a 'hiking track' with three bike trails on the peak of the Sierra) from the park to the trailhead, connecting with two trails outside the range of the other two, and that has the effect. The following hike from the park is followed by the hike to a forklift at Lulley Road in Santa Rosa. The forklift is a pretty nice place to catch a bike. From there, you can follow the climb the day round. The forklift is the easiest way up, though, since the path runs up and down steeply through the trees.

One of the things that has made a bike like this so unique is driving it around the road with the exception of a few trails. The
