I will never forget one of the funniest moments I shared with my best friend. We had been friends since childhood, so I had all but memorized her quirky sense of humor. One night, after weeks of jokingly tormenting each other, we finally decided to go to the movies together.

We settled down with popcorn and drinks in our seats, and the previews began. One particular trailer was so terrible that we couldn't help but laugh hysterically. I remember whispering out of the corner of my mouth to her, "I can't believe they made this movie." 

My best friend tried to contain her laughter, but eventually she let loose in a fit of uncontrollable giggles. Our laughter echoed through the theater, and before long we were both wiping tears of mirth from our eyes. We spent the whole movie laughing and making ridiculous comments about the movie, and at the end of it, we knew that we had made our relationship so much stronger through it.
