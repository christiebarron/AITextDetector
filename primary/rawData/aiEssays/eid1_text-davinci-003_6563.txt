To the Editor, 

I'd like to take a moment to share my thoughts about the effects of computers on people, and the increasing presence of technology in our lives.

Recently, I've noticed more and more people around me, particularly children, becoming increasingly reliant on computers and the internet. Schools are using technology more often in the classroom, and many people's work and leisure activities can now be done online. While this can certainly be a positive thing, I worry that people are spending too much time sitting at a desktop or laptop, and far too little time out and about or enjoying physical activities.

It's so important for people of all ages to remain active and engaged with the world around them, and I see computers as a potential barrier to this. If we become too comfortable with doing things on the screen rather than experiencing them in real life, we run the risk of becoming disconnected with the environment and our communities, leading to more stress, anxiety, and health issues.

In my opinion, computers and technology should be a tool to help us live life better, but not to the exclusion of actual living. We should be mindful of how and when we use the internet; finding ways to ensure that our lives are still enriched by physical, face-to-face interaction. With the right balance, computers can help us make the most of our lives, not take away from it.

Sincerely,
[Your name here]
