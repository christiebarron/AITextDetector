The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Many objected to the ability of the car to go anywhere but the dock to allow the aircraft to fly into the building before they could reach the tower. A further obstacle that would need to be overcome was the "Dock" as a term is now widely used to refer to a "passing" tunnel under the building. In fact, the first dirigibles to enter the WTC were built in the 1960s and 1970s. Many were designed to be used as elevators, which had to be turned on during construction to avoid any possible disruption of the building's exterior due to building heights. Other features included the "Bike", which was the only one known to carry light rail and only was used on the first day of the new building. There were a number of other aspects to this design that may indicate the use of the "Bike" on the first day, the most prominent being the use of elevator windows on the first floor. When an elevator or elevator-like structure was going to descend, it was necessary to turn the building's elevators in one direction or the other for that to happen. This is what caused the height restrictions that have been placed on this area of construction to become common and as such is the reason why the most frequent dirigibles use the left-side of the stairwell on the first floor. There also has been a few construction of "mixed
