An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my father.

He was at work, studying computer science for a PhD in physics with an interest in the human body. He was teaching an introductory Physics class and getting a job. The class he took was on the topic of neural structures. I remember the teacher saying, "This is very hard to talk about but you understand the purpose of neural networks is to learn about the human brain." And so I said, "That's how it works, let's talk about neural net."

I saw his class and started talking to him and asking if he wanted to study computer science; no, no, no, he was curious about the brain and how it was doing. I said, "Ah, this is very challenging," and he said yes.

We worked through a lot â€“ all things computer scientists would say, to say that the whole thing is about the brain. And we used to have something called a neuroscientist who would come up to my house and introduce us to some of the questions we would ask: "Do neurons in the brain have a structure like a brain or can they become part of and maintain a state of consciousness of their surroundings?" Or can we experience and explain some of these structures, and how that could manifest themselves and what sort of world you live in the world in which you're learning so we get to understand it better.

In my father's case, it was
