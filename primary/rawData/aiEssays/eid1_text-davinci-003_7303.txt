In "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski, the cyclist faces multiple challenges throughout the course of the journey. The physical geography of the route, as well as the resources available to the cyclist, influence how successful the cyclist is during this challenging journey. 

The route chosen by the cyclist is primarily mountainous terrain. The cyclist must climb several steep hills, navigating challenging drops and sharp turns as he goes. This adds difficulty to the route, as the cyclist has to expend a great deal of energy to conquer these sorts of inclines. The cyclist also has to consider his momentum, since some of these hills may require a running start to ensure a safe and efficient descent. 

Additionally, the resources available to the cyclist also affect how successful he is. The cyclist is given a limited supply of water as well as relative little food, which suggests that his preparation is incomplete. This could lead to fatigue and a lack of energy, making it even more difficult for the cyclist to conquer the steep inclines.

These physical features of the journey make the cyclist's progression more difficult and demanding. The cyclist must expend a great deal of energy to get from one place to another, and in some cases must make do with limited supplies. This makes for a challenging journey, as each hill comes with its own uniquely difficult set of dangers and obstacles. The cyclist must be prepared to face whatever is thrown his way in order to make it to his destination.
