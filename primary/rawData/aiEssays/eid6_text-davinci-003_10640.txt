The Empire State Building is one of New York City's most iconic landmarks and is renowned for its striking visual presence and innovation. The moored mast, which was designed to allow dirigibles to dock at the skyscraper's pinnacle, is a prime example of this innovation. However, constructing a docking mast for dirigibles at such a high height presented unique and sometimes unforeseen obstacles that the building's designers had to accommodate.

The first challenge was ensuring the mast was strong enough to withstand the strength of the winds at such a vast height. Constructing a mooring mast that was strong enough to bear the weight of an airship was essential. To secure the mast, the designers opted to affix it to the building’s steel frame at the 85th floor. This helped to ensure the mast could withstand the high winds whilst not unduly stressing the building's structure.

The next obstacle was allowing the airship’s passengers to disembark safely onto the building. To accommodate passenger disembarkation from the airship while it was moored, a staircase was built that led to the building’s 85th floor, located directly beneath the mooring mast. The staircase was also surrounded by a wall to provide passengers with extra protection from the wind, as well as grab rails for added stability.

A further challenge was creating an efficient mechanism for the airship to moor itself reliably without damaging the building. To help secure the airship,
