This final line serves as a metaphor for the trials and tribulations of understanding and balancing two cultures in the life of the protagonist. When the hibiscus begins to bud in the spring and the snow melts, signifying the arrival of new life and the end of winter, the protagonist will revisit the test of understanding and balancing two cultures. The snow melting reflects the protagonist's journey as he strives to learn and embrace both of his cultures and the geese represents the connection to his homeland and the return of the cultural knowledge and understanding that will help him to pass the test. The use of the natural metaphors gives the story a sense of hope that one day the protagonist will be able to fully understand and balance his two cultures.
