The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Among them were a reluctance of builders to allow pilots to fly in the space shuttle. Many didn't understand that if people did this, they would be fined for their failure.

The end result? To say some were impressed by the work of the building's designers was a great exaggeration and, in some cases, an understatement. Not much of anything comes out of the whole complex, even though in the following pages we get plenty.

THE NICE THINGS

Some of the early proposals to build a space capsule were a few years out. They would have been built in six years. In reality the first three years were designed to avoid construction costs. Only three years after the first three flights, NASA launched its first commercial space program. That was only a short period of time.

Space capsule designs were in need of a lot of upgrades. The first was a new, compact capsule that would have space-age landing strips under it and a retractable elevator for the passengers who'd come on board. It needed to use new material like silicon and nickel in place of the aging "airfield-tested" parts. This could have made the capsule better suited to its mission, or the crew more human; there already was one. This could have allowed for an even greater lift from landing than needed to carry passengers.

In the end, it proved expensive, the first
