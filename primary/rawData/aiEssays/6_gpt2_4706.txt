The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. To address such problems, the Federal Government issued a rule requiring all buildings to have a fixed speed, from 30 knots to 50 knots. Although the speed was not changed, all construction, including public buildings, had to be within ten knots of high speed.

In a bid to allow more people and businesses to benefit from the speed reduction, the Federal government established a system of compulsory maintenance at the Empire State Building. Construction standards were set to keep the building and its fittings from breaking at more than 100 percent with each successive floor (or with each successive roof if the building did not have one). The steel floors, which had been used during the Civil War, were the standard, and the new steel floors had no additional requirements. In accordance with the rule, construction was permitted until May 1854.

The Federal government implemented the new rule as a national system of standards and practices for all new construction projects until October 1, 1854. A similar system, known as the Standardized Works Committee, was set up to oversee construction and operation of public and other public structures and to guide the construction of public and other public places throughout the Empire State Building until mid-1854. Construction by the Standardized Works Committee and the Standardized Works Committee Building Rules Committee were required to be completed by the end of May 1854. In addition to construction, two rules for the maintenance of the new works
