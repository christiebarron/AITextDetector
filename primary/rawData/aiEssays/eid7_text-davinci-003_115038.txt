When I was in the 4th grade I had a pretty rough teacher. Mrs. Hollenback wasn't the nicest person and she was really strict about following the rules. Despite how hard it was to be in her class, I was determined to do well and still tried my best. I soon found out that she was quite fond of her lectures and often lectured us for things that weren't even our fault. Despite how frustrated I felt during the lectures, I kept my cool and patiently sat through them. 

While I wasn't always the best behaved student, I was always able to maintain my composure and treat her with respect. Even when she was being overly critical of us, I knew that she was just trying to push us to be better and try harder. That's why I was patient and tried to understand her perspective, even though it was sometimes difficult. 

Over the course of the school year, my patience paid off and Mrs. Hollenback began to warm up to me. She even started giving me extra help during class and praising my work. It was really great to feel acknowledged after all the hard work I had put in and I attributed it to being patient and understanding what she was trying to teach us.
