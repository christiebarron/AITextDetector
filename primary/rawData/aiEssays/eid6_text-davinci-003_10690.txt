The idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was a daring concept, one that the builders of the tallest building in the world would have to figure out a multitude of complex solutions to make a reality. In the article “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, it can be seen that the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome a variety of obstacles to create a safe and effective mooring system for the dirigibles.

First, the builders faced the problem of creating a strong enough mast that could withstand the wind that the dirigible generated when landing. This was a major issue because if the mast failed, the safety of the passengers on board would be affected. To address this concern, the Empire State Building developers designed their mast to be three stories tall and made of steel. This not only allowed for the mast to be extra sturdy but also provided a place for the dirigible to be tied down during bad weather.

Second, the builders needed to create a location on the building that would allow for the dirigible to land safely. This posed a particular challenge because the building was situated over a heavily populated urban area and the landing would need to be as swift and precise as possible so as to not endanger pedestrians on the ground. To do this, the builders installed two landing pads at the top of the building, large enough to fit the dirigibles, and outfitted them with electric motors
