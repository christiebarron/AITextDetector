The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because the author took a few things that we may have missed. Among these are the chapter titles (see below) which we got from the library, their cover art and an introduction that we got from our local bookseller. I don't remember being a big fans of the book, but they are an awesome piece of magic! It's a true magic-book that can be read and read like a book. A great resource for any author looking to become an actual magic-book-dancer!
