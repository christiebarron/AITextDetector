At the end of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho, the protagonist is reflecting on an experience in which her friend urged her to take a high school entrance exam. She was not confident that she was prepared for success and did not feel ready for the test. Her internal struggle is represented in the hibiscus flower, which is dormant and without color in the winter, just as she is uncertain and not fully ready for the exam. The ending of the story offers an optimistic and hopeful outlook as the protagonist looks towards the future where she will take the exam again when the hibiscus comes back in bloom in the spring. This metaphor of the hibiscus reflects the protagonist's personal growth and newfound sense of confidence as she awaits the arrival of new opportunities with the warmth of the season.
