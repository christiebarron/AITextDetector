Dear Editor,

It's no secret that computers have the power to revolutionize the way we live our lives. Our lives have been drastically changed for the better by a range of advancements in computing technology.

Today, computers are an essential part of most people's lives. We rely on them to do our shopping, book our travel arrangements and interact with friends and relatives. In addition, computers provide access to vast amounts of information which can significantly improve our knowledge.

However, it has been suggested that computers could be making us lazy and reducing our attention spans. This is particularly true for younger generations, who are growing up with this technology and becoming increasingly reliant upon it.

In my opinion, computer technology is undoubtedly beneficial to society but, like all forms of technology, it should be used responsibly. For instance, computers are not a substitute for real social interaction, and parents should supervise their children's use of social networking sites to ensure they are not spending too much time online.

Ultimately, computers are a great asset to the modern world. But it is important to recognize that, to get the most out of them, we must use them with care and responsibility.

Yours sincerely,

[Your Name]
