The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it puts a lot of emphasis on the characters and the writing. In fact, I would still give this a D+. I love the fact that Hibiscus is set with many places and characters that are interesting and diverse. I especially loved the book's story where Hidari and a group of students in a village discover an artifact from an ancient civilization that might be useful to the world's ruling elite, but the only way to get them to leave is to bring it back to life. Hidari and the group are saved by a girl named Hana. Hana brings them back to life by making them a girl living under a statue of a goddess, but with no memory of the past. Hana will eventually return to his family to return them to life under the statue and the one-time friend, and help Hana realize his dream. It is only natural that Hibiscus will be one of those stories.

Speaking of Hanaâ€¦ I didn't get to see it from the beginning. I went to the bookstore, ordered the book, and saw this amazing, gorgeous cover, done by a beautiful artist called Laura. She is in fact one of the best illustrators in Japan. She also wrote the novel with my friends for me, one of the best. Laura is an amazing writer and editor and I couldn't ask for a better pair of hands on pictures. We're so glad to have
