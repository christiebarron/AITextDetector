One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I took a shot at a friend I was dating. She was one of those people who I think I would have been offended by if she had not put the camera down and put her attention to making fun of me. I wish these people had actually got that far and not let me see where I had got my fun while talking about how much I hated her, but I think I've been too distracted from my own emotions and my own history, and then went into some serious tirades about being racist and something I really felt like I did not understand or want to be called out and told what I did or said. The end result was my friends and family getting angry that I was having this conversation, thinking it was just a silly thing that we all had to deal with. It left me so angry that it really stuck out as to why my friends and I would not be allowed to have conversations about racism, whether it was because of race or for our own personal taste or whatever that thing is. I still feel like I could easily talk about my own racism and make jokes about it, but just because I know it's true doesn't mean I have a problem with it, or anyone should have to go home and discuss it with anyone they don't know or care about. I have gotten a lot of negative and even offensive comments about it, but as far as having a conversation about all of this has gone I am OK with it
