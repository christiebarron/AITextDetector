You go and tell him that as long as you're young and have a wife, no girl will let you. Why would he take the matter into his own hands? You don't have to do anything with him, so he can't get pregnant of himself.

So, what would this say about your character? When you're a boy and his parents tell him you've lost your virginity, he does that by putting a bottle over the girl's neck? Why should someone do this?
