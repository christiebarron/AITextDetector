The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho implies hope. In the poem, the narrator reflects on a difficult exam that she needs to pass in order to go to a good school. She is filled with anxiety and feelings of inadequacy, yet she still has hope that in the coming months (when the snow melts and the geese come back) the hibiscus flowers will be blooming, and that she will take the test again with renewed vigor. The imagery of the blooming hibiscus serves as a reminder that even in difficult times, they can come to an end and things can start blooming again. The ending implies that if she can face her anxieties and fears and take the test a second time when the spring comes, she will succeed.
