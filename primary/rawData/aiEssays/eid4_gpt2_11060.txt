The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because, with its great mystery, it makes you wonder what you have been missing before reading it.

While we've seen what it has to say about the life-and-death struggle to survive through the cold hard winter nights of life, we're only just starting to unravel the secrets the book tells us.

"Winter Hibiscus" tells the story of a young woman who returns from a trip to a rural village and finds herself in a strange world. Though in search of her family life, she must battle the cold and the wind to save some memories.

This is not a game of ice-cold thriller, but a story of hope, conflict, longing.

We know how the world works.

We know more about a woman that finds something unique under the sun at sea to save her family. We know what it means to be a warrior. We know what it means to be an independent man.

We know the secret of life and love.

And the mystery has always found an outlet inside us. It's because we find out how that may be.
