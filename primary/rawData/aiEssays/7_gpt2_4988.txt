An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when my husband was having an issue where he was a little too heavy and I was able to do a better job at keeping him healthy. We worked on the same job doing maintenance on the same side in the same place. I did everything right and left time just fine. Sometimes a job won't give my back up quickly so I made it work. There was a lot of patienceflow, the way they were working over the years. My best work was in the area of building the houses over a period where they were very low cost. The house had two homes. The house was on high price and I was working pretty hard to provide for those homes. The house was used to house an elderly family for a year. My husband was a huge help in helping his brother get off the phone and get some work done while I had my little boys back.

A more accurate way to explain the work we did with the house was to say our house was going to do all of the work for a year and at a reasonable cost to the family over the next year. The house was still under construction, so the cost to the family when that time comes (years from now) I say, this time we do have the house ready for the whole year.
