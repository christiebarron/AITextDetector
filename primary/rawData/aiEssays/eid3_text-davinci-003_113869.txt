In the poem "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski, the cyclist travels through a broad range of terrain and environments. This can affect the cyclist in myriad ways. 

The first of these is the physical effects of the changes in terrain. The cyclist is often trying to make their way up steeper slopes than those encountered elsewhere, and must carefully gauge their energy and pace in order to make sure they do not exhaust themselves before needing to tackle the next ascent. Additionally, the presence of boulders, loose stones, and other rocky obstacles challenge their bike balance and control, presenting the need for quick reflexes and focussed concentration.

The cyclist also has to take into account the weather conditions of their journey. As temperatures rise, which is common in the summer months in many places, it requires the cyclist to replenish their liquids and energy stores more frequently. This must be done in whatever environment they are in, but the lack of options in some places can necessitate extra forward thinking.

The cyclist must also keep aware of the wildlife and plants that is native to the setting of their journey. They must not come too close to any animals that could pose a threat, while also being mindful of poisonous or dangerous plants that they may encounter. 

The features of the road in front of the cyclist can have a big effect on their experience. Through the poem, the cyclist must plot a course to carefully and safely find their way around each area
