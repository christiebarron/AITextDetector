Despite being an ambitious endeavor, this would be the first structure ever to allow such a feat. Nevertheless, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of obstacles along the way.

The first challenge was ensuring that the mooring mast could withstand the considerable weight and force of a docked airship. As such, the builders had to come up with an innovative design to ensure the mast could remain firmly attached to the building and not risk toppling. To this end, they chose to use four suspension cables to make the mast more resistant to winds, with each cable spanning an entire floor of the tall building.
