The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. On the first day of construction, a couple of employees came up with the idea to design three separate docks. A number of construction companies had developed new docks for this purpose. The new docks also had no mechanical integrity or shielding, and they were very expensive to build. There wasn't room for the two-way cables and one-way axles that required that the structure have a new height and height to prevent a collapse.

Construction of the Empire State Building began in early December 1936 and was completed in two phases. The major component of the Empire State Building completed was a huge wall on top of which was a massive and retractable platform. Building engineer Thomas A. Lough and electrician Arthur J. Ehrlich developed the idea here. The platform had a 3,000-foot span that extended the span of the structure to a height of a 30 storeys. The platform also provided insulation, which helped keep the building cool. After construction, the bridge was upgraded and opened for vehicular transportation.

The Building's original design (see Figure 1) has a built-in canopy. The canopy was added in late 1950s and early 1960s as an option for use in the new "Big Tree" towers. The canopy is now on the site. There is nothing to suggest that it was in question prior to the final construction.

The first big tree construction was
