The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it is short but readable, it also helps to establish what is happening in the world, and provides insight into how people use their natural resources to make their own happiness. You want a story like this!

(You can go here for the first edition for a more complete version, but it is priced at $16 and it includes a "A Brief History of Western Civilization" for free downloads!)
