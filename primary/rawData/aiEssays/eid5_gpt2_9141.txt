The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is not a happy one. It's a reminder of how much of our country really feels at its worst. It is the most difficult place the world has ever known. It is a war zone, with a rich man with a lot of power... and a lot more to lose. Yet, despite all the sacrifices we make to survive the war, it will always be true and unbroken.
