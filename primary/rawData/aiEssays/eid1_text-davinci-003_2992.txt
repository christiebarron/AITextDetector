Dear Editor,

I'm writing to express my thoughts about the effect computers have had on our society. While computers can used positively for tasks ranging from running simulations to powering businesses, I believe that they have had a largely negative overall impact on people.

For starters, many of us spend an increasingly large portion of our lives on our computer or other electronic devices. We may be working, gaming, browsing the web, streaming entertainment or, in some cases, losing ourselves in time-consuming activities that cause our attention spans to suffer. As a result, we become increasingly detached from reality and disconnected from the people around us.

Furthermore, computers have changed the way we think and how we interact with each other. We are able to shop, take classes, and even work from the comfort of our own homes, which eliminates the need for us to interact with others in person. Moreover, the ability to rapidly access any type of information at any time results in us relying more on computers to think for us, diminishing our own creative problem solving skills.

Not to mention, computers have led to the rapid rise of spam, malware, and a host of other digital risk factors that can negatively affect our online security and data
