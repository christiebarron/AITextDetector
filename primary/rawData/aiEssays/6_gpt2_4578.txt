The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

The Federal Building Committee determined the dirigibles should be mounted from 12,000 feet with no more than 5,000 feet of vertical clearance. The new U.S. Military Standards Manual, or MRSM, required that "except in special circumstances, dirigibles should be left unattended, as they should of any container or roof on either side of the building. In general, a person wearing or carrying the dirigible, if there is a hazard of causing a collapse or accident, should leave the building as long as possible without causing a collapse, and not to transport or use a crane." But that rule also excluded the propane-powered propane-powered airplanes.

Some pilots were unhappy with the change, especially after planes could be operated by electric power.

In June 1965, Boeing agreed to send a passenger jet powered by diesel (as opposed to propane). The planes, named Delta IV and Delta V, were equipped with a propane-powered engine. The planes were later nicknamed "the Boeing 400."

In 1980, American Airlines signed a memorandum of understanding with the Boeing-led company to transport a U.S. military aircraft equipped to refuel the Soviet Union.

The Soviet Union in 1988 signed a document for an aircraft-battery that will transfer to US military facilitiesENT that an aircraft will be used for refueling.
