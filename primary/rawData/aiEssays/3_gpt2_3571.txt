Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. It has to be understood that the settings are only used for specific sections of the roadway. It's all about who can see the cyclists and who must be aware of them. One of the main problems with Rikers is that they tend to move far too fast â€“ many riders who ride between these 'roadways' will be stopped just by sight. If 'Rough Road Ahead perception' is not used, cyclists will be stopped from a wide angle, rather than facing the road side. In other words, you could have a lot of different riding patterns in a city with fewer cyclists. A bike with a 'Rough Road Ahead' perception would be less difficult to maintain and maintain than a bike with a 'Road Around'. Riding from such a 'Rough Road Ahead' perception might lead to further 'Rough Road Ahead' problems if the way is kept too far from one direction (like turning left or right), or the driver is distracted by any other road or scenery.

The 'Rough Road Ahead' perception was developed by a group of volunteers from the Department for Transport and was adopted by the Bicycle Society of Greater Manchester in May 2016. After many months of development planning we decided to make these three 'Rough Road Ahead' setting scenarios possible. First, let's look at the scenarios for Rikers:
