Censorship in libraries is a highly contested issue, and one that should be given serious consideration. The public library system is a crucial part of our society and should remain a safe space for all community members. 

Some argue that library materials should not be censored, rather libraries should be open to all kinds of materials, including those that may be seen as offensive. However, this assertion overlooks the unique circumstances under which libraries operate. It is the responsibility of libraries to provide materials that are in the best interests of their patrons. 

Quite often, certain materials may be considered offensive due to language, explicit imagery, or tough topics. These materials should be removed from the shelves of libraries for the safety and welfare of library patrons. Access to inappropriate materials can be especially harmful to children, who frequent the majority of library collections, and could cause adverse reactions from parents and guardians of these minors. 

Of course, there is a balance between censorship and wide access to materials. Libraries have a responsibility to provide materials for individuals of all ages and backgrounds, and have the duty to provide a safe place for their patrons to learn, grow, and explore freely. Thus, it is important for libraries to strike a balance between providing materials that could potentially offend some members of the community and the educational needs of patrons.

In conclusion, libraries should censor certain materials when it is necessary to ensure the safety and security of their patrons, while still providing large collections of appropriate material
