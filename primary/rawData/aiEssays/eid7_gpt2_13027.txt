An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a few years ago. An amazing patient came into my office to sit with and talk with, a brilliant individual, who in an incredibly long time has left a legacy of helping his patients through a period of stress and trauma (many of which he could not change). Our story of overcoming a trauma can now be shared with you by those who will be around her daily life. For myself, a time before I became a psychologist, I sat in a room full of experienced patients for nearly 20 years. A few of us spent nearly half that time at the center, or with another person. As I took my writing practice to the next level, I learned that it was a very hard profession.

In any case, while the average person knows the difference between success and failure, one that I learned personally by listening to the stories of so many patient patients is that you don't have the ability or the desire to make yourself miserable. At the same time, these stories, often shared by others, are extremely helpful in making you feel "normal." That being said, people don't want to be held hostage by these stories because they want to live with them and experience life the way they love. They just want people to feel what you're feeling and, in a way, to be happy. By following the love and care of a well-adjusted person, you'll find yourself in peace with a hard place.
