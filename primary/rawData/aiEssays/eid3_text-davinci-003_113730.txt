The setting is very important in Joe Kurmaski's story "Rough Road Ahead". It is set in rural Wisconsin and evokes the feeling of desolation and hopelessness. The cyclist in the story is an unnamed twenty-five year old woman who is struggling to stay on her bike. 

The first feature of the setting that affects the cyclist is the terrain. It is described as a dirt and gravel road that is pitted with rocks and stones. The constant bumps in the road make it difficult for the cyclist to stay on her bike and keep her balance. The terrain is also described as being grey and dull, creating a sense of loneliness and isolation for the cyclist. 

The second feature of the setting that affects the cyclist is the weather conditions. It is raining heavily, making the already difficult terrain even harder to navigate. The rain and the mud hinder the cyclist's progress and make it difficult for her to stay on her bike. The darkness of the sky adds to the sense of solitude and hopelessness that the cyclist feels. 

The third feature of the setting that affects the cyclist is the soundscape. It is silent except for the sound of rain and the occasional cry of an animal. There is a sense of loneliness and despair in the atmosphere which makes the cyclist even more determined to get to where she needs to go. 

The features of the setting all work together to make the cyclist's task more difficult and give her a greater challenge
