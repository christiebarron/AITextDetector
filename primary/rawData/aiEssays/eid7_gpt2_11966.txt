An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a father who died in a hospital after it flooded a power plant. He did not remember much at the time of the flood but at the time the flood stopped, he came home and I was doing some of the most useful cleaning of my garden as a father would. The flood was just beginning. When there was a lot of rain at the time, I had to pump water out in the garden to get a lot of water back. The power company gave me this, and they did the job perfectly, then they started a flood control system because there wasn't too much to do with the water.

It was at this time that the power company decided what they were going to do - to pump water and make sure there was sufficient pressure to keep the garden up on the field and not drown and so on. The water went into the garden, there was enough so many water there to make a difference in the area to stop it happening. (He was so impressed with the experience that he called the man who came into the power plant.)

Once the flood stopped he took off like a pro. He had a good feeling of security and had very little to worry about. He worked in the field for about six months, and then he and his family got married in the Spring of 2012. I was born and raised in Northern California, so I have a large family here.
