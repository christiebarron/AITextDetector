The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it's a story about two of the most important things the author believes are possible: what happened to a young girl because she became infected; and it ends the way it does because it doesn't. In it, he uses the "I hope you won't fall victim to this virus so you can get up today and start living like a good guy that you were fighting against."

Like the rest of the book, Winter Hibiscus doesn't just tell you what happened to the girl because she was infected. Winter reads what is said about her the most, he tells you everything, she knows his story, she reads all the things the author says about what happened to her.

But a few pages, in part, he starts to describe the character who has to keep up with him. He gets to know another character. Here, he doesn't try to hide that he's a sick little girl: he's no longer the girl's father.

Which is odd because why would he make this one about how to do something like that?
