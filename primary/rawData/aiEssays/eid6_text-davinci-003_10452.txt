The construction of the Empire State Building is widely considered to be one of the engineering marvels of the 20th century. As a testament to its ambition, the building is famously adorned with an earmarked "mooring mast" at the very tip of its spire, a facility designed to allow airships the opportunity to dock. Although this was an interesting design choice for the time, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of obstacles in making the dream of docking dirigibles a reality. 

One of the most notable issues faced by the builders of the Empire State Building revolved around the mast itself. Although the mast was written into the building’s design from its inception, the architects and engineers involved in the project initially resigned themselves to the idea that it would remain nothing more than a decorative feature. As Marcia Amidon Lüsted explains in her article "The Mooring Mast," the mast was one of the last elements to be fully designed and constructed, and the engineers involved admitted to being "unsure of the exact features that would be necessary to make it practicable for use." In the end, the mast was constructed using a steel cable-and-winch system to allow airships to tie themselves off.

After the mast had been designed, the builders of the Empire State Building and the Airship Trails Club in the United States (who had proposed the idea of a docking system in the first place) grappled with another
