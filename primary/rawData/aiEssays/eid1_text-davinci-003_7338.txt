This steep and mountainous terrain holds many physical challenges for the cyclist, and the harsh mountain climate makes his journey more difficult. 

The cyclist is first challenged by the hilly terrain that requires pedaling and shifting gear. He has to keep up with the other riders in order to stay in the race, and the challenge of the varying inclines makes it more difficult for him. The weather also takes its toll on the cyclist. It is cold in the mountains, and the snow and icy conditions puts him at a disadvantage. He has to take extra caution to prevent slipping or crashing, and this causes him to have less energy overall.

The environment also presents the cyclist with a mental challenge.
