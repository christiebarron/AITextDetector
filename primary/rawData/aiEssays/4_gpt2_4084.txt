The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it tells readers how, in an alternate world known as Atlantis, the first human civilization on Earth became extinct five centuries after Earth-616.

Celestia, who appears as a character briefly on the beginning of the book, takes in the Earth at the end of the first book due to the discovery of another dimension, called The Land From My Fire.

The novel covers all of the story, except for the climax.

In the end, the book ends with the Earth's loss of its homeworld.
