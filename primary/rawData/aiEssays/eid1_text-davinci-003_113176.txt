Dear Editor,

These days, computers and gadgets are a common presence in people's lives. Many of us rely heavily on these tools to help us with our everyday tasks. But it is also important to consider how these devices affect us in the long run.

My opinion is that computer usage has had both positive and negative effects on humans. In many ways, computers have certainly made life easier. We can now research information quickly, communicate with friends and family instantaneously, and even work remotely. However, there are certain drawbacks that must be acknowledged.

Studies show that prolonged computer use has been linked to strains on the eyes, neck, and back, as well as increased levels of stress due to multitasking. People also tend to be more sedentary when they are in front of a computer and this may lead to an unhealthy lifestyle.

In conclusion, I think it is important to strike a balance between using computers and living a healthy lifestyle. People should be mindful of how much time they spend using computers and ensure that they are taking breaks and getting enough physical activity throughout the day.

Thank you for your time and consideration. 

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
