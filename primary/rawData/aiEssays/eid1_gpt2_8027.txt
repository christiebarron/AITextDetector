Smith has previously written that the very idea of living in some sort of 'hyper-cinematic virtual reality world' might seem quaint, particularly in the age of online social networks. So, too, do some of the many theories that have emerged around it. But he also points out that there is much we can learn from what we've seen, from the facts that we've been able to detect, from what we have been able to identify, and from what we've seen so far from the reality.
