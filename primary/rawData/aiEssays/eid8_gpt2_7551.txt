One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I met my girlfriend at their wedding. She was very very happy and supportive, and I was glad to have her there. After making an appointment with someone on our team and looking at their faces I started having an easy laugh. I felt that I got "back up" all through our meeting and was more grateful for it. I told them they have some more opportunities to learn and I believe that this is a great opportunity for them to grow in other areas of their lives. And one more time when we both made it and we kissed. And she said "Oh yes please" but it was as if that's why I got back up so much faster than that. Just one, we get to see and experience love that we had not even conceived of until so many years pass. Thank you - - - Love You
