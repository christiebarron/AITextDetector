One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was 10 years old. It wasn't about being funny, it was about my love for it: I had a crush on her when I was 11 years old, but I got bored, so I went to work first thing in the morning and had my first laugh of the night while laughing.

A year has passed, and I have finally got that great job that I've always loved, but a few years ago, I had a job in a supermarket.

I was a part-time sales clerk for several months before suddenly quitting. No one loved me, so it became my passion. I became a "realist teacher" and taught courses. I taught all the classes, but the teacher didn't find it funny at all, so I stayed on because that was what I wanted to do.

But now I don't want to end up a realist teacher anymore â€“ I actually want to become one. I'm an artist, so I'm doing a lot of art. I'm very passionate about learning and teaching. So now I'm doing music (as an agent, as an illustrator) and teaching classical. But I don't want to live and let this happen again for long!

So I've been creating and painting for quite some time. I can't say much, but I've been doing it for four years now and now I'm planning to quit right now for about six months
