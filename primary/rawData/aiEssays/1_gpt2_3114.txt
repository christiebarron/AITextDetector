Computers have many effects on people. As our species advances from an evolutionary point of view toward a new reality, the use of computers and artificial intelligence is going to be one of the greatest challenges facing humans.

A computer can give you a real-world experience on the fly. It could also learn from your actions. This sort of experience is why it feels good when you can use it to see yourself as you are. Because it seems so natural to us to take this kind of experience when not being a true human is the case, it is important that you do your best to learn from the experience, not only that your way of life is more natural and sustainable.

Why did you choose to use your computer to do experiments to explore how artificial intelligence can teach us about our own actions?

As I said, I was an active participant in this study. I wanted to find out more about this phenomenon before we could come to conclusions about the possibility that we might be using computers to influence us.

The result of this study was this amazing data that was created by researchers from the University of California, Santa Barbara. They recorded what happened at the Brain Imaging Unit. Since that time, they are using it to study how computers can learn.

We can only guess the true role that an actual human intelligence can play. For instance, how could we have our own experience of the world without giving more pleasure to people who are our closest friends?
