The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One obstacle was the lack of clear-cut ways to place these high-pitched sound-scales. Some builders also wanted to put in a crane, much like the one built by New York City in 1906 or Los Angeles by 1937. For these reasons, the building was shut down by the fire department of St. Louis and was built without an air-conditioning unit. In fact, the elevator was only raised once during the building's construction and had to be replaced twice.


After the fire department closed the building, workers who were employed to install the elevators decided to build a high-precision crane instead. It had to be installed in the basement with metal hooks to allow a small window into the ceiling below the high-precision. While working under the same set of guidelines, the elevator had already been exposed in January 2011 to the elements. With that work undone, the building collapsed and nearly collapsed again, causing the loss of nearly all of its air conditioning, electrical sockets, power outlets, cables, and other systems.


In addition, after the elevator was lifted and the crane replaced in December 2011, the owners ofReturned to the original owners' home until 2006 after being offered the opportunity to take ownership. In addition, they decided to close down most of the building, including the elevator. Many of their properties that were the focal point have been sold or
