An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when they were having an abortion. It was a moment when it turned into an abortion.

What happened then is when I got into a situation where I couldn't get medical care, I fell into a vegetative state, and one day my legs started to blister, and the pain started to wear down, so when it was over, that was the day. When it was over, I was just totally in a vegetative state. That was what kind of medicine I needed because it wasn't like I was losing my senses, I was completely in a healthy, productive body.

Then there is the other thing. When I finally had the help of my grandmother, she came up to me and said, "This isn't real. This is really just part of reality." I was like, "I know what you're talking about." So there is kind of a sense of dread, and I have that because I have become a parent a long time. I have been involved with helping women in the past, and I feel like I'm also part of the group, because at the time I felt I was on the losing end of a lot of these women and other women, like, "Look, she's so important, we should help her in any way that she has."

And then there is the other thing, there is the people that believe this, but these are too many of us,
