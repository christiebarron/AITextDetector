Computers have many effects on people. They have little to no influence on how people think, socialize and do their work. Science has shown us that the majority of our knowledge gets used by technology, and some it does not. It is very often an over-reliance on computer software that allows our brains to be shaped (like in biology, which turns into computer programming in our brains).

What we are experiencing today is much the wrong direction. It is too early to start talking about what these new technologies, technologies that have enabled the brain to form our brains and to play a much larger role in brain development and communication are doing. We may never even know if new discoveries will improve our understanding of the world. This is due to a lack of knowledge, and ignorance, the way that it has been for thousands of years.

I know it seems impossible, so I will continue to explain in a few more chapters about how AI and brain development work and how we might learn more about them. If you haven't read the chapters with the words "the human brain", let me just ask you. What does that mean for us humans? Well, it means that you might think you know less about the matter than we do. If you're just going to learn about how our brains work and how the technology can help us understand our minds and bodies well, what will it mean for you to learn about how we are developing and making decisions? That you might look at
