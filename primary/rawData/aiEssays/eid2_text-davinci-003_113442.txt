As the world continues to grapple with the issue of censorship in libraries, it is important that we make educated, fact-based decisions about which materials should and should not be allowed. Libraries should never be used as a platform for censorship, and no material, books, music, movies, magazines, or otherwise should be removed from the shelves just because someone finds it offensive.

The purpose of a library is to be a place of education, learning, and the exploration of ideas, and controversial topics should not be feared. If anything, these materials should be readily available so that people can objectively engage with the material and form an educated opinion about it. The decisions about this kind of material should focus on accuracy, scientific literacy, and understanding the material is apolitical. 

Further, even matters that are deemed offensive by some individuals have the potential to be inherently educational. From a more practical perspective, libraries are part of a public network and are funded by taxpayer dollars; no one person should be allowed to dictate which materials are available on the shelves. 

The issue of censorship in libraries is complicated but the answer is clear; meaningful conversation should be had about these subjects, not a knee-jerk reaction to stifle them. Books, magazines, movies, music, and other materials should not be banned just because they could be perceived as “offensive”- instead, they should be used as a tool to open up intelligent, informed discussions.
