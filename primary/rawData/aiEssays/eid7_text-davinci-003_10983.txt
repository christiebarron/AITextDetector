I had a good friend with whom I shared many of my embarrassments and successes. Recently, I had been preparing to take an important test that would determine the course of my future. I was nervous, so I tried hard to practice and studied for days. 

My friend was incredibly patient with me during this time. Even when I was grumpy and aggravated over the material, they would comfort me with kind words and encourage me to keep on going. They even went out of their way to help me memorize facts and formulas.

On the day of the exam, I was so stressed that I almost backed out. But with their help, I was able to push through and take the test. I'm unbelievably thankful to my friend for the amount of patience and support they showed me. Without them, I'm not sure I could have been successful.
