In Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead," the cyclist must confront the features of the setting as he races toward the finish line. The setting is an obstacle course packed with hills and curves along with other elements that make the road ahead challenging.

The hills prove to be one of the biggest challenges for the cyclist, as he must climb up and over them in order to make progress. The hills require a great amount of physical and mental strength, as the rider needs to summon the energy to power up the inclines and remain focused to ensure that he safely navigates the hike.

The curving paths of the road provide more difficulty in that they become increasingly difficult to follow the further the rider advances. With each bend, the terrain shifts and the cyclist must constantly adjust his ride in order to remain on the correct path. This constant shifting also demands a considerable amount of energy, as the rider must focus on staying within the boundaries of the course while simultaneously exerting the energy necessary to make progress.

The sun and wind also create an obstacle for the rider as he strives to reach the finish line. The sun is a source of distraction, as it shines in the cyclist's eyes and can make it difficult for him to stay focused on the road ahead. The wind, meanwhile, can help or hinder the rider as it determines how his body moves throughout the course.
