The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One of the most significant challenges was the technical and engineering constraints of the building itself. Despite its imposing 1,250-foot height, the building was not structurally designed for the strength requirements needed to withstand the external forces of a large airship.

The erection of the mooring mast and the configuration of the telescoping mast spire to which a dirigible would hook presented further problems. The mooring mast had to be at least 200 feet above the observation deck, and yet tall enough for the airship to dock. A height of 1,400 feet was settled upon, yet the tall mast structure had to be constructed to absorb the shock from the immense incoming and outgoing forces of the dirigible. Design solutions to minimize vibration were employed, including the use of a hydraulic dampening system within the telescoping mast.

Further challenges were posed by both the movement of the airship and the height of the building’s roof. To dock, the airship would have to slow down and eventually come to a complete stop while suspended in the air—an incredibly difficult feat. Furthermore, to be operational, the mooring mast had to be visible to the ships’ pilots.

The idea of the Empire State Building being accessible to dirigibles was a daring one, but the builders nonetheless pushed through and overcame the technological hurdles. The determination
