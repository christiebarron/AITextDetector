I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is essential.

The First Amendment, which includes this provision, was not intended solely as a safeguard against those who wish to deprive the government of "all Power which may be directly or indirectly derived from the dictates of man, or from the exclusive Power by which he may be secured by his Creator" (The Freedom From Religion Foundation v. Madison, 611 U. S. 1, 12 (1996) (citing United States v. Theodoridis, 438 U. S. 491, 502 (1978)). Rather, the First Amendment was intended as a means of protecting free speech, which was, of course, not a goal of this case and can be used in other contexts: for example, "to prevent any person from saying or publishing an untruthful Act of Congress," 442 U. S. at 665 ("and to prevent any government body from forcing its employees or its associates to obey the Constitution by means of laws of other countries, by threatening, and usually with violence, to do so"); and "[t]he First Amendment does not protect or guarantee the government from being subjected to the pressures of those who seek to control its activity."
