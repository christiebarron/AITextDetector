Dear Editor, 

Today, computers have become such an integral part of modern life that it can be difficult to imagine life without them. While computers play a valuable role in streamlining and improving efficiency, there is an ongoing debate on the effects they have on people. 

In my opinion, the widespread presence of computers has had both positive and negative effects. To begin with, computers have made many aspects of our lives much easier. They allow us to access information, communication, and entertainment quickly and easily. Additionally, computers have reduced physical labor in the workplace, creating more opportunities for workers and increasing efficiency. 

On the other hand, computer use can have detrimental effects on our lives if left unchecked. For example, people can become addicted to playing computer and video games, which can lead to a lack of physical activity and social isolation. Similarly, those who frequently use computers may find themselves spending less time on healthy outdoor pursuits. 

Ultimately, I believe computers can be a great aid when used responsibly. We should take the necessary steps to ensure that computers are used responsibly in order to maximize the positive effects and minimize the risks. 

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
