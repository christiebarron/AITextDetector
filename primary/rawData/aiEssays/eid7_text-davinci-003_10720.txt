I was at the supermarket the other day, waiting in line to buy my groceries. The person in front me had a large cart filled with items, and the cashier was ringing each one through slowly. 

I had already been waiting in line for about 15 minutes, so I was feeling a bit impatient. But instead of letting my frustration show, I just told myself to be patient. 

I thought about the reasons why the person in front might be taking a long time: maybe they didn't have enough money to fully pay for all the groceries, or maybe they just had a lot to purchase. Whatever the reason, I decided to remain kind and understanding, even if the process was taking a while. 

Finally, after about 30 minutes, the person in front finished paying and I was able to move up to the cashier. Even though it had taken much longer than I had expected, I was pleased that I had been able to be patient and not let my impatience get the better of me.
