The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. As such, the "H" shape was a big hit for many developers but there were many problems.

The H was designed with "H" in the center of the ceiling. H was also designed to contain three elements:

1) A vertical-sided design, to be able to fit all elevators

2) A central horizontal-sided feature, to be accommodated by a small vertical wall

3) A vertical-sanded design in which the vertical portion of the ceiling was removed from under the roof and the horizontal portion was connected to the lower side of the building

This horizontal-sided design became the HV. The H-shape was an attempt to make the design more "flexible" by allowing a lower height of the building to be accommodated without creating a higher floor than the HV. By the time of building the Empire State Building (EBR) in 1883, the HV was 5 feet (60 cm) wide and 20 feet (100 cm) high. By early 1840, the H was about 5 feet (30 cm) long and about 3 feet (2.1 cm) tall, and by 1840 1825 it was estimated that it was 4.1 feet (3.7 cm) tall and 0.9 feet (1.1 cm) tall. Despite its small size and construction limitations, early commercial construction
