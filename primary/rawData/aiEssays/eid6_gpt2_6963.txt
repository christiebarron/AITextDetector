The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They needed both time and space to install a "headliner," said David M. Johnson, a professor of political science at Ohio State University's School of Civil Engineering. A second, older structure had to be constructed.


._But there were others.

Two weeks before the start of the demolition of the Empire State Building, engineers tore back roof panels, then moved the rest of the building. "If you put some new steel and reinforced reinforced steel on the roof, the windows, even on each side, would show that this was going to be an event," said Robert F. Thompson, a partner who specializes in building the Empire State Buildings in Cleveland.


The two "calls" were so important that Mr. Thompson would eventually go on a "headliner" project which included placing two concrete cements at thepicked ground. The two cements, one on a side that ran across the building. On top of that, the steel frames were added as an attachment for the steel.


The two concrete cements on the front side of the building showed they meant the building, built a decade earlier, was in some sense a "death tower" since the steel's structural foundation can collapse.
