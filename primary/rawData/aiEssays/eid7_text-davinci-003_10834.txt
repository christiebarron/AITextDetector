I remember the time I was waiting in line to purchase a movie ticket. The line was incredibly slow. The people before me were taking forever to complete their transactions. I watched as the man at the counter became increasingly irritated. I could feel his exasperation in the air.

I, on the other hand, remained calm. I remained in my spot in line, making sure to keep an appropriate distance from the person in front of me. Even though I was growing frustrated, I didn't give in to my feelings and I stayed patient. I took a few deep breaths and read a few articles on my phone to help pass the time.

Finally, the line began to move and I was able to purchase my ticket. I thanked the man behind the counter for his patience and thanked those who were standing behind me. Everyone was thankful and relieved that the line didn't drag on for too long.

Though it took me a while to get my movie ticket, I'm proud of myself for staying patient. It was a lesson in self-control and understanding.
