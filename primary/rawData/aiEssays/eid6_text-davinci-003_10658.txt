The construction of the Empire State Building was well underway when there was a proposal to add a mast and docking mechanisms on top of the skyscraper in order to allow dirigibles to dock. While this idea was initially met with enthusiasm by the public, the reality of planning and implementing such an undertaking was full of obstacles that presented unique challenges to the builders of the tower.

The first major obstacle facing those who wished to incorporate the mast to the Empire State Building was the sheer height of the building itself. As a skyscraper, the Empire State Building stands at 1,860 feet tall, making it a potential hazard to dirigibles with wind turbulence and destabilizing air pockets. As such, the builders had to take into consideration the physics of flight such as wind shear, air pressure, and wind currents when planning out the mast construction and docking mechanisms.

The second obstacle was the environmental pressures posed by the busy metropolis of New York City. Building and maintaining the mast posed a major risk of disruption to air traffic, as dirigibles would have to fly low enough for comfort without interfering with other aircrafts in the sky. Additionally, the noise associated with the arrival and departure of dirigibles in major cities was a concern - both for citizens on the ground and the operators of the dirigibles themselves.

The third obstacle was the cost of the mast itself. Dirigible docking was still relatively new technology back in the early 1930s and even the most
