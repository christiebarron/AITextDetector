I was recently travelling with a group of friends on a long haul flight. As soon as we had all settled into our seats we were informed that there was a delay due to technical issues. My friends were all getting agitated but I knew that these issues were out of our control, so I decided to remain patient. 

I distracted myself by reading and playing games, and I could see that the flight attendants were doing their best to help us. After about 3 hours they finally announced that the plane would be taking off, and everyone around me seemed very relieved. The situation could have easily boiled over if I had not stayed calm, and I was happy to have been the calming force in the group. My friends thanked me later for demonstrating patience in the face of adversity.
