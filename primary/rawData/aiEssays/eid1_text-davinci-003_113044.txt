Dear Editor, 

I’d like to discuss the impact of computers on people’s lives. In many ways, computers have revolutionized the way we work, communicate, learn, and shop. But it’s important to consider how these advantages can be a double-edged sword.

I believe excessive dependence on computers can have a negative effect on our lives. Firstly, increased screen time can be harmful for our physical health. Sitting in front of a computer for prolonged periods of time can lead to stagnant posture, eye strain, and even depression. Secondly, computers can discourage some of the activities essential for creating strong relationships. Instead of physically interacting with people, many of us would rather stare at a computer and type out a few words.

It’s true that computers offer many advantages, but too much reliance on them is certainly not ideal. I think it is important to recognize our own limitations when it comes to our dependence on technology and take an active role in balancing out screen time with activities that contribute to our physical and mental wellbeing.

Sincerely, 

[Your name]
