I believe that censorship of materials in libraries should be abolished.

We've also been told that it's not clear that the government is committed to reducing bullying and abusive behaviour at the library.

The Australian Media and Communications Commission says it's prepared to remove websites that "encourage bullying, discrimination or harmful behaviour".

Some sites include the Guardian, The Australian Financial Review and The Australian Medical Association.

The Commission is proposing that all sites using terms like "rape" or "sexual abuse" be banned altogether.
