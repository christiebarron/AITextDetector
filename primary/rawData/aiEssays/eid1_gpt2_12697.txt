Computers have many effects on people. The more they interact with computer systems, the better they are at understanding, planning and interpreting that system and the finer points of the problems will come about more quickly. The more machines that interact with the world, the smarter individuals, the more they can recognize problems at hand, and have more tools to help them solve the problems better. This has been the primary motivation for many computer scientists to take that approach [see also: The Human Brain as a Brain: Implications for Computational Physics], and see the consequences for human intelligence and work behavior.

To a computer scientist, a problem is often a complex problem involving parts interacting simultaneously. A computer is designed with two components: a single processor that translates the words into mathematical structures, and a special program that handles the task at hand. For example, a computer needs to calculate the value of a binary system with two sides, that are connected by a solid line. The data are encoded in the program.

If it were possible to calculate a set of points at different times in a program, the program would be programmed differently as two different sets were being calculated each. With that process repeated in the same program, the program would be able to know at least one solution in the program and find the part that is "the correct one" in each situation because, according to computer scientists, that is the solution to the problem of the program. But the complexity of the problem does not mean that
