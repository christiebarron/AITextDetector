I believe that censorship of materials in libraries works in the very wrong way to protect those who are entitled to free expression. On the other hand my own personal belief is that a right like yours should not be taken for granted. I believe that if you allow content that is not in violation of your moral right then the public will be able to know that you are not above criticism. I believe that we need those who hold these positions to be held accountable for the very bad decisions they made on behalf of our common interests if we want to protect free speech and freedom of expression.
