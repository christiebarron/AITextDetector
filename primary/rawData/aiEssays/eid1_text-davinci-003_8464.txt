I remember one time when I was about 8 years old, I wanted to learn how to ride a bike. So I asked my mom to help teach me. One day the weather was perfect for bike riding, but I was still struggling. I was starting to get frustrated and about to give up, but then my mom said, "It's ok, sweetie. Take your time and keep practicing. I'm here to help whenever you need."

That moment, I was touched by my mom's words. She was so patient to not only stay with me and encourage me but to also constantly be checking on me to make sure I wasn't getting too tired or overwhelmed. Even though I was still learning and it took a lot of practice, I eventually did learn how to ride a bike. All because my mom was patient with me and was there to support me.
