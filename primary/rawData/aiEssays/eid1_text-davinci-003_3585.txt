I remember the first time I met my now husband. I was so nervous, but he had a great sense of humor that put me at ease almost immediately. We both had traveled far in the night to get to our destination, but despite our exhaustion, we couldn't help but joke around with each other.

I was so impressed by the way he found the humor in life and could make me laugh in a matter of seconds. We sat in a cozy coffee shop, sipping our drinks and laughing for what seemed like forever. I remember feeling a connection between us that I had never felt before. 

Time flew by as we talked and laughed together. Finally, we decided it was time to part ways and he kindly offered to walk me back to my hotel. We continued to laugh and joke around the entire way. The sun was starting to come up and it made me feel so happy that I started to skip down the sidewalk. I was completely in my element and without warning I let out the loudest, most hilarious laugh I'd ever made. 

My husband was taken aback at first but then couldn't help joining in on the laughter. I remember that moment so vividly and it was in that moment I knew that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him.
