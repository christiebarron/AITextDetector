An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a guy on their way to work, but he had a few issues for them and would drop everything in one fell swoop. And no good doctor could help him. And that's in 1998. He came for his vacation, but they still had an appointment and he didn't have the money to get a lawyer. The problem was, he wasn't there to help you. He had an appointment. He dropped it. And they needed to deal with him in the other direction at that point, so he just picked up the phone and called his lawyers. He called a friend in New York in 1999-2000. So it wasn't that much of a problem. He had some time on the line. He ended up taking the money to get another surgery to be made.

The original problem was with the two physicians that did that. And one of these three physiciansâ€”you know, you get this story. I'm going to get you an example of an old joke about that and a one-time complaint. And the other doctor complained, but the thing is none of the doctors in this case and none of the doctors who actually cared that much about that incident.
