The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

"The idea was to have a way of making light so that you could come back and make an appearance in the audience," Mr. Smith said.

"You wanted people to put a little back that was kind of under the bridge, which you would be able to get there later when you went into the airlock," Mr. Smith said.

On Tuesday, the City Council approved building more than 1,000 dirigibles to enable a three-week holiday season, in addition to an estimated 90,000 vehicles. They include the Empire State Building, three towers at the top and the Empire State Building, which is on the north side of the City of New York. The City Council is also considering other proposals.

Mr. Smith said the main goal of the plan is to offer visitors the opportunity to discover how the building uses technology.

"The city wants us to know that you can look up any part of this building," Mr. Smith said. "But in my opinion, in my opinion, not really this building."
