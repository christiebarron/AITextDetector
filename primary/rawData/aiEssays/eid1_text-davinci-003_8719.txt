I'll never forget the time I shared a laugh with an old friend.

It was on a dark and stormy night, after a particularly long week at work. I decided to stay in and catch up with an old college buddy of mine over the phone. Our conversations usually started with us swapping stories of our work lives, but this time I needed a break.

So, I decided to take a chance. I asked her to tell me a funny story.

In a completely unexpected turn of events, she told me a tale about the spider living in her bathroom. She described the huge arachnid, so big she had to go get help from the maintenance team at her apartment.

At first, it was a bit of a dark tale but then something amazing happened: she and the maintenance guy started laughing. It turned out that he had seen the same spider the day before. When she told him that the spider was too big for her to catch, he offered to come help.

I couldnâ€™t help but laugh. It was such a silly story and we were both laughing so hard that we could hardly finish the story. In that moment, it felt like no time had passed between us since college. Despite the miles that still separated us, it was just like when we were together: two old friends, sharing a laugh.
