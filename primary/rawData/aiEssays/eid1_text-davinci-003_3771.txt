Dear Editor,

I am writing to voice my opinion on the effects of computers on people and to persuade readers to agree with me.

In todayâ€™s world, computers are everywhere and a large portion of society relies on them for a variety of tasks. From doing homework to completing work obligations, computers have become an integral part of everyday life.

However, I believe that due to their powerful capabilities, computers can create both positive and negative effects on people. On one hand, computers make tasks easier and more efficient by automating processes and allowing us to view digital information with ease. However, computers can also negatively affect people by creating addictions and distracting us from other important activities.

Therefore, it is important for people to use computers in a controlled and responsible manner. People should be aware of the effects computers can have on them and prioritize activities that improve their physical and mental well-being, such as exercise and social interactions.

In conclusion, computers are very powerful tools that can offer numerous advantages. However, they must be used responsibly in order to maintain a balanced lifestyle. I hope that this letter encourages readers to think critically about how computers can and do affect them.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
