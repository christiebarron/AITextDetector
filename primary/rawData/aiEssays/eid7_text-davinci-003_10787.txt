 

I was out shopping the other day for ingredients to make dinner when I noticed my elderly neighbor who was struggling with his bags. Instinctively, I went over to offer my help. I asked him if he would like me to give him a hand. He said he could manage it, but he ended up dropping part of his groceries, and it made it clear he could use a little help.

At first, I was a bit taken aback as he declined my offer. But then I thought to myself that maybe he just wanted to remain independent. So, rather than insisting on helping him I simply said I was there if he needed anything. For a few minutes we just stood together without saying a word.

Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, he asked if I could help him with his groceries and I gladly obliged. We made light conversation as I carried his groceries for him, and I offered to help him with any errands he could come up with in future. He thanked me for being patient.

That moment taught me that rather than pushing help onto those who may not want it, it's better to wait and allow them to ask for help when they are ready.
