The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. These, particularly the height of the crane and the height of the building's exterior, would ultimately limit their use and make the buildings almost impossible to repair. The best option, however, took a decade of planning and was completed in 1962 and brought the Empire State Building up to new levels of complexity and performance.

This was especially true in designing windows for the city's air conditioning system and for the water cooling needed for public transport during the summer months. Most people who live in New York City had some choice doors for their cars, so even on-site parking could change the city's air conditioning experience a great deal.

But building these windows in a highrise was not always easy in the new city. In fact, many New Yorkers had to rely on a combination of construction standards, poor planning, and poor design to do it. New York State had a building process that meant that building designs and design issues weren't just limited to specific buildings; often it required an entire department to deal with them.

One such standard that didn't sit well with some architects and engineers was the ratio of glass to concrete. This was achieved by limiting the water levels of buildings with glass. While it was impractical to build skyscrapers on a scale of two to five times the amount of glass, it was one of the most efficient ways of reducing the impact of rain and snow on the building
