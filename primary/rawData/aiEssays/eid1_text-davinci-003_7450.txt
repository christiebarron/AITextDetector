At the end of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho, the protagonist is looking ahead to the future, specifically the spring when her exams will take place. Through the reference to the snows melting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding, Ho is referencing a cycle of coming full circle and the idea of renewal and resilience. It creates a metaphor for the protagonist's own journey. Despite the difficulties that arise with studying for the tests, she is hopeful that when all these signs of winter thawing arrive, she will have the opportunity to try again and do her best.
