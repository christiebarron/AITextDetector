The Empire State Building was designed with the innovative vision of containing a dirigible docking facility. Although this central feature of the building was intended to facilitate an efficient entrance to the building, the project to build this feature faced several obstacles.

The primary obstacle encountered during the construction of the Empire State Building was the large amount of structural and engineering work that had to be undertaken in order to accommodate the dirigible docking platform. A large mooring mast needed to be built on top of the building in order to provide an anchor point for the dirigibles. This mast, known as the “Mooring Mast”, was designed to be strong enough to support the weight of a fully loaded airship, but also had to meet the complex standards of the New York City Building Code. The original design of the mast had to be altered numerous times in order to meet these requirements, leading to lengthy delays in the construction process.

In addition to these structural problems, the project to build the Empire State Building was further complicated by the high cost of construction materials. The mast had to be made using steel, which was expensive at the time. To further increase the costs, engineers determined that the mooring mast had to be surrounded by a larger structure containing windscreens, lights, and other necessary features in order to safely facilitate the docking of the dirigibles. 

Finally, the numerous advances in airport construction technology since the completion of the building meant that
