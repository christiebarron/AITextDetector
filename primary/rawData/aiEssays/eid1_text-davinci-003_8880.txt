I remember scrolling through my smartphone, staring intently at the tiny screen as my husband lay next to me, snoring contentedly. Suddenly, I heard a spark of laughter burst out from his mouth and I glanced up in surprise. I saw that he was still asleep and couldn’t help but be intrigued as to what he was dreaming about that had tickled him so. I couldn’t help but chuckle too, wondering what amusing scenes were unfolding in the recesses of his mind. As his laughter bubbled away, I felt a warmth responding inside of me and I snuggled closer into his side. We lay there together for a few blissful moments, completely content with each other’s presence and the enduring love that seemed to bubble gently between us. It was in those moments that I truly remembered the importance of laughter in relationships – it truly can bridge any distance, no matter how big or small.
