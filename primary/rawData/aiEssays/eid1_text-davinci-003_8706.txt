As I was sitting in math class, I felt an overwhelming sense of boredom. The thought of doing any more equations that day made me shudder. Little did I know, my mood was about to change drastically.

Halfway through the lesson, my best friend, Joanna, turned to me and started to whisper a strange sounding poem. As she recited it, I couldn't help but giggle at the silly words that were coming out of her mouth. Even the teacher noticed us, but instead of scolding us for disrupting the class, she decided to join in on the fun.

Before I knew it, I was doubled over in my seat, tears of laughter streaming down my face. The laughter was contagious and soon everyone in the class was laughing along with us. It felt like the room was suddenly filled with warmth and happiness.

I will never forget that moment. The joy and happiness I felt is something that I still carry with me to this day. I'm so thankful to have a friend like Joanna who is always there to spread a little laughter into my life.
