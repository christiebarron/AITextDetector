Computers have many effects on people. The first effect is the perception of objects and events on the screen. These objects can change with every minute movement it takes to set it up. The second effect is the appearance of things. Something that you would normally associate with something else and that is often referred to as an object shift.

In other words, people often are used to different things coming, rather than seen as separate entities. It's very easy to see this tendency to not see something you are expecting to see. In addition, people might see things or events that they expect to see but don't. So if you are going to use a computer for gaming, don't be afraid to ask the person deftly for an explanation.

The third effect is information overload. If you start to know something, you may begin to lose your way. Don't allow it to go with you. Don't let it happen. Never allow it to happen to a person.

That is important to remember as well: for the time being, just keep it to yourself and you won't get back to it.
