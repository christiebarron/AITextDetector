The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They would have to secure permits from several commercial construction stations and obtain local permits to move the equipment around with the approval of builders. Other elements added to the problem would require additional public debate about the use of the dirigibles. When asked why the company would have to change the way such materials are produced, the builders answered that some companies simply were not interested in doing such an important job.

In the meantime, dirigibles are used commercially. Among the many examples was the Tesla Model S sedan which received over 1 million downloads per day and was followed by the Chevrolet Volt. However, it takes a company considerable time to obtain permits for small businesses, as well as the installation of a system which allows them to operate without the use of dirigibles. Tesla's engineers had already received approvals for use of large and small dirigibles. The car was not built as a single vehicle. The vehicles were built under contracts which also required an extensive preparation for the installation of large dirigibles, and required the installation of multiple parts for each unit. In the future, Tesla has plans to build dirigibles and convert the power system into a single power source, but this has yet to be completed.
