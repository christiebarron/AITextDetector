The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

First, there was a lack of space for passengers, due to the vast expanses of space for a set of aircraft in the tower that led to the narrow open sides of the building. In the 1950s, a larger, open-air structure was constructed. After extensive modifications, the massive building now houses a three-story building with an open-air elevator in an open-air loft atrium and a 3,800 square foot, three-level terrace deck atrium.

Second, although it remained open, the tower proved the most difficult to access during construction. According to George Williams, lead architect of the tower, the elevator went flat all about the tower's exterior wall. On top of it the tower's four bedrooms were all on a single floor.

A third major problem was that there were no stairwells on the south side of the tower, making it impractical for the elevator to descend or ascend. Since the west tower housed apartments in an open space, it was easy to get trapped in the tower's open spaces.

By this time, the Empire State Building was already overcrowded. Although it had all the air, it was not completely empty, and, as a result, there was no need for it to be opened. The new building's elevator was already built.
