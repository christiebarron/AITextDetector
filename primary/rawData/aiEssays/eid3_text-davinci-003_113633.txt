The setting of the story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski has a strong influence on the cyclist as he is struggling to make his long journey. The environment of the story is a desolate rural landscape with no one else around except for the cyclist. This isolation has a strong effect on the cyclist as he begins to feel isolated and helpless, unable to rely on anyone else for help and support.

The terrain of the road itself is another key feature of the setting which affects the cyclist. The rough and bumpy road filled with potholes makes it difficult for him to make progress and continues to sap his strength with each pedal he makes, making his journey increasingly difficult and demoralising. The lack of any resources or amenities in the area means that the cyclist is unable to rest, refuel and repair his bike, which adds to his exhaustion.

The weather conditions also affect the cyclist while he is on the road. A heavy rain brings added difficulty as the rain makes the track slippery and difficult to cycle on. The storm also adds to the feeling of isolation the cyclist experiences as he can't turn to anyone for help or shelter.

The features of the story's setting all come together to make the cyclist's journey harder, testing his resolve and strength as he pedals on. This allows the author to effectively convey the cyclist's feelings of loneliness and hardship, and the importance of resilience and determination in conquering any difficult journey.
