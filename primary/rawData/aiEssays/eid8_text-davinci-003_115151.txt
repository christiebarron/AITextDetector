I vividly remember the moment I shared with someone that filled the room with laughter. His name was John and we had been friends for over a decade.

John had a great sense of humour and we would often joke around together. The last time I saw him was on my birthday.

We had decided to have dinner at my favourite Italian restaurant and were enjoying a nice night out. We were deep in conversation when out of nowhere, John quipped a joke that immediately reduced us both to tears of laughter.

The joke was entirely absurd and totally random, but it was hilarious. We were both laughing so hard that we were trying to catch our breath, and it was one of the most infectious laughs I have ever heard. Everyone in the restaurant was looking at us as we laughed uproariously, but we didn’t care. We kept laughing and enjoying each other’s company.

It was one of those moments that stay with you – a memory that will always make me smile. That night, John and I learned the power that laughter has to unite people, no matter how different they are.
