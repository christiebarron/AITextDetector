The setting of ‘Rough Road Ahead’ by Joe Kurmaski is a vital element to the story, as it has a direct effect on the cyclist. The setting provides a certain degree of challenge that he must overcome in order to reach his destination. The most prominent feature of the setting is the terrain, which is described as being heavily hilly and rugged. This difficult terrain is a major obstacle for the cyclist and dramatically increases the difficulty of his journey. The cyclist must continually climb steep hills, causing him to exert more energy and strength than he would on a level path. The terrain is often unpredictable, and this further adds to the difficulty of his journey.

The weather is also a significant feature of the setting. The oppressive heat, in particular, poses a problem for the cyclist, as it causes him to become increasingly dehydrated and exhausted. The combination of physical and mental fatigue results in him having to constantly push himself to reach the top of each hill.

Finally, the setting also has a psychological effect on the cyclist, as it serves to emphasize the severity of his task. The isolated and barren nature of the landscape encourages the cyclist to push forward and strive to reach his destination. The physical hardships he must endure to progress through this setting prove to be the ultimate test of the cyclist’s resilience in the face of adversity.
