The narrator of the story is a young student who is struggling to pass her test. She reflects on her experiences in winter, which included seeing a withered hibiscus flower in her school courtyard. She draws a parallel between the flower's life cycle and her own academic success or failure. By ending the story with a promise to retake the test when the hibiscus blooms again in the spring, the author implies that the student will gain the knowledge and motivation to succeed. This provides hope that the student can ultimately pass her test and bloom with success.
