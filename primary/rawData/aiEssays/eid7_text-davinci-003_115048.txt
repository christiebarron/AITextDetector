I remember a time when I was on the subway, and it was extremely crowded as per usual. I was trying to get closer to the door so I could get off when the next stop came. As I was maneuvering closer, I noticed a teenage girl trying to get on. The train was so packed that it was nearly impossible for her to get on, and despite how desperate she looked, nobody seemed to be willing to make more room. I could sense her embarrassment and frustration, but I also noticed how patient she remained.

What really stood out to me was that even though everyone else was so crowded and uncomfortable, she seemed almost apologetic. She never complained even though it was clear that she was in an uncomfortable situation. Eventually, she found a small space near me where she could turn sideways and squeeze in, and I even shifted my bag and body a little so she had more room. 

After she finally got settled, everybody around her and myself acknowledged the kindness that she showed us all by remaining patient and composed. We thanked her for her patience and understanding, and it reminded me that little kindness can go a long way.
