One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I woke up at 4 am and saw that my dog was in the corner. He had turned to hug me, and I asked him "What's your name?" He was saying "Hail, Fusco. I won't eat grass." I took my dog by his collar, and I said "Where's your nickname, my name, your phone number, etc.? Let's just say that my father was on the phone and said to me "Hail, Fusco, you've got your new name. It was my father's old one, and it's my nickname." He was kind of confused, I said "Oh, there's a little more information." And, of course, the whole conversation turned out differently for me. My dad was always trying to ask me questions on my Facebook pages; I was always getting more and more questions. That's when he decided he needed to be more specific, more specific, so I said "You'll know what I mean when I put it that way. He said his name is [the same] as my father. My dad never changed," and that's when I realized my dad was on the phone because my dad has a phone number of 912. His new name is Dottier. And that's not because I'm the same person I am anymore; I'm the same kind of person I used to be. I'm just a different sort of person
