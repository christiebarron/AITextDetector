I remember a time when I was visiting my soon-to-be in-laws for the first time. I was a bit overwhelmed and nervous to meet the parents of the person I was set to marry, but I tried to hold my composure.

Once I’d arrived, we chatted and caught up as if we’d known one another for years. We were having a great time, until my future mother-in-law said something that tickled my funny bone. I couldn’t help but start laughing. She looked a bit taken aback, but my future father-in-law burst into laughter as well — my soon-to-be wife joining in shortly after. 

It was in that moment that I truly felt like I was part of the family. It was as if, in that moment, there was a realization all around that this was going to work out. Laughter is magical like that. It can erase all the awkwardness and put every person at ease. That moment of shared laughter brought us all closer together, and it is a memory I will cherish forever.
