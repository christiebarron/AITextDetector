Dear Editor,

As technology advances, it's hard to avoid the debate about the effects computers have on people. I believe strongly that computers have had and continue to have a largely positive effect on society. 

For one, having access to computers and the internet provides us with a wealth of knowledge and information. We are able to glean insights from across the world, as knowledge is just a few clicks away. Connecting with others is easier and more common than ever before, with platforms like social media providing us the opportunity to communicate with friends and family living far away in an instant. 

Computers have also helped to improve efficiency in many industries and workplaces. Computer-run programs are faster and can complete more intensive tasks than humans ever could, giving businesses the opportunity to expand and grow. Additionally, with more complex tasks now being handled by computers, some jobs that were once only completed by humans can now be done with the help of technology, allowing more people to find employment. 

On the other hand, computer usage brings about certain health issues. People are now spending more time in front of a screen, which can lead to eye strain, headaches and poor posture over time. Additionally, there has been much concern about the potential for addiction to gaming and the internet. 

However, the benefits of increased access to technology on our lives far outweighs any drawbacks. Computer usage encourages creativity and innovation, and will only lead to further progress and growth
