The ending of Minfong Ho's poem Winter Hibiscus reflects the main protagonist's determination and hope. At the start of the poem, the protagonist is anxious and overwhelmed by their upcoming test. The imagery of the hibiscus ‒ a flower which cannot bloom in the winter due to the cold weather ‒ symbolizes the protagonist's seemingly impossible dreams of passing their test. However, the fact that the hibiscus is still alive even in the cold winter means that the protagonist will not give up hope. The protagonist can draw strength from the hibiscus' resilience, just as the flower will bloom again when the warmth returns. By ending with the protagonist expressing their determination to take the test again in the spring, Minfong Ho emphasizes the themes of strength, hope, and perseverance in the face of adversity.
