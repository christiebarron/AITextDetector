The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' was that of a depressed and exhausted soldier, struggling to adjust to life after war, while also writing books that spoke to a different and darker side of his own life in that he had been raised by a Catholic, now considered a "savior."

It's worth noting that the 'From Home' book's subtitle in its subtitle comes only from an article from the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders that was commissioned by the publisher. According to the magazine:

"The book's subtitle simply refers to a group of children diagnosed as being "emotional distress dependent at some point" (DAD). At this stage of our clinical process and while still a child with PTSD, DAD presents to DAD at an extreme intensity - not just mentally, but physically. It involves daily self-help, as well as 'training' with therapists, in ways that might make sense for DAD but may not make more sense for the average individual.... The author, a writer of five novels, also explores this'mental illness' topic with an extreme intensity. It's clear in the way he explores emotional distress, and his use of the term 'discomfort' to refer to emotions in and of themselves, is very clearly not just a way for DAD to describe itself... DAD is a highly complex and dynamic individual. This is not a situation that could reasonably be described in isolation." [Psych
