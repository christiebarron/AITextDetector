Minfong Ho ends the story Winter Hibiscus with this line to demonstrate optimism in the face of failure. The protagonist has failed her medical test, a major setback and one which has left her feeling down. The hope implied in the line is that with a change in season and a new beginning comes the possibility of success. The imagery of spring, melting snow, returning geese and budding hibiscus is used to evoke feelings of optimism and hope for the future. The protagonist is suggesting that in the coming spring she will be better prepared and she will have another chance at success. The line also serves to demonstrate the cyclical nature of life - winter has passed and now spring is to come, just as after failure comes the chance of success.
