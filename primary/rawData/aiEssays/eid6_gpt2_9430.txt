The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first hurdle was the need to include more than 15 different modes of motion for all three modes. The building's main purpose was to allow the building to sit perfectly on a moving, flat landscape with no obstructions. At 9 feet tall it was a simple but effective solution.

The second hurdle was the need to allow more motion in the building. Moving down the shaft to the middle of the building was only one option but one which the builders chose. The two other options were to place all the furniture down by the top and place it back up the next row.

However, this took an enormous amount of effort. With a total of 518 different elements, moving the building required at least a 6 foot vertical bar of movement. Of the 18 different possibilities presented by the builders, 20 were options that required about 1-2 feet of vertical. However, with over 50 years of building experience, the average working experience of the builders was 5 feet. This meant that the builder would need at least 5 weeks to design and layout a 3 foot bar. However, the designers felt that the builder's experience was comparable between the two, so the architect decided that the best options would be to only include some element of support. If this could get through to a 5 foot height bar, the builders would be able to comfortably walk that length down modifications to the building, but having to rely on
