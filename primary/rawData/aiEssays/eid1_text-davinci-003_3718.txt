Dear Editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. 

As we all know, technology has changed dramatically over the last few decades, with computers becoming an essential part of our lives. From using them to communicate with friends and family, to their use in medical and educational settings, computers have caused a dramatic shift in the way people live their lives. 

On the one hand, computers have certainly made life more convenient. We no longer need to spend time looking up information in libraries, as a simple online search can provide us with all the information we need in seconds. Furthermore, modern technologies can also help us stay connected to distant family members and friends. 

However, there is no denying that computers can have detrimental effects on our wellbeing if we use them too much or incorrectly. Constant access to the internet and social media can increase feelings of stress and lead to problems such as sleep deprivation and reduced physical activity. So while computers can be incredibly useful tools to have, they must be used in moderation.

Overall, I strongly believe that computers can be incredibly useful but that they need to be used in moderation. With this in mind, I urge all readers to consider the potential effects computers can have and to use them wisely. 

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
