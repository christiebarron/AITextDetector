One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was playing an opera in Spain; I remember being so engrossed in the music that I began laughing at my own, and I couldn't stop to stop. When I was 20 that year, I sang a ballad; I told my mother, 'When I'm old enough to sing the same song every week, we'll talk about something else.' And I did that. It was so funny. And I thought, I, you know, to think about the work when I'm 40 and I'm doing this—and I was playing a ballgame—I wonder what the whole thing was like. I got this huge smile on my face when I was just doing this; I felt better and then I noticed that I had seen everything. It was not so much to see myself or feel what you saw and when you looked at it, it was for sure. The first time I did the same is when I went to Spain in 1992, from Los Angeles (Los Angeles, CA). I was so happy in a country where when I had these fantastic friends from other countries I would just like to meet them and I could do that very easily. This country was very important to me. People had told me I was beautiful because I was good at it and I tried to do what I was supposed to do. I knew I didn't get it. As it turned out, I didn't even get where I was going."
