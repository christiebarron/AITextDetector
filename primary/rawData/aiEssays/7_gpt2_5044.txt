An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when he was waiting for me to start a bike ride, so we were working on a new bike, at first he was waiting for me to go on his bike, so I felt like a bit more patient than before, but then once we got there, he finally got on my bike! So he was really thankful for my time. He looked after my equipment, made sure I stayed as hydrated as he was, brought food and water for me that evening. He was awesome!" - Mary McSchnitt
