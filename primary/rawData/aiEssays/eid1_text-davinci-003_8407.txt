I was at the store the other day picking up the supplies I needed for a party I was throwing. I managed to find everything I was looking for, but when it was time to check out, the line was extremely long and I was already running late. Rather than getting frustrated, I decided to take a deep breath and be patient.

I knew that every person in front of me had a story, and that it was important for them to be able to get the items they were buying. So I waited patiently, and tried to think about other things. Eventually the line started to move faster and I was able to check out.

I was so glad that I had exercised patience and stayed calm instead of getting frustrated and complaining. It was a good reminder that it is often better to take the time to be patient, even when it is difficult.
