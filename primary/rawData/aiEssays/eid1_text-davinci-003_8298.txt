The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when allowing dirigibles to dock in a structure of this size. As detailed in the book The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the biggest challenge was providing the necessary infrastructure and engineering to ensure safe mooring. To do this, engineers knew they had to create strong mooring cables, excellent wind protection, and the potential of delaying the opening of the building until 1930 in order to create the appropriate structures. 

The mooring mast was the biggest challenge for the Empire State Building. Constructing a mooring mast for dirigibles required a structure that could hold over 60 tons of force created by the large airships as they moored. Additionally, due to the large size of the airships, the mast had to be fairly tall in order for the dirigibles to access the necessary altitude. After the engineers found the suitable material and developed the necessary designs, they had to construct the mast and other necessary equipment—providing rings large enough to fit a blimp, secures lines, and proper safety covenants along the building—high above the ground without obstructing the views. 

The wind also had to be taken into consideration when constructing the Empire State Building mooring mast, as the airships were very large, lightweight, and struggled to stay stable in strong winds. The engineers had to find ways to protect the dirigibles from extreme winds while
