I was recently on vacation with my family. We had planned a big beach day and I was so excited, but then it started pouring rain and I could feel my mood sink. Everyone around me seemed so discouraged. 

My dad, however, was patient. Instead of giving up, he suggested that we find a place inside. We all sighed, but my dad said he was sure there was something we could do to make the most of our day. 

We ended up at a nearby museum and had the best day ever. As we explored, I could see my dad having as much fun as us kids. He never complained or feared that our plans were ruined. I'm so grateful for his patience that day; it made all the difference.
