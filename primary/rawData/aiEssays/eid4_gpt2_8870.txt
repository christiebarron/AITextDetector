The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because the main character, Sigmund, finds himself with nothing. In reality, this is all he needed to find, and when he came closest to finding the end he found something.

So as we move past the book's cliffhanger in order to get the point out, we know for certain that Snow's heart is still there and it does not have his emotions, but that it will never forget. Sigmund's attempt to rescue him leads to the downfall of the book. This means, of course, that in order for Snow to end up dead, he will need to find somewhere to live. It makes sense considering what happens to Snow after this death.
