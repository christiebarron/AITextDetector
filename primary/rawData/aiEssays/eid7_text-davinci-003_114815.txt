I recently experienced a time where a person was incredibly patient. I was in the middle of a difficult project, and although I was determined to complete it, I was running out of time. I had several deadlines looming, and I had to take a break to go to an appointment. 

I was nervous about my time constraints, and the person I was working with could tell. But instead of getting frustrated and pushing me to work faster, they offered to stay and help. They patiently worked with me to finish the project despite my tight timeframe. 

Their understanding and willingness to help was beyond anything I expected. I was in awe of their patience and grateful for their assistance. In the end, we not only completed my project, but also set a successful working foundation for future collaboration.
