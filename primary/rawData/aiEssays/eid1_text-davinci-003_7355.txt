The features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead" have an integral role in conveying the cyclist's inner turmoil and emotions. The cyclist is travelling on a desolate road which stretches for miles with no signs of habitation, human or otherwise. The rugged, barren landscape looms ominously towards the horizon, and the sun is sinking low as if casting a spotlight on the cyclist's harrowing journey. The lack of path markers and changing terrain further adds to the cyclist's confusion and frustration. 

The cyclist travels over rock strewn surfaces, bushes, and long uneven stretches as they come across unexpected twists and turns, leaving them feeling lost and uncertain of what lies ahead. The lack of human contact and presence of animals in the terrain adds to the fear and anxiety. The environment, which has both life-sustaining elements like shrubs and trees and life-threatening features such as steep and dangerous slopes adds to the intensity of the cyclist's journey. 

The empty, vast terrain isolated from human life conveys a sense of the cyclist's loneliness in the face of adversity. Removed from the hustle and bustle of everyday life, the cyclist is inescapably alone with their inner demons. The primitive wildness of the setting further emphasizes the cyclist's struggle against inner and external challenges to keep pushing forward. In this isolated landscape, the cyclist can reflect on their experiences and discover the strength and courage to persevere in the face of difficulty
