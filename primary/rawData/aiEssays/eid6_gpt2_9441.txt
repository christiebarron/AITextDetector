The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

First came the need for flexible, long-distance cables connecting to their beams. These new fiberglass cable cables could be connected across a building and a third of the weight of some of the large buildings would be dropped to cut back the drag.

Then came the need to allow the structure to support several heavy objects as they traveled across the ground. Once these were removed, the height of the structure was lowered by two of the 10-storey beams, thereby requiring the buildings on the other side to use a much heavier weight for their carrying capacities.

Each building required a separate set of cables, and those cables were no longer feasible in modern construction. After more than two decades of negotiations, the builders Baltimos and Tambov chose to go ahead with the project and eventually built a fully integrated 2-storey building, about 10 feet long compared to the 5- to 6-foot wide buildings on the island of Laval.

Both buildings served a particular purpose. With the help of several skilled engineers, the building had the potential to allow for more complex and expansive building layouts, and with the additional support of the tower and its roof, would allow the building to accommodate about 25 passengers per day and 10,000 square feet of floor space. But with little or no support, and little or no service on all the building lifts in the area, this would
