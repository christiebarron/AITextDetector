I believe that censorship of materials in libraries can cause problems for libraries. Libraries that do not have a good deal of freedom to share their content with other libraries can be less safe for learning and making research available.

The Library Resource Act of 1972 and the Department of Education's National Research Resources Preservation Act permit public libraries to release and preserve their own material, but can impose other restrictions, such as not releasing academic library items that can be used (and/or which have been banned) by the Federal Government. Libraries that do not have a good deal of freedom to share their materials with other prostitutes can be less safe for learning and making research available. Library buildings and facilities that are maintained for domestic or general purposes andinators to care for children and pets are not exempt from the Copyright Act. Libraries generally prohibit use of materials, books, CDs, and DVDs that are not designed for sale and any other materials that the Library is not allowed to dispose of. The Library Resource Act specifically states that libraries are able to use materials that are not protected by the Copyright Act as they see fit, unless you have to do so by statute. For a more detailed history of the Internet, see Copyright Law, for specific sections in this section.

The Library Resource Act of 1972 protects copyright holders in a number of ways. It allows public libraries to collect a fee and transfer it to their local library, such as to the National Archives, archives departments, etc. and transfer it to the general public.
