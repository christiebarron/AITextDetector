The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

In 1871 a California man named Thomas Jefferson built the American Empire State Building as a test of future Americanism. It was later moved to Los Angeles and the buildings were demolished in 1900.

In 1873 Mr. Jefferson, a lifelong Californian, proposed to purchase the new building as a house on the site of World War I. It was later built by a consortium of American developers and his plan became the cornerstone of a new skyscraper called the National Building Project, which has since served as an official federal building for the nation.[1] The building is believed to be America's last surviving skyscraper.

C. Dickson had a very strong interest in the architecture of the new skyscraper. Born in the northern United States in 1855, he worked as a carpenter until the 1950's in Los Angeles.[2] He also had some political aspirations.[3] Dickson worked for the San Francisco Examiner, the Los Angeles Times and as an editor while he was a state legislator. He was also an advisor to California's Governor, Edward Elmer.[4]

Elected in 1860, the building was one of the few real estate investments in the nation. The building included a $800-million state-of-the-art state-of-the-art water treatment plant, an advanced military airfield, and a three-story hotel in the
