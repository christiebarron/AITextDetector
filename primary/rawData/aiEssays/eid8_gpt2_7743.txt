One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I heard this sound from a man who just happens to be my boyfriend: "How dare you be funny."

One minute he had an image on my laptop - the one he had never seen before - and immediately the thought arose: "Ah, but the image I was seeing was a piece of shit like that? Then, you're not joking, I'm laughing?" He was laughing because we all laugh all the time. Of course, the idea of jokes is very basic. The joke is funny because of a feeling that you are having a good time. One second I could see him enjoying himself, but I couldn't make the joke to him. His jokes were silly, he never showed them.

Now we do not see the jokes on TV without someone trying to fool our minds. Even during the darkest hours of his life he was often interrupted by his friends and family. After the death of his partner I have a very strange feeling about how little laughter there really was in that world. Not because we are good at jokes, not even because we've enjoyed them because we enjoyed them so much, but because the joke that he told me was very good. He did not feel like we wanted to know the joke because he did not feel we wanted to see the joke. We are very good at jokes. That's the story that I have been told by all the other human beings. That's what makes me sad.
