One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I read "Hood of Love" while being in a church. We used to sit at the table and share food with each other. But now I can't believe that I would ever sit as an adult, being so young. The idea of being able to think your body is your body is scary. I don't want anyone to ever come to a similar level of fear as the kids in this room. However there is hope for our parents of doing something good for us. What better way than to find some kind of love in others like yourself, who your friends and families rely on in some way or another.


In addition a large number of parents who are concerned about kids who can't have a normal life are asking if our kids really need help or help in a way that isn't a "normal day at school". They are concerned that they won't do well in school but, will they get an opportunity to go off and make a difference in their students' lives? Please, please take action by supporting our kids and letting them be proud and happy for their lives.
