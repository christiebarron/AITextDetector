I had been friends with John since high school, but it wasn’t until college that I developed a deep friendship with him. Even as our paths diverged and our lives went in different directions, we stayed in touch and always found time to get together and catch up. We had an unspoken understanding that our friendship could never be replaced. 

One summer, John was in town for a visit and we decided to take a road trip up the California coast. As we drove along, we laughed about the crazy adventures we used to have together, the memories that time can never erase, and the laughter we shared in good times and bad. 

As the sun set over the Pacific, our conversation quickly turned to more serious topics. We talked about our dreams and the paths we were carving out for our future, both of us hoping for the best. As I listened to John’s dreams and fears, I found myself in tears, and soon he was comforting me.

But instead of letting the mood linger, John quickly brought us back to laughter. Pulling out his signature tongue-in-cheek wisdom, he pointed out that “laughter really IS the shortest distance between two people,” and soon we were both bursting into gales of laughter. 

As we drove on, I recognized that the bond between us was one that could weather anything, and I was grateful for the laughter that kept us connected.
