Dear Editor, 

Today, computers are an incredibly integral part of our lives. From our telephones and laptops to our cars and homes, they are everywhere, making it hard for us to imagine life without them. Despite their undeniable convenience, the role they play in our lives is quite controversial. Some argue that computers can be harmful if used irresponsibly; however, I believe that they have mostly positive effects on people. 

Firstly, computers have enabled us to instantly access any kind of information with the click of a button, making knowledge more accessible than ever before. This alone has made tremendous strides in cultivating a culture of educated and informed citizens who are better able to make informed decisions. 

Moreover, computers have brought the world closer together. Due to their fast connectivity, people can now easily collaborate on projects, communicate with distant family and friends, and even shop on the other side of the globe. Relatedly, computers also provide access to a huge range of entertainment, from movies to videogames, making them great sources of pleasure and relaxation. 

Finally, the proverbial “connected world” gives people a real sense of community, connectivity, and belonging, allowing them to share their thoughts and experiences and fostering a spirit of connectedness between groups of people who may otherwise never have connected. 

In sum, computers have broadened our minds, kept us connected to the world, and provided us with a wealth of new experiences.
