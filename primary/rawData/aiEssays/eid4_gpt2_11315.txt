The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because the "good" ones never give up, because they never forget what can happen to the good people. But this book does that too, by the time it's written, in the second half of the century.

At the same time, this book really does have such a great message, this chapter where we look back and wonder at why things went wrong, and is about the people who are willing to give it to others. It's this way that that book really does help to end the book. I would like you to go read it again

Also, I want you to take a look at this book from this week on to see how it has changed these last two years. Because if you don't care about your life then it is okay if you hate it for one day and then you still love it. But even if you don't like it more, please give it another read and see if there is anything you're disappointed in. I will read this book again in the same year so you can decide which was your favorite.
