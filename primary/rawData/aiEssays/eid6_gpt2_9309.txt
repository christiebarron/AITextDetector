The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. A permit for them that year expired and the state later announced that the permits were not currently in effect. It now runs into opposition from major American companies with which it deals. The International Trade Commission (ITC) has asked the Federal Trade Commission to consider filing a petition in federal court challenging the government's attempt to "reboot" dirigibles.

The FAA has been criticized for refusing to address some of the most compelling reasons for the ban. Its regulations protect aircraft from the dangers of airliners, but it has also put the brakes on private flights and allows a private plane's owner to fly one-quarter its fuel to the nearest airport.

A spokesperson for Ola Airlines said that the company began an open letter in January, calling out the ban, but has withdrawn the letter as of Monday.
