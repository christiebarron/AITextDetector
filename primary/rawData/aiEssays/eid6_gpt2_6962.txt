The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Although space constraints were tight, the designers had no qualms about putting dirigibles on the roofs of most of the buildings in New York City and Brooklyn. But in late 1960's, when the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) wanted to send small pilots into space to fly small planes without a big box, the FAA chose the path of dirigible.

But the FAA's decision was greeted with widespread disapproval, including from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). In 1967, the FAA launched a re-examination of the issue. Initially, dirigibles were not as safe as traditional airliners. In 1970, the FAA issued new rules that made flying on a space plane less safe than an airplane traveling at less than 100 miles per hour, even if one is seated, and required pilots to wait for the pilot to make contact. And that is when the FAA decided to put the dirigibles on the roof of the Empire State Building.

The New York City City air traffic controller at the time, Dr. William H. P. Smith, considered the concept a success, but not without controversy. "The first time I checked the FAA website today," he recalls, "I never saw an example of a jet aircraft on the roof of a tower." Even after the FAA began testing pilot friendly lasers
