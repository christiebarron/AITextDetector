As to the current situation on the campus of the University of Missouri, which was once a free campus, "I believe that censorship of materials in libraries would be the greatest weapon against our free expression."

This, he continued, could lead to free speech through "a range of restrictions on free speech that do not give people the right to control where they go."

While he was in a heated argument, and one that took place at the University of Michigan, a student reportedly turned away and asked the two men if they could come sit under the school's wall as they were talking on Facebook. "I'd love to meet them," said a student.

Several people on the campus described it as a bizarre and disrespectful behavior but that may not be the case against Milo Yiannopoulos:

I just spoke to an anonymous male student who was on a campus tour yesterday and he spoke a couple of ways about Milo and this person is absolutely anti-democratic, but he's really nice to people. Is that okay? I don't know. He's trying to give them to a bunch of people, people who never got to meet at universities. I don't think people should be invited to be on that
