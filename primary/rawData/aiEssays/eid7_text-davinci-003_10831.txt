I'm always learning and growing in my understanding of what it means to be patient. More than once I've had to practice patience in different situations. Recently, I was volunteering to help an elderly couple with small projects around their home. 

The woman I was helping was very kind but her husband seemed to be more demanding. He often tried to rush me with my tasks and didn't seem to trust that I would do a good job. I could tell that it was stressing my elderly friend out and making her anxious. Rather than getting irritated with him, I reminded myself to be patient and reminded myself that he probably just wanted to make sure that the job was done well and in a timely manner.

I took my time to do the tasks meticulously and did my best to answer his questions and address his concerns. I could tell that his attitude changed a bit when he saw that I was doing a good job and that I was paying attention to detail. By the end of the day, he thanked me for my work and seemed to be more content with the completed tasks. It was an important reminder to me that a little patience can go a long way.
