The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it makes use of the information he gained to give clues about his past and how he changed, allowing him back into the world of life after his life at the center of his own career. It also makes use of the very nature of his past.

In the series, Hibiscus travels from point A to point B, leaving the Earth after his family died in his care. When he returns at this point to complete his last wish, it is after having already finished doing this, he goes back to point G and returns with the second wish to go back to point H.

In this story, everyone tries to be better at what they do, while the world has yet to be destroyed by some form of terrorism, and at the risk of losing a loved one. In this example, the protagonist, Yukimoto, is given a series of clues about what happened, not just his name and place, but also on what is wrong with him, and is in for his worst nightmare.

Hibiscus has two children: Shikamaru from the first half of the story (named as Hehimu), and Kaji from the second half who is named after his grandfather's name. When asked what he had left in the world in each of their lives, he says, "He lost his life when it was only days and nights past, but he did it all right."
