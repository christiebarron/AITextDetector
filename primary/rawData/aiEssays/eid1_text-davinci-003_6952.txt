Censorship in libraries is a hotly contested topic and there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Libraries are an important part of our democratic society, providing an opportunity for open dialogue and free exchange of ideas. Too often, however, inappropriate material is allowed to remain on shelves, leading to confusion and discomfort among library patrons.

Censoring certain books, magazines, movies, and music does not mean denying opportunities for learning and growing; rather, it means helping to keep libraries safe and pleasant for all visitors and patrons, regardless of age. Libraries should have clear policies in place to address materials that are offensive, in any form. This could include: 

• Establishing a process to review materials for appropriateness and having staff members who are trained to evaluate potentially offensive materials. 

• Requiring parental guidance for items rated R or higher, such as movies or books featuring explicit content or explicit language. 

• Providing access to filtered internet options, especially for younger patrons.

By having a policy in place that outlines when materials should be removed from the shelves, libraries can ensure that their selection of materials is suitable and appropriate for all patrons. Furthermore, they can also demonstrate a commitment to protecting access to diverse and interesting materials that promote understanding and dialogue. 

In a democratic society, libraries should be a place where everyone feels safe and welcome. Censoring inappropriate material isn’t a restriction on freedom
