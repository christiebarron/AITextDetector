Narciso Rodriguez’s memoir ‘From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives’ ultimately creates a mood of nostalgia rooted in bittersweet memories. Drawing on Rodriguez's memories of growing up in a Cuban-American household in New Jersey, the memoir plumbs the depths of his relationship with his family and the hard work they did to make ends meet. Through his recollections, Rodriguez creates an atmosphere of pride and adoration for his parents and family before, during, and after their experiences as Cuban refugees.

At the same time, Rodriguez’s nostalgia is also informed by a tinge of melancholy. His memories feel simultaneously distant and immediate, and he conveys the many joys and sorrows of his family’s journey. He paints the generational differences that he experiences between his own upbringing and that of his parents’, while acknowledging how his understanding of his parents has shifted with maturity. Through his experiences, Rodriguez forces readers to confront the rift between generations, and between cultures as well.

‘From Home’ ultimately creates a mood that balances between situations that are both foreign and familiar to the reader. Rodriguez crafts a vivid picture of his relationship with his parents and his upbringing, while forcing the reader to consider their own family dynamics. The memoir has the ability to make readers feel both recognized and understood due to its universal themes, while at the same time providing a glimpse of a culture and family that remains unfamiliar to some.
