I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is inherently unfair and inappropriate, and has the potential to have damaging and unfair consequences," Lee told Al Jazeera. "As a result, libraries have been forced to accept a more stringent policy: for every book, every academic has to be allowed access to the material at their choosing.

"Therefore, people who don't want to read books or read materials are not allowed to read them."

Lee highlighted a 2011 report from the European Research Council (ERC) on intellectual property laws that found that the number of books and manuscripts printed or digitally released per 1Mb (20.5 seconds) in the UK was 40% higher than in 2002.

This year, the number of such texts reached 80mb, compared to a total of more than 30m every year. It was also reported that libraries are now required to issue new and improved copyright warnings for those using digital content.

Lee said he was disappointed there were still many libraries in the EU whose staff were still using DRM free technologies, like the DRM plugin that will make it easier for book publishers to publish books online.

"With the new methods in place, we may be able to stop the proliferation of DRM-free books, but DRM and the open Web will certainly be the major barriers to future access in this way."
