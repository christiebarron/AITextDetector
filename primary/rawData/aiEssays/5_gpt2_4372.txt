The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is akin to that seen in the film 'From Hell' -- when you read a piece of news about a person's death and you believe somebody, even if you no longer know them or want their identity, or they've done something terrible in the past, you know what you feel? In this way, one piece is a complete picture and the world is a complete picture, the events are completely erased and the information is a complete picture. I believe the whole concept of 'From Home IS' is nothing but what these people who died for my sake and others who are on a journey to get there are supposed to be. I believe this is just a myth."

The final moment in 'From Home IS' was in the words of the woman who gave it to her in the movie: "After getting out of the car myself, I said, 'I'm a little bit worried now.' "

'From Home IS' co-writer Jarrad Pippenblom writes in her memoir that she was not pleased with her character's death, at least in part because she wanted to portray him as a man who went missing but would soon be found by someone else in the same situation. "At first I thought it was just a dream but then I realized we were going to see it," Pippenblom says. "Even after he came home I still kept a very positive attitude about it.
