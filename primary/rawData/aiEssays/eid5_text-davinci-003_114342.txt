The memoir 'From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives' by Narciso Rodriguez creates an atmosphere of nostalgia, ambition and longing for home. Narrated from the perspective of his father, the memoir shares the memories of his childhood in Nuevitas, Cuba – a place of refuge from the chaos of the revolution. The nostalgia of the memoir captures a moment in time of the family’s life before they were driven apart.

He paints beautiful images of his father’s gardens, the warm sun and his bustling neighborhood that is never forgotten. As he shares these moments with his readers, the underlying fear of a future without any of these comforts is felt. While Rodriguez was young when his family left Nuevitas, he never loses the desire for his childhood home and the feeling of security it brought him and his family.

Rodriguez is inspired by his father’s encouragements to reach for his dreams and the success that has followed him since. He shares with readers his journey of passion and dedication that resulted in a well-recognized career and international acclaim. Yet even in his various successes, Rodriguez never loses sight of his roots, but carries them as a driving force to his success.
