As technology has continued to advance in recent years, our reliance on computers has grown exponentially. For many, the presence of computers has completely changed the way people work, shop and interact with each other. As someone who has personally seen the effects of this technology in my everyday life, I'd like to take a moment to discuss the impact this technology can have on society. 

First of all, computers have had a huge impact on the way people do business. From a retail perspective, computer technology has enabled businesses to become more efficient and more competitive. From a customer's point of view, computers have made it easier than ever to shop for items online with a few clicks of the mouse. With access to a seemingly endless array of resources, customers are able to quickly find the best deals and services. By utilizing computer technology, businesses and consumers alike have benefitted from increased efficiency and improved customer service.

Beyond the realm of business, computers have also had a significant impact on the way people interact with each other. Social media offers a way for people to stay connected and up-to-date with friends and family who may not live in the same city. Email and instant messaging has made global communication more convenient, allowing people to quickly send and receive messages with a few keystrokes. This technology has not only changed how people communicate, but it has also increased the amount of available information and made it easier for people to access what they need
