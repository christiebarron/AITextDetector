I had been friends with Tom for years, but we didn't always get along. We had plenty of disagreements, but usually we managed to laugh it off and move on.

One day, we had a particularly heated argument about something trivial. I ended up storming off in a huff and neither of us wanted to talk to the other. 

A few days later, I was walking down the street and noticed Tom coming in the opposite direction. He was heading for his favourite café, so I decided to follow him in and try to make peace.

When I arrived, I saw him already seated and in the middle of an argument with the waiter. He was being incredibly rude to the poor man, so I decided to make a joke to lighten the mood. I spoke up and said, "Hey Tom, why don't you treat the waiter like he's your best friend? You know, like me?"

My comment made Tom stop, pause, and then start to laugh. The whole café heard it and soon everyone was laughing along with us. We were able to let go of our silly disagreement and start talking like normal friends again. We spent the next hour sipping our drinks and laughing at each other's jokes.

That was the moment when I realised laughter really is the shortest distance between two people.
