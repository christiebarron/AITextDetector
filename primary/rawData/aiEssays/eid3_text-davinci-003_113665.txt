In the short story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, the unnamed cyclist is forced to contend with features of the setting that all provide a unique challenge: the terrain, the scenery, and the weather.

The terrain is the most immediate challenge the cyclist faces. The road traverses steep hills with sharp turns and is rarely straight. These conditions require a tremendous amount of physical energy from the cyclist and demand skill and finesse as he quickly shifts his weight in an effort to maintain his balance. The terrain also unfortunately limits how the cyclist can respond given it is a single-track mountain road and all the obstacles must be negotiated with proper care.

The scenery also contributes to the cyclist’s struggle. The sweeping green and brown landscape with its smattering of wildflowers is beautiful, but also serves to remind the cyclist of the distance he has to traverse and of the time it will take.

The weather has an even greater effect on the cyclist. The sun is a relentless force of energy, and, as he climbs, its heat bears down on the cyclist creating an overwhelming weariness. The lack of clouds or wind only reinforces how exhausting his journey remains.

Ultimately the features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead” have a significant impact on the cyclist. The terrain, scenery, and weather all prove difficult to overcome at various points in the cyclist’s journey, and each in its own way
