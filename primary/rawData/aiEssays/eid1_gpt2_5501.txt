Computers have many effects on people. Those effects also vary among industries: the economy, the service sector, health care, manufacturing (or even those within), and more likely than not with every industry being treated.

If you want to start making smarter decisions about future economic performance, research on this topic is helpful (see this great article for example). If you are going to start with smarter computer decisions about future performance, a smarter one shouldn't come from a brain and not from another brain. As Dr. Tim Smith of Harvard University (in the last decade) demonstrates, computers don't play the role of super human beings. Instead, they make choices which, if made consistently, will make us smarter than we would be if they were all equally responsible for our behaviors.

By having all those choices, one gets an intuitive sense for what is going on. And so we often can't know what was being predicted.

1. What are the consequences of brain-based models of business performance?

Let me be very clear on one thing. I have written extensively, and with great interest, articles about the effect of computer-driven models of business performance on people's personal and professional lives. To cite two examples, I have written about:

"What does research show?" "What happens when we try?"

Let me reiterate another aspect I think is missing. Our brains tend to use all kinds of methods in making decisions. There can be the
