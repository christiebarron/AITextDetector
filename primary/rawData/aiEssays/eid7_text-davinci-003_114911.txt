I remember when I was a child I had a toy that I loved very much. One day I was playing with it in the park and I accidentally dropped it and it broke apart. I was so upset; tears filled my eyes. I tried to put it back together, but I just couldn't make it work. 

I knew I was going to have to tell my parents, so I slowly started walking back home. I was sure they would be mad at me for being clumsy, but instead they were very kind and understanding. They told me that it was ok, that accidents happen, and that I should just be patient. My parents gave me a hug, and with their words of wisdom they were able to restore my hope. 

Taking their advice, I decided to go back to the park and look for all the pieces of my toy. I was persistent and after a few hours of searching I found every single piece. I also had a plan of how I would fix it and make it better than ever. 

My parents were very patient with me throughout this entire process. They never became angry or frustrated, and they were always supportive of my plan. With patience and hard work, I was able to make my toy look and work like new. Patience is learning to understand and accept that not everything in life goes as planned, and that mistakes are inevitable. I'm very thankful for all the patience my parents showed me that day and in
