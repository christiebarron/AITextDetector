Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. For example, when he gets to the end of a crossroad, which will then give the cyclist a little more distance, the setting is:
803 – The point at which that crossroad will stop being a crossroad is:
604 – The cyclist (see figure 10) will then be on the other side of that road, which is a rough road to cross and/or to bump into. You can also take the route on that road if and only if you are on flat roads.
Turn around to find a spot that you will be able to race in, see where it begins or stop as you wish.
It's up to the user to determine how to use this setting to optimize the route they are following and how wide that narrow is so they can get to the end and get out on the road. To get that view you can then simply make the following steps or follow the steps with your bike (see below for more information).
