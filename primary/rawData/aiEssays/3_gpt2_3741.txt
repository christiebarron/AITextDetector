You can add and remove specific tyres for these tyres.

Searches and inspection are performed after your tyres are installed storage before starting the service. This lets you be certain that those tyres you installed after installing new tyres would sit in a fit of good service for a short period. The key to ensuring that your tyres sit in a fit of good service is to keep them under warranty, although the warranty period will vary depending on the model (RWD, FWD, Hybrid). For example Sure tyres can go back in two years (if needed) but will be damaged after three (if needed) years without warranty or warranty and this is the same for any RWD and FWD tyres. As it is not possible to run your tyres under warranty all tyres must be taken out of service immediately and then sent to a brand new installation plant on a charge of 20% plus the cost. Also ensure that all repairs are made prior to running your tyres. As with any repair, if you have any issues with your new tyres (or with your servicing), please report the issue below.
