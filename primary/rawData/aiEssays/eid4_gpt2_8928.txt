The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it is written primarily about the history of the Great Migration. This is the first collection in which he examines his own personal journey to and through the Great Depression for the history of New Jersey and its history of immigration. But I believe it is an essential contribution, with a number of new features, to the book. I would be very pleased to receive the second volume; the first one is available in paperback. There is an additional edition available for pre-order.

This book is also a very moving book: the beginning is short and well-written, with an interesting history of the Great Migration's history, including a long discussion of the early migration history, as well as a discussion of New Jersey. This is a book so fascinating on the immigration of American history it deserves a place in libraries in that it takes readers directly to the point of starting the historical material about New Jersey's history. This is a book that is timely even if some of its arguments are hard to find.

The second volume focuses on the Great Migration's history, which I find somewhat interesting. I would Conservation: A Documentary History of American Life. I also get some good material, but I read it as though it were my own. This collection provides a good jumping-off point in order to explain and explain the main concepts of American life, for a number of reasons I don't want to put too much time into.
