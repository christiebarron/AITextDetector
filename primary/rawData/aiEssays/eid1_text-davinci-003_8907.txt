 

Dear [Newspaper],

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects of computers on people. There is no denying that computers have drastically changed our lives for the better, allowing us to find information faster, manage projects more efficiently, and communicate with each other from virtually anywhere in the world. 

However, there are some potential risks of over relying on computers. In particular, people may become overly dependent on computers, leading to a decrease in their problem-solving skills. This can lead to feelings of disconnection from the real world and from people. Additionally, excessive screen time has been linked to physical health issues such as neck pain and eye strain.

I believe that people should limit their screen use whenever possible and focus on developing other skills. Computers should not be a replacement for our cognitive abilities, but rather a tool to make our lives more productive and enjoyable. We can still use technology to assist us with tasks, while still retaining the skills used to think and solve problems independently.

It is my sincere hope that readers will agree with my opinion and use computers in a responsible and constructive manner. 

Sincerely, 

[Name]
