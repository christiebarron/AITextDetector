The building of the Empire State Building was an impressive feat of engineering and architecture, but what few people know is that the plans for the building included making it possible for large dirigibles to dock. This was an ambitious goal for the engineers, as the obstacles to overcome were considerable. 

The first obstacle to consider was the size of dirigibles themselves. At the time of the Empire State Building’s construction, dirigibles were huge airships that measured hundreds of feet in length. In order to accommodate them, the mooring mast needed to be very tall and sturdy. Secondly, the building of the Empire State Building it was slowly built upwards from the ground, but the mooring mast needed to be constructed first. This was a challenge as it had to be made of steel instead of concrete, due to the need for additional stability while the airships docked. Additionally, the mooring mast had to be extended from the 103rd floor, and since these floors were being built as the mooring mast was, the building’s construction had to be modified slightly to accommodate the addition. 

The third area of difficulty had to do with the engineering of the mast itself. Two large steel beams were used to support the mast and were bolted together. Also, the mast's support had to be strong enough that the airships wouldn’t cause too much stress on the building’s structure. Even after the m
