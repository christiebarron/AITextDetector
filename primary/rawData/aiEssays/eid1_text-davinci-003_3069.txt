I am writing to state my opinion on the impact that computers have on our lives. In my opinion, computers are a valuable asset to humanity, but can have both positive and negative effects.

The positives effects of computers include making our lives easier by eliminating tedious manual labor and increasing communication across vast distances. Computers have brought about amazing advancements in various sectors such as education, science, and business. In addition, computers help us to interact with people from different cultures and backgrounds.

On the other hand, computers are also used for malicious activities such as cybercrime, cyberbullying and online addiction. Desensitization to violence, pornography, and other negative content can desensitize us and make us less sensitive to the real world. It can also be an isolating factor. People tend to spend more time on computers than they do in social interaction with real people.

I believe that the effects of computers are both positive and negative, but ultimately, our lives revolve around them. Thus, it is important to understand and recognize the risks associated with computers and be aware of the impact they may have on our lives.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my
