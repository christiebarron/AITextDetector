The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it's all about the way we view our characters. It's not like we're there to show you that a character died. It's all a part of the experience. It's how an experience makes an individual feel. It's how a family will develop in the years that they live together." (T.S. Eliot's novel The End is coming to print in October).

Though we think it's worth reading, the book should be enjoyed as a serious, entertaining read: a treat, like "The End of Eternity."

What's it going to take for you to make the cut? Will you find a character to take on the role of Harry Potter? Let us know in the comments below.
