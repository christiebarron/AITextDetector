One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I took my daughter to the bathroom to wash my daughter's hair after I noticed and asked some questions.

"When my daughter came home to tell her mom about the new girl and her friend, they talked about what had happened, and my daughter asked my lady about the new girl and her friend. I told she I would be happy having them with me, because it is important for my daughter and I to stay positive. For instance, the day before she went to see my mom, we didn't have any children, so I asked her 'What's going on with your daughter when you want her to learn and feel more confident?

"That's where I've heard all questions," says my lady.

She went on with explaining why we would like to go to see my daughter, the new girl. How could we let her go into the girl's world if we wanted her to feel more confident and happy?

"It does surprise me. I have never been a strong person. I knew some strong people and didn't want to be. It was just that my life was different and I didn't realize I had strong people around me. I realized I wouldn't change if I were the strong person."

I also know they are worried and confused about what this girl is doing or her boyfriend did. I just want that to be heard, and understand that this is not a normal Lyme disease
