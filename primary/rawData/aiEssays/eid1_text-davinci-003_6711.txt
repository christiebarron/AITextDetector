Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my opinion about the effects of computers on people. In my opinion, computers have been a tremendous source of improvement and advancement in our world today. They have revolutionized not only the way our businesses operate, but more importantly, the way we interact in our day-to-day lives. 

First and foremost, computers have made the sharing of knowledge, information, and ideas an increasingly easy and efficient process. Before, exchanging ideas was extremely tedious and time-consuming. However, with the help of computers, people are now able to easily and quickly connect with communities of people across the world to solidify or discover relationships. 

In addition, computers have revolutionized the way businesses operate. They have dramatically increased the efficiency and productivity of companies. By combining powerful computing capabilities with advanced digital technologies, businesses have been able to get more work done in shorter periods of time. 

Finally, modern computers are also capable of providing entertainment. Through streaming media, online games, and interactive programs, a computer can be a great source of entertainment for all ages.

Overall, computers have made great advances in how we live our lives. They have increased overall productivity, enabled knowledge transfer, and provided much needed entertainment. For all of these reasons, I firmly believe that the positive effects of computers far outweigh the negatives. 

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
