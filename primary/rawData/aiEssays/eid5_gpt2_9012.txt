The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' was more melancholic than the somber, but it's a good thing that the film is so very sad, the music is sad, but itVERY does something. Because it is so emotional, it does an amazing job of showing the people who live there what the feeling is. And I think many of them feel it too but if you watch the movie and read for like 10 seconds and look at the people who live there and they're like 'What are you feeling?' you don't know. It's all emotional but it just gives people a very interesting and very vivid sense of the place. That's one of my favourite things about this film. You won't find other great documentaries with this kind of emotional journey. You'll find other films that show a person living up to their dream of living life as an American citizen and live where they're passionate about what they do.I'm really grateful to go to this film together and so grateful that the cast so quickly brought it together. It is amazing what they do together. We all look at it with worthless emotions and we look at the film as a life changing movie so if there's going to be any change you have to look at the people that went into making this film or the production team and the people that went into making this film. You can look at my daughter or my son and say oh I wonder what she will think of me if she comes home at
