Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my opinion on the effects computers are having on people. As technology continues to evolve, it’s clear that computers are having significant implications on how we work, think, and interact with each other.

The vast majority of people find computers to be extremely helpful in terms of productivity and efficiency. They can be used to automate difficult tasks, find information quickly, and create things that were not possible before.

However, there are also a number of potential negatives that cannot be overlooked. The widespread availability of computers has caused us to become increasingly dependent on them. This dependency can lead to a decreased sense of personal responsibility, as well as a lack of creative problem solving skills. In addition, increased use of computers can lead to a disconnect between people, which can affect both the quality and quantity of in-person interactions.

I realize not everyone shares my opinion, but I believe it’s important to consider the potential downsides of relying so heavily on computers. It’s important to use these powerful tools in a way that is mindful of our need for responsibility and human connection.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
