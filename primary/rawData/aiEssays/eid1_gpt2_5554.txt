Computers have many effects on people. In addition to slowing and decreasing their performance on certain tasks, these effects make it harder and harder to stop people from learning new things. Another example is, that while people are likely not learning anything new, their ability to think will increase, and a person's knowledge of a new thing increases. This results in people not teaching themselves how to read the media. The researchers are proposing that this effect also could be due to their ability to memorize new texts. It is not, of course, correct to say that people don't learn how to read the media. At other times a language might be useful, especially if it was developed as a way of communication.

The study suggests that people might need a little time to get that second hand book into their hands. The scientists suggest that they might look at the books of the past or to look for new books for different subjects depending on their education levels. But the authors say they have just got around to studying the books of the past.
