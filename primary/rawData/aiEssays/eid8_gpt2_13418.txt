One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I saw a cartoon character. A man called J.D. came to the office and said, "I need an explanation. I'm going to do a very good job of explaining to you the real, real answer to your question." It was a hilarious experience. There are thousands more examples of people standing up and saying this out loud on a daily basis."

"Sometimes what you want to see is somebody in a high class position. It doesn't matter what your status as a high class person is, your class is not at risk."


"In the real world, when in the real world, when a human being can sit at your desk and sit at your desk for several hours and not even acknowledge that it means anything, it does. It takes your entire existence to prove whether you're a high society person. That is who he says he is. In the real world it takes time. There are others who may not realize you're an all-star sports player, a great athlete and an athlete who put up good numbers."


"You see a lot of high school athletes walking about with their ball, wearing sneakers with the logos. I heard you all do that on your radio show every night."
