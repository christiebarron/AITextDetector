I had been dating my boyfriend for only a few months, but it felt like we had known each other for much longer. His sense of humor was something I treasures and it left me feeling light and bubbly every time I heard a joke from him.

One day, we were exploring a new restaurant together and while we were trying out dishes, I spotted a funny evening figurine in the corner. It was a donkey with sunglasses and it had 'Aloha' written on it. I couldn't help but find it silly and burst into laughter.

My boyfriend must have seen how amused I was and he started laughing too. Both of us could hardly stop and I was laughing until tears ran down my cheeks. We eventually spent the rest of the evening walking around the city, still sharing casual jokes.

It was that evening that made me realize that laughter really is the shortest distance between two people. It was the one thing that connected us and was something we could always fall back on when everything else was too heavy.
