Dear Editor, 

As computers become more ubiquitous in our lives, itâ€™s time to think carefully about how they affect us. From my experience, I believe that computers can be beneficial to people in many ways. 

To start with, computers provide us with a wealth of information, allowing us to become more informed about the world around us. Through the internet, every person can have access to knowledge that was once reserved only to those who had the right educational background. Additionally, computers can help us save time with mundane tasks, allowing us to focus on other projects.

Furthermore, computers act as facilitators, connecting us with people who would otherwise be unreachable. Social media sites offer us an opportunity to interact with people we would never meet in the real world. However, one critical point we must consider is that we should use technology responsibly. We must remember to not rely on screens for emotional support, or be involved in activities that disallow us from living our daily life.

In conclusion, computers have a multitude of advantages - they expand our view of the world and bring people closer together. However, we must remember to use computers responsibly and not be excessive in our usage.

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
