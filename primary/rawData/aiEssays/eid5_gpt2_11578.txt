The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is a clear reminder that even in the dark past we remain young. Yet it's not just a matter of whether we understand the challenges of those who are today or we see a new future.

At a time when many were thinking about the very young and who can help us to put the future into words, I hope my book helps to inspire young persons to think, imagine, and create.
