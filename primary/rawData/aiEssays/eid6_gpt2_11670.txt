The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The new high ceilings in the towers allow gravity to slip the glass in.

The engineers of the Pentagon could also bring into question the notion that a dirigible could be turned so as to avoid a space-faring scenario where the building is no longer necessary.

If the building is not used then the city's only option would be to turn its building with an overhang into a parking garage.

A high ceiling overhang in the base of the Pentagon would be a more desirable site for dirigibles, in principle. But building in high-rise buildings that have a higher height and higher speed would be a serious risk.

On the other hand, if we assume the building is not used and no dirigibles are needed, then the design could well be more appealing to the visitors.

One factor that could make dirigibles more appealing is their proximity to roads where they could be used for pedestrian access.

If the buildings are not used then the designers' assumption that the buildings are not necessary can be proven wrong.

In fact, to make the Pentagon usable, then this approach has already been tried: "The designers of this houses can use a large number of dirigibles to make the entrances to the building more visible to the public," said James Gartner, a professor of design
