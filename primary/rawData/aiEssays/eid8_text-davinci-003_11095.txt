 

I tend to be a bit of an introvert, so when I first got to college, I was struggling to make friends. With a heavy heart, I trudged to class every morning, feeling increasingly foreign and alone in this new environment. 

That all changed, however, when I started to talk to Sanam, the cheerful brunette who sat next to me in a few of my classes. We quickly became good friends, bonding over our mutual love of philosophy.

One morning, we both got to class about 10 minutes late and Sanam plopped down in the seat next to me, her bright blue and green outfit making her stand out from the sea of gray and beige that usually filled the room. Thatâ€™s when it happened.

She started telling me about her weekend, something funny that her aunt had said at her cousin's wedding. Suddenly I couldn't help it; we started laughing uncontrollably. Another student gave us an angry glare, but neither of us cared. We were both too busy trying to catch our breath, laughing until we were practically hysterical.

That moment marked the beginning of our friendship. After that, laughter became our way of connecting and the twinkle in Sanam's eye whenever we shared a joke made me feel like I had finally found my place. Even the silences between us could bring a smile to my face, because I knew that we would be back to laughing our heads off
