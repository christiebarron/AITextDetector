When I was a teenager, I was a TA for my High School Chemistry class. I was assigned to help out a few struggling students who were having difficulty understanding the concepts. I was young, and not as patient as I am now, so it was quite a challenge for me to remain calm and be understanding. 

It was frustrating for me when I tried to explain one concept and it didnâ€™t click with the student. I had to take a step back, put on a smile, and patiently try again. No matter how much I wanted to give up, I reminded myself that I'm here to help them succeed. 

Eventually, the students were able to comprehend the lesson, thanks to my patience and willingness to keep trying. It was rewarding and encouraging for me to see how far they had come. It felt incredibly fulfilling to know that I had played a part in helping them get there. 

This experience taught me that patience and encouragement are often the keys to success.
