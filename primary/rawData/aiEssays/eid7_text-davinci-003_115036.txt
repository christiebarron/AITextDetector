I got into a car accident last week on my way home from work. Fortunately, I wasn't injured. I was, however, incredibly upset because I had to wait almost two hours for the police to arrive and take my report. It was the last thing I wanted to be dealing with on a cold, rainy night after a long day of work. 

As I impatiently waited in my car, the rain pouring down like a curtain, I was overwhelmed with emotions and had to fight the urge to just drive away. But then I remembered this quote, "When things don't go your way, be patient and take a deep breath." 

So I took a few deep breaths and calmed myself down. I was patient and understanding about the situation, telling myself that I had no control over the amount of time it was taking. I made an attempt to fill my time by listening to music and phoning a friend. 

After 1 hour and 45 minutes, the police finally arrived. I was relieved to be able to finish the paperwork and be on my way home. I was proud of myself for handling the situation in a calm manner and not losing my cool like I usually do. 

This experience taught me the importance of being patient. I know now that in difficult times, patience can help me not only to deal with challenges, but also to maintain my composure and sanity.
