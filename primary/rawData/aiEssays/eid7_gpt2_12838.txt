An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was in a relationship who refused to give birth and then had a birth before or after me if I wanted to have sex with her.

I was very patient and I did the best I could to help them. And some of that knowledge, I think, I really learned my lesson, and I think it was something positive that had me struggling on and off a boat for years and I think that could also be linked to other things. I think I could make that connection and give her an example, and she would say, "Oh Influenza is real, this person's got the flu, she's got to have an education." So that was something I wanted to know. I think something that my parents were asking me was, "What's this disease that you can't cure?" and my question was, "So as someone who's already cured, what kind of person are you?" So I could be the solution.
