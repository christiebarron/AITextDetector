One time I experienced laughter in my life was when something terrible suddenly struck me. My parents were trying to get married in Texas and I was at work, looking into our house when a big bear appeared. The bear was about 5 feet, 5 inches tall and about 6 feet long. And we were not surprised -- we were stunned. And we thought, Oh my God -- something really bad must have been going on up here. So I immediately ran to the neighbor who said, "You heard me -- this is the same thing that happened to you, my friend, so it's probably coming right back up here." I said, OK -- I got out of the house, ran to my own vehicle, ran through a bush and caught a bear, shot him in the back... and he was bleeding. He was bleeding badly. I knew I'd had a bear in town, but he kept coming. And I said, "Did you hear me, this is the first time my friend has gotten hit, and yet I can't figure it out yet, so this is probably coming right back down here." And he kept coming, and I was not able to run away. I came home safe and sound and OK. So I ran to my mom who had given my friend an ear-clearing ear piercing and told her the bear was probably coming down there. So she went back and did an ear-clearing ear piercing on him and made him think he was really having a bear
