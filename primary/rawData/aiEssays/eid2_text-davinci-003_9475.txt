The freedom of speech and expression is a right that every individual must be able to enjoy. Libraries should act as the cornerstone of this right, providing a safe place for people to access the materials they need for their research and leisure. It is for this reason that censorship should not be welcomed within the walls of our public libraries. 

Censorship within libraries would go against the fundamental principles of free speech and expression. It would deny citizens the right to access materials of their choice, which is necessary for personal development. It would also limit the scope of knowledge available in these libraries and impose an unacceptable restriction of choice on the people who use them. Furthermore, libraries that choose to censor their collections would risk singling out certain materials as offensive, which could lead to an unnecessary moral judgement being placed on peopleâ€™s reading habits. 

Rather than censoring materials from its collections, a library should provide information on the material it holds instead. This would allow citizens to make more informed choices about their reading material, without the library having to impose its own moral or academic judgement. Libraries should also educate their users about the potential harms of certain materials and provide resources for further research. 

It is important that our public libraries remain as informative, educational and, most importantly, free-thinking places. Censorship within libraries should never be considered, as it would only serve to limit the scope of knowledge they can provide to the citizens who use them.
