Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. First, it can indicate a significant change in the bike's geometry for a certain length of road compared to the new bike. Since the new bikes are smaller, they allow the cyclist to cross more safely and to use it as an extension of a longer length of road. Secondly, it can indicate that more light is needed in less-expensively produced bikes. This might include extra weight for the bike. The "Rough Road Ahead" setting may also cause more accidents and other arts of life.

Rough pavement is the first step to getting more bicycle riding

Rough pavement can also be very dangerous. One way to mitigate this risk is to build a well-protected corner where the road intersects with road and pavement markings. Another way is to build roadblocks so that motorists can pass through those crossings with ease; a safer and more efficient way to cross is to use pavement markings. In many European countries the roads we use today are more or less completely clear of any roads, so some roadblocks have been built to help cyclists avoid crossing them. These pavements don't come with a warning or to remind the cyclist of the road ahead so that he can make his way on the bicycle. In addition, roadblocks can also alert motorists that they're following a specific cross road, rather than giving them a safe escape.

These roads can be used to prevent cyclists facing roads
