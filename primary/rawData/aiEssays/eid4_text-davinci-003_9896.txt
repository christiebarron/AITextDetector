The last line of the poem serves as a metaphor for the narrator's emotional journey and her view that a person can always try again, no matter how many times they may have failed in the past. The narrator is reflecting on her experiences of taking a test and failing it, and how, in the same way that the hibiscus blooms and dies each winter, she will get up and take the test again and again until she eventually succeeds. The repeated use of the phrase "when they come back in the spring" serves as a reminder to the reader to never give up, even in times of difficulty, and to look toward the hope and promise of a new start that the spring season brings--just like the hibiscus.
