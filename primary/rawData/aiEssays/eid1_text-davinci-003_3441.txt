Dear Editor,

As technology has become increasingly advanced, many are concerned about the effects computers have had on humans. As a student who has experienced both the upsides and downsides of computers during my educational career, I believe computers have had both positive and negative effects.

On the positive side, computers have allowed us to access vast amounts of information in a fraction of the time it used to take us and helped us become more efficient in the process. Next, with computers being able to complete tedious tasks, it has enabled us to put our resources towards emerging or creative fields which would otherwise require an extensive amount of time. Furthermore, computers have opened up a variety of ways of communication which transcends geographical boundaries, allowing us to stay connected with those we care about no matter where they are located.

Unfortunately, the drawbacks can’t be ignored. On one hand, the amount of time people are spending on their computer has reduced the amount of time they spend in face to face conversations and social interactions, which can lead to social isolation and depression. On the other hand, computers have made it easier for people to be lazy, leading to decreased physical activities and thus impacting people’s health.

Overall
