I've always believed in the power of laughter. And last week, I got to see it firsthand.

My brother and I have an age gap of seven years, so we never quite connected when we were younger. Now that we both live in different cities, it's been a few years since I've seen him, and we Skype every couple of months to catch up. When he visited for the weekend, I was really excited to spend some time with him.

The night he arrived, we hung out in the backyard playing some games. We were laughing and talking, but suddenly, my brother made a joke about something completely random and unexpected. That joke caught me off guard and I couldn't help but laugh so hard that I almost fell off my chair.

As I was laughing, I noticed my brother had this mischievous glint in his eye that made me think he was trying to make me laugh. That moment opened up a whole new opportunity in our relationship. We were both immediately more comfortable with each other than we had ever been before.

Since that night, we've been texting more and spending time together when he's in town. Whenever we talk, laughter is always at the center of our conversations. It's like it's re-igniting our relationship and creating something new.

It's amazing the kind of power that laughter has. In that moment, it brought us closer together and showed us how we can truly connect
