I remember a time when my friend was going through a tough situation in her life. She had to make a really difficult decision and was feeling very distressed. She asked me to come over and talk to her about it.

I could tell that she was really struggling, but I stayed patient with her. I listened to her as she talked, but I didn't push her to make a decision that she wasn't ready for. Instead, I just offered as much support as I could by just listening and being understanding of how she was feeling.

I encouraged her to take her time and take care of herself before deciding what to do. I reminded her that she was strong and that she could handle it.

Eventually, she made the decision that she was comfortable with and for me it was such a proud moment. She showed me how patient she was being with herself and I was so proud of her. It was a reminder to me that taking your time and being patient with yourself is key in tough situations.
