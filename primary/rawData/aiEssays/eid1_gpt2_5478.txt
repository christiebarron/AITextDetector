Computers have many effects on people. They've really increased our understanding of personality. It's easier for us to understand someone, but more importantly they are more likely to believe the information (which the computer has read and used to create people) and thus, we may more easily understand others. I think it's a common trait from other cognitive disciplines. I would think that it's a trait we are particularly sensitive to, and perhaps also we would be more open to being able to see things that might seem odd but are actually very clear. In my mind it's about empathy and caring for others. It might be that a person has an emotion for someone whom they don't necessarily know. Or you've read something that might just explain away in a way that makes you empathize with them. If that's part of a more sophisticated approach, then we might not just give the impression that someone is empathizing in some other way, but maybe in more subtle ways. Or we might expect that someone is just an easygoing person, and will do what will make our lives easier. That may make it easier for the computer to do just that. That could help us be more open to understanding people of other types. However, if anyone is willing to go through any of the problems I think we are facing with helping people understand one another, I think it would be a good idea to create a program that has people using it. It might be that someone is not actively interested in understanding this
