I was on vacation with my family at an all inclusive resort in Cancun, Mexico. One night after dinner, my parents and I went to the theater to watch a local show. As the show progressed, I felt an increasing urge to laugh. I tried to contain myself but I couldn't help it; I started laughing hysterically. Soon enough, my laughing was contagious and everyone in the theater was erupting with laughter. No one knew what was so funny, but it didn't matter because we were all laughing.

The show finally ended, and everyone left the theater in a lighthearted and cheerful mood. I felt a special bond with my family and the strangers I was surrounded by. We had all experienced something special; something that would be hard to recreate. The beauty of shared laughter was what made the moment so unique and memorable. We all left the theater with a new appreciation for the simple joy of laughter.
