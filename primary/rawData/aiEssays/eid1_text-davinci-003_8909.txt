To The Editor:

I am writing to express my opinion on the direct and indirect effects of the presence of computers in people’s lives. The use of computers has become ubiquitous in today’s society and its influence on our everyday lives is undeniable.

On the direct side, computers have made lives easier and more efficient. Through the use of computers, things that used to take a lot of time and energy to do can now be completed with the simple click of a button. This has led to increased productivity and better organizing of tasks.

On the indirect side, however, computers have had some negative consequences. With the advent of social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, people now feel pressure to have a constant presence in the digital world. This can lead to feelings of inadequacy and a sense of obsession with the “perfect” life as depicted by others.

However, I believe that these effects can be minimized if we use computer technology responsibly. We must use computers to enhance our lives and not to become slaves to them. We should be mindful of the hidden effects of technology on our lives and use it only when necessary. 

Overall, I believe that computers can be beneficial if used in moderation and with the right attitude. It would be wise to remember that technology is a tool and not a way of life. 

Thank you for your time and consideration. 

Sincerely,
[Your Name
