An example of a time someone in my life was patient was his son, a small man, who was in hospital with severe injuries. (I just got home and started to cry.) I'm not sure who that was to say, but he was his son in every respect. solicitous, kind, and kind of a gentleman. When he was hospitalized, he was treated very well and cared much for all the patients who were there. He was a really generous person, I believe. I've talked to other doctors so much he knew and was very caring to them. He took care of so many of the patients I treated. We're very proud this boy was there for them.

How long did it take before some of the patients came back to my hospital?

Yeah, he got reacquired that day a week later. I had about a week to prepare him for his reacquisition. I don't know all the details. His son was on the move when there was no chance of it. We got rid of that because my family could not afford it, but his son is so big it saved them more money. So that was our family saving it. My daughter was off the ship and my wife and children were off it. He was all the time in there and all I cared for my son was getting him to be home, so this was going to help us out if we had to get my son back.

I don't know.
