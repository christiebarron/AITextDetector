Dear Editor, 

I have been following the conversation about the impact computers have on people. After hearing about the different views on the subject, I am compelled to write a letter to share my opinion on the matter.

I believe that computers have had a positive impact on people. From the rise of new devices to the development of new technology, our lives have become faster and more efficient. With the help of computer engineering, more people are able to access information and resources at the press of a button. Medical treatments, transportation, and communication are becoming more advanced because of the use of computers. Furthermore, computers are becoming more affordable and accessible for all socio-economic groups, providing the same opportunities to everyone.

At the same time, computers have also made life easier. We no longer have to leave home to access the internet, find answers to our questions, or even shop; we can do everything from the comfort of our own home. As a result, people are becoming more productive and creative as they can find innovative solutions to common problems or come up with new ideas.

In short, I maintain that computers have had a positive effect on our lives. We are more connected now and more empowered to do tasks more efficiently and quickly. I hope that you agree and can see the positive impacts that computers have had on our society.

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
