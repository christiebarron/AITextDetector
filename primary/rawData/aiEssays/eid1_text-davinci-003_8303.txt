I remember one instance in particular when I had to be extra patient. I had recently finished my undergraduate degree and was applying to numerous graduate programs. It was a long process of researching schools, studying for the GMAT, sending in applications, and waiting anxiously for an acceptance or denial letter.

The common thread to each step was simply being patient. This meant controlling my anxiety and nerves not to get ahead of myself. I had to be diligent in studying for the GMAT, taking my time with the applications and giving schools ample time to consider my candidacy.

My patience was finally rewarded when I ultimately received multiple acceptance letters. The moment of satisfaction was unmatched, though it paled in comparison to the feeling of self worth and inner strength that I felt from having the fortitude to practice patience.

Having experienced this firsthand, I'm grateful for the countless times patience was necessary in pushing through any difficult moments in my life. While I don’t always remember to “allowing some time to pass”, this memorable experience stands out as a reminder to continue to exercise this virtue moving forward.
