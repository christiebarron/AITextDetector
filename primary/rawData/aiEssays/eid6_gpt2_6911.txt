The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, a large amount of light couldn't easily get from one end of the building to the other in such a way as to make the lights stand out. Second, there were no walls of any sort to discourage anyone from entering the building in such an attempt. Finally, after many attempts, the builders had to rely on the light sensors to adjust the lighting for the room.

On a normal working day, the first task could easily run for two hours. In this case, there were not enough hours to allow anyone to turn on the lights until five o'clock in the afternoon. Fortunately, the pilots had one trick up their sleeve. The three sensors in front of this pilot could identify the aircraft and the location of a pilot who was about to take off. As long as the pilot was out of the room, the pilot had no choice but to turn off light.

The system kept the lights from getting tangled in the light fixture's back, which is a necessary condition. Even if the pilot was not to be seen, the system would still be able to provide a better indication of where the pilot had passed. And on that basis, a large variety of other sensors, including an infrared sensor, were needed to distinguish pilots under some conditions from the pilot who received no warning. It became too complicated, and the problem remained until the pilot finally could locate the pilot.
