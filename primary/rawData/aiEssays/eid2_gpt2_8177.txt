I believe that censorship of materials in libraries can help to lessen problems such as online trolls, which has been occurring for some time now. I would certainly like to see more research into the issue from within or outside the state.

I also understand why some publications or schools have struggled to provide a library service. I'm still in awe of how much we value the freedom these voices provide and feel we have a responsibility to our fellow citizens.

Let's all be patient. If you see our stories like these, be aware of how many of us live under constant threat. We may be in the midst of a new era of freedom, but the changes we all are making are still the best days of our lives and the best lessons we can learn from them.

Thank you,
