Computers have many effects on people.

"We can see that the impact on people's lives is very low because they are not working but people's work doesn't change what they take away from us," said Tew. "They don't see themselves as their own people."

Tees said the results of the study and their design would allow for better ways to look at why these effects are occurring.

"It's still unclear what these effects may actually be. It's clear that the lack of a single mechanism that people have used to help their lives is a real concern," he said. "But that's not something we can think of now," he said.
