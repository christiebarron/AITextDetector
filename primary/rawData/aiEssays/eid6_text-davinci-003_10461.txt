The Empire State Building was the first skyscraper in the world to attempt to dock dirigibles, making its opening in 1931 a remarkable event. As the first of its kind, the attempt had an incredible number of complex logistical obstacles that the builders had to overcome in order to make it a success.

In the first place, the design of the mast itself was a difficult task. The mast had to be tall enough in order to provide enough height clearance between the top of it and the top of the building for a dirigible to maneuver and dock, but the structure also had to strong enough to support the weight of an airship. To achieve this, the mast had to be incredibly sturdy but slim at the same time. In the end, a 65-foot tall steelmast was built while utilizing the strongest materials available, including steel cable and gypsum rods.

The engineers had to also take into consideration how the dirigible itself would approach the docking area, as the mooring procedure had never been done before. In the end, they determined that the flight path should be relatively straight and the approach angle should be from the east. To accommodate the process, numerous wind tethers and observation decks were built, allowing the airship pilot to make necessary adjustments as it flew in to dock. As for the operators on the ground, a special railing was installed to help guide the nose of the airship so that it could properly line up for the mast.
