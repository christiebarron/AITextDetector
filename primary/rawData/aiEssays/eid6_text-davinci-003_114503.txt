The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when they decided to allow dirigibles or airships, to dock there. These obstacles include the need for a large, heavy, and complex mast along with the physical limitations of the building design and the safety of passengers. 

The building required a mooring mast which was to be located atop the Empire State Building. As the tallest building in the world, the mast had to be equally impressive. It was designed by William Nicholas, a chief engineer, and was made of steel and concrete with a 355-foot vertical length reinforced with steel girders and pins. The mooring mast was also designed to be adjustable for the varying heights of the distinct types of dirigibles. The mast was further designed with an elevator that allowed the passengers and crew to board and disembark the airship while it was moored to the mast.

The physical limitations of the building design presented another obstacle. The building was not designed to support the extra weight of a mooring mast or the airship itself. Therefore, engineers had to develop a plan to distribute the weight evenly and safely to all parts of the building. As a result, the girders and pins of the mooring mast were reinforced and placed on special concrete foundations, tie-runnels, and arching beams with dampers to ensure that none of the floors were vulnerable to collapse. 

Finally, the safety of passengers had to
