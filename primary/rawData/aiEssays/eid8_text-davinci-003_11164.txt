I was out for lunch with my best friend, Matt. We had been catching up on each other's lives for a while when the waitress finally brought us our meals. My stomach was rumbling, I was so ready to dig in! 

But Matt had something else in mind. He took one look at my plate and started to laugh. I couldn't help but join in even though I still had no idea what was so funny. I asked him what was so amusing and he pointed to my plate. 

It turns out, in the rush of serving us our meals, the waitstaff had accidentally put a bowl of mashed potatoes on my wrap sandwich. We both fell into fits of laughter that only got louder and longer as we pointed at the other diners looking over at the two of us, barely able to breathe because of our laughter. 

We ended up having to leave the restaurant we were laughing so hard, but I will never forget that moment. It was so much more than just a funny moment for me; it was a reminder of how our friendship has stood the test of time. We both knew that no matter what bad times we faced, the laughter between us would keep us going.
