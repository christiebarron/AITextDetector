She knew the president made it easy for her to control the vehicles, provided she was on the payroll, even after she was out of the building. The three sons were sent to his factory to be tested and they died in the blast.

Because the Empire State Building's power plants were not well equipped to handle power plant workers in large numbers, the city authorities were unable to create sufficient capacity to handle these workers.

Some of the power plants were equipped with electronic control equipment (ICU) in the form of a remote switch. An automated power drive was also installed in the building to make the building smarter and more resistant to natural disasters. All of these problems can be explained, but they
