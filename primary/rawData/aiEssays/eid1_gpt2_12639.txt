Computers have many effects on people. I feel like every single one who has ever been to a doctor or had one has seen something like that. People are extremely difficult to touch or talk to. What have we done? I was in the emergency department when an ambulance took me into its trunk from the ground. And, this is all you can remember. I couldn't see through the plastic bag they brought me into because then the doctor would call it an emergency – this is not normal. There is no way that we can save this guy. We need the patient to be taken to the doctor – that's just another form of torture – but it's a medical procedure.

Teddy's mother has never talked to him since. He has always insisted he never made any attempt at talking to her. He had never seen either her face or eyes either. It's amazing – it was impossible to talk with him in a moment.

JANUARY 24: He does not know what happened to him and will never say anything to him. He has not told anyone, and yet they see the doctor, but no one is sure who brought it up to him when he was under anaesthetic.

DAMAGE: The doctors at the hospital have found blood for me that has clearly started clotting when the blood is put in a bag

In 2011, Teddy was treated by an anaesthetic. It took about an hour for him to turn into an ambulance.
