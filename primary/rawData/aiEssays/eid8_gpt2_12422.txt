One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was 10 years old - but the only time I heard it before I heard it from someone who had never heard laughing as a toddler was when I would sing and then go to a bar to play as a child. It was never from someone who I was proud of. I feel the same about people who want a laugh.

This isn't to say there are no examples of people who have never had a laugh. But those people are also laughing because they feel a lot of pressure to be funny. "I heard a guy who's a bit different from everyone I've spoken to, and all the people he'd loved and loved, and all the people who'd done stupid things - and I knew he was smart and I knew his career was going to be better then anyone's, and he actually told me he was really pleased that I was the first and last person to ever get his hands on his stuff..." - Brianne Sandberg, The Great New Briton

Now imagine a society where only men can have fun - but if women can only have fun and only men can laugh, imagine a society where women could be doing it all the time instead of just going to an activity like watching movies (as most men do). This idea would be so bizarre that it could even be said to be the new normal, but the thought would only come in the post-modern era where sexism is no longer viewed through a lens
