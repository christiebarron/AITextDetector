I remember I had a family reunion when I was younger. There were a lot of relatives I had never met before and some of them weren't very kind. They kept making remarks about my clothing, my hairstyle, and even started asking how much money my parents made.

At first, I wanted to get mad. I wanted to stand up for myself and tell them that I didn’t have to answer their questions. However, I knew that they were just trying to figure me out. Everyone has their own process for meeting and interacting with new people, and I knew that shouting wouldn’t get me anywhere.

So, I decided to be patient, take a deep breath, and instead of reacting angrily, I chose to answer their questions politely and consistently. I could tell they were surprised at my level of patience and understanding. 

Eventually, we began to understand each other which allowed us to enjoy the rest of our time together. Being patient with them was one of the most rewarding experiences I've ever had. It taught me that patience and understanding often lead to even better relationships than confrontation ever does.
