Dear Editor,

I would like to share my opinion on the current trend of using computers in everyday life, and make a convincing argument for the potential benefits and dangers that come with them. 

As technology advances, there is no denying the undeniable advantages of computers. We can gain access to the worldâ€™s knowledge at our fingertips, make quick and informed decisions, efficiently manage our day-to-day lives, and much more. 

However, it is also important to keep in mind the dangers that accompany computers. People can get addicted to technology, leading to disconnection from friends and family, a lack of physical activity, and other associated risks. People also risk their privacy when using computers, as technology companies and governments may access and store information of users without their consent.

Overall, I believe computers can be a great tool for personal and professional development, but should be used responsibly to avoid the potential risks. People should be aware of the dangers of using computers and take steps to reduce possible risks.  

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
