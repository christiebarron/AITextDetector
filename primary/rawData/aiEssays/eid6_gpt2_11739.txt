This is an area where we know that many problems went unpunished for many years, and that many different architectural approaches were the work of many individuals. The very first problem was to build the tallest building on our planet. The second problem was to make the building at that moment a real world house. The third problem was to make it feasible because the building would have to be built by now. To avoid it, the builders found ways to make a large part of the building a flat screen TV and film. For example, we made a number of windows, some smaller and so on.

This technology was called "The Sky TV" and was used in the war to cover up the problems which prevented the building of the Empire State Building.
