The author is likely using the imagery of nature to symbolize renewal and hope. The symbolism of the hibiscus, the snow melting, and the geese returning allude to new beginnings and the possibility for a brighter future. By using this imagery, the author is expressing hope that despite the difficulty of the previous winter, better things can happen when it comes back. The ending line itself is a metaphor for the protagonist taking their test again and implies that the protagonist will do better when that time comes.
