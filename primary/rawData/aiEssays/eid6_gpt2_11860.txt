The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The tower, however, is still one of the largest skyscrapers in the world, with 2.1 million square feet in the building's upper floor.

The Star-Spangled Banner

To keep people from going down when they want or when they don't want it, they used a Star-Spangled Banner.

The New York Times reported:

The Banner was first brought to life for the city at the United Nations International Convention Centre, where it became the world's most popular symbol after falling one to the ground.zees@nytimes.com.

When the American Army Corps of Engineers released a request for proposals for the building with the request for proposal, the company said it wanted a banner to replace a flag in the building that had a horizontal and vertical cross section.

Instead, the company said it wanted a standard "D" on every side, which includes a line.

The Banner atlas is made up of a series of triangles, with "D"s for each shape. The first Banner was built in 1867, showing what would be the main cross section after the addition of the central and smaller columns.

As the government asked public officials not to build the Banner to replace "D"s for a flag, many other buildings were eventually completed using a flag.
