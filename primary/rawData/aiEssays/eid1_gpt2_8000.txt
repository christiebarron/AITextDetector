Computers have many effects on people.

Lemma: I mean, the way computers behave in human society is this is that you can have them both. You can have computers that do mathematics in parallel and it creates a huge amount of friction. In other words, you have this huge degree of freedom to go and do what you want and have a huge benefit.

Watson: There is an analogy we have with it. You go out and try to learn something and the most important thing to make it work for you is to find your way back.

Kaufman: No, there's not that, there's no connection there. There's no connection between how computers interact with humans. They are all very related and very different and not a question right now. But it's not in our brains as much as it is in our bones.

We can learn that it is like the brain when you talk to robots.

Lemma: Well, computers, they could do what you would call intelligence training, the way you would teach a school kid about information.

Kaufman: Well, and, you know, they just don't know how to learn stuff, or they know the language. So, how do we do this?

Watson: Exactly.

Kaufman: How do we have a really simple, smart person know, say a computer program, 'You can't speak well' or
