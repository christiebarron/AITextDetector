The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is that when the young people of Paris were leaving for work, they were told, "you didn't have to pay anything for your life that much." At the same time, they were told, "You were being very honest." 'The more you have gone, the more you get tired of hearing about the Paris-to,' says Michel. "The more you get tired of hearing about the Paris-to, you get stuck with the same problems. And no wonder you say in Paris, 'My life's too nice.'"

In response, in 2013 the city agreed to pay the company â‚¬8 million ($10 million) that would allow the group to sell its first production unit in France. The decision was made even as the city appealed the judgment to France's central court.

Today it is a legal battle for the rights to the history of the Paris-to and for the fate of the company, founded in 1983, that will end in 2020. The decision was not expected to be decided and the company was not prepared to comment with reporters about the deal. Michel says that some of the arguments, including one made last fall, were based on the argument that the city's "poverty" and "high rate of unemployment" were contributing to its decline.

"The decision comes in the context of a society in which a large number of people living in poverty are living in isolated, isolated communities," says
