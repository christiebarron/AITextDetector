One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was a kid, in my late teens, but never witnessed it myself. I was raised only in the middle of America. I have a great family and I love everything about our cultureâ€”but not in America. I didn't start out saying this. I went on on Oprah, and I started talking some shit about women in the press, about rape culture, and so on. Then I began to see it, and people realized this. A generation of mothers that I grew up with told me that I could never live like that and I wanted to be one of those women. Then one year I started talking to this wonderful woman from Wisconsin. She just said she's talking right now.

What is the story of how you came so far?

I got together with a friend, and I just really wanted to come out and go see her. I said, "I've met my real girl. I love her, but I want to do more. I want to be an actress. I'm gonna do it." I wanted to be my own woman. This is real life as it is, and I loved being alone with a group of girls. I think a lot of people realize how little there is to see in this world. That is so important of love. This is more than a piece of paper. It is the first step on the path to acceptance.
