I recently had a commitment I had made to a friend that I didnâ€™t feel I could keep. With school and work, I had completely forgotten about it, and they were getting increasingly frustrated with me for not following through. I could tell they were getting angry with me for not being consistent, but I chose to stay calm and treat the situation with understanding instead of reacting negatively. I reminded myself that life can be complicated and that it was understandable that things could slip our minds from time to time. I apologized to my friend and promised to do better in the future, and they asked for some time to cool down. I respected their wishes and gave them space, not prying too much until they were ready to talk again. Eventually, they opened up to me, and we were able to part ways on good terms. Being patient was difficult, but I'm grateful that I was able to show understanding and resolve the situation peacefully.
