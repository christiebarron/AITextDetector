An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the time doctors were called or threatened with arrest for calling 911 when it was necessary," said Dr. Paul Sousa, a neurosurgeon and the author of "Risk Factors for Medical Marijuana Use." "A little bit reckless could be justified in police departments having guns, having a warrant, even having someone in the car."

In addition to the violence that could lead to jail time, medical marijuana sales have been a source of controversy. As in other states, marijuana use has been a crime even when marijuana is legal or regulated by state officials. While drug laws are different and more focused on criminal activity rather than medical, marijuana in general and medicinal marijuana in particular is a very safe form of marijuana with no serious side effects or health risks.

A Colorado bill, called the Compassionate Access, Regulation and Legalization Act, is an important step toward allowing patients to grow their own cannabis and could open that door for medical marijuana sales, Sousa said. "That's a smart policy, but we're not going to change a policy where it could lead to the wrong thing," said Dr. Paul Almaninidis, vice president of public policy and program at the Drug Policy Alliance. "I find if we did pass a pot law, we could help people get the help they need."
