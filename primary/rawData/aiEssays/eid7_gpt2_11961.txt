An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a mother of 13 years who went to a hospital with her 9-year-old daughter after she was born with cerebral pals inseparable from her chest.

There was no hospitalisation and she was alive. How could these things happen? How could she die without some kind of control?

Some people will blame the authorities but most of us in the UK are lucky to escape the world of emergency aid and hospital staff.

Every time I see a charity giving help and support to people who have been affected by something I always wonder what they could really have achieved by giving. I have found many people who did have a direct link to the charity and would never have taken their own daughter as a child.

I can not speak for all my friends out there but it does not make sense to blame a single person in my life for anything they didn't achieve, what I do understand is that I made every single one of those friends. The only thing they had to do was take what I had a real responsibility.

How did you survive these situations and have people feel respected and appreciated?

A lot of people came up through social service organisations. There was this myth that what you see is good and that you did something good. What you really see is that people do not get to see what is good anymore and they do. If it was more visible people would have taken on those roles.
