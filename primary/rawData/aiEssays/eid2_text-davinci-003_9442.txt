Censorship in libraries is a controversial topic. On one hand, some argue that books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from library shelves if they are found to be offensive to the public. On the other hand, some argue that censoring library materials limits education and stifles creativity.

In my opinion, censorship of library materials is too extreme and should not be practiced. After all, libraries serve as places where people can seek out information, knowledge, and entertainment. If offensive materials are removed, this limits the resources patrons have to learn and grow from. Furthermore, censorship limits the input of conflicting ideas, which can help people learn more about different views. 

It is possible to censor library materials without removing them from library shelves. Libraries can use labels or ratings to help people make an informed decision about what kind of materials they choose to check out. Another compromise would be to move any offensive materials to a separate area or specific shelves, where individuals can decide for themselves if such materials are appropriate for them or not. 

In today’s world, resources are so vast and available at our fingertips that censorship in libraries is utterly unnecessary. Removing materials from library shelves is a form of censorship that takes away a patron’s right to make an informed decision about what kind of books, movies, or magazines they want to check out. I urge library patrons to discuss this issue among themselves, and to oppose censorship in libraries.
