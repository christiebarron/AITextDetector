The features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead” have a significant impact on the cyclist’s experience. The rough roads and lack of gentleness in the landscape evoke a sense of danger in the environment, which in turn creates a heightened sense of uncertainty. This feeling of instability adds to the cyclist’s sense of vulnerability as they are cycling in an unfamiliar terrain.

The coldness and barrenness of the environment serves to make the cyclist feel isolated and alone in a vast and dangerous land. This further contributes to their fear and worry as they navigate their treacherous path. Furthermore, the darkness of the night serves to add to the sense of danger in the environment. This is made even more difficult by the fact that the cyclist is unable to see ahead in the darkness and is thus unable to predict what may lie ahead in terms of obstacles or hazards.

The features of the setting thus create an atmosphere of uncertainty and danger which deeply affect the cyclist’s experience in this story. The terrain, darkness, and loneliness all contribute to the cyclist’s feeling of fear and vulnerability, heightening the tension and danger in the story. Despite the fact that the cyclist is strong and determined, they are still at the mercy of the environment and thus are greatly affected by the setting in this story.
