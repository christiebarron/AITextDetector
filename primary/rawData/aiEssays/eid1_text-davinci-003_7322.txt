The setting of “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski is an integral part of the story, and it influences the cyclist in a variety of ways. 

One of the story’s most significant features is the fact that it takes place in a rural setting. This means that the cyclist is navigating roads that are unfamiliar to him.

In addition, there are no street lights or driveways along the roads, leaving the cyclist to navigate the terrain on their own in often low light scenarios. This makes the cyclist vulnerable, given their lack of knowledge about the setting and limited visibility.
