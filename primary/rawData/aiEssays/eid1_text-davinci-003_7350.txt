In ‘Rough Road Ahead' by Joe Kurmaski, the setting is a mountainous region in the United States. The story focuses on a cyclist who is struggling to ascend a steep, rocky road.

The environment of the setting plays a major role in the cyclist's experience. The terrain of the road is rough and unforgiving – the cyclist's journey is repeatedly hampered by rocks, potholes and jagged edges. The steep incline of the road and the thin mountain air make it difficult for the cyclist to make any considerable progress. The tiring journey is further compounded by the heat of the sun.

The more ominous aspects of the setting are the dangers that the cyclist must face. The cyclist is alone on the road and there are no other cars or cyclists in sight. A recent storm has made the road slippery and the cyclist must take extra caution to prevent any crashes. The cyclist also faces the risk of a wild animal attack, as the surrounding mountain is home to bears and other wild creatures.

The setting of ‘Rough Road Ahead' creates a unique challenge for the cyclist. The rugged terrain, thin mountain air, and potential danger can all make it difficult and exhausting to progress onward. In this way, the setting contributes to the overall tension and suspense of the story as the cyclist struggles to make it to the top of the mountain.
