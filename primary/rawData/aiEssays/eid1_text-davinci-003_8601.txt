I remember the first time I met my now husband and the laughter that ensued. We had a mutual friend, and he had asked her to arrange a double date - the four of us going out for drinks. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was open to it.

What I wasn't prepared for was the instant comfort and familiarity we shared. Our conversations flowed effortlessly, and the laughter seemed to come so easily. It was like we had known each other for years, not just hours. 

The time flew by, and before we knew it, it was time to say goodbye and head home. Walking back to my car, I could feel a connection to this man that I had never experienced before. I knew I had just met someone special, and all that laughter we had shared only served to affirm that feeling. 

Now, five years later, we're still laughing together. That laughter is what I cherish most about our relationship, and I feel so lucky to know that even when life gets tough, we'll always find solace in each other's laughter.
