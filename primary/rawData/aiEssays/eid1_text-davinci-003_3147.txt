Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my opinion on the effects computers have on people. While technology has revolutionized the way we work, learn, and interact with each other, it has brought with it both positive and negative consequences.

On the one hand, computers give us access to so much information, making it easier for us to stay connected and advance our knowledge. We can quickly browse online databases, access files, gather data, and more. That said, computers often keep us from doing the important work of actually engaging with one another in meaningful ways. Fighting to focus in an environment that is ripe with distractions, like the number of apps and social media platforms available, can be a constant challenge. 

I believe it is crucial to find a balance between the amount of time spent engaged on a computer, and in actual human interactions. We can use computers for the benefit of our productivity, but not at the expense of our social lives. 

By attempting to acknowledge the both the pros and cons computers bring, we can create a more positive future for ourselves and our communities. 

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
