One of the most impressive feats of modern architecture must certainly be the Empire State Building. Completed in 1931, the skyscraper was a marvel of engineering for its time. However, one of the most ambitious plans for the building was to incorporate an air dock where dirigibles could land and moor. This idea was originally conceived by General John J. Raskob, an executive of the building’s financial backers, and initially met widespread praise, but quickly met numerous difficulties—from technological and structural to political and legal—that made its eventual completion nearly impossible.

The first obstacle that hindered the mooring mast’s development was technological. A mooring mast was a revolutionary invention; it was a technological advancement because of the inclusion of the double helix steel cable, which could be winched from the top of the mast to the balloon gondola’s anchor lines. This would allow for a greater stability that would reduce the risks posed by the weather and encourage passengers to get out of the gondola and onto the dock above. To make this a reality, engineer Clifford M. Holland designed a docking mast that could be extended to as much as 435 feet. Ultimately, the engineers had to deal with new structural materials and designs, including the use of longhorn cattle hides for the winch cables.

The second obstacle to contend with were the political and legal issues surrounding the mooring mast. The first issue was the fear
