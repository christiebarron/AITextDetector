The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Some of them included an enormous wall of steel that held in place the doors of the Empire State Building and, in time, required its removal. This wall was eventually erected a bit later, however, and was a huge improvement over the unfinished wall of the State Building, which had been in place since at least 1880. In 1904 the project manager recommended the removal of all structures from an old section of the building, although this project was vetoed by the new president of the Council of Building Engineers. The original design was to stand two stories tall, the two-story tower was to stand on two sides. The upper stories were to have a total floor area of 1 1/2 to 3 3/4 of a mile and all stair-lamps were to be on one side of the structure. An 18-inch diameter metal beam and a single-track frame were also needed for a total floor area of 2 2/3 to 3 3/4 of a mile.

A 3.5-story steel-glass facade along both sides of the building, the height of which had decreased with the construction of the state building, was added. By 1909 the top of the first story of a two story building was covered with a
