Dear [Name of Newspaper],

I am writing to express my perspective on the effects computers have on people.

As much as we have seen our lives become easier thanks to the technological advances of computers, I believe there are some negative implications that come along with it. For example, many people are developing computer addiction, which disrupts their daily lives. Especially during the last decade- when the computer industry has seen incredible growth, it has affected mental and physical health in numerous ways. All day sitting in front of the computer, with no breaks included, physically affects our bodies. Strained necks and backs, blurred vision and headaches are some of the many physical issues people face when they are glued to the computer for too long.

Moreover, computers also have an impact on our social lives. Some people become so involved with their computer activities, they lack communication with the outside world. This sedentary lifestyle can stir up severe communication issues, depression and isolation.

Computer addiction has become a worldwide issue that needs more attention. I strongly believe that the government should take initiatives to tackle this problem and help people develop awareness and some control to maintain a healthy balance between computers and other aspects of their lives. 

I hope my words will persuade the readers to agree with me and urge the government to take necessary steps to stop computer addiction in our communities.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
