I snuggled closer to my husband on the couch as we watched our favorite show on TV and the laughter started to flow. We both loved this show, but it was our shared laughter that made it special. 

Every time we watched this show together, it felt like we were nine-year-olds all over again - giddy and excited about jokes that made us howl with laughter. My cheeks started to hurt so much that I had to take a break and grab some ice cream for us. 

My husband placed his hand on my knee and sniggered. I looked up at him, and he had a smirk on his face.

"You know what? I don't think the punch lines are that funny" he said with a mischievous twinkle in his eye.

That was all it took. Before I knew it, he and I were in full fits of uncontrollable laughter, pointing at each other and getting the hiccups. 

We lay there for what felt like forever that night, completely lost in our laughter. I thought to myself how wonderful it was that, after all these years, we could still share a moment like this between us. 

It was then that I knew for sure that laughter really was the shortest distance between two people.
