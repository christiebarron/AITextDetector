Dear Editor,

As technology advances, computers are becoming increasingly ubiquitous, and it's important that we discuss the effects they have on people. To me, the effects of computers are overwhelmingly positive.

For one, computers have connected people all over the world. They allow us to communicate with anyone, anywhere, anytime. We are able to access a wealth of knowledge and information that was previously unavailable. We're better able to keep in touch with distant family and friends, stay up to date on news, and even meet new people.

Computers also increase our productivity. We're able to work smarter, not harder. By automating certain processes, we no longer need to waste precious man-hours on tedious tasks. We can now get things done quicker and more efficiently.

Furthermore, computers are helping us become more creative and innovative. We have access to powerful software and tools that help us visualize and develop ideas. We can use technology to express ourselves in ways not possible before.

In conclusion, I believe computers have overall been beneficial to humanity. By using them, we can become smarter, more creative, and more productive. We can communicate with ease and access a world of knowledge. I hope readers will agree with me and see the immense potential computers bring.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
