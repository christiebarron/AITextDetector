Censoring materials in libraries has long been a controversial debate among citizens, educators, and librarians alike. However, there has been a shift in recent years towards allowing the library to carry a wide range of materials available for the general public - regardless of their content. For the librarians, it is a matter of honoring the right to information - and freedom of expression without censorship. Unfortunately, the problem of potentially offensive materials influencing our society's moral standards has been a reality, and should not be overlooked.

The library should not be viewed as an authority on what is considered offensive, as everyoneâ€™s moral values can differ greatly. However, removing materials found to be offensive is a valid option. A library can carry materials that may contain references to violence, sex, drugs, or religion and still be within ethical and professional guidelines. It is up to the librarians to have the discretion to remove items deemed as truly inappropriate.

In recent years there have been several attempts to censor materials in libraries. This includes book-banning, which is when titles are removed entirely from circulation. Often, these initiatives are sparked by concerned parents of young children who are worried about what kind of material their children will have access to. While censoring library materials is not the solution, there are other options that can be taken. 

Filters can be used on computers that contain access to the Internet. These filters block access to websites with adult content.
