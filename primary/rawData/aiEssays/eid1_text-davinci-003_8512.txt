I was recently helping my mom clean out our garage. It had been a while since any of us had really gone through the stuff stored in there and organize it. For hours, I worked sorting items, throwing away the broken things, and deciding what was still useful. I got frustrated a few times, and my mom could see it. She told me that it was ok to take a break, but I wanted to get everything done as quickly as possible. 

So, I kept going. I worked hard to stay focused and did not give into my urges to be distracted by other things. I kept telling myself that it would be worth it once the garage was clean and organized. After several hours, I had it all sorted out and the feeling of satisfaction was worth it. Patience really paid off for me that day.
