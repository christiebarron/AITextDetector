The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

Building of a "spatty airframe"

Even when the Imperial Building was completed in 20 BBY, it was still heavily damaged by storms. Because of this, only two of the Empire State Buildings were left. In 18 BBY, all three have been replaced and most are in good condition.

In the 20th century, the Empire State Building is the best place to go for a night viewing. However, on a Saturday or Sunday night you can also go for a private view of the Empire State Buildings. There should be private viewing booths and private viewing windows for both the public and Private viewing areas. If you are staying in the Private viewing area, you need to use the private view (not public view) in order to get back to the Empire State Building where you can use each public view.
