Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. You can make it hard to find the right shade, a shade of leafy green in a green environment with its natural setting, or a shade of greenery that makes you feel much easier to ride.


All of the setting is also available in different colours, whether you're looking for a warm colour or just your own.
