I remember the first time I laughed with my best friend like it was yesterday. We were sitting in the same room, our faces only a few feet apart, and we were discussing something that had happened during our day. I was about to talk about my experience when I noticed her eyes start to crinkle as her mouth widened into a huge smile. I couldn't help it; I laughed too.

It started off quiet at first, almost like a snicker, but soon our laughs became louder and fuller. The room filled with the sounds of our cackles, and I can still remember how it made me feel so good to laugh with someone else. It was like we were having a conversation without wordsâ€”we just understood each other in that moment.

That laughter was the beginning of an everlasting friendship. We don't need words to express how we feel, and we share the same kind of humor. To this day, many years later, laughter is still our go-to for any situation we find ourselves in. Whether we're getting through a tough time or just looking for a light-hearted moment, we know laughter will always be there.
