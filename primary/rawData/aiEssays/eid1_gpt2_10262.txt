Computers have many effects on people. Whether it is to improve their health, get healthier. To prevent dementia—particularly with respect to age, weight, gender, and so forth—it is critical not only to get the best of the world but also to have the best in the world. We're getting there with education. But also, we're paying attention to what we already know about these effects. We have more data. What we do know is that changes to the relationship between the physical and emotional, the brain, and the environment are often associated with cognitive decline. What we are seeing in people with Alzheimer's, and especially at the top of the list here, is that if we know of conditions that affect the cognitive function of the brain but don't have a direct link about those things, where we're missing the mark, then we can be more productive and more productive.
