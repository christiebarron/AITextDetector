Computers have many effects on people. As long as we're all just doing whatever feels right to us, they're not going to be different to the other. The only difference is that we'll be at places where we make different choices â€“ where we believe the only difference is our personality in our choice, our outlook. People are going to do anything to get what they want, but they won't stop until they make a difference, and we all have that opportunity."
