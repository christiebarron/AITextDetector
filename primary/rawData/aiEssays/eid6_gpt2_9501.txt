The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. According to a report by the Federal Register, while construction crews in the building on the North Avenue corridor in 2010 and 2011 were permitted to use lasers to beam beams of light without using any human space, pilots were prohibited from using lasers for any more than three minutes, and no one was permitted to use laser-like beams to beam beams outside the building during time zones that considered human activities.

One final obstacle for those who wanted to use "alien" or "alien mediums" was the ability of those spaceships to transmit a laser pointer. According to a 2012 New York Times report, the U.S. government "reported that it had sent more than $100 million worth of radio jamming equipment to military and civilian space space stations" in 2011.

These developments brought the United States into a conflict with France and Great Britain, both in space and in the Middle East and North Africa, that began when the New York Times reported in November of last year that an American and French government officials had negotiated a $6 billion arms deal that, though "limited
