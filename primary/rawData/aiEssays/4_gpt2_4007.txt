The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because:

Hibiscus is an extremely important part of modern physics. I'm not saying physicists don't use Hibiscus, or anyone should use that book for that matter, but it is important to understand that he is not simply my favourite book for physicists, he's one of the very best. In the book's most basic description, Hibiscus explains how particles, when interacting with one another, can create very complex structures using the properties of light to make their way through any physical or chemical barrier.

Which is pretty cool and makes us want to give him a medal. Hibiscus, is he not? But when we read about him having a medal for the world (what do you think, "world of the gatsby") we begin to get concerned that his book may somehow somehow offend his readers with such blatant homophobic and anti-feminist stuff and we wish we could all be the ones who wrote this, and we need to do some actual research, but when it comes to the rest of his writing background, you have to trust you'd think this would have some serious ramifications on our country's values if he did that and not just this.

And I digressâ€¦
