Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

The effect of the setting is what makes a different cyclist feel more comfortable to move through narrow roads (with the exception of traffic jam conditions).

"There are a lot of different types of roads, so people are often more in between them because they are more focused or they're tired," explains Mr. Cottrell.

The cycling community will be more aware of the effect of this setting on cyclists throughout the year, he added.

"French Roux, St. Leger or the whole Dutch mountains will be affected," according to the Cycling UK website, which says: "In all of them we're looking at an overall improvement in overall cycling. For example, the roads that stretch for a mile or so will have a higher risk for crashes, or higher overall crash risks for drivers."

Rough Road Ahead has been a major component of the London Metro and will be operational for the next 30 years. A number of cycling organisations have raised their voices about the importance of having a "bad" setting in the roads and the resulting drop in bicycle crime.

They argue drivers have made it harder to handle dangerous situations that drivers don't understand.

The website says there are some improvements to be made, particularly with bike lanes and cycle routes added in 2014, but still calls for a more rigorous approach to cycling development in recent years.
