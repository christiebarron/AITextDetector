I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is vital to all kinds of innovation. I think it's important that the people of New Zealand are educated in a way to preserve all kinds of important information.

We're not going to go around censoring the contents of our libraries to make it more useful for kids. It's important not to do that.

I think we need to keep an open mind about that. We should not do that. I don't believe that there is any way that this is going to be used in the classroom.

The Australian Greens have spoken out strongly against censorship of online content, and I am disappointed that our Government has not tried to push through a package of new legislation to end those weighted down restrictions.

In short, I was really disappointed by how we were treated at Parliament when that proposal was put out. I'm disappointed that the Government had taken the time to consider a proposal to take them on board. They had hoped to get things done in the first place.

I think the policy is right on the wrong track, but the government is still trying to drive people away from the internet. It's the wrong policy to try and encourage people to get their things online at home, but really it's the opposite â€“ it doesn't make good, and it's actually a waste of time and money.

If that is how it works elsewhere, it will end up costing you hundreds of millions of dollars a year,
