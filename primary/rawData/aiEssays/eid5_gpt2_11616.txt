The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' by N.K. Advani has come to the point where the book's subject matter appears not only contradictory but, for me, extremely harmful.


The title itself makes a pretty big difference (as in "Is it about me?") because of how it has taken these two writers, who both are Indian nationalists, for so long. The entire text is filled with vitriol and lies (as one such reader tweeted in outrage at a recent post by Advani that he had "misnailed one of my favourite books of 2017" and had to give it a go to give the book a review) and so it's surprising that even in the face of such a large and diverse cast of such people (who are very, very much Indian, and still very much in the right mind-set) it becomes so clear to me why the book is so so controversial in the end. You'd think that N.L. Advani would have been aware of this, and the author's attitude towards his own writings has taken his past in the same way, so no, N.L. had no other choice: he had to abandon any hope in having Indian nationalists talk about such things, and then the book would have been picked to have the same kind of negative effect.


I just don't think it is acceptable in general to read a book of this kind like 'From Home' and write a review for
