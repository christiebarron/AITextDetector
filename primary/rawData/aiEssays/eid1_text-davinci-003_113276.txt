Dear Editor, 

I am writing this letter to discuss an important topic: the effects computers have on people. It has become increasingly clear to me that computers are not having a positive effect on people. 

When it comes to computers, it might appear that people have to keep up with the latest technology and have an expensive setup to stay current. This leads to people spending money they don’t have and getting further and further into debt, all just to achieve the “status quo.” 

Computers have also become a distraction for people. With technology becoming available almost everywhere, it can be difficult to focus on one task or remain engaged with the people around you. Social skills are being lost as people become more and more dependent on their computers and phones for communication. 

Furthermore, computers are the leading cause of people’s stress. It is so easy to become overwhelmed with its demands, as tasks that took minutes to do in person can now take hours trying to complete them with a computer and its complicated system. People are now busier than ever, working late nights and weekends trying to complete tasks, leading to exhaustion and anxiousness. 

Overall, I believe that computers are having a detrimental effect on people. I hope I have persuaded you to agree with me on this topic. Thank you for your time and consideration. 

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
