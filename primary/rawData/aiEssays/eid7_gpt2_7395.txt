An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the time when she lost her entire face and my heart to it. When she was 15 she went to the hospital because her parents did not want her to take up surgery at home - her hospital had taken the kids to the local zoo but they couldn't bear to see them there either. Then when she was 18 she felt so sad that she needed a change in clothes and the hospital didn't even tell her when to see the new kids. I had never seen such an amazing girl in a year.


But my kids have been wonderful!

Brought up in a family full of doctors, I was lucky enough to attend an intensive care unit that was so big I could barely fit all 4 babies in it! My parents even moved with me to Florida to start their college years displayed their support and encouragement! My only regret was that they thought I couldn't care more about my kids and not care and my mom was so angry they refused to be supportive. I'm looking forward to going on a few more years where there is no place like home to share my story.

I am very proud of my parents, my kids and my family and want to share our story with others.


The girls in my family have had amazing years. We went from being only 9 in high school at the start of high school to being in the Top 10 in college.

They have taught me this and so far
