Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives paints a vivid picture of the author's journey coming from a migrant family to a successful career as a fashion designer. In the memoir, Rodriquez emphasizes the shared love of family, culture, and education that serve as the common thread for stories of accomplishments, success, and personal resilience.

The mood of the memoir is often bittersweet. Rodriguez recollects his life with a sense of nostalgia, describing his upbringing and upbringing of his relatives with fondness and care. He recalls the hardships his family experienced in migrating to the United States, hoping to provide a better life for themselves but having to face unexpected obstacles along their journey.

The memoir also contains moments of joy, such as when Rodriguez fondly remembers his grandmother Paulette's messages of encouragement and support, or when he climbs the Statue of Liberty for the first time and feels the "ideals of freedom" evoked. Other scenes in the memoir are ones of warmth and acceptance, as Rodriguez' family teaches him “the importance of embracing connection and responsibilities” and “how to love with intention”.

At the same time, the memoir also touches on sorrow and loss. Rodriguez vividly captures the final moments he shared with his mother with poignancy and grace. He paints a picture of a woman that embodied strength and resilience, and whose passing left a huge void in her family's life.
