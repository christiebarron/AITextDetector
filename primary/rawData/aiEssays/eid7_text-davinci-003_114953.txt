I recently had the privilege of witnessing true patience in action. I was at the hardware store with my neighbor, who was trying to pick out paint for her front room. We had already been standing in the aisles for close to an hour, with every color and hue possible having been carefully examined and then discarded. As a single mother with two children to care for, this was obviously proving to be a painstakingly long process.

I knew my neighbor had very little time to spare given her limited schedule, yet she never let her frustration show. Even as she was double checking all the shades of white (for the third time), she did so with a smile. 

Her patience was truly remarkable. She was kind and understanding with the staff at the store, always taking into consideration the fact that they were likely busy juggling many other customers. She even found the time to joke and laugh with them, despite the fact that the hour was slowly draining away.

In the end, I think her patience paid off. We left with the perfect shade of pink and magenta, the perfect color for her daughterâ€™s room. I was so inspired by the experience of her patience and kindness towards the staff that I now try to example her behavior whenever I am in a similar situation.
