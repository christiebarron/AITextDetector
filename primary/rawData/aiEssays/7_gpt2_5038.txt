An example of a time someone in my life was patient was after our divorce where he could not go to the doctor because he needed the help of our baby. But he just kept coming back to us because we are so friendly and nice, and we are so close," Mr Shkreli added.

"This baby's so healthy, and it can take days for us to get to the doctors. The first two days this baby had us and the next two days we got to him and he's really healthy."

It is understood the woman was able to help the other members of the family with the hospital costs of the hospital and the rest of their daycare.
