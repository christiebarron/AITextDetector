Dear Editor, 

As our culture grows more and more reliant on computers and other technologies, I am often asked what effects, if any, this has on the people who make use of it. In my opinion, computers are extremely beneficial to us, provided that we use them appropriately.

Our lives are positively impacted by the use of computers in several notable ways. First, they can help us stay informed and connected with the world around us. With the use of computers, we have access to vast amounts of information, giving us a more comprehensive understanding of current events as well as plenty of opportunities to stay in contact with family and friends. 

Moreover, computers are an invaluable tool when it comes to learning. No longer confined to textbooks, students now have the ability to access textbooks, lecture notes, and other educational materials from the comfort of their own homes. Additionally, computers enable students to benefit from educational websites, interactive simulations, and multimedia activities that can help them uncover new knowledge. 

Finally, computers provide entertainment for us after the work or school day is over. Everything from streaming videos and movies to playing games and visiting online communities can provide welcome diversions after a long day.

All in
