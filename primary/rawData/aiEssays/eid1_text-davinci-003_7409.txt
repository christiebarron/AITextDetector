The author is using the hibiscus as a metaphor for her own life and experiences. The ending shows the narrator's determination to overcome her struggles and adversity. She uses the imagery of the hibiscus's cycle, which includes a dormancy in the winter, to reassure her that she can come back and reattempt the test once the weather gets better: just as the snows will melt and geese will return, she will also be able to persevere through her own struggles. The imagery also reinforces the idea that her story of perseverance is ongoing and cyclical, and that she can keep trying no matter how many times she fails.
