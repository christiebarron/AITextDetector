I will always remember the day I laughed with my grandmother. It was a beautiful summer day and I was out visiting my grandmother for the weekend. Since she was now living in a nursing home, she wasn't as independent as she once was being cared for by the staff. 

We were in the recreation room and she was showing me some of her old photo albums when we saw a photo of a trip she took to the Grand Canyon. As she was talking about how much fun she had, she started laughing and saying, "Oh, it was so much fun! I remember I was so frightened when I was on the edge getting my picture taken!"

I started laughing too, and then she made a joke that was so funny that I almost had tears streaming from my eyes. We shared those few golden moments of belly laughing until we both had tears streaming from our eyes.

It was such a special moment and one that I will cherish forever. It was so special to be able to share that moment with her and to know that she was able to laugh and enjoy life no matter what her age. Laughter really is the best medicine.
