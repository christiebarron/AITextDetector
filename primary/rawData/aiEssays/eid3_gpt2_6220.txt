Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.


When riding on rough roads the cyclist takes a left on a hill, which is usually a straight road. However, the road ahead is actually curved to allow the cyclist to continue their right-hander. These curves tend to be fairly narrow if they are very narrow at the ends.


For instance, if you ride a downhill bike from your corner to your saddle, the angle of the road on your left will also go to the far, flat end of the curve.


This kind of change is also seen in our 'Slop or Bust' setting, where when we adjust the height of the bike before a junction to the angle of the road, the angle of the road in its centre is wider.


This difference in turning is due to a number of factors such as the nature, shape etc of the road. We will also note that there are other factors which can affect the cyclist.
