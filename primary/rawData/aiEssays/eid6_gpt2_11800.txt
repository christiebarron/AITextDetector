The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, it lacked a suitable design, which made docking a challenge. The Empire State Building needed the right materials, and the building's architects had to work with a company in Boston. The idea of a large-scale dirigible would have made it difficult to put into operation. But an American design firm was offering to offer high quality items, and its founders realized that doing business with a firm with an engineering background was better than their traditional business model for designing something for the masses. They hired the company that owned the building, which included an architect and its contractor, to design and build the dirigible. To provide a large-scale, fully functioning dirigible, the company asked the Boston-based company to provide a team of engineers, architects and architects from Boston who were not familiar with building materials and who were familiar with how to program a dirigible. The team of engineers worked hand in hand with one another, and it worked. According to an article published in the Boston Herald, the Dassault Group, known as "Shelter Dynamics," found an alternative to putting a large-scale dirigible onto the building's roof. "After looking at the results," wrote John Sorenson, engineer with S.L.F., who is also an advocate of the construction of dirigible technology, "the team realized it gave the building the best of both worlds," he said.
