The dream of docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building was only realized after many difficult obstacles were overcome. The first obstacle was adequate weather protection. As the building was not designed to support such moorings, significant modifications needed to be made. To provide an appropriate wind break, the revolving doorways that were the main entrances to the building were blocked off, and instead two enclosed steel mooring masts were built. The masts were approximately 150 feet long, and their tops rose to over 800 feet high.

The second obstacle was the need for a strong and stable base for the masts. To accommodate this, a huge steel foundation was created, which was called a slurry wall. This wall was designed to keep the masts in place, even in high winds and rain. The concrete base was mixed with bentonite to help it remain in place against the side of the building, even when subjected to extreme pressures.

The third challenge was one of innovation. The builders of the mooring masts had to come up with a new design that would be able to secure the dirigibles safely, even in severe weather conditions. To achieve this, the masts were designed with pull-down arms connected to cable stays. This meant that when a dirigible approached the mast, the arms were automatically lowered, trapping the dirigible in place. To make sure the airships were secured firmly, the arms were connected to a steel winch that
