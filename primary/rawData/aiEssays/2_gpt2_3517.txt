I believe that censorship of materials in libraries has become a norm in some of our country's communities, to which many students seek to return," she said.

However, critics of the practice point to a study conducted by the US Library Association in 1989 that found that nearly a third of respondents thought censorshipression in libraries was the main cause of illiteracy. And, as the U.N.'s High Commissioner for the Human Rights report into the problem pointed out in its report, "No state has systematically suppressed literature in libraries. However, the extent to which some of the more than 40 states, some municipalities and some states' educational institutions have implemented a variety to censor texts cannot be ruled out."

There's also a significant problem, the report found, with the lack of state control. A new National Library Association policy, on 'censorship as a public right' and related changes in the system – under which a library has to be screened for political leanings – might have pushed over the barriers created by the restrictions. However, the NLA's chairman, Howard Alcorn, also found a more difficult situation in the meantime. He told the news media's "Awards Magazine" that he would be "hopeful" the review would bring out good public understanding on the subject and that "it will help us in any cases to address the issue".
