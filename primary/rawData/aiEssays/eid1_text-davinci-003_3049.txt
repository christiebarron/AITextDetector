Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people.

The introduction of computers has changed the world as we know it. Every sector of society has been impacted by computers; from how we do business, to how we communicate, to how we entertain ourselves. Therefore, computers have the potential to bring both positive and negative impacts on people.

From a positive standpoint, computers have opened up a variety of opportunities. For instance, the amount of information that can be accessed through a few clicks of the keyboard is unparalleled. Furthermore, computers have helped to reduce strain on individuals in the workplace, making it more efficient and cost effective. They also keep children engaged and help to inspire creativity with the numerous online educational tools available.

However, it is important to note the potential negative impacts of computers on people. There is the risk of people becoming too reliant on computers, making personal communication skills suffer in the process. Moreover, children may become addicted to chatting online or gaming which could lead to adverse effects. Finally, too much usage of computers can also have an adverse effect on physical health due to a lack of exercise.

In summary, I believe computers are a great resource but
