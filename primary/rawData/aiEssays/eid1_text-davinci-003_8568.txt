I was at the store the other day picking up a few items when I realized that the line at the till was winding all the way back to the door. I knew this was going to take some time, but I was in no rush so I decided to stay in line. I watched as the lady at the front of the line attempted to pay for her groceries, but her card kept being declined. The cashier had no choice but to try it multiple times, eventually getting through. 

Meanwhile, the other people in line were becoming increasingly agitated. No one wanted to be there, and it showed. The cashier politely apologized, assuring the customer that it happens from time to time. The customer, however, was not so understanding and launched into a tirade.

Despite the irritation of those around me, I decided to stay patient and reminded myself that these things can happen. Thankfully, the customer later apologized to the cashier and moved along. Taking my place, I finally got to the front and was relieved to quickly get through the checkout. It just goes to show that a little patience can go a long way.
