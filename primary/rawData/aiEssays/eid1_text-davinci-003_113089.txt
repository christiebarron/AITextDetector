Dear Editor,

Technology has changed our lives drastically, and it is no surprise that computers play a huge role in this. Today, computers are a part of our everyday lives: from helping us find a job, to managing our finances, and from social networking to researching cures for medical conditions. The effects computers have on people are far-reaching and deserve to be discussed. 

I believe that computers have had a largely positive impact on society. Technology makes our world more interconnected, more informed, more efficient, and more productive. Computers enable us to communicate faster with one another, access useful information quickly, and have more control over our everyday tasks. Computers have allowed for a larger and more efficient workforce in both public and private sectors, and they have created countless new job opportunities. People can now access the world from just about anywhere, and this has sparked an unprecedented surge in productivity.

At the same time, computers have some negative effects on people as well, such as poor posture, eye strain, repetitive motion injuries, and so on. Despite the potential downsides, I believe computers have more benefits than drawbacks. Furthermore, there are steps people can take to mitigate the negative effects of computers, such as taking regular breaks and using tools like blue-light filters or ergonomic keyboards.

In conclusion, computers have changed the way we live and work in many positive ways. There are some potential risks to consider, but the overall benefits outweigh these by
