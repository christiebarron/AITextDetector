One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I heard someone crying "You've been naughty boy!" My dad was also a big fan of 'TwiFlam' and I have a friend who likes to rap, but always kept a pretty low profile.

My cousin had an incident that really upset her. When she fell down onto my lap while I was doing a spin she got really mad and hit me so hard that I ended up with my head knocked out. The next day, she made it clear to me that she has a crush on me and that I should try and get her to change their relationship. She then got mad and threatened me with a knife.

It isn't hard to write a character such as an aloof but caring cousin or girlfriend or even close friends that way because it shows how far they are. You can even make your own characters, like a real girl or your mom or your brother or an older brother. I have seen people get in serious trouble for putting a smile on someone's face without their parents knowing. But at the same time, it has to be remembered that there is a difference between being able to smile and crying. A face is your best way of expressing it. It keeps you calm while you're at it.

I feel for all siblings, friends and even strangers in general who are experiencing negative social interactions because of the way they live. I want them to see that there's meaning in sharing their story
