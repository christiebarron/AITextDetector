I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a fundamental human right, and that this right has been undermined by the state.

In the wake of recent attacks on our First National Library, we have long sought to protect the right of any and all libraries to use all of their resources under their control. The Library for Public Education has long supported this fundamental right by making sure that the materials are in all of its libraries, and that's why we have worked with the National Library Board, to ensure that the rights of libraries lie with people of all ages and abilities and not under the control of government.

Our library system, like any other government system, needs to reflect the interests of all people, not only those with the least resources, but especially those who experience the most negative impact on society. Not just those who are less fortunate than us, but also the people who lack a high level of literacy.

In an effort to build trust by creating Reporters Without Borders' International Press Standards for All, we've already done nearly 900,000 pages of work by our staff and students, and now we are moving to 6,300 books, and that has an impact on the lives of 1.6 million people. These efforts show that we have succeeded despite our greatest efforts.

If you would like to support Reporters Without Borders and our work as we continue to work to create a new and more welcoming system, we suggest you do so by making a donation.
