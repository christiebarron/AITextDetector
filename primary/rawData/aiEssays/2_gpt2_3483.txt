I believe that censorship of materials in libraries will contribute to the problem of censorship, a problem which we as researchers urgently need to resolve," said a statement from the Norwegian Science Foundation, which is helping coordinate Norwegian universities to implement the plan to promote education on the internet.

Earlier this week, the state of Sweden implemented a plan to increase censorship at the hands of the internet operators, allowing them to remove material without a search warrant.

The legislation has been approved by the Swedish parliament, which has already approved the directive.

A similar plan will already be adopted in Norway, which has already added a measure restricting the distribution of pornography, as well as a ban on online pornography, which Victoria Nuland, head of research at Norway's Institute for Public Affairs and the Internet at large, explains.

This is, he said, in line with the country's proposal to change the criminal code to criminal liability in most countries.

"The Swedish law will be considered at present the first national issue of concern," he added. "But it will also be applied very gradually in other parts of the community."

Nuland said more and more countries may find this model challenging because the criminal code, which was passed in 1992, will have to be amended in new cases, similar to the previous legislation, if it is intended to restrict online viewing.
