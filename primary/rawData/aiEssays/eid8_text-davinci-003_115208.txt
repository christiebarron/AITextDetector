I remember the moment we shared our first laugh like it was yesterday. We had been seeing each other for a few weeks at that point, and things were going well. We’d been talking about some mutual friends and suddenly I said something about them being so silly. To my surprise, he laughed. His laughter was contagious and I found myself laughing too. We both laughed so hard that tears started running down our faces, and we fell into an embrace. 

From that moment on, laughter has always been at the core of our relationship. We often joke and tell stories and revel in each other’s company. Even during moments of difficulty or hardship, we’re often able to find moments of light and joy that we can share in. I’m so grateful to have him in my life and have that special bond that allows us to find joy and humor together. There’s nothing better than sharing a great laugh with someone you love.
