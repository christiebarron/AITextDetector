The Empire State Building was an unprecedented engineering feat when it was completed in 1931. At the time of its construction, there was a fascination with dirigibles and the dream of making trans-Atlantic flights a reality. As a result, the builders of the Empire State Building were presented with the ambitious task of constructing a mast which would allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. This proved to be one of the biggest obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced.

The task was certainly not easy. By the time the building was completed, the mast was already rising over the top of the building and stood taller than the Statue of Liberty. To make the task even more difficult, dirigibles could only dock at the mast if the wind speeds were consistent and slow, generally about ten miles per hour or less. This was because strong winds would cause the moving dirigible to become rocked, jerked, and pulled in multiple directions, proving too difficult for the dirigible to maintain control and dock.

However, the mast was made in the shape of a trident which allowed the dirigibles an easy, secure, and stable anchor which allowed dirigibles to easily maneuver into the area. The design used the wind currents tamed by the split shape of the mast, and it also allowed the crew of the dirigible to securely land and remain in place. The mast was also built with a steel cable and an anchor block so that the dir
