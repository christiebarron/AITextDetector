I was shopping at a store the other day when I noticed a customer ahead of me arguing with an employee over a return. The customer had clearly gone beyond store policy, and the employee was struggling to explain it to him in a firm but fair manner. I could tell the customer was getting worked up and was about to reach his breaking point, but I was really impressed by the employee.

He stayed calm and kept explaining the return policy in a gentle and patient way. He never once said anything unkind or raised his voice. I don't know if the customer ever understood or accepted the policy, but I was truly impressed by the way the employee handled the situation. I believe he was the perfect example of how to stay patient with someone in a difficult conversation.
