I was walking through the city the other day and encountered a lot of people who were very busy. I noticed an elderly man walking slowly, struggling to keep up with the pace of the rest of us. I stopped to wait for him, offering him a smile. His face lit up when he saw me and he thanked me for being so patient. He explained that he was trying to get to an appointment that was very important but that he had an injury that prevented him from walking as quickly as he wanted.

I was so moved by his story that I offered to help him get to his appointment. We made small talk and joked while we walked and when we arrived we both hugged before he went in for his appointment. I felt so happy that I could be patient, understanding and kind to someone in need and it made my day.
