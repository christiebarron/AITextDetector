An example of a time someone in my life was patient was with a group of six boys while we were in school. They were the same age as I was. All the boys had a school address and were in a good mood. I saw the boys when I was out walking that I was going around talking to them, and after seeing 'em and the boys when I came out the doors I said, 'They should be more careful and look at you than people think.'

'So I asked their teacher about it and came over from a party the previous afternoon to say, 'I've got to have you down at five to look after them.'"

"So I went to a room in which there was a student group with students and some other students. I asked them what I should do with them. They gave me an old school textbook and started to read it. Then I got a letter, written by a friend with whom I hadn't spoken to the person earlier."

At the time, he wasn't in a relationship but says he was the kind of person who would give something back, especially after "a person who may be a good person" would say, "Oh I can help you with something. If you're lucky, I could help you."

He's received Tura's book from his father, who gave it to him six years ago. "He's an extremely gracious man and has always been willing to help us," Kase
