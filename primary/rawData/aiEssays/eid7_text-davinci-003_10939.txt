I was recently shopping for a new car. It had been a long and complicated process full of meeting with different salespeople and comparing prices between different dealerships. One of the salespeople I dealt with was particularly pushy and tried to persuade me into buying the car for a higher price than what I was willing to pay. I wanted to respond to him with frustration, but I knew that wouldn't get me anywhere. 

So instead I chose patience and remained calm. I reminded myself that the salesperson has an incentive to try and make me pay more, and I kept a clear head as I firmly discussed the lower price I wanted with him. In the end, the salesperson still wouldn't budge but I decided to keep looking and shop around some more before settling on a car. 

Patience was definitely the best approach in this situation and ultimately I got the car for the price I wanted.
