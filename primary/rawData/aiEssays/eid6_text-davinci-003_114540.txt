The construction of the Empire State Building was an impressive feat of engineering that holds true even today. However, as impressive as the structure is, an important part of the buildingâ€™s original design remains largely forgotten among modern memory; the provision of a docking station for large dirigibles. While the potential advantages of such an endeavor are numerous, there were significant obstacles that the builders had to overcome, or at least contend with, in order to make this feature a reality.

The main obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building faced with the docking of dirigibles was the sheer engineering skill required to do so. The task was far from simple, as the massive airships necessitated a sophisticated mooring system to safely hold them in place. This could not simply be a rigid structure, as it would need to be able to adjust itself to the movements of the ship and account for the winds that would affect it. To be truly effective, the mooring mast, as it came to be known, would need to not only solidly secure the airship, it would also need to be capable of soundly contending with prevailing wind and weather conditions.

Before the mooring mast could be built, the engineers involved had to account for the prevailing meteorological conditions of the area to ensure that the mast system would be stable and secure in any and all conditions. Ultimately, the mast design that was constructed was an effective one, constructed with extra strength and
