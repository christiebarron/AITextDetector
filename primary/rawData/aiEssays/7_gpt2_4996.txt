An example of a time someone in my life was patient was for her to call up a call center where a doctor was doing some really strange things, so I couldn't wait to see if she'd been picked up. So, as soon as she'd call up a doctor I was very happy. I had not considered her that well, but I had been pleasantly surprised.

After about a month of being asked I knew who was going to be the next head of pediatric care. I was now really comfortable with the idea of this idea. So I did what any other pediatric surgeon will do, I said: My only question would be, who is going to get the job? I wanted to have a surgeon to answer that question for me - the guy who did the work to get the postgraduate placement in a special subject in clinical medicine. I wanted surgeons that were willing to work with people in their field to do it for me, and I wanted a physician, not just to do this job that a doctor would be willing to do to get it done for me. This was the only thing I had thought about before - not much, but the only thing I had been really surprised of all the candidates. There were those who said, "It's no big deal. It's not very likely." In your opinion, what would've been an extreme degree of risk to give yourself an opportunity like this is to get to know the person you would be so happy to work with?
