 

I remember the first time my best friend and I laughed together like it was yesterday. We had met in a college class, and had seemed to always have a connection even though we were both shy and neither of us knew how to act around one another in public. 

One day we were in the cafeteria grabbing lunch when a tray full of food fell to the ground with a loud crash. We both started to giggle and soon the laughter was contagious. Everyone in the cafeteria was looking at us and started to laugh as well. 

The ice was broken and we finally found our common ground. We became inseparable after that, using laughter to get us through the difficult times and appreciate the good together. Whenever I think of my best friend now, I get a warm feeling in my chest and hear a hearty chuckle ringing in my ears.
