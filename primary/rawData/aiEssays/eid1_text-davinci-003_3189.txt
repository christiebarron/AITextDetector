Dear Editor,

I am writing in response to a recent article about the effects of computers on society. Over the past few decades, technology has evolved dramatically, and it is clear that computers have had an immense impact on our lives.

While there are many positive aspects of this technology - such as unparalleled access to information and a more efficient workplace - I believe that computers can be detrimental as well. Oftentimes, they create distractions that inhibit productivity, as well as considering that physical activity and human interaction are becoming increasingly rare. These are two essential forms of stimulation that all people need to be healthy and functioning citizens in society.

Additionally, computers have caused a fundamental shift in how communication is conducted. Social media is constantly playing a major role in our lives, and this shift has caused us to become increasingly less attuned to in-person conversations. As a result, we are often less mindful and empathetic in our interactions.

From my own experience, I have seen the enormous benefits of computers, but I believe we need to be mindful of their drawbacks to preserve our mental, physical, and interpersonal health. Computers should continue to be a powerful tool, but not one to be over-relied
