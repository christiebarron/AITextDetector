Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

The Cycling Mode

The Cycling Mode is a key part of the cycle ergonomics and is one of the most widely used modes on the road. A cyclist can use either the Bike Friendly mode - which features a large rear circle in the centre and rear wing on the left of the bike - or the Front and Back cycle modes without the large circle to the left.

The new front circle changes the cycling experience very much from the back in the form of a triangle. The triangle is visible along the centre of the bike as it changes colour from orange to blue and thisinces a unique look for riders. A triangle was proposed in order to give cyclists the impression that it was more comfortable on the road and that riders would be able to take advantage of it with their existing riding style.

The Cycling Mode

The Cycling Mode is the cycling version of Cycling Gear which is used only in the US. The bike's design can be tailored to fit any specific riding style. The new front triangle appears as a yellow or blue colour around the edge of the centre of the bike and creates a high level effect.

The Bicycle Mode

The Bicycle Mode is also one of the main reasons why Bike Friendly Mode works with all bike modes. All road modes now have a flat rear circle on the left of the bike as well as a wide front circle with a smaller rear circle
