It was an unsure sort of laughter - the kind of laughter that happens when everything around you looks so dire you can't help but giggle in an effort to get a grip on your own sanity. 

That was the kind of laughter my husband and I shared the night his daughter called to tell us that her car had broken down on a remote stretch of highway outside of town. We didn't know what to do or how to help from so far away, so all we could do was laugh and pray that a friendly trucker would come along and offer her a lift. 

Sure enough, not five minutes later she was able to call us back and report that a semi had stopped to give her a ride. I don't think either of us has ever felt so much relief as we did when we heard that she was safe - and it all came spilling out in an eruption of laughter. 

That incident reminded us both that, in the face of the unknown, laughter can often be the most powerful connection shared between people.
