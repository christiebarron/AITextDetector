The construction of a dirigible-mounted crane on site was seen as unwise and ineffective for the building, and had the potential to significantly reduce the cost for transportation between Manhattan and New York City.

At least three construction sites were also designated for the event's construction to accommodate dirigibles. The first was the West Village Bridge, which will link Brooklyn and Queens along the West River (formerly Hudson's Bay and the River Thames). The bridge will be finished by 2022, but the MTA is asking the public to remain at the site until the site is rebuilt to accommodate dirigibles. A two-story brick arch structure was installed on that building at 1719 E. Broadway, providing a direct link for the dirigible to the Queens Bridge. The second was the East Village Canal-Related Artery and Harbor Building, both located next to the Empire State Building. The third was the South Street Bridge, a span of water used to provide access to membrane-filled parking lots. That building, also named for its namesake structure, was used for two separate vehicular construction projects. The East Village Artery was constructed at 1857 West 34th Avenue, replacing the four-story South Street Bridge. An auxiliary sewer line through the East Village Canal, a bridge over Brooklyn's Hudson Canal from 1866 to 1906 and a separate waterway were completed at 1854 W 44th Street to create a
