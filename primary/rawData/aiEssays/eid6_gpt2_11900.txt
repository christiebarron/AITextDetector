The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

In February 1962, the owners met with representatives of the owners to discuss possible uses of their new building. In turn, they discussed ways they could improve the building's design. At a meeting on Nov 2, 1961, both sides agreed that "there are various ways to incorporate an aircraft into your building from a plane, but they can be very complicated. One of the most important considerations that we discussed was the problem that aviation may need to be carried through our building for a period of time of time." The most significant consideration, they said, was that it involved "a huge amount of manpower." But this needed to be done sooner, not later. The last remaining consideration, they continued, needed to be taken into consideration.

In November 1961, the building was moved to St. Petersburg where the building's architect, Mr. Boren, had been appointed to design a new structure, using the exact same plans as the original as well as new designs being considered for the new buildings. This led to the installation of over 200 aircraft. The new aircraft, while still being constructed with the same exact design, became operational during January 1963. For years the planes were in flight waiting for their flight path back to the Soviet Union in orbit. But the plane went all the way back, down at Yalta and crashed and killed two civilians. A new building was built. In August 1963
