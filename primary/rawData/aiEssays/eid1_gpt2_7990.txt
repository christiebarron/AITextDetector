Computers have many effects on people. We all have a certain predisposition to those effects. And that's going to affect our health, our children's safety and our ability to keep themselves healthy.

"Whether it's the weight or whether our children know how to cook, there's an impact. It affects our physical and mental health and our ability to manage them," he said.

"That's the thing about science is it allows us to sort of predict when a disease is going to appear."

He noted there are ways to study a disease as it develops.

"When in hospital you're waiting for a doctor and you learn about it, you learn something about the disease and how it's likely to develop."

Dr. David Boggs said there are ways to study a disease as it develops, including through DNA analysis and other methods.

"For example, DNA sequencing could change how you think about certain chemicals, their origin and their potential effects or their side-effects and then help predict which ones they'll show up in your body as a cause of chronic diseases," he explained.
