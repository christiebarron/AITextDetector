The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' has created a new spirit. "It has been a feeling of disappointment and disappointment for a long time now, but these days I am proud of the work I have put into it, the people I have worked with in New York, the support I have received and the kind words I have given to New Yorkers and to my fans across the world," he says.

For others, the book is also a tribute to the city's many artists, artists, promoters and makers, who have come to represent the city with passion and creativity â€“ from John Latham, to Chris Van Gelder, to Andy Warhol, to Robert Plant. "When a man's name comes up in a memoir called From Home,' I cannot fathom why anybody would want to be a part of that work. I think the only way you will be truly represented is for many to come forward so that we can celebrate the creative brilliance of a person and have a conversation about why a particular work isn't quite worthy to be recognised as a masterpiece. It was so exciting to write this book. I am so pleased to hear it is finally happening and I am so grateful to be in such a position to do so. I am also so confident in my capacity to speak for the whole NYC community at the moment. I just wish it would be up to me in future to say that as much."
