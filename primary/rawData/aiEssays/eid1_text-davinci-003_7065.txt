The libraries of today are an invaluable educational resource, and they should remain as such. Therefore, it is essential that materials on those shelves remain accessible to all. Censoring the content of the library, whether in the form of books, music, movies, or magazines, deprives citizens of their right to knowledge and education.

 opposing books, music, movies, or magazines that might be seen as offensive can potentially deprive citizens of access to essential cultural materials. Consider the historical significance of some of the books in libraries, which document and celebrate the diverse backgrounds and beliefs of our citizens. Removing or restricting these books from the shelves may prevent people from learning vital information about our cultures, past and present. 

A better solution is for libraries to provide access to materials, while also providing patrons with the tools to make their own informed decisions. Libraries should regulate content, but only to alert patrons to potentially offensive content. It should then be up to the individual to decide whether or not they wish to access those materials. This way, libraries still provide freedom of access while allowing patrons to exercise their own judgment. 

Censoring the shelves of our libraries will have a harmful effect on education and culture. By providing patrons with the information they need to choose appropriate content for themselves, libraries can maintain their role as a source of educational materials without infringing on the rights of citizens to access information.
