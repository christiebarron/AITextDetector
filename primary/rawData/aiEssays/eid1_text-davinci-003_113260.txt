Dear Editor,

I'm writing to express my views on the impact computers have had on our society. By now, it's undeniable the extent computers have transformed our lives for the better; they have become essential tools for communication, education, and business. 

At the same time, however, computers also have an incredibly significant downside. They can cause us to be more socially isolated, lead to dependency problems, and cause physical health issues. Research has found persuasive evidence that these health issues can include eyestrain, poor posture, and a generally sedentary lifestyle. Additionally, prolonged exposure to screens can lead to a lack of concentration, forgetfulness, and difficulty sleeping.

I therefore urge people to understand the potential negative effects computers can have on our lives, and to seek out ways to use their devices in a healthier way. We should take regular breaks away from our screens, use ergonomically designed equipment, and limit our exposure to blue light when using our computers at night.

By being mindful of the risks associated with computers and taking steps to counteract them, we can reap the many benefits of technology without suffering from its drawbacks. 

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
