An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was at the University of Virginia, where we were going to be in a conference about health care for all patients. It became a meeting point, and my experience showed that patients should not assume such a scenario as their own. That was certainly a mistake; I should have known that what my patients did were so great! The real danger to them was that the same things they would have done next, that is, when you go to a hospital where no drugs are being taken, you are also doing something that would be far worse than that that you had done.

The second problem is that we often are just starting out on an adventure that is very very hard. I am writing from the perspective of a very young man who had gone to the University of Connecticut and got treated and had a full time job a few years later. He knew that he had to earn it. My experience was that when you go to a treatment center you see very little. But he is very aware about the treatment. He went to the hospital and met a group of very well-trained people. His first question was asked was could he work on this without insurance? We had just gone to the hospital for four days and had talked to a lot of people, including, as I will say to you, the physicians. They were all very happy about us.

I never got much of a response. I am very proud of
