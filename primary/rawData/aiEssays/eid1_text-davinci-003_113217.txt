To the Editor of the [Newspaper], 

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Computers are an essential part of our lives and have proven to be a great asset, but they can also have a negative impact on our health, emotions, and relationships. 

Research has shown that too much time spent on computers has led to physical health problems such as headaches, eyestrain, and neck and back pain. Additionally, people who spend too much time on the computer may become isolated and depressed. Since communicating through virtual channels can be emotionally detached and unsatisfying, computer addiction can actually damage relationships. 

Although computers are useful tools, we must recognize the potential harm caused by spending excessive amounts of time in front of them. This is particularly important to consider when it comes to children, as their still-developing brains are especially vulnerable to the potential for maladaptive habits that come from using computers too much. 

To me, it is essential to have a sense of balance when it comes to using computers. We should prioritize face-to-face interactions, as well as physical activity, in order to ensure optimal mental and physical health. 

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
