The construction of the Empire State Building presented a unique challenge when it came to planning for airship dockage. The 872 foot skyscraper, begun in 1930 and completed within a year, was to be the largest building of its era and the world’s tallest skyscraper for the next 40 years. Early plans for the building contemplated the incorporation of an airship dock, or mooring mast, as an integral part of its design.

The mooring mast was an idea that would not be easily achieved in over 1350 feet high steel structure. It would require complex calculations, innovative engineering design and rigorous construction processes. The skyscraper presented a structural and environmental challenge, as high wind pressures on the building’s facade necessitated the use of heavier than average materials to create a stabilized platform for mooring airships. Exacerbating these challenges was the use of higher than average steel columns on the building face to support the mooring mast. In addition, the standardized height for mooring airships had to be taken into consideration, adding further complexity.

Despite the obstacles faced, the mooring mast was successfully incorporated within the design of the Empire State Building. The mast was created using essential design techniques, such as the use of specialized steel cables and brackets that could withstand extreme wind speeds. Innovative engineering techniques were put into place to calculate and ensure firm connections between the building’s frame and the mooring mast.
