I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is the duty of government."

Karen Wigdor, public affairs director for the Human Rights Campaign, also expressed disappointment on Twitter at SOPA.

"As we've heard, the House Committee has considered SOPA, including in support of SOPA," she wrote. "There is a good argument to be made that this is a misguided and unnecessary effort to advance one particular group's rights, and that this attempt creates real threats to the rights of individuals, their work, and the communities around them."

Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., who chairs the House Committee on Oversight, Technology and Labor, told the Huffington Post she would not support the bill if it came to consideration.

"The American people do not want that bill to pass in this new Congress," Lofgren said. "We're in a position to make real changes in legislation, and we're working on it right now."
