The author is using the end of the poem to emphasize the idea of renewal and growth. The winter hibiscus continues to grow despite its difficult surroundings and serves as a reminder that with the coming of a new season, hope is around the corner. The poet suggests that the speaker will use that hope to tackle their tests in the coming season when they too will re-emerge stronger than before. It is a reminder of the power of winter and how it will always be followed by a new season of growth and life.
