Once, I was working on a difficult project at work and I was really struggling to get it all done on time. All day, I worked on it but it seemed like I was just getting further and further behind. Around the late afternoon, I felt frustrated and overwhelmed - I knew I had to finish this project in order to please my boss, but things just weren't going my way. 

But then, my boss stopped by my desk and saw how hard I was working. He sat with me and calmly explained the different parts of the project and showed me some strategies on how to complete it. He was so patient, understanding, and encouraging - it really helped me get through it all and finish the project on time. His patience made all the difference in the world.
