The concept of a skyscraper with a mooring mast for dirigibles (airships) was a grand vision when designers first proposed the idea for the Empire State Building. Although the building was built with a mooring mast, the obstacles the builders faced in creating a functional dock proved to be daunting.

When the Empire State Building was initially designed, the idea of docking dirigibles was met with enthusiasm. However, the builders soon realized that if the mooring mast were to be used, certain conditions had to be met. These conditions included an understanding of the way the airships would be moored, the construction of a safe and secure anchoring system, the design of mooring towers that could withstand the strong winds and turbulence of the airships, and the creation of a roof platform strong enough to support the weight of multiple airships.

Additionally, the builders had to develop innovative systems to buoy the mooring mast and slow the airships during the docking process. This was an especially difficult task, as traditional buoys proved to be too unwieldy to use in conjunction with the mooring mast. To address this challenge, the builders developed other devices including an aircraft winch and different types of stabilizing cables.

Furthermore, as larger-sized airships began to be used during the 1930s, the builders had to modify the mooring mast and anchoring system to accommodate the heavier aircraft. Additionally, they
