One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was running away from some guy who punched me. I took a picture with my friends after we ran away and started laughing in front of him. I got really upset because my friend is a pretty nice dude and can talk. It made me start to feel safe.

I love people. Some of the great Optimism & the Unrelenting will leave for one of two scenarios.

My first one is what happened next. The guy took a picture of me on a computer, and wrote a message to my mother. That message was a lot more heartfelt than this. It's like a prayer, and the messages were pretty clear for my mom.

So I emailed her, and she texted to say, I love you. This is really good.

Later that day, she said, I could take a picture with her on a phone. There are some great pictures too, and her mom is happy to take a picture with me.
