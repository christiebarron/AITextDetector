The memoir ‘From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives’ by Narciso Rodriguez has an amazing ability to create a range of moods for the reader. Rodriguez places us in small Cuban towns, introducing us to the people and culture of his life. He delves deep into family history and the family politics, sharing the evolution of his creative identity through intergenerational narrative.

The writing in Rodriguez’s memoir evokes strong feelings of nostalgia and longing. Throughout the book, we experience the joys of childhood and the hardship of a post-revolution life. He describes his youth with vivid imagery that creates a warm and familiar atmosphere. We get a close insight into his Cuban American roots and we can understand how they shaped the man that we know today. On the flip side, he also paints the struggles of migration from a young age and the flight from the horrors of the political situation at that time. It's an intense story and the reader will feel a huge range of emotions.

The paradox of Rodriguez’s story is that although we’re learning about his origins, there is a deep sense of belonging, resilience, and joy. We’re presented with a complex and inspiring story about the construction of identity through the connection to his Cuban home and his newfound home in the US. As he journeyed from one place to the other, he tells us about rebuilding of family ties and rekindling of bond.
