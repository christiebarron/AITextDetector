An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the time she was taken to hospital by an ambulance. In a long line of similar situations, we were asked "What do you think you're going to do to do it better on the road?". The first question that stood out to me was "How can I save myself?", and I am sure you know where to go with that. To make it clear, the whole thing is self saving. The "take some action" philosophy that's become associated with survival skills is certainly very relevant to this.

But on top of that, your self esteem may be at an all time low, and you have an idea how other people feel in the face of this situation. What's the best, most personal option that you can think of?

Yes, the best option that I can think of. I don't want to think of trying to get you to do what you don't want or not doing what you don't want and failing to think of someone else doing it. I would say that if there is someone you have respect for, trust in them, and that there is no way for them to take that away from you. The only thing you have to do is make sure that they don't do it, and that they have a backup plan that will hopefully bring them back.
