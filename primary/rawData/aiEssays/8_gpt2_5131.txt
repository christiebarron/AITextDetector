One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I watched comedian and comedian Jeff Gordon talk about his family. Jeff said, "It's a great situation to be in. My son is like a brother, and even we share the same age so everything just comes together." Then it became a love and family situation, especially if he found joy in his life.

Now that Jeff Gordon is retiring after 30 years in comedy it's easy to imagine him as what comedians and comedians would call an authentic version of the "normal man or woman." With the advent of live-action TV and social media people need to see their comedy career, as we see it, as authentic as there is to any of us.

With that being said, as you can imagine there are a few important steps that a comedian is required to take to truly become authentic to the way he has always been seen over his career.

First, he must be open enough. This can often be done outside of live-action television or social media for the majority of comedians or as a starting point for a young comedian looking to get started.

Second, the comedian must be willing to let go of his fears, resentments and fears and accept reality instead of pretending to care about how anyone actually works.

Lastly, even the most introspective one may be too afraid to speak up or even act out, even if that will only add to the already hurtful feelings that he feels at times
