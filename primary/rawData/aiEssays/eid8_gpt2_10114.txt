One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was thirteen, so I started watching my peers work in the playground. I loved watching adults do what they are taught to do, but sometimes it just comes over me.

"Why don't they want to go to classes with us? They need to be on their knees and give us a good reason for that." â€•Jango Fett to Aiden Pearce [src]

Though it was rare in most cultures other than in the New World, the Academy and the academy are a large group of wealthy people. There are three different types of wealthy persons on this world, each of whom are wealthy as well as working and well-educated, and all have powerful people they use to their advantage. The more wealthy, the more powerful the others, and those who were well educated at the time are the most powerful. Despite the fact that the Academy was in the process of founding its own school, they continued to follow and learn, and when the two were able to do so in the past, they came to think as if their goals were the same.

In the future, people from the Academy will have their own school if one or more of the three academies becomes successful in their new school.
