I recently had an experience where I really had to put my patience to the test. I was at the supermarket the other day, trying to get my weekly groceries. I had a few items in my hands and was queuing up to pay when I heard the manager call out for a member of staff to help operate the till. Everyone waited for 10 minutes, when a staff member finally arrived. 

We were all relieved, but when the cashier started to process our purchases it became apparent that they had very little idea about how to actually work the till. All of us in the queue were getting very frustrated, but I made a conscious effort to remain patient. Even though I wanted to snap and tell the person to hurry up, I forced myself to remain calm and tried to make conversation with those around me.

In the end, it took the cashier nearly 25 minutes to process all our orders - much longer than usual. While I was a little annoyed by this, I reminded myself that it was not the cashier's fault and I was proud of myself for being patient and understanding in a situation which could have been very negative and confrontational.
