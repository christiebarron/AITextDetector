I was once working at a grocery store when a customer snapped at me for not knowing where an item was located. She began hurling insults my way, and I could feel my temper starting to boil. I slowly took a deep breath and calmly asked her to tell me what she was looking for. I thought to myself that it was not worth responding to her in an angry way, or stooping down to her level.

After a few minutes, I politely offered to help her find the item she was searching for. She thanked me for my patience and was able to leave the store in a much better mood. Even though the customer had treated me terribly, I knew it was best if I remained calm and patient. It taught me that patience and understanding can go a long way in difficult situations.
