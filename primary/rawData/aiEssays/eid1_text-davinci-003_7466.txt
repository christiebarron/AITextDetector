The author chooses to end the poem with this line to give the reader hope and to express the narrator's will to keep persevering. Winter can be a difficult time, especially during difficult times, and the idea of the spring and all that comes with it -- the snows melting, the geese returning, and the hibiscus budding -- indicates that it's not the end. Rather, it's a new beginning and a time to try again. The narrator is suggesting that they will take the test again when the spring comes, symbolizing a renewed determination not to give up.
