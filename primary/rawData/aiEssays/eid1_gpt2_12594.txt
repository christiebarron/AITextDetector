I have seen this in action in many countries and still find the idea of computer programming completely impractical or non-existent. But when you have all these things in mind, one of the things we cannot do is just be as sure as possible that any of the technologies we consider beneficial are still available."

The original goal was to create computer hardware for businesses, but since many of these companies never applied for patent licenses in their initial weeks of launching, that resulted in many companies being sued by their inventors, particularly companies who developed some "computer products" and then went on to invent many more.

In the early 1990s, after computer hardware market share had fallen, the patent office realized that it would be much easier for the US Patent and Trademark Office to win patents for the exact same thing, and some of the original patents were then awarded under similar patents at some point. But of course such a decision would not have created many patents, but instead created huge costs, at a time when many firms were losing thousands of their employees based on these new patent awards.

Fortunately, while the original problem is still on the surface of an old design and current technology, many things have worked
