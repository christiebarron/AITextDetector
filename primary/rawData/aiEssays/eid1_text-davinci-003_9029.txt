 

Dear [Editor],

I am writing to voice my strong opinion on the effects computers have had on people’s lives. The potential of computers is enormous and a great part of modern life, but it needs to be used carefully.

The power of computing is now so widespread that it has become part of almost all aspects of our lives. Computers can help us to become more efficient and productive, but in many cases, they are being used to the detriment of society. For example, people are over-dependant on technology and machines. They are not as reliant on their own creative thinking and problem-solving skills as they used to be. This is threatening our ability to think for ourselves and to develop our own solutions to life’s challenges. 

Moreover, computers provide people with the false notion of security and, in some cases, can lead to isolation. Many people are not aware of the potential dangers that computers can pose. They can be used for identity theft, fraud and cyber-bullying, to name a few. 

Nonetheless, computers should be embraced and used to their fullest potential. We should use them as tools to help enhance our lives and make them more productive and efficient. We should use computers to learn, to understand, to expand our knowledge, and to communicate. We should also be mindful of the potential drawbacks of using computers, so we can use them responsibly and protect our personal information.
