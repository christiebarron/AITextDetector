The ending of Winter Hibiscus serves to emphasize the idea of coming full circle. All of the plant and animal life that changes with the seasonal cycle remind the protagonist of her own movements, from the trials of middle school to the hopeful beginnings of a new year. The final line symbolizes the resolution of her journey: she knows that with every passing of winter, life and hope will be restored, and she will have the chance to make a fresh start. Eventually, the protagonist will be ready to try again and take the test she failed at the start of the story.
