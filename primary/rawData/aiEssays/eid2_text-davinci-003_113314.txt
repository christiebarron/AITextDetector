The proliferation of censorship in libraries is an interesting topic worthy of discussion. While the removal of objectionable literature and materials from library shelves is understandable to some extent, library patrons should never be deprived of access to works that offer a range of intellectual diversity and insight.

Censorship of books and other library materials should be considered on a case-by-case basis. For example, books containing content that may be seen as offensive to racial or gender groups may have certain chapters removed or altered, but the library should retain the book’s original format for its patrons. This approach allows the library to make adjustments to provide patrons with access to material that is responsible and respectful of a wide range of cultures and beliefs, and while still protecting the patron’s rights to read freely and make up their own minds on controversial topics.

Censorship also needs to be weighed in the context of different age groups. Books or materials may contain content that should be restricted from children, but not necessarily from adults. Libraries should endeavor to provide literature and other media with content and language appropriate to different age groups while allowing adults to access uncensored information that may be deemed inappropriate for those under 18.

In summary, libraries should not be indiscriminately censored, but rather utilize measures that allow patrons of all ages to access content that is appropriate and thought-provoking while still affording them the right to make the final decision with respect to what they would or would not like to
