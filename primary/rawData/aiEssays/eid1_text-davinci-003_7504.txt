Ho ends the poem this way to emphasize the cycle of nature and the process of seasonal rejuvenation. It implies that, just as the hibiscus blooms each year with the arrival of spring, the speaker will also persevere and have the opportunity to retake the test and ultimately be successful. The idea of hope in the face of adversity is an important theme of the poem, and Ho's ending allows this message to be encapsulated within the circularity of the natural world.
