Computers have many effects on people. They are the foundation of all kinds of creative endeavors, many of which are based on the ability of our minds to generate ideas or ideas of a kind. Those brain cells, known as the synapses, where knowledge is stored have not only power to organize ideas, but also act as centers of thought. But it does not only control how thoughts are stored. Their functioning can also affect human consciousness, a field within which there is ongoing debate. According to many scientists, the synapse is one of the most significant elements of the brain. Recent advances in neuroscience and aging, which have led to advances in cellular and molecular treatments for aging, allow us to study the brain's connection with the environment and to determine what the brain can do. The synapse plays a pivotal role in our daily lives, one which is to be expected as we age. We call it the "neurons" in our brains, which are the central nervous system neurons. The synapse, considered the leading visual system in humans, functions to regulate and control the perception of external things. There, these structures are thought to have fundamental functions. The synapse is one of two main brain-control systems in each of us; for instance, when we speak, we use the synapse to tell the motor cortex, one of the neural circuits responsible for thinking, that we want to speak. This has led to a plethora of new studies that use imaging techniques and other techniques to
