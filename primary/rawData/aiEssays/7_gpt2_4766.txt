An example of a time someone in my life was patient was that time an acquaintance with whom I did not like. In a situation of crisis of interest or uncertainty, I had to make decisions.

What changed my mind? Is this about the nature of my life and the fact that life is so unpredictable and so complex?

My life may be such a strange place that it's hard to explain. It doesn't make sense, and the answer, of course, may be a lot simpler.

What do you make of the argument that we ought, by virtue of our unique abilities, to go out of our comfort zone and move, because it makes no sense to go out and choose to live in a world which seems, to me, almost like its own. And why am I so fascinated by this situation? Because why would I want to live in a world that seems almost like its own, in which the possibility for doing good, in which something was lost, was so clearly lost? What we have, I think, is a unique ability of one person, myself, to enter in a situation of life of great urgency, great power and importance. If I chose to go out my comfort zone, I was no longer one that could do great things for any people. The man has come and will stand before me and will stand in my way for a long time. That decision may or may not be mine.

What do you mean by this?
