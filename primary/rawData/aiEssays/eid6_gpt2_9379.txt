The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They relied mostly on the old British practice of using wood as the primary material and then using paper to assemble the concrete blocks, in which case they had to rework and replace parts of the original wooden columns or concrete floors. For some time, wooden furniture remained the same, but it was difficult for the builders of the towers to distinguish new wooden columns from older ones saves time and effort. So the builder who moved to New York to build on the Empire State buildings needed to bring the existing columns along by hand; other builders, on the other hand, preferred to use hand-rolled wood.

Most of the tall buildings of the Empire State also included small flat-screen theaters called domes, which were constructed with cardboard veneers on each side of the frames to prevent a large portion of the projection windows from being completely exposed. This technique allowed the theater director to get a picture to illustrate his work before the work was delivered, thereby encouraging the director to build the theater in what some called "the best possible way." (To help ease the problem of building large tall edifices with no overhead seating, in the 1880s, architects in New York erected two large square domes called the Eiffel Tower and the East Village at the center of their buildings; the Eiffel towers were built just blocks apart.) Other tall buildings were built with stone in their original form, such as
