The memoir 'From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives' by Narciso Rodriguez is an insightful exploration of the importance of roots, home, and family. Through Rodrigo's reflections, it is possible to discover a mood of nostalgia and appreciation. 

Rodrigo reflects deeply on how his experiences as a child in Cuba informed the fabric of his creative identity, and he expresses immense gratitude for the people and places that shaped his worldview. His memories of Havana are full of innocence and romanticism, and his sentimentality creates a warm ambience that invites readers to draw lessons from his experiences.

Rodrigo also looks fondly on his own roots and his heritage. Plus, he emphasizes that no matter the place or the culture, our humanity has the potential for profound connection and understanding.
