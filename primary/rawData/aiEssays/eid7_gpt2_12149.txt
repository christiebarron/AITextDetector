An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I stopped crying, in January. A few months later I was diagnosed with chronic lung failure. My parents divorced and the two of them left me alone. A few weeks ago I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. It was a very bad case of asthma. I spent 15 years feeling like a failure due to asthma, then my dad called home to find me suffering and said I couldn't breathe. I didn't know what to do. They took my brother to my doctor but he didn't do much at all. I was very lucky. It took three years and three surgeries to finally understand that for some people they're not alone. I still suffer from asthma but sometimes it takes a while. Sometimes I just look at myself in the mirror and think, "What the hell was that?" But, sometimes it will be what makes me happy."
