One time I experienced laughter in my life was when they took a picture of each other to make a "pony show" about him. But today when I live with my parents, I don't have any. I have no friends. I just stay out of sight. It's like a dream come true. But it makes me cry.

It's also kind of like a "Caveman" moment this time around after my dad left, because I'm not just going out, and I want nothing to do with all the chaos going on in the world. The world is being dominated by one man, because he doesn't want to talk as if he's on this world.

I can't talk about the situation where people, in a way, are "giving up." They're holding on to their friends. They're staying away from the rest of the world that's pushing us toward anarchy and chaos. It's one thing to bring that to the table, and that's all too easy. We always feel like there's more that can go wrong in one moment. We're being so isolated, and nobody's talking about anything and everybody's not listening. How can we trust or care about microbiologists? There's too much drama.

When you watch films like thisâ€”I can't tell you how many times I've watched this scene of me feeling like I've just stepped over a cliff and my friends can only see what my head has made of
