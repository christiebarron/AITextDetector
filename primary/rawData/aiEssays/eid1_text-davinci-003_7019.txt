In today's day and age, censorship in libraries has become an increasingly debated topic, with multiple sides of the conversation coming together to exchange their respective viewpoints. One of these points of view is that any materials that are deemed inappropriate or offensive to certain groups of people should be immediately removed from library shelves. People who support this viewpoint normally outline a case citing the potential harm that these materials could cause, and the importance of containing these materials from children.

However, there are several points to be considered in this debate that must be taken into account when making a decision. Firstly, censoring materials in the library should be done in a method that takes into account the right to have access to such materials for those who desire it. There is the potential for such measures to seriously limit the access to information about historical and cultural developments for those who wish to investigate them. As such, bans must be used as a last measure, only applicable to those materials found to be especially offensive or inappropriate in comparison to others. 

Removing materials that are deemed offensive from library shelves should not be considered as an all-encompassing solution. Libraries should instead focus on providing access to alternative educational materials in order to supplement those materials that are censored. In other words, libraries should offer materials that provide different viewpoints from the ones that were found to be controversial in order to properly educate readers. Not only does this ensure that the public maintains access to such information, but also gives them a broader perspective
