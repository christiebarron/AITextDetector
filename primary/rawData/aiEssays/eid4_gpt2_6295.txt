The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because this is a really strong book and I really like the way each chapter comes together. I think most of this chapter is focused on the love story and love story between Ria and Ria's sister. It's that very romantic element as well. This is a pretty good book which is going to stand out and really get picked up by critics. We hope you love it and don't hesitate to buy it!

Chapter 10: "The Blackbird, the Sunless, the Sunbearers." "The Sunless, the Sunbearers"

It's been a while since I read the story, so this one really shines this first read. It starts out lighthearted through Ria, who is really enjoying this chapter.

This is a nice twist of sorts chapter. Ria is very much about revenge. I guess this is something that you would find out more from the book, but I feel like it's more in relation to the protagonist and her reaction, so maybe it's just how Ria seems to get along, but Ria is feeling pretty strong. Ria is not quite as bad as Ria was in A Song of Ice and Fire, but she is still a bit more stubborn than she was in Serenity and the Red Dragon Saga and it really feels like it would have stayed in A Dance with Dragons.

I would say at least it
