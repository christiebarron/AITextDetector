Dear Editor, 

As we enter a new era of technology, I find myself particularly concerned with the effects of computers on people. Computers play a significant role in our modern lives, providing us with tremendous educational, economic and technological benefits.

However, it is undeniable that computers can also have a negative impact on human development. Too much time spent in front of a computer can lead to physical health issues such as obesity and headaches. It can also lead to mental health issues such as addiction to video games, isolation and depression.

Nevertheless, the benefits of computers greatly outweigh the drawbacks. Not only do computers help us stay connected to the global community, they also provide us with invaluable educational and career opportunities. Computers also offer us greater job flexibility and enable us to work remotely from anywhere.

Ultimately, computers are an instrumental part of our lives, both personally and professionally. Let us all strive to use computers in a responsible and healthy manner so that we can reap the maximum benefits from them. 

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
