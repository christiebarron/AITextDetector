One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I asked my best friend to show me him a card from the movie "Invisible Man," that he couldn't take because he was too shy to be seen.

At about this time, my partner was working on the script for the film and having been diagnosed with stage 4 diabetes. I had never been diagnosed with stage 4 diabetes by my doctors, but that didn't sound like a big deal. And yet, when we said goodbye, I found myself staring at my phone, crying. It felt so good.
