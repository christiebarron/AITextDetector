The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' was not the same as it seemed at first: he spoke quietly and told nothing except to lie when needed, even when it was obvious he was going to.

'The last time I ever went out in that condition was when I came for work. I didn't lie to anybody. When I went out it was in desperation and the only explanation was my own desperation. I would say the last time I came back in this condition is when I was working in a hotel room. It is more than a normal situation.

'One day, there was an ambulance coming to the hotel and after a few minutes there was a woman holding out a sign asking if Mrs Pendergrass was going to go. She then started screaming back, 'Oh! I hear a dog barking!'

She went to the fire escape where she was taken to a vet and a doctor. At that point I knew I was going to have a difficult life.

'When she got out of the hospital I was left there and there was a lot screaming and I couldn't hear anything when I had to call for help.'
