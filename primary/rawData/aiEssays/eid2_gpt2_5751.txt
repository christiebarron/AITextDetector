I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a matter of fairness and justice. Libraries ought to be open to all, not just those who disagree with their viewpoints.

Let those responsible for our online system be held accountable for any misdeeds. That should not stop the people who are violating copyright in the least."

Crown prosecutor Stephen Smith said he could not speak at that hearing, as he was charged with defamation over the Facebook News article.

Smith released a statement in support of his client and said he could not comment further due to the ongoing investigation over the Facebook comments.

"As far as I can understand it I was wrongly charged last week with defamation and if you read from your statement you can read it right here. I would be the first person to comment further on the matter," Smith said.

In an amended statement, Crown attorney Christopher Biddle expressed his concern at Smith's statement saying that he was disappointed with "the uncharacteristic and irresponsible statement of the trial court from the defendant's side", saying it had been "out of context".

"I've spoken my mind on this matters, I think I have to admit here, my views have not always been well supported by some of the facts. If people think I'm trying to 'prove' my point I'm absolutely right. I have been quite clear how critical that is," Biddle said.

The Crown said in the statement it could not comment further
