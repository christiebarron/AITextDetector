Dear Editor,

I am writing to voice my opinion on the effects of computers on individuals and to persuade readers to consider this controversial issue. Computers have become a widely accepted part of our lives. With advances in technology, they have become more embedded in our everyday lives, from the workplace to our home. However, with this comes a great concern, as their use can have a major influence on our daily decision-making.

The introduction of computers has had a major impact on how humans interact with each other. As many tasks are now done through technology, face-to-face communication has decreased significantly. This can have a damaging effect on interpersonal relationships as people are less likely to interact with each other in a meaningful way. This can lead to a disconnect in how we communicate and relate with one another.

It is also important to consider the effects that computers have on mental health. Overuse of computers can cause mental health issues such as stress, anxiety, and depression. This is because of the constant stimuli that is presented by computers, which can be difficult to cope with. Social media in particular can cause people to become obsessed with scrolling through their feeds, leading to a never-ending cycle of comparison.
