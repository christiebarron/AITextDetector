The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had to take steps to create safe transportation for dirigibles. An earlier version of the A-10, known as the Cessna 172 SkyStar, had been designed as a replacement for a much larger Cessna 172. (In 1997, FAA spokesman Brian Wetherly said the lack of a suitable replacement was because "the airplane is more sophisticated." But he added that the 172 had "a good performance.")

Despite concerns that the craft could become too dangerous to fly, the A-10 is safe and ready to fly: "Dueling is extremely safe in the United States at the most recent FAA performance review. The A-10 was designed on the basis that the vehicle can be powered up, and we do not believe that has been achieved."

In 2007, the FAA revised the A-10's performance rules (see page 39, below) to account for changes in technology.

On January 24th 2008, NASA engineers working on a new unmanned aircraft were asked to test the A-10's performance after the first half of a test in September 2008. The A-10 received positive feedback from both the aircrew and the FAA, the team was told, but it failed five times to meet its targets. "The problem was the test result was
