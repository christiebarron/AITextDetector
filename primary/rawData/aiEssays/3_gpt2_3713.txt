Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. Here I'll talk a bit about how these settings affect the cycle way to go and give a little insight on how I use them.

I'll use a few basic settings with CyclingTips.org to set up my initial route:

The first setting is the setting 'Rough Road Ahead'. It shows the time spent on routes. This is the time spent where someone does very little cycling. It allows the cyclist to control the pace, control speed, and more, when on longer routes; a very basic method of running, without going crazy on hills or flat roads. It also allows the cyclist to be more engaged when the cycle is shorter or the route isn't so flat. It also allows the cyclist to look at the number of people and choose their best route. It shows the time invested in the day or night, where they can't go without something nice or good to say about it. It shows how they put in time on your bike, which includes how many miles you've done, speed and what kind of things like bikes they have made. It shows how far you've ridden during the day (the time you have on the bike!), how much time you've taken to walk or do yoga. It shows how easily somebody will want to put in a short time for an activity when it's just a short walk away. It shows how your favourite cycling route will take you
