The author uses the metaphor of the winter hibiscus blossoming at the end of the story to suggest that there is hope in the coming season. Winter can be a difficult time, but the author encourages the reader to take heart knowing that spring will come and the bud of the hibiscus will blossom, much like the protagonist has the chance to take the test again in the future. The imagery of the winter hibiscus embodies the idea of resilience and suggests that while difficult times may come, with determination and a positive attitude, anything is possible.
