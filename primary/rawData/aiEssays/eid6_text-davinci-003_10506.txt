The construction of the Empire State Building was an unparalleled feat of engineering, one that prompted the ambition to develop the worldâ€™s first airship docking station. Although the idea seemed achievable in theory, during its construction in 1931, the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges in allowing dirigibles to dock in the air above Manhattan. 

One of the major obstacles to developing a docking station for airships was the considerable height of the building. At 1,250 feet in height, much of the building was out of reach of the airships and far too unstable to attach a mooring mast. 

The second obstacle was wind. Dirigibles relied on still air to remain stationary in the sky, however, due to its extreme height and close proximity to the harbour wind was an issue that could not be avoided. To overcome this, engineers installed an anemometer on the roof of the building, which allowed them to measure the wind speed and subsequently adjust locations.

The third challenge lay in the difficulty of attaching the mooring ropes to the mast. Due to the considerable height of the mast, engineers had to use heavy materials such as metal for the mooring ropes to ensure that their attachment would be secure. As a result of its weight, the need for counter-balancing was also essential to stop the mast from swaying in the wind.

The fourth and final obstacle was the logistics of hauling the airship up to the
