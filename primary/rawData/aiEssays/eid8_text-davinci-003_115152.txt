It was the first time I had ever met my husband’s parents. We had been dating for a few months and the time had come for us to meet. I was a little nervous, but my husband was as calm as could be.

His parents were gracious and kind, and it didn’t take me long to feel comfortable with them. We chatted for a bit, catching up on each others lives, and swapping stories. At one point, the conversation got surprisingly serious, and I could sense my husband getting a bit uncomfortable.

That’s when his dad turned to me and asked “Do you think you can make him laugh?” I was taken aback, and I looked over at my husband. With a mischievous grin, he challenged me to do it.

I thought for a moment, and then remembered my husband’s sense of humor. I gave him a sly look, and blurted out an absurdly exaggerated version of a story that had happened only a few days before. I had expected polite laughter, but his parents erupted in hysterics.

In the middle of their laughter, I saw my husband’s face light up and he laughed harder than I’d ever seen. They all enjoyed the moment, and in that moment, I think I knew that we were all going to get along just fine.
