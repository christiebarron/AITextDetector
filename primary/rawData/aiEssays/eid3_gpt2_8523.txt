Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. They are generally as follows:

• Speed and comfort

• Performance. What speed you think you want.

• Balance. How you want to live your life.

• Performance. Is it hard riding or having a good time?

• Distance and location. How long to get there

• Road safety and safety on the go.

Although the setting is simple and does not affect the rider in rough distance there are certain important things to consider before you choose.

What is the difference between a typical cycling performance setting and a hard ride?

A standard riding performance will vary from person to person. In some areas, cycling performance may just be the most noticeable. But, the setting you're choosing should be well below or equal to that performance. A few other settings might be more common.

Some riders prefer the 'unpleasant' setting and will put a lot to work and spend a lot of time riding under the curve. Often, the setting will just mean you need more riding to finish well. You need to take it the extra mile and it'll look different.

If you're in the 'easy to hit' category then the setting, or more specifically, the 'cheap but easy ride' setting should be in such a way as to not allow any type of speed or comfort to affect your ride.
