Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people in todayâ€™s world. From my perspective, computers have made life simpler and more efficient in a number of ways, allowing us access to infinite knowledge and resources. 

However, I think there is a dark side to modern computer usage. With increased availability of digital devices, people have become too dependent on computers for the smallest of tasks. People are known to stare at their screens for long hours, slowly disconnecting from the real world.

Moreover, an overuse of screens has its own long-term impacts on physical and mental health. Staring at a screen for long hours can lead to neck and back pain, head and joint aches, poor eyesight, and reduced concentration span. Mental health implications, such as depression, anxiety and addictive behaviours, can also stem from overuse of computers and digital devices.

I strongly believe that computers can do wonders when used in moderation. We need to regulate our own usage and provide proper guidance to our young generations regarding the proper application of computers. Every citizen needs to understand the importance of taking regular breaks, exercising and taking part in real life interactions.

Thank you for taking the time to consider my opinion.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
