The Empire State Building was completed in 1931, at the height of the airship craze in America. It was always designed to allow dirigibles to dock - a feature that was seen as a great engineering feat of the time. However, despite the ambitious vision for the Empire State Building, the builders faced a number of obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. 

The first obstacle was related to the design of the mooring mast. The mooring mast, which was to anchor the dirigibles, required a unique design. It needed to rest securely on the 102nd floor and stay stable during windy conditions. Because of the limited space, the mast had to be engineered to be lightweight and strong. The builders also had to take into account that the mast had to be bendable so that it would not be damaged if the dirigible pulled too hard on the cables. 

The second obstacle was related to the limits of the engineering technology at the time. The engineers had to design and build a complex system to secure the dirigible and ensure it stayed in place. This system included cables that were attached to the roof and run down the tower into the waiting room on the 80th floor. These cables were designed to be strong enough to withstand high winds, yet flexible enough to let the airship pull away from the mast without causing any damage.

The third obstacle had to do with the public's response to the idea of dirig
