An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a woman who came to my clinic. And she was trying to find her husband and had to walk to the clinic and she had a really bad case of what I could not fix and then decided to call me up, and, well... she was so late to work, but she came, she came, she made so much money, and she called me up and he had her a year ago and he came, and now he doesn't even know how to get her the money to help her, and she says, okay, you need a loan on your car, I'm so sorry, but we have to do this, and you need to take your car out of the dealership right now, so we need to take out a loan on your car first, so I can fix her. We'll get your car fixed and we will refund you for the money. My life is better now.

When people talk about changing the insurance policy, how do you get them to change their policy? It's really hard, because you're trying to make a change.

Yes. The first and really important thing is to be honest, make a change, which is you need to know why. And you need to know the reason because you know, this is something that is going on in your lives, but you don't really know. And people try to sell insurance or you know the reason I told you all this
