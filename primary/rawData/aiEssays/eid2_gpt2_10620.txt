I believe that censorship of materials in libraries and archives, or access of the Internet to personal and critical information, is a violation of our First Amendment rights."

In the end, Tewell dismissed the charge, saying the ACLU "never argued the importance of the First Amendment right to free speech in his case." But they still want it dismissed because Tewell said his goal was to make library patrons "feel safer or be able to say exactly what they want to hear with dignity."

"Our argument is that the government's decision-making process has made it clear that it is in the public interest for the Department of Justice to ensure and keep the rights of library patrons safe and to make sure that information on our libraries cannot be disclosed," Tewell said. "We agree with Judge Tewell that he should have said more eloquently."

The ACLU said it is not challenging Tewell's decision so long as it was made in a closed-door proceeding and he had a strong and transparent message to his viewers.

"The administration's argument does nothing to address the needs of individuals trying to read their constitutionally protected books because it is not a factual analysis," said Jeff Blount, the legal director for Public Knowledge Publishing. "The only question is why it might cause so much harm in the first place."
