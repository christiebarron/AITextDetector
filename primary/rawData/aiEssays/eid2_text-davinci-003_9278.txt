Censorship in libraries is an emotional and difficult topic, and one which has been fiercely debated for years. On one side of the debate are those who believe that certain material should be removed from library shelves if it is found to be offensive or inappropriate. On the other side are those who staunchly defend the idea of allowing access to all materials, no matter what subject matter they contain.

I believe that when it comes to censorship in libraries, the answer is not a simple one. Depending on the age and maturity level of the library's patrons, librarians should be allowed to determine what should and should not be on their shelves. While children and young readers should be shielded from books, movies, and music with distasteful or dangerous content, adults should have access to any material they choose.

The best solution for library censorship is to label or identify materials that are potentially offensive. By giving parents and patrons the opportunity to make informed decisions about their own or their children's reading material, libraries can make sure everyone feels comfortable. As long as there is adequate warning of the content, patrons can decide if the book, movie, or album is within their comfort level.

Rather than ban certain material altogether, libraries should take the approach of working with patrons to identify potentially controversial material. This will allow everyone access to the material they seek, while also making sure that potentially offensive material is clearly identified and that library patrons can make informed decisions.
