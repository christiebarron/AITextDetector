I'm standing in the kitchen, stirring a pot of pasta, when I hear a contagious chuckle coming from the living room. I know that sound, I can recognize it like it's my own -- it's my husband's laugh. It's a sound I so rarely hear these days since he started a new job, so I smile to myself, happy that he is finding something so amusing.

I sneak into the living room to find out what's making him laugh so hard. I find him perched on the edge of the sofa with his laptop open, watching a comedy special on Netflix. 

My husband looks up and sees me and starts to laugh even harder. I join him and together we sit and belly laugh until my sides ache.

The moment feels like a thread connecting us; the holes of distance and stress filled in with laughter. Nothing else feels quite like it and it's the glue keeping us together. 

No matter how hard things get in the future, I'll always remember that moment spent together in laughter. It's a reminder of how healing and important it is to just have a good laugh with those you love.
