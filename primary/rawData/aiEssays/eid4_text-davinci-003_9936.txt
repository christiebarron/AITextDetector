Minfong Ho ends the poem with this line to emphasize the idea of resilience and perseverance. Winter Hibiscus is about a girl's anger and frustration towards school and her own sense of inadequacy in academics. With the line, Minfong Ho suggests that this girl is undeterred by her struggles and failures and will continue to strive and try her best. This is reflected in the image of the winter hibiscus, which continues to blossom despite the harsh winter chill. Through this, Minfong Ho conveys the message that even in the harshness of winter there can still be hope and beauty.
