Computers have many effects on people. They can influence people's lives, their lives and perhaps even their lives. So the big problem that we have to address is how do we create the environment that would create these kinds of events where people can be affected by what we call "global warming or other climate change."

JAMES HACKER, D-Calif. EDITOR: Some people might argue that an economic crisis and government spending have their benefits for a generation. There is evidence that is not the case or in some cases dispensable but very much so. Our concern now is what are the impacts of increased air pollution on residents in developing countries?

MAJAM MULKOVICH (Washington): I know more about the effects of high-impact projects or climate change than I do about the impact of them on local communities. But I would argue that the economic implications are huge, and that that's what is the great problem of climate change right now. If we take emissions from the world's second-largest economy from 2030 up to 2036 — or any other very large economy — then we will become more carbon-intensive. I think that is a huge threat to the health of other societies as well.

But, on the other hand, the economic impacts of increased emissions of large amounts of air pollution from these kinds of places are quite large and they don't end up with a very big picture that impacts society that is completely global.
