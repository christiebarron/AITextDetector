Dear Editor,

In today’s ever more connected world, the impact that computers have on our lives is undeniable. Computers provide us with unprecedented access to information and allow us to accomplish tasks quickly and efficiently. However, while computers certainly do have a positive impact on our lives, there are also potential negative implications for the people who use them.

The foremost concern is that computers can lead to mental health issues due to an excessive use. People may find themselves addicted to technology, resulting in them spending an unreasonable amount of time online or playing video games. This can lead to an unhealthy amount of screen time, which can lead to increased stress, anxiety, and depression. Additionally, engaging in activities through a device can lead to a disconnection between people, leading to social isolation and difficulty forming meaningful relationships.

Additionally, computers can lead to physical health issues as well. People who spend too much time in front of their computer screens may suffer from a lack of physical activity, and even more serious health problems such as obesity, poor eyesight, and headaches.

For these reasons, it is important for us to find a balance between the use of technology and living active, healthy lives. Parents should monitor their children’s screen time to ensure that they remain safe and healthy. It is also important to encourage physical activity by limiting the amount of time children, and adults, spend online.

I hope this letter has made you consider the potential effects
