I was on a work trip to London with my colleague and best friend Steve. We had been working all day and were both exhausted. As we walked to the train station to go back to our hotel, Steve started to make jokes about London. For a few minutes I couldn't help but laugh at his silly observations and silly voices, until eventually I had to stop myself so I didn't miss my train.

Once on the train, I noticed a couple sitting opposite us. We had all been talking the whole ride, and Steve had been telling them about our experience in London. Suddenly the couple started to laugh uncontrollably at one of Steve's jokes. We were all laughing so hard, it felt like the train had become a different place.

We chatted the whole way back to the hotel and parted ways with the couple at the door. They wished us well and Steve and I waved goodbye with a huge grin on our faces. It was the perfect ending to an exhausting but wonderful day in London. Laughter truly had made a connection between us and these strangers, and I will never forget that moment.
