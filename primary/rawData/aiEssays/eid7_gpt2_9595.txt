An example of a time someone in my life was patient was someone who was looking for a job. He was on Medicaid, he'd put his wife and newborn daughter on Medicare. Because of the low income, he felt very comfortable. And in spite of that, he stayed in jobs and he left.

This story is about something I had heard from, and it can't be true. Not a single year after they had to go to work for a full year, he worked for someone who had Medicare. And that person said he didn't deserve to be there, and they told him they'd paid for a plan. So he went straight to work for this person. It went downhill over that period. Then he got a job, got kicked out. He had to go back to his old job, so he went home to see his family again.

Then he left, and I was in the hospital the whole time. There were always people in the staff and everybody was at the same job. Even though this guy wasn't going to become an administrative staffer in her field who'd done a bit of work as a nurse at home, he made the biggest impact on me. He's a big influence in this state of Alabama.

But I'm saying this about you because I know your story. And I've heard you mention other stories. So now, please let me tell you what your mom actually did for you when you moved to America last year (laughter
