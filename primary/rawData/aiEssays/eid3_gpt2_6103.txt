Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. The most important component is the number of people who can ride or bike with 'Rough Road Ahead'. In order to make this choice a cyclist has to look at its effects on their ability to keep their head above air. How many people can bike with the best of all possible worlds? How many people can bike in such a large cycling population? How many people can bike in countries that have laws for the type of cycling that is permitted in the first place?

The 'Rough Road Ahead' system also relates to how cyclists do physical and mental activity. When one person walks past a certain location and a new one steps away from him, the current cycle will likely be at a faster rate because it is expected that more people will be passing by and passing by without any physical movement, without the need for physical interaction and as such can feel more comfortable while commuting.

In a new study published by the Science of Cycling at Cambridge, University of Cambridge, PhD student Paul Wiedemann and colleague, Murtaza Kuznetsov, calculated the number of people cycling each day on average with a standardised 'round average' cycling rate (Table 1). During round average cycling rates decreased in areas with higher 'Rough Road Ahead' cycling rates for each of the cycling characteristics of the group (such as level of comfort and speed), but these changes were only present on the round
