The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' was inspired by her growing friendship with actress Amy Winehouse ("She just looked really cool with her shoes on"), and her sense of humor.

"I loved watching her play the 'Game of Thrones' and getting her to have conversations with her characters over and over," she said. "Every time she played in that game I thoughtâ€¦that's what I needed to have for my first book."

In a statement, the novelist said she'd worked with Winehouse on the book since they were teenagers and she hopes the book follows their development. "I am incredibly grateful for her efforts and her generosity," the statement reads.

Williams is a "fan favorite of many and I have written several of her works. I'll miss our book," and that's something she would continue to have in a memoir, she said. "But the one person's life that makes me smile the most is her. She's the only person I will ever need to look back on and thank for all the work she did."
