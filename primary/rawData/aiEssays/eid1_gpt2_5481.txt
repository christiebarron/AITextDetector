Computers have many effects on people. The most prominent may be to cause brain health problems, heart problems and diabetes, and have even been linked to cancer.


But what if a computer were to help them to better control their daily energy use, as their physical bodies would evolve, in large part by improving in-built energy? The researchers could make computers out of various parts of neurons (or fibres) of neurons as well as cells. This could have far-reaching implications for the way the brain actually functions as opposed to an electronic system or a more computerlike computer based on circuitry. Some neurons have much better electrical signals compared to others, which means an electronic system could also be used for brain research.


This could be why some computers, like the IBM Neuron computer, were developed as tools for exploring quantum particles. Instead of simply computing, they built computers so they could test electrical properties, so they could help us understand what's going on in our brains with the help of a simple system of simple cells. The new version of this algorithm will also allow people to generate energy and calculate energy values more accurately, thus avoiding expensive lab procedures and error that many people face with energy monitors.
