One time I was visiting a new doctor who had never seen me before. I was feeling anxious because I was afraid of how the appointment was going to go. To my surprise, she was incredibly patient and understanding. She was willing to take the time to listen to all of my concerns and make sure her treatment plan was tailored to my needs. She asked a lot of questions and answered all of the ones I had. Even when I asked the same question several times because I was nervous, she was never short with me or gave me any indication that she was frustrated. At the end of my appointment, I was incredibly grateful for the level of care she provided and her patience.
