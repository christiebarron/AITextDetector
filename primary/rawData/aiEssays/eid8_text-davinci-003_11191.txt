I recently experienced one of the most special moments of my life that made me realize how laughter can be the perfect way to bond with someone. It was my first date with my now-boyfriend. Though I had been anxious for days beforehand, once we were seated and started talking, everything felt comfortable and natural. 

He made me laugh right away with his dry wit and we quickly found ourselves talking about everything and nothing for hours. The conversation was so light and easy that I felt like I had known him for years. I was in my element and relaxed, enjoying the moment and laughing at everything he said. 

We stayed out late and the evening ended with us laughing until our stomachs hurt. To this day, when I look back on that night, I can't help but smile as I remember how laughter was able to bring us even closer together.
