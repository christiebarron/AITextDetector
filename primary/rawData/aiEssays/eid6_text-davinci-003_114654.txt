The Empire State Building was an awe-inspiring project and a testament to human capability – but no project comes without its challenges. One such challenge facing the builders of the Empire State was making the building suitable for the anchorage of dirigibles- better known as airships. The prospects of the building as an airship pier were really only explored when Albert Lambert, a well-known Swedish inventor, approached Malcolm Delehanty, the project manager of the Empire State Building with an innovative idea of allowing the airships to dock on the observation deck. This ambitious idea led the builders of the Empire State Building into uncharted waters, and the challenges that faced the project were immense.

The first issue was the lack of a reliable means of anchoring these large airships. The large and rigid structures available for mooring masts were not suitable. Lambert proposed the technological solution of installing heavy-duty mooring cables, but this had never been done before and required an immense amount of investment, engineering and precision to get it right. Not only did this prove to be a financial precarious project that the builders had to undertake, but it drastically changed the scope of the building itself – a change that the builders weren't entirely comfortable with.

The second issue was the observatory deck itself. The observation deck made for bad anchoring grounds and was ill-suited to the regular arrival and departure of airships. The floor of the observation deck had to be reinforced
