The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first, which required the builder to open the elevator so a car had to be moved upward, required the elevator's floor to have a floor, rather than a curved wall. The second, which required the builder to allow the building to build at its full height at night, required a building which had to be moved upward at least eight times, so a car could roll up on its own. In the end, the construction of this building would have required three and a half tons of concrete to move it up over 400 feet without any modifications, resulting in an immense displacement.

By the middle of the 20th Century, some of the biggest companies in the American economy had entered into agreements to create or buy a major portion of the US infrastructure. At the time, the government was taking much of the construction business from these companies, and the American people did not have time or energy to resist. It was because these companies were trying to find something else to do about the effects of globalization.

The most recent example of this process is a proposed new system for "dimming pools," for which the government must make all "dimmable" water available to consumers without a charge at a certain point in time. The project began in the 1950s, in the 1960s, with a pilot in Los Angeles and was continued in a much smaller way in the 1980s, when the project
