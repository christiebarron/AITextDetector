One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I saw her sitting on a table with another member of my family and laughing in her face. I don't think she meant 'choking my brain out, she's always laughing') but in my mind we are doing something very nice to let each other relax and feel better. I can only imagine her eyes, that spark and smile and smile so much in the back of my head.
If you are wondering why we keep on laughing we are because of how great it is to feel great and to feel great.
And when we were younger we lived with our parents for long stretches of time every Sunday night and as she is getting older we had fun as her laughter became a source of joy for us, and we feel very blessed to have her.
The other little details can sometimes feel good as you get older and the longer you live with your parents the more you can relax
We have been happy to have such a great family and we love having them around for such a long time. disaster.com.pr
