I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a human right that should be respected. I would like to find out whether government can even do that. If it did, it would mean the establishment of a central intelligence control organization (CIA, FBI, Homeland Security). That's a great goal, I'm sure, but it never meant anything else.


This is just my personal opinion, of course. The only way to enforce it is with government authority with public funds to do so. The fact doesn't mean that censorship is illegal, right? This is just the latest example of how people are getting used to this system of totalitarianism. So, we got to go to China today. We will probably do it well. What's the best way to get government to stop censorship? The best way to get it not to be allowed. (Applause)


Now, the point may be that China is a very different place today, to the place in 1820, or to the very founding of the United States, the days that were spent fighting the French Revolution. But China became a much more peaceful state in the nineteenth century. It was really just about democracy and freedom and equality and equality. Now I wonder what will happen to this right after that? I'm not sure. This is my personal opinion. The only way to enforce it will be with government authority with public funds to do so. The fact doesn't mean that censorship is illegal, right?
