 

I remember a time where I had to be patient. It was the summer before my freshman year of high school and I had really wanted to go to a music festival with my friends. My parents had always been strict about where I could go and what I could do, so I wasn't sure what I could do. I mustered up the courage to ask if I could go but they said no without even thinking about it. 

At first I was really frustrated and felt like I had been treated unfairly, but I knew arguing wouldn't do anything. So instead, I turned the situation into a conversation and asked my parents why they said no. After a few minutes of conversation, they asked if I would be willing to work extra hard on my studies and in the community for the next few weeks if I could go. 

I thought it was a fair agreement and agreed to their terms and conditions. I worked really hard for the next few weeks and was able to make my parents proud. With my successful efforts, I earned my way to the music festival and was able to enjoy a great weekend with my friends. 

Despite my initial frustration, I was able to be patient and understand my parents' concerns. Not only did I have a great time, I also learned a valuable lesson about being patient and understanding of others.
