I believe that censorship of materials in libraries might have made an effort to preserve this information. By the right to information, we believe there is a common interest between a library and public interest.

The copyright regime is also at play, for example by allowing the preservation of information about research done on a particular subject by providing specific rules or procedures for it and an independent assessment of the effectiveness of the information provided. This may sometimes be useful in some instances. The library might have relied on information found to be unavailable without informing our readers; some of the information could have been shared at a time when it was less accessible.

Of course this is not to say that only public libraries don't make the choice between freedom of information and security. The public should take issue with copyright regime and should consider what it means in practice. The information available to us is available for public use without restriction that makes that public interest a public interest.
