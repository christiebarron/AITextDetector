The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because the reader is drawn into this in the early part of winter, just as the narrator begins the story. While the reader has no choice but to follow Mr. Hibiscus, the character and narrator do choose to follow him. He does this for him, in a very limited and difficult manner, and it is his decision to make the best choices which keeps the author from being too easily distracted. One of the things I have learned from the book is that when you read a short story, the story becomes complex enough, and the reader gets to interact with the character. When you hear a story that you know well, you feel that the story is a very good start. I don't consider myself a fan of the story at this point, but I wouldn't mind it if the reader was in a different position at the same time. The character, he is not in that position right now. In fact, most people would rather leave that up to the author and not go with that. One of my favorite elements in reading winter is how much this book leaves the reader to engage with the characters and the relationships within and between them in a very natural way. This book is not a fairy tale, a fairy tale, a fairy tale, a fairy tale. Like I said, its story is that novel, the characters are there to be engaged with each other and to engage in the stories. That book is the book itself.
