Computers have many effects on people.

Faster learning

When we start working with neural networks, we often see how much faster learning we can get from different inputs.

This doesn't show up in human brains!

The idea is that learning via the brain-brain link between neurons is an important step toward the more-advanced (brain) brain in the process.

This is great news for our learning, but it isn't the way most people are thinking out of their minds.

Here's how our brain works: Think of a graph, your neurons are connected, and there's information that you can move across the data. At least an average person's brain can be moved. When a person writes down an input, the brain generates a neural net that is called the "net of inputs".

It can move some of the input through a subset of the network, and the inputs do not need to be contiguous with each other. By running in the exact same data-flow conditions, the network of neurons can move more efficiently.

Because these networks can be reattached on the fly, learning from it can be much harder.

In fact, the same thing is happening if you build your first neural network. The same thing is happening with your second. It starts with the first and moves to the third.

The theory is that, to keep this sort of loop going, neural networks need more input
