Censorship in libraries is a contentious topic that is often debated within the confines of society. It is a belief that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are deemed to be offensive in some way. While this may be seen as highly moral and responsible, it is my belief that this practice of censorship in libraries should be stopped immediately. 

The primary argument in favor of censorship in libraries is that it will minimize the number of objectionable and morally questionable sources of information the public can access. However, this argument fails to acknowledge the fact that eliminating access to certain materials deprives individuals of their right to exercise freedom of expression and knowledge. It is essential that citizens of a democracy have access to material, including offensive materials, so that they can become educated and informed on a variety of topics and issues. Banning certain texts is an act of censorship that can greatly limit the scope of public opinion and knowledge, especially when the person responsible for determining what material is offensive or unacceptable is biased or ignorant.

Banning materials from libraries can also preclude individuals from understanding certain aspects of life which they may not have experienced firsthand. For instance, an individual may not be fully aware of the struggles of those in the LGBTQ community, or the struggles of other minority groups, without access to the books and films outlining the plight of these communities. It is important that individuals develop an understanding and appreciation for all people â€“ not just those whose backgrounds they may have experienced or heard about. By
