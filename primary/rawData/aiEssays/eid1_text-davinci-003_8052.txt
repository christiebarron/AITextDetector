The construction of the building had many obstacles, but perhaps none greater than the challenge of allowing dirigibles to dock there.

When the Empire State Building was being constructed, the idea of using dirigibles for transportation was growing in popularity and there were plans to have the building serve as the terminus of these airships. The main problem that the builders had to face was the need for a mooring mast where dirigibles could dock and offload or load passengers and cargo.

The idea of erecting a mooring mast on the Empire State Building took a great amount of planning and engineering. With all the available space on the roof of the building, there was an obvious concern that a mast could not only be unsafe but also unsightly in the skyline of New York City. In addition, the mooring mast needed to be strong enough to handle the stress of mooring a large dirigible without any damage to the building or putting passers by in danger.

The engineers of the Empire State Building took on the challenge of designing a mooring mast that would fit the requirements. The result was the 'Mooring Mast.' Made of steel and rising 420 feet above the roof, this mast, managed to merge both safety and aesthetics. The designers
