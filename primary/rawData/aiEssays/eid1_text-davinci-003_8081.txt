The builders of the Empire State Building faced a unique set of obstacles when attempting to make the iconic building dockable for dirigibles in 1931. The prominent engineering feat was a period of trial and error as the engineers tried to make their lofty ambitions a reality.

The first challenge was simply the unprecedented nature of the idea. Though ballooning and air travel had become more prevalent in the early twentieth century, the idea of docking a dirigible to the top of the Empire State Building was a novel concept. This made the task of designing the mooring mast, a necessary piece of equipment for the task, awe-inducing. 

To make the project more difficult, there was an incredibly short timeline. Chief engineer, Ralph Walker, was given only three weeks to design the mast for the opening of the Empire State Building, a daunting task considering its potential effect on the entire world. Ideally, the mast had to be very sturdy yet also lightweight, something that had never been achieved before. Undaunted, Walker and his team built a 77-foot mast made of duralumin, a lightweight alloy used primarily for airplane manufacturing. 

The fourth challenge was that the Empire State Building ran into significant problems in the permitting process. Though the FAA, as well as the city and state, approved the request, General Hugh A. Drum, the commanding general of the U.S. Army had the authority to overrule the decision. While the president, Herbert Hoover,
