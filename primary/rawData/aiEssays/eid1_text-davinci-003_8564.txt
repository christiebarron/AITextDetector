I recently had to wait in line for over two hours to apply for a job. At first, I thought it was going to be a long and arduous experience, but surprisingly I found that I was able to keep my cool. I made sure that I stayed upbeat, said hi to the people around me, and even shared jokes with them to help pass the time.

I soon found out that it wasn't that bad and that it was actually quite enjoyable given the long wait. I made several new friends and acquaintances, which was a welcomed surprise. Everyone was so incredibly patient and nice that it really helped the time pass by very quickly. Seeing the people around me handle the situation so graciously definitely helped keep me patient and calm.

After two hours of waiting, I finally made it to the front of the line and was able to successfully apply for the job. I felt grateful that I had the patience and the strength to wait that long and still keep my positive attitude intact. Being patient is one of the hardest things to do, but I reminded myself that often times good things come to those who wait.
