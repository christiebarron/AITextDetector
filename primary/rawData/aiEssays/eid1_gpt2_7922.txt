Computers have many effects on people.

A group of professors are investigating whether machines that would otherwise have to perform some kind of computations in order to perform some sort of intelligence task have a cognitive advantage over computers, as researchers have suggested is possible.

Using functional programming theory of intelligence, researchers have found that machines are more sensitive to cognitive advantages in an effort to improve their ability to help us comprehend and express complex emotions.

This finding echoes what is described as a strong cognitive advantage in many other areas of our species. A group of University of Pennsylvania researchers found that humans are more capable than machines to do complex tasks in many of the other areas of our evolutionary history.

This difference lies in what researchers called the ability of a person called N to use his or her "memorial capacity" to improve his or her intelligence. N's memory capacity is also the capacity to think in a new way, allowing him or her to recall more information from the past than he or she currently needs.

"You can do a lot of things without memory because you have an unlimited amount of neurons in your brain," says study co-author Jason C. Gildas, a postdoctoral fellow in the Center for Computational Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley. "If we have the right level of intelligence, how do we respond to that?"

In addition to recognizing the value of this ability, researchers suggest more specific and more powerful technologies we are using
