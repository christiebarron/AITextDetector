I'll never forget the first time my wife and I had a good laugh together. She had just moved in with me and things were a bit awkward as we tried to get used to living together.

One night, we were watching a movie when I made a joke about one of the characters. It was for sure an awful and corny joke, but my wife started laughing hysterically. I couldn't help but join in and soon we were laughing together on the couch.

It felt like all our awkwardness melted away and, for the first time, it felt like we were really a real couple. We lay there for what felt like hours and couldn't stop laughing.

Whenever things seem tense between us or we're feeling uncertain about the future, we can always turn to that moment and break the tension with laughter. Even after all these years, I can still hear the sound of us laughing together, and it reminds me of how far we've come.
