I remember the first time I was really tested on my patience. I was in a grocery store with my two kids. The store was relatively crowded and the lines at checkout were very long. To make matters worse, both my kids were cranky and fighting with each other. I was starting to get flustered, as I wanted to get out of the store as soon as possible, but I knew that screaming at them was not the route to take.

So I took a deep breath and held my tongue. I tried my best to ignore the noise they were making and instead I focused on being calm and understanding. I spoke to them both in a gentle voice and reminded them that we were all feeling frustrated, but that didnâ€™t mean we had to get angry.

My patience was tested, but eventually my kids calmed down and apologized to each other. We managed to get through the check out and get our grocery shopping done. I was proud of my ability to remain patient under the circumstances and it has been a lesson that I carry with me to this day.
