I had just had a long day at work and I was feeling exhausted and overwhelmed. I was trying to make it home in time to make dinner but the traffic was unbearable. I was trying to stay calm and patient, but I could feel my frustration building. Suddenly, my tire blew out and I had to pull over to the side of the road. I could feel my temper rising, but I took a deep breath and tried to remain patient.

I called the auto club and they told me someone would arrive in about an hour. I knew I was not going to make it home in time for dinner, so I just decided to try and relax. I took a few deep breaths and listened to some music to help keep my patience. When the tow truck driver finally arrived, I thanked him for coming and was beyond grateful for his help. I was so relieved that he was able to quickly get me back on the road. 

In the end, I was able to make it home an hour later than expected, but I was proud of myself for keeping my cool and staying patient despite the circumstances.
