The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. There were some problems, such as low building quality in Europe; some were built to make space for the Empire State Building but some simply did not meet the requirements of the building codes.

Curious about the designs, the architects also made plans for a new class of dirigibles, the E-Venture. They proposed a combination of a winged or single-engine, electric-driven dirigibles with double engines. These could be mounted on the roof to facilitate movement of troops or cargo and could use the side-wall to protect against incoming fire. A single engine can be mounted on the roof to allow for a more agile maneuvering of the pilot or, in the case of the E-Venture, it could be mounted on the roof for movement or protection at low speeds. A second engine could be installed for maneuverability but the idea of dual-engine is no longer in the works and the E-Venture project has attracted considerable interest.

"My main problem of the E-Venture was not the layout and technology," says David DeYounger of Los Angeles-based architecture firm Energy Architects. NAFTA is a collaborative effort between the United States and Spain, and an element of a major new development has been proposed to take advantage of this potential for economic and political development.

The E-Venture has generated many new business opportunities in Europe
