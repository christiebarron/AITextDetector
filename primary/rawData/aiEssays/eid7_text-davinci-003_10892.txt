I recently had the privilege of meeting an elderly woman named Mrs. Baker. She was an old-fashioned type of person, and when I first met her I asked her a lot of questions. She was initially a bit wary of me, but I didn't want to push her away and I was determined to get to know her.

So, I decided to be patient with her. I gave her time to respond, and patiently answered all her questions. I could tell that she was uncomfortable but I was determined to show her that I was sincere in my desire to get to know her better.

After a few weeks, our conversations began to become more relaxed. I realized that Mrs. Baker was actually a very intelligent, warm-hearted and witty person. We began to talk about things that we had in common and to exchange stories. She gradually opened up to me and eventually even invited me over for tea and cake.

Mrs. Baker was very thankful to me for being patient and understanding with her. Without that patience, I don't think we would have had the great friendship that we did. Thankful for that experience, I now strive to be patient in all my interactions.
