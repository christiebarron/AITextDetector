Recent debates around censorship in libraries have raised a question worth consideration: Should certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Libraries have traditionally been known as places of learning and education, and consequently, the notion of censorship can seem counterintuitive. However, libraries also have the responsibility to serve their local community, and the materials they offer must reflect the needs and values of that community. 

In this regard, it is understandable why certain books, movies, and magazines could be pulled from library shelves if their content is found to be offensive. Take a movie such as Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction for example; while it may contain artistic value, it is nevertheless extremely violent and not suitable for viewing by those who are considered too sensitive or are too young to understand its content. It is therefore beneficial to give library patrons, young and old, the right to choose which movies they would like to watch in an environment that is respectful.

However, censorship should only be imposed when extreme cases present themselves. Generally speaking, libraries should support and promote open access to knowledge and information, and should avoid censorship wherever possible. After all, one of the fundamental elements of democracy is the ability to access different ideas and perspectives. Therefore, libraries should serve as a platform to hold authors and filmmakers to account for their works and encourage healthy conversation about differing viewpoints.

All in all, censorship in libraries should be administered
