Dear Editor,

The rise of computers has been both a blessing and a curse, especially in the realm of human relationships. If used responsibly, computers can be a powerful tool for connecting people, preserving memories, forming communities, and spreading knowledge. Unfortunately, too often people rely heavily on devices to do these tasks for them, substituting casual conversation, physical contact, or even common courtesy with text, Google search, and AI.

Ideally, computers should act as a way to supplement human contact and facilitate further exploration, rather than replace it altogether. For example, technological advances in communication platforms like Skype and Zoom have allowed friends and families to stay in contact over long distances. However, such progress should not excuse digital isolation from the people around us.

A generation of young people who are unable to engage in meaningful dialogue or connection with one another might be headed for a total disconnect from the world outside of the digital realm, and that's a frightening prospect. With decreased ability to understand each other's perspectives and express themselves openly, meaningful conversations are being pushed further and further away. 

We can prevent this disconnect by actively engaging with one another in both the physical and the digital realms, and recognizing that technology is something to be used with communication and caution.

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
