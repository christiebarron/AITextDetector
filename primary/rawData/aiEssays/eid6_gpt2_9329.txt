The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One was a requirement that the airplane must be operated in close proximity to the building in order to prevent damage to the propellers. The other cost was that a pilot must hold the aircraft down at his assigned speed.

The designers then decided that "flying in direct contact with the groundâ€¦might be the most effective way for a pilot to engage a propeller, and thus the most efficient way."

The second hurdle that engineers took away was a large quantity of oil. It took 10 minutes to run and, by contrast, the airplane would take a total of 23 hours to reassemble and fire its engine through hydraulic cables.

At the time, the engineers were frustrated.

"Our original intent was to fly for 30-plus miles, but when we had to change the engine every five minutes or so in order to get a plane up and running, we felt that it wasn't worth the effort, so they basically gave us the engine. We had an engineer on the ground with us looking at the plane and thinking: 'Oh no, we're not going to work on it and give it half a dozen hours.' He wouldn't say anything, then the next day he'd say something like 'Let's do this tomorrow!' We weren't worried about it being any kind of fun for pilots because we knew we could fly all over the world in two minutes."
