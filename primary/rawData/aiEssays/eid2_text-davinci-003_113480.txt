Censorship in libraries has been a debated issue for decades. The American Library Association promotes the idea that all library users should have access to all materials of interest, including potentially controversial ones. However, some argue that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. 

On one hand, it is understandable that libraries should screen and remove books and materials that are harmful, such as extremist political materials that may incite hate or violence, child pornography, and other types of content deemed inappropriate. This is to ensure that all library patrons, including children, have access to safe, age-appropriate material that can enlighten and educate, instead of potentially harmful content.

On the other hand, censorship of books and other materials based on personal opinions is a slippery slope. One person's opinion of what constitutes offensive or harmful material may be different from another's. Additionally, censoring books and other materials on the basis of opinion quickly takes away the fundamental freedom of thought and expression that libraries should be protecting. 

Furthermore, books, music, movies, and magazines that are found to be offensive can be a great resource for candid conversations about topics such as racism, sexism, and discrimination, and should not be automatically censored. Instead of removing those materials, libraries should provide access to them, while also offering educational programs and support groups to aid in understanding.

Overall, libraries should continue offering access to wide range of materials to encourage freedom of thought and expression
