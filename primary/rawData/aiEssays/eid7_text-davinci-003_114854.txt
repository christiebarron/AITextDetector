I often think back to my grandmother, who always had the most patience with me. She was the definition of a kind and generous soul who always had time for everyone.

I remember one time, when I was about six years old, I had gotten a new toy I was very excited for. Because I was still so young, I had trouble figuring out how to put it together. After a few failed attempts, I started to get frustrated and was about to give up. Thankfully, my grandmother stepped in and offered her guiding wisdom.

Instead of just showing me how to assemble it, she patiently walked me through the process, step-by-step. Despite my numerous missteps, and especially after my feelings of frustration had subsided, she continued to encourage me with words of reassurance.

Finally, after about a half hour of back-and-forth work, I was able to put the toy together completely by myself. It was such a sense of accomplishment.

The patience and understanding my grandmother showed me that day stayed with me throughout the years. To this day, I've kept the toy as a reminder of her loving guidance and ever-present patience.
