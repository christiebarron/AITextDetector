I was at the grocery store recently and a man in front of me in line had a bit of trouble with his card. He was becoming increasingly frustrated with the machine and started to apologize to his wife, who was next to him comforting him. I could tell by his behavior that he was embarrassed, so I decided to stay quiet and be patient with him. He tried the card over and over again, and after multiple attempts, it finally worked, all while I stood there silently waiting for him to finish. He thanked me for being understanding and I just nodded and smiled as he went on his way. Being patient was the right thing to do and I'm glad I had the self-control to stay silent and let the situation resolve itself.
