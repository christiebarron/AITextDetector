The ending of Winter Hibiscus serves to echo the poem’s theme of resilience and hope in the face of adversity. Throughout the poem, the speaker has been reflecting on the challenges she has faced when coming to terms with a foreign culture, and her feelings of alienation. However, in the final line, she finds a renewed hope for the future. The idea of the hibiscus “budding” in the spring symbolises the possibility of rebirth and renewal; a testament to her resilience despite the struggles she has faced. By ending the poem with these words, the speaker is expressing her determination to take the test again and to continue overcoming any obstacles she encounters. It serves as a reminder that with strength and resilience, anything is possible.
