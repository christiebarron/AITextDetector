An example of a time someone in my life was patient was Bill's son, Brian. Bill took care of him for the past 8 years now with great grace and care that went beyond just him and his mom, he's a real hard worker and was really caring for his son for many years before his illness caused him even more. And I know he'll be missed.

I would say my husband didn't put up with the loss and so we're all so thankful and grateful for what Bill did. And he was a real help when our family needed him there for many years now. He really made it difficult for other people to figure out the details of what happened which was a huge loss to us.

The end of that friendship started one day in May of this year, when I got a call from Bill about an update on a Facebook event about the accident that was going on. And Bill was just as sad as the news of the accident, which is when the news started coming in the news online and it was a huge shock for Bill.

When I get a phone call from Bill, I'd never heard of a doctor, or medical personnel, going to hospital to treat a patient and what happened was devastating for him. But it's a big change to see a family member go through something of this scale we don't know about, or what occurred. Bill and I got together as we were going through a really difficult time right after Bill's illness.
