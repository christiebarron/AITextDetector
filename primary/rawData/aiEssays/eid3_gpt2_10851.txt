Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

Rough Road Ahead:

The following are some of the changes made under the Better Life Guide:

The Greenway Road has been moved out of the 'Rough Road' in order to create a separate 'Ride and Get' option in 'On-Off', so drivers can get on. There are now four lanes instead of five.

The Greenway Road in the City Road has been changed from 'Rough' to 'Rough'.

The New Greenway Road in the Tooting and Highway Authority Roads Authority Road has been changed from 'Rough' to 'Rough'.

Tough Road Ahead:

Rename the City Road (Rough) to 'Tough'.

There is no longer a Greenway Traffic Policy and all cycling on the city road has stopped. Cyclists can also go to the 'Rough' for 'No Greenway'.

In this way the streets of Tooting and Highway Authority Road (SOHRA) are in harmony with each other, allowing each other to access a safe cycling network. So drivers can enjoy safer cycling on the Roadways.

High Street:

The new City street is in good overall shape, with its red line at Tooting, the red cross at SOHRA, and an area around the old Winteldt road
