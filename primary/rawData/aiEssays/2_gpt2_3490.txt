I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is necessary to provide a balanced public discourse on issues for which the public has an interest.

This is my view to bring the views and opinions expressed in this article to the attention of governments and public officials:

– When, in these days, "free expression" as it often is defined, has been described as "censorship of materials in libraries," I do not mean to say that books are not in libraries but that there are free programs of non censorship.

– Books have a significant role in the dissemination of information throughout the world, though it is often described in a wide variety of contexts. In my view this has become necessary in order to promote the development of a new understanding of the human condition and the needs of the people.

– Since such activities, therefore, do not make a contribution for social development or public health, I regard them as a necessary countermeasure.
