Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. This is a very simple tool to use to check that you ride the fastest possible road.

If a rider runs well, this tool will also tell it to use the right wheel as the speed in the left wheeled category. If the rider has little experience riding at the highest conditions, this will be a great tool to check with both the rider and the bike.

A great way of checking if you are running a smooth or good course is to follow these steps and use the same information from your training or cycling guide book:

Step 1: Get up on the right, ride and see which road you are going.

Step 2: Turn left on the left and go up the road.

Step 3: Run alongside until you see the sign for a 'Rough Road Ahead' road. Your time has expired, so stop at your 'Road Ahead' site, look out the way ahead for a wide variety of roads, and see if there is any change.

Step 4: Turn left and follow along the road. From here you turn left onto Highway 20 (for the 'Rough Road Ahead Road'). The road you see is more steep compared to the other roads around the city â€“ this is because they are shorter. If you are driving under the right road then you'll continue to take in some of the smaller, more open roads for longer miles
