Censorship in libraries is an ongoing debate topic that has recently become the focus of much heated discussion in certain communities. Libraries are often the cornerstones of communities, and I believe that the decision to censor material should not be left solely to libraries. 

First and foremost, it is important to remember that libraries are a public resource, meaning that the people should have access to information regardless of whether or not certain materials are found offensive. Removing certain materials simply because they are deemed offensive denies the public access to important and educational resources. Just because certain materials may be deemed offensive by some, does not necessarily mean that they should be removed from library shelves. 

Another important factor to consider is that libraries should respect the First Amendment rights of its viewers. Although there is a fine line between offensive and inappropriate material, libraries should strive to ensure the open availability of information. Furthermore, it is important to remember that libraries also have a responsibility to provide resources that are relevant to its consumers, which may include material that may be deemed offensive. 

Overall, I believe that libraries should not be forced to censor resources, or remove certain material simply because they are found offensive. Libraries should strive to provide unrestricted access to materials, while also considering relevancy and First Amendment rights. After all, libraries should be the cornerstone of the community, and we should strive to ensure that people have access to the resources they need.
