In the poem "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski, the cyclist is presented with a challenging course ahead of him, full of difficult terrain. The mountains, tall hills, and gravel roads serve as an obstacle to the cyclist. The cyclist must face this difficult course by himself, with no assistance available alongside him as he battles his way through the trail.

The setting plays an important role in the poem insofar as it influences both the difficulty of the course and the position of the cyclist. The poem focuses largely on the terrain of the course, noting the tall hills, mountains, and the rough gravel roads that challenge the cyclist. The difficult nature of the course can be seen as physical barrier that the cyclist must overcome. Due to the physical barriers, the cyclist must rely on his own strength and ability to get through the rough terrain. As the course progresses, the cyclist becomes increasingly pressed to push himself to the limit as the gradient increases, the temperature drops, and the workload grows.

The position of the cyclist is also affected by the features of the setting. The poem establishes that the cyclist is alone on the course, making the task of conquering the terrain more difficult. With no assistance to help the cyclist over the difficult terrain, he must rely on his own resilience to get through. The course itself also serves as a sort of mental challenge for the cyclist, pushing him beyond the limits of his physical ability and testing his mental fortitude. With no external help
