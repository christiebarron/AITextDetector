The idea of constructing a building that allowed dirigibles to dock on it’s rooftop first emerged in the mid-1920s, when the iconic Empire State Building was just a dream. With the promise of bringing cutting-edge transportation advances to the table, the idea of having dirigibles stop on the building’s mooring mast had the potential to be revolutionary. Despite this, the plans quickly ran into a number of obstacles that restrained their expectations.

First and foremost, ensuring the Empire State Building could sustain the weight of an airship posed a major challenge. Engineers had to develop a complex and sturdy mast system that could handle the airship’s enormous load. The masts had to be made from the strongest steel and fastened with the toughest rivets imaginable. Each mast had to reach a height of 365 feet, further adding to the complexity and weight of the undertaking. The task of building such sturdy masts was only further complicated when the pliabilities of the building’s spire had to be taken into consideration. This issue was temporarily solved with the construction of two forty-five-foot mooring masts, one at the 73rd floor and the other at the 79th.

On the other hand, the enormous amount of time and resources for the process of register and certifying the various dirigibles posed another, nearly insurmountable problem. In order for a dirigible to be able to dock
