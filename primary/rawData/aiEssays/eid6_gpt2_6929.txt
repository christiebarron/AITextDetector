The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They included lack of an elevator line (due to pressure) and the high cost of space above the building itself. Additionally, the lower mass of the building is used as a staging area on the floor to provide emergency shelter for workers if the building becomes unusable. A building with one high mass of the construction material such as steel or mortar, however, requires more mass for a lower-mass surface such as concrete. However, building materials such as cement and cement linings can hold mass well below the ground, even when exposed to the air or other obstacles. ft 3

For the most part the buildings on the planet have lower density of materials such as concrete and concrete-filled building materials. Due to building sizes being much larger (typically 300 foot tall and 6 meters long) than the cities on Earth, cities are also relatively less stable when building larger, wider buildings. According to some historians, a large city-sized building was usually built at the height of the Pleistocene. It has been estimated that there were over ten million people living in the Pleistocene, but with less than 1% of the population living in denser cities, and being the last significant pre-industrial civilization along with a few megapacts of human settlement on the planet, it is extremely likely that even the largest cities on Earth could have had no habitable environments on the planet, and some scientists are concerned
