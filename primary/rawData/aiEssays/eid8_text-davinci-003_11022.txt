I was on a business trip with my coworkers and we decided to go out for dinner one evening. We all got into the car and drove to the restaurant. As soon as we arrived, the conversation among my coworkers got a little heated. When I saw the tension in the room, I decided to lighten things up a bit. 

I made a joke about the waiter's hairdo and everyone in the car burst out laughing. Within seconds, the tension evaporated. Then I started telling some funny stories about my work experiences, and everyone was laughing and having a great time. 

By the end of the dinner, we were all full of laughter. We went back to the hotel with a much lighter mood than we had at the start of the evening. I felt proud of myself for using my humor to help solve a potential problem. Laughter can truly be the shortest distance between two people.
