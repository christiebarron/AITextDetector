The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because in most cases, if you didn't know the book was coming, you're either too na√Øve, or too drunk or too hungry to read it, or you're too anxious or you're too afraid or you're too excited to read it.

I've always wondered, in my day to day life, why people who read literature take so long to read after the publication of Shakespeare. Was it because they're so preoccupied with getting their fix?

Well, I'm just as anxious as anyone of you to read the entire book. It's not that I don't like books, but it has to be explained. It's like, look - I read Shakespeare quite freely. I'm a huge fan of Shakespeare - there's a number of fantastic characters and so on, but I'm never as into them, I read them to the point where I get an erection. I don't have much of a sense of Shakespeare, but I have no idea what he has to say about love, of death, of death in history all the way to the end of his life. He's written so many important books - I haven't read some of them that I would put the word out there but then I read some of those anyway so if you take my example and I'm just looking at the first thing you're gonna see is the first half of his dialogue and then we just go and do a bit of that
