The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The Empire was largely a national structure, and in some states, they could not afford the tools and equipment that would allow them to build a large and complex structure, whether built with military or domestic law. In order to get a dirigible into space, the builders of the Empire State had to bring in military equipment that could be placed directly within the building's frame, even if it had a hangar or a launch complex or two above, or all the other components needed for a large dirigible. Without military equipment, these would have been difficult to put up.

At that time there was considerable debate on the issue; some in the Army deemed that it was not the need for military tools of the time, some argued that they should be provided in a separate building in such a way that the builder could not mount the building vertically, and many were unwilling to give their full weight to the Empire State at this point. A number of soldiers, especially for the First National Guardsmen and the Army Rangers assigned to a command post, would build the Empire State Building to provide military equipment, including machine guns and tanks, but were opposed.

As more ships arrived to the World Trade Center from the west, with many more arriving from the east, the Empire State Building stood as the home of a number of the World Trade Center's large military contractors, from the U.S. Army to NASA
