I met John at a friend's birthday party, and the moment he walked in, I was drawn to him. He had a big smile on his face, and he radiated a sort of energy that just made me want to be around him. 

Throughout the night, John and I ended up talking a lot. We had tons of things in common, and we were just laughing and joking and having a great time. 

At one point, John told me a joke that was so silly I couldn't help but burst out laughing. I laughed so hard my stomach hurt and my cheeks grew sore after a while. What I didn't expect was that John was even funnier than his joke. His laughter was so contagious and I couldn't help but laugh even harder each time he did. 

I eventually found out that throughout our conversation, we had managed to move our chairs closer and closer to each other. It was almost as if we were connected by our laughter. 

Needless to say, John and I have been inseparable ever since. Laughter really is the shortest distance between two people.
