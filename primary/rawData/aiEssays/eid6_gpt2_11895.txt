The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first was the fact that the doors of the Empire State Building were only accessible by a single stairway. Then, after more than 15 years of neglect, the Government of the Philippines (GPA) decided to remove the entry stairway from the top of the building in order to allow dirigsibles to take place. As a consequence, these dirigibles were located on top of each other and the stairs were closed without any doors as well as with the exception of an open entrance which was located on top of the top of the Empire State Building.

In December 1966, the main steps were modified and doors began to appear on the second floor, but only after a series of construction challenges resulted in their removal from the building. The main steps now appear on the top of the Building, as well as on the rear of the building's facade (although these steps are not visible from within the building). The entrance stairs to the third level were removed, while the last entrance has been completed and its elevator is now located above the front entrance. It is unknown when the stairs was installed, and who provided the building with them, the only clue to their exact nature is that the top of the stairs were originally designed to be accessible by four stairways connecting the two sides of the building.

The remaining steps, which have been modified as an open entrance, are only accessible through the door
