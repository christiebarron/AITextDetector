I was on a date with my now husband, and it was our first time really having some quality alone time together. We were both so nervous, but I noticed a funny expression on his face and I couldn't resist a joke.

"What's wrong?" I asked him.

He laughed nervously before he replied "I just realized, we're on the same wavelength when it comes to music...we both like the same old school R&B artists from the '80s!"

We both cracked up because we had both been so nervous, and it had seemed like an odd way to break the ice.

From then on, laughter was always part of our relationship. We can take the most serious situations and find a way to make each other laugh. We truly believe that laughter is the shortest distance between two people and that it always brings us closer together.
