The setting of Joe Kurmaski's short story, "Rough Road Ahead," plays an important role in how the cyclist fares on his journey. The rough terrain, poor infrastructure, and unpredictable weather conditions are all elements of the cyclist's environment that affect his success. 

The setting is described as being the American Southwest, which means the roads are often much more challenging than they are in other places. The road is described as having an abundance of sharp turns, elevation changes, and narrow stretches with no shoulder. Not only does this make the ride physically more difficult, it also makes it much more dangerous. The cyclist must be on alert every moment, looking out for a misstep that might cause an accident.

The infrastructure plays its own role in making the cyclist's journey a trial. The roads and bridges are decrepit and often in disrepair. The cyclist is at risk of potholes, large cracks, and other obstacles that could cause him to lose control, crash, or receive a flat tire. 

The weather is unpredictable in the desert and can frequently come in the form of strong winds, intense heat, and unexpected storms. The cyclist must exercise extreme caution to stay safe on the road, avoid heat stroke, and stay dry in a sudden rainstorm.

The features of the setting make the cyclist's journey difficult and dangerous. He must remain vigilant in order to stay alive and complete his ride. The cyclist knows he is pushing himself
