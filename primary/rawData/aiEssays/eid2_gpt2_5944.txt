I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a fundamental human right and that such speech is protected to theorneys general, and that these should not be treated as such."

The judge said the rights of free speech are also important.

"We are taking it one step further by suggesting that some speech may be subject to constitutional protections and protections at law," he said. "That is a case of "reasonable accommodation."

However, the judge held that the U.S. Constitution guarantees free and fair warning if it is held in violation of Title I.

"It should be clear to anyone concerned that all information contained on a publication is a private matter. Our society is much more robust when it contains information that is protected against any censorship than when information is not protected," the judge said.

The decision is part of a series of appeals that were heard in a trial that is due to wrap up next month.

Earlier in 2013, the ACLU successfully secured a temporary restraining order under the Constitution's Freedom of Information and Privacy Rights Act and also challenged the First Amendment's right of the public and judicial branch to share, freely and privately, federal news and other information deemed to be confidential.
