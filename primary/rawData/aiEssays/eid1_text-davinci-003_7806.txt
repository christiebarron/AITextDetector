Narciso Rodriguez’s memoir, From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, powerfully conveys a sense of longing, nostalgia, and sentimentality that reverberates through the pages. Rodriguez revisits his childhood home in New Jersey to explore his family’s past while reflecting on his own emotional journey. The author carefully constructs an environment that captures the melancholic feeling of memories, both from those of his family and his own personal history.

The book’s focus on the family home as a physical space of memories imbues it with a poignant, reflective mood. Rodriguez brings to life a rich portrait of what his family home was like and what feelings it evoked in him. As he visits particular places in the house that were special to him, the memories attached to them become so vivid as to evoke a physical response in the reader. His vivid descriptions of the objects, both mundane and special, further reinforce this mood.

The memoir functions as an act of commemoration as well, as Rodriguez solemnly remembers and honors the lives of loved ones who have passed away. Juxtaposing past memories with life in the present imbues the book with a sense of wistfulness. The reader finds themselves in a limbo, living between the past and present, left to reflect on the time they have lost and the memories they have yet to make.

Rodriguez’s memoir artistically captures the contradictory feelings of nostalgia and longing. By
