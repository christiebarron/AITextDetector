The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In fact, most other buildings are designed to contain the remains of the building system, including the Empire State Building, where the dirigibles are mounted. Thus, it is not as easy a task to have an Empire State building mount a drone, but that was not the case for this week's episode of Star Wars: The Force Awakens. The Empire State Building was built around the same time as the previous two main Skywalker, Palpatine and R2-D2 Star Wars games.

In Episode VI of Episode VII, Kylo Ren is shown as a fighter pilot in a training role; in the first Star Wars movie, Ren takes on the role of the new Rogue One-class.

As the last episode of the franchise was set to air in 2013, it is important to note that not all stories of the story on The Force Awakens were actually written for the original Star Wars trilogy. This may have created a conflict between the Jedi and the Jedi Councils and Star Wars lore on a large part of the Star Wars lore is based on older Star Wars canon.

In Episode VII, when Luke meets Kylo Ren, he has the exact same lightsaber as his father. This seems to mean that during the course of the story, Luke goes through a similar battle with Kylo Ren, but this time there is no reference to the two heroes even during the first two episodes
