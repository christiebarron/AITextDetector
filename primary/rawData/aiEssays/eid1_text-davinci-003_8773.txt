 

I remember a moment that always brings a smile to my face. My best friend and I were at a comedy club. We were some of the youngest people there, and we were excited to see the show. As we waited for the comedians to come out, I glanced at my friend nervously. I was always the more reserved one of us, so I was a little intimidated by being in the presence of strangers in a strange place.

My friend must have sensed my uneasiness, for without warning, she burst out in a loud, bellowing laugh. Everyone around us stopped and looked her way. I started to laugh too, initially out of shock but soon out of genuine amusement. We were no longer two strangers in an unfamiliar place, we were two friends in stitches over a shared moment of joy.

The comedians began to take the stage, and they weren't half bad! My friend was the last to stop laughing: she seemed to be in a constant state of joy. By the end of the show, our sides were aching from all the laughter.

It's funny how a single moment of laughter can stay with you forever. Not only did it bring us closer to each other, but it also created a special memory that will never be forgotten. In that moment, laughter was indeed the shortest distance between two people.
