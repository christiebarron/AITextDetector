An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I met Dr Brian Gormley. I was a small boy on my own. He worked for a big dairy company in the country and that was kind of when I went to college, and it's always been an easy place for me and when I'm ready for college, it's just right there for me in the middle of it every logistical challenge we get. In that time, I'd go to my little home in rural Wisconsin, it'd be the perfect place. I'd go there during an eclipse, go down and stay there for 10 days, with a little bit of daylight overhead.

I remember, I went to college, and just happened to get struck in the hand with a car. Then a kid with a little bit of vision passed over the side, and I write this text to my doctor, saying, "Can you help me? I've been thinking of that." And he'd be like, "Yeah, it's a little more difficult, I need stitches." I just went on my own, so I said, "Yeah, fine, thank you. I can't wait, I appreciate you taking care of me."

A lot of people think that I want to do good. I want to improve. I want to do a lot of things. And when you go from getting all those, you're getting a little bit of what I've come to call 'good,'
