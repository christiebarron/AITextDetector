The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' reflects the challenges people face in their daily lives to reach a sense oforney's in which they can feel free to work freely across three continents. The author has previously told how she finds each other very grateful that she doesn't have to pay any rent on her home, while also saying, "You can be so rich and you can pay at most half your living expenses or even even better than your grandparents. You just need to do that."
