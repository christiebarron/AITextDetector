The features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead” have an immense effect on the cyclist. The physical features of the road surface is the number one factor, as the road is uneven and filled with potholes and other hostile surfaces. These topographical features cause the cyclist to encounter unexpected obstructions, forcing him to either slow down or take creative measures to navigate around them. This can be dangerous, as he is unable to anticipate the layout of the terrain as well as he would on an even surface.

The geographic location of the road is also a major factor, as it is taking place in a remote countryside area. This means that the cyclist is vulnerable to a variety of dangers, such as unpredictable weather patterns, rocks or debris tumbling down mountain slopes, and unforeseen objects placed in his way by local mischievous kids. With no one else around, the cyclist has no one to rely on for help should he encounter any of these unforeseen circumstances.

The cyclist is also affected by the mental imagery and sensations created by the atmosphere of Joe Kurmaski’s story. The roar of the engine, the biting wind, and the uphill trek are all palpable and bring home the emotions of the cyclist’s journey. As he pushes forward, the cyclist’s uncertainties, fear, and dedication are all heightened by the visual and auditory details included in Kurmaski’s description. Altogether
