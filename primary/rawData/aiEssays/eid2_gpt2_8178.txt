I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is not only wrong but also destructive of free speech, because it would threaten free expression.


Let's be clear here. We stand against censorship, of all kinds of content out there. If people can easily see it, people will be able to decide for themselves what to say, what to say about content in their libraries.


But we're also here to fight for free speech, because we're fighting for the public's right, the right of the public to have their voices heard. Chronic suppression of free expression is the antithesis of that right, right of the public's right for debate and expression, with its inherent dangers."
