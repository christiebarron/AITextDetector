I had been on the dating scene for a few years, trying my best to find “the one”. I finally took a chance and asked out my coworker, Jackie. We both had a lot of fun on our first date, but I was nervous and it was a little awkward. As the date was coming to an end, I made a joke about one of our coworkers that was just too funny to resist. It seemed like I’d made my move too soon. Jackie just stared at me, seemingly shocked by my comment.

But then, something amazing happened—she smiled. We both started laughing uncontrollably and, before we knew it, time had flown by. We continued to talk and laugh, and it felt like I had known her for years.

That night I learned something very important—laughter really is the shortest distance between two people. We’ve been dating ever since.
