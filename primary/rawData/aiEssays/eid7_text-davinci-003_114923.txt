I recently encountered an experience that tested my patience, and I am proud to say that I passed with flying colors. I was out running errands and stopped at a local grocery store. Lines had been growing since I first arrived, but I chose the shortest one anyway.

The person in front of me had a lot of items that they were slowly putting away in their cart. I patiently stood in the same spot until they were ready to check out. I could feel my frustration begin to swell up, but I stayed patient and adequate.

Once the person in front of me finished ringing up their items, I was in disbelief when they asked the cashier for price checks on multiple things they had just purchased. I took a few deep breaths to keep my patience.

The cashier took their time, thoroughly checking all the prices and explaining the various discounts offered in the store. It took them a good 10 minutes to finish and in that time I remained incredibly patient.

When everything was done, the cashier thanked the customer, apologized for the time it took and wished them a good day. I thanked the cashier as well and moved on with my errands, feeling proud of my patience.
