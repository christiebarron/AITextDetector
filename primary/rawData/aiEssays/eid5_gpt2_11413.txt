The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is that of a child who does not know where to turn.

She tells how she moved from New York to North Dakota to take care of the family dogs - she would never make it in even three days without her mother, her brother and two stepfathers.

She told them that she had been 'living with all this for a while' and that she was determined to do nothing but love and care for her kids.

She has been called the only woman to be the head of a professional soccer team and the only woman on the world soccer roster - but she says at heart it is her love which made her the first to get off the field.

She says she always told her children she thought it was her job to pick up the pieces of their lives, and that she wasn't being selfish after all.

And she has been called not just the head of a professional soccer team or the head of a professional athlete but the most beautiful woman ever born - a remarkable feat given how her appearance and physical features may have been in her 20s

Bravo: The way her hair is dyed and she gives her trademark hair black color (left) with a black headband is one of the things that make it so special

She even goes as far as to say how her hair is dyed and also how it is her job to pick up the pieces of their lives
