I was having dinner with my cousin at a restaurant and we were both laughing over a conversation we had. Our laughter was so loud that the whole restaurant stopped and looked at us like we were crazy. 

We couldn't help but laugh even harder and soon people all around us started joining in too. I had tears streaming down my face and my chest ached from laughing so hard. Everyone else was also in stitches. It felt like what true unity between strangers should feel like. 

Eventually the laughter died down and we continued on with our meal. I'm sure everyone around us still remembered that moment of collective joy. My cousin and I couldn't help but laugh whenever we reminisced about that incident. That experience is still so fresh in my memory and it reminds me of how laughter does so much more than just make us feel good. It is a way of bonding with others and connecting on a deeper level.
