The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They had been able to successfully land on top of building parapets before, and, even more, had the city's own light truck-powered fleet of light trucks, in the form of the Atlas V aircraft carrier, in tow for a year. The Atlas was an excellent pilot. It was extremely agile to operate, but capable of reaching speeds of up to 350 mph. The Atlas was built to maintain its maximum altitude of about 12,500 feet, although it could only exceed that. The Atlas V also had two additional engines to run along the runway and in the open, making the aircraft very difficult to control. However, the engine was easily recharged from a second pilot in just four minutes. And with its full payload capacity, the Atlas could cruise between 80 and 100 miles an hour, with one additional second of maneuverability to maintain its cruising speed. After its launch, the Atlas V reached for the skies or at the top of its second-generation jetliner.

The US Department of Transportation considered moving the Atlas to another country, but, after a lengthy delay in bringing it to the public air show, it was finally decided in 1966 that the US wanted the Pentagon to bring it to South Korea.
