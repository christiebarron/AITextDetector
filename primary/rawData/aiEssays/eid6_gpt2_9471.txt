The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Many owners didn't want to allow their cars to be used under these designs, causing issues like broken or broken windows.

Some of the major flaws that existed in the building were that many of the columns that were supposed to be standing on top of each other were only partially covered by the concrete. On top of the three-story tower, the second story had a gap separating the buildings.

After the collapse of the building, both columns were covered by a concrete slipper that allowed it to float on top of it. That slipper can be seen below in the following video.

However, the construction of the two towers that collapsed just as a result of the collapse are not included in this video. However, their structural steel were designed to prevent further damage to the building if an explosion had occurred, as well as to prevent the construction of another structural failure.
