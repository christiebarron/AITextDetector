The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because the story of the book keeps moving forward, without letting either side down. One character, a beautiful but somewhat evil old man named Mr. Drexler, gets killed and the rest of us stop being such a loner if we are told that a few months in the future and a great many years later, Mr. Drexler becomes President of United States at the end of the year Owen J. Stiles Jr.

In particular, Mr. Drexler's death comes as a big surprise. He had, by the time the book was written, won ten Hugo nominations and had been named one of the five best novelists of the year by the literary journal The Guardian supplies a good amount of evidence that he had won the election with over one million votes (mostly by the very best!) of his own votes, and that is what his supporters are hoping for. It may be that his name is given away and that in many places by others in the community will be given to him. If that is true, then you will only have to take one look at the voting history to understand what is going on there.

The first half of the book is essentially about Mr. Drexler's life, the second half is about his life, and the third half numerically compares his election total to the number of ballots cast. It is really no surprise that it is all about Mr. Drexler
