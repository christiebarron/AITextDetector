The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because if you're not happy with something, you're not going to leave it at that place. That's a bad feeling. My book was about the fact that it's like being thrown by a horse. It was a book about a girl who had just been laid to rest in her bed. I was so thrilled that we'd made this work.

There are only three books on this list that have more than 70,000 fans, and it's only a matter of time before we've made the same mistake. Winter Hibiscus is a great book for your little one; by that, I mean you can say, we did an amazing job.
