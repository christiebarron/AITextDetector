In Joe Kurmaski’s poem “Rough Road Ahead”, the cyclist is faced with numerous challenges on their journey. The poem is set in a rural area full of varied terrain, including hills, gravel roads, and curves. This setting creates a number of obstacles that the cyclist must deal with to be successful in their journey.

The hills in the poem force the cyclist to work harder in order to reach the destination. Pedaling uphill requires increased exertion and much more effort on the part of the cyclist. This is a great test of physical strength and endurance, and allows for a feeling of achievement upon reaching the top. The slopes are also difficult to maneuver on a bike, as the diminishing grip of the tires requires even more effort from the cyclist.

The gravel road provides a challenge that is not as physically demanding as the hills, as the road provides little grip and the small rocks create an unsteady footing. This adds to the difficulty of remaining upright while pedaling, as the cyclist must constantly account for the instability of the road. The turns in the road add another level of difficulty, as the cyclist must learn to react quickly and efficiently while attempting to remain on course.

In addition to the physical challenges, the cyclist must also take into account the terrain of the land. This includes the dips, valleys, and sharp edges which can affect how efficiently the cyclist can travel. These changes in terrain can create difficulty in balancing the
