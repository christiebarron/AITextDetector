The Empire State Building has long been a symbol of New York City, of ambition and of human engineering, and for involving the city progressive inclusion of dirigible travel. Despite the success of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock, many obstacles had to be faced in order for the vision to be brought to fruition.

The most obvious obstacle the builders faced was the sheer physical limitations posed by the building. The engineering work that went into the building was incredibly complex. The plans for the building had to be adjusted to accommodate the mooring mast, the tall column to which dirigibles would attach. This would often involve additional steelwork and many additional calculations. Despite its size, the Empire State Building was still limited in its ability to accommodate the mooring mast.

The climate of the city was another obstacle. New York City often experiences high winds, which could make the dock unsafe for dirigibles, as well as the frequent fog. Additionally, as the city was home to a large number of birds, they posed a potential safety concern to the dirigibles, these additional challenges made it increasingly difficult for the builders of the Empire State Building to create conditions safe enough for dirigibles to dock.

Finally, due to the complexity and technology needed, the building of the mast also opened the door for liability issues. The cost of the mast was considerable, and the manufacturers of the mast wanted reassurance that they would not be liable for
