At the end of Winter Hibiscus, Minfong Ho's protagonist is reflecting on an academic test she faced earlier in the story and had not done well in. The discussion is one of growth and learning, as the protagonist recognizes that the questions asked of her in the exam were quite different to what she was used to. It reflects a connection to her experience in the story, that of the hibiscus blooming in spite of the winter chill in which it had been planted. This idea of growth and persevering against adversity is shown in the reflection of her own experiences. The character's thoughts in this final paragraph represent a recognition of the struggles she has faced and the idea that, in the same way as the flower is resilient against the elements, she will be able to persist and do better in the exam when it comes around again the following spring.
