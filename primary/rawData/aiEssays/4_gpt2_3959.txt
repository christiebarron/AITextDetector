The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because while she's happy to have had her "died" thanks in part to her "mourn." It doesn't help that she's being treated like a child herself for the past few words. In fact, she was treated as a child.


As I said, it's really difficult to read Winter Hibiscus without being very familiar with the original work; despite its familiarity, if you haven't read his translations, you can't count out the fact that every one of his parts is very similar to one another.


I wouldn't mind if you enjoyed reading Winter Hibiscus in order to read and follow and appreciate it.
