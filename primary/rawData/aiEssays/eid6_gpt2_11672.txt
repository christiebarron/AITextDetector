The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

Once they were approved by the builders in 2006, their design was approved by the EPA. But the building itself was destroyed by fire on July 23, 2007, and the building's glass panels collapsed.

Many of those at the building have since spoken about why their views have remained so different.

"I feel great," said former firefighter John T. Taylor. "I have been seeing it for nine years, I just never felt it. My eyes have been getting better and better. I think we were really lucky.

"The first time I saw a Dirigible, a black box, it was incredible."

In 2012, the EPA finally approved, and they're proud, that the city finally put them up.

"We have three new Dirigible stations," said Houston officials with the American Diner Alliance. "To be able to continue serving that great city is huge. It means more than ever here."
