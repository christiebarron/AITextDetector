The ending of the poem ties in to the theme of resilience and hope. The speaker is faced with a difficult challenge: they have to take a test they don't feel prepared for. However, they stay hopeful and determined, believing that things will turn around and that they will take the test again come spring. The speaker finds hope in the resilience of nature, represented by the hibiscus, the snow melting, and the returning geese which will eventually cause the hibiscus to bud again. This idea of nature continuing in spite of hardship is an uplifting reminder that nothing is definitive or permanent, and that no matter how bleak things seem, better times could be ahead. The resolution of the poem thus ends on a positive note, and reminds the reader to never give up, no matter how difficult the challenge.
