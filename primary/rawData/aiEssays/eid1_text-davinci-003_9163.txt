Dear Editor,

I am writing today to address the impact computers have had on our society, and to persuasively argue why I believe they have had a positive effect.

With their countless uses and applications, computers have revolutionized our workflows and allowed us to reach milestones that were previously out of reach. The advances made in each industry due to the presence of computers is enormous, and no-one can argue that their implementation has had anything but beneficial effects.

Take education, for example. We are able to access educational resources faster than ever before, allowing us to learn the skills needed to succeed in whatever career we choose. Computers also help improve communication between students and educators, creating an incredibly effective form of remote learning.

Not only do they facilitate learning, but computers also help bring people together from all over the world. We now can communicate with people on the other side of the world as if they are right next door, bridging the gap between people who are far apart.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers have only had positive effects on society. With their immense capability, they have become irreplaceable tools that help us in all aspects of life. I urge readers to consider the advantages they have enabled us to achieve and the impact they have had on peopleâ€™s lives.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
