The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because of his efforts. For a novel that has enigmatic magic effects, it certainly should.

In My Own Magic (2012), it's shown that even Serenity and Winter Hibiscus have the same name. The name was changed, but it appears there's this thing called the Dark Lord (also known as the "Black Mask, the Dark Lord, and the Dark Guardian") who has no more powers after the events of My Own Magic in My Own Magic.

The author (Linda Gensler) suggested that the meaning of the book could be revealed before the book hits stores:

"I feel safe saying the following. If the book's in your possession, put it in your possession. If not, put it away before you read."

So, the meaning of this would be somewhat different than the original title: "My Own Magic is a place where magic works."
