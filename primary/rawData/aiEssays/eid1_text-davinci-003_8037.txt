The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. This process required significant innovation, and the intricate nature of designing a technology that would be able to secure the massive size of the airship while accommodating its passengers and cargo was daunting.

One of the key elements in designing the docking technology for dirigibles was the mooring mast. Initially, only the nearby and relatively small Chrysler Building was able to accommodate a mast for dirigibles, but the Empire State Building needed a much larger version. The architects determined that the top of the Empire State Building should have a mooring mast to which the dirigible could be attached, but the additional weight posed a challenge. The weight of the mast and the necessary systems had to be taken into consideration when the building was being designed.

The engineers had to figure out a way to support the extra weight of the mooring mast and the entire system. As Marcia Amidon Lüsted discussed in her book “The Mooring Mast”, they decided to create a series of concrete walls in the center of the building with an open space between them. This open space created a strong base to hold the mooring mast, which weighed more than 140 tons.

In addition to the technical challenges posed by the mooring mast, the engineers also had to take into account the safety of the people who would be using it. In order to make sure that
