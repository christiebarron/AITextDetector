The use of censorship in libraries has been an ongoing debate for many years, leaving many wondering if certain materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. 

While some may think that censorship is an effective way to control what we are exposed to, I believe that taking away these materials is only detrimental to the mission of a library. Studies have shown that censoring content in libraries can have a negative effect on freedom of speech, and can also prevent valuable educational opportunities. Furthermore, it does not guarantee that the materials in question will no longer be available.

This is why I strongly believe that libraries should not be censoring material. Rather than removing any potentially offensive material, libraries should be embracing it and providing educational guidance for their patrons. By giving patrons the tools to interpret and analyze the content at hand, libraries are creating an opportunity for their patrons to become educated on the material they are exposed to. Libraries can also host talks, workshops, and events allowing patrons to have conversations about the issues without limiting their access to material.

Removing potentially offensive content from libraries is a form of censorship that goes against the values of libraries. As such, it should not be tolerated. Instead, libraries should continue to provide a space free of judgement where patrons can access and discuss materials in a productive manner. This ensures that patrons have access to materials of all kinds within a safe, educational environment.
