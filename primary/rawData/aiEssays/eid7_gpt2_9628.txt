An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the time my husband did not know his wife. I can hear many stories of husbands asking their wives and kids: "What good is it if we are just a baby?" and "What if I will live or die with you? Would you mind living in a house with my kids, knowing we will be having them do chores?" Then you are not a husband or parent and you are a child. When I was a child, I did not think about the consequences that would come my way if my husband and I had kids.

I was a very good father to all of my children. My children had very good behavior. They were taught to learn and become great, and also to be independent. I would give out free cookies to my husband and put money on his behalf so that he could pay his bills. And I still have his kids. These children were learning because they needed to be taught to take responsibility within themselves and to care for their family.
