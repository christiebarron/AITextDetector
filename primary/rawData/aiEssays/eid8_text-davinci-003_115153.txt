I had been married to my husband for five years and still found it difficult to break the ice and talk about anything more than just 'surface conversation'. Whenever we scheduled date nights, the conversation was always awkward and forced, and it felt like every topic we brought up ended in an argument. 

That changed when I decided to take him to the comedy club one night. We were both a little hesitant at first, but as soon as the first joke landed, the tension began to dissipate. We couldn't help but to laugh, and soon the entire night was filled with laughter. 

The effects of that night were profound. We started communicating more openly with each other afterwards, and even talk about the funny moments from the show every now and then. 

Laughter is truly the shortest distance between two people. It was amazing to see how it opened us up to being more vulnerable with each other and strengthened our relationship in such a short time.
