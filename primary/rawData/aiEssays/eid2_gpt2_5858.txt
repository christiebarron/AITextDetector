I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is not censorship at all. We all have rights as individuals to free information on both academic and political issues."

The professor claimed that some government-supported censorship was necessary, but not essential. "We can get through a period of silence and denial on a daily basis," he told the conference. "We can try to stop people from seeing this as an attack on us, or trying to defend their intellectual capital." But he stressed that he was not "in the wrong," and told the audience that his philosophy would not be attacked. As the chair of the International Library Federation, Professors Li and Liwai had been in government-supported organizations to fight this censorship.

"The government has the means to prevent censorship from its citizens," Li explained. "And yet the censors have not acted in a manner that it would not like. It must have the means to protect its interests or to stop it from happening."

I am writing to express my dismay at the absence of any evidence from the US government to support Professor Li's account. As I write these words, my phone is vibrating every day. To say that censorship is so important to me, despite this seemingly contradictory statements, speaks volumes.
