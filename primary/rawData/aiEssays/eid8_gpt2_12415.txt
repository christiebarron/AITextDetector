One time I experienced laughter in my life was when the car in question was going into reverse when the sun was out. But I couldn't understand that. It was just a random fact, but this was actually the kind of thing that happens more often because of the climate of our planet. If you are able to see your temperature the same day, it gets different at different times of the day.
