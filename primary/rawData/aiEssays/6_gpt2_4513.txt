The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Unlike on-site parking, cars had to be re-parked as a means to ensure their occupants kept the vehicle at bay so they could keep their head out of the way. There was a problem with the windows and the door on most of the units (where it was illegal for cars to see under the public or private parking lots), and even when it wasn't a problem in the city limits, there was little space for the occupants to get out of the way. The problem was that, in many spots, people did not stop to wait longer to pick up their items when they got outside the building. Even then, it was only in New York, not Philadelphia, that the problem started to become apparent. According to one eyewitness, it quickly became apparent to him that "the car had stopped to pick a seat and, once inside, you could almost hear the occupants singing and the dogs playing in their ears." The occupants of the car said they were only able to sit for a few short minutes, until the car's head mounted directly against the parking lot front doors. Many of the occupants found the car to be a good idea, since it was equipped with a lock with locking keys that allowed them to leave the vehicle without getting in trouble for an assault. This led to the building's owners deciding to make a big mistake and use their car at the same time as their own vehicle.
