The Empire State Building is one of the most iconic skyscrapers in the world, built in 1931 in New York City. When it was initially planned, the Empire State Building was designed to include a unique innovation known as the “mooring mast,” which was created to allow dirigibles—the then-popular blimps or zeppelins—the ability to dock atop the building. This proved to be a particularly difficult engineering feat, as there were a number of obstacles to overcome in order to make the design feasible.

One of the most significant challenges in the building of the mooring mast was figuring out a way to make it strong enough and safe enough for the large airships to dock without damaging the roof or the structure. The Empire State Building was designed primarily as an office building, and so there was no pre-conceived idea of what type of infrastructure would be necessary to hold up a large aircraft. This meant that engineers had to come up with innovative solutions for how to fortify the top of the building.

Another obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the issue of air currents. Because the mooring mast was to be located at the highest point of the skyscraper, it was constantly exposed to strong changes in wind speed and direction. This necessitated the use of special anchors to secure the large airships as they docked, as the gusting wind could potentially cause them to drift or move unexpectedly
