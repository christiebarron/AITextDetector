An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my daughter's mom who was on the phone every morning and sent me emails from her mom saying how happy she was to be with my daughter and how happy she thought she could be with my sister or niece. She was thrilled to see that her mother had a family of her own and they were so happy they didn't have to have their own mom and brother in our house and there were literally only 2 of them in the whole world and they would not get along and have trouble and so there were definitely times where they would just find it difficult and it was just as frustrating when they got to know some other person they didn't know and in a way because we don't have them there are never as many children of our own parents and we really can't bring them in the family. But I did have my daughter and she had always been a huge part of my life and at the same time she saw me do my thing and she was a big part of it and that's really what she was able to put through that when she was younger and she just always brought her own mother in with her. I couldn't have been anyone else that I could have been and that was really what she saw. I am so thankful for what I do today in terms of living as a father with my wife and my two kids and she never felt like her relationship with me had been as frustrating as those years were and that's my biggest blessing
