I was on a date with my longtime crush when they decided that we should take a break and go for a walk around town. The sun was shining, and the sky was a bright blue without a cloud in sight. We talked and laughed about all kinds of things, listening to each other's stories, and it felt like we'd known each other for years. After awhile, I started to really open up, and I started to tell him stories of my own. I noticed something change - his laughter no longer felt forced, like he was laughing merely to be polite. His laughter was deep and genuine, and it felt like he truly understood everything I said - it was like we were communicating on a level that we couldn't have done with just words. When we finally made it back to his place, I felt like my heart was soaring. I knew then that something special had formed between us - laughter had connected us on a deeper level.
