The Empire State Building was built without any specific plans to allow dirigibles to dock, however, after its completion in 1931, the U.S. Navy agreed to use the top of the building as a mooring mast. This presented the builders and engineers with a unique challenge – how to safely dock heavily-laden airships hundreds of stories above the streets of New York City.

The primary obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced was creating an infrastructure that was strong enough to support the cantilevered dock hanging off the tallest building in the world. With dirigibles weighing up to 70,000 pounds, the mooring mast was designed to have a weight capacity of more than 100,000 pounds, but also had to be built with enough flexibility to avoid the danger of a crash in the event the powerful winds of midtown Manhattan caused the airship to sway.

In order to secondarily defeat the winds, huge steel plates were installed on the wall of the mast and draped in 8,000 yards of chains that could act as an anchor, helping to secure the airships to the mast. The steel plates had to be anchored deeply within the building, as the sheer force of the airships buffeting against the walls was strong enough to damage masonry.

The engineers didn’t stop there though - they also had to design a locking mechanism that would allow the airships to attach to the mast securely and in a uniform manner
