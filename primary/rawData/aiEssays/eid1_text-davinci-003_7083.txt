The freedom of individual expression is perhaps one of the most important aspects of any society, and nowhere is this more relevant than in our public libraries. It is for this reason that censoring books, music, movies and magazines should not be an acceptable practice in libraries. 

The fact is that citizens of all ages will visit libraries and, in doing so, have access to materials that may not match up to their own personal beliefs. Forcing the librarians to censor those materials is not only limiting the freedom of expression we all have a right to, but it is also denying access to potential knowledge that could be beneficial and thought provoking. 

Additionally, censorship of any kind in libraries imposes a moral judgment on users and ultimately creates a feeling of intolerance. In the extreme case, it can even lead to a history of restriction, damaging the progress of our society as a whole. Furthermore, the effort to filter and censor materials can also be a costly one for libraries, as it requires librarians to go through each piece in depth, and sometimes go to court if the issue is challenged. 

In conclusion, we should not accept censorship in libraries in an effort to protect the right of intellectual inquiry, the freedom to read, and the promotion of creative ideas. Instead, our libraries should be a place for the sharing and growth of a rich variety of opinions and perspectives.
