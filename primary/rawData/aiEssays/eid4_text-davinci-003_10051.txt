The reason why Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho ends with this line is to emphasize the theme of determination and resilience in the face of hardships. The protagonist, Ana, has been struggling with feelings of insecurity and lack of confidence. The story ends in the winter just before the “test”, and the final line suggests that no matter what obstacles she may face in the future she has the capability to surmount them. The imagery of winter and the return of spring, complemented by the reference of the hibiscus' budding, symbolizes the renewal of hope and possibility. The ending line reflects optimism and offers the reader the sense that Ana can use these newfound feelings to continue moving forward.
