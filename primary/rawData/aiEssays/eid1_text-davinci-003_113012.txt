Dear Editor, 

As technology advances, the use of computers in our daily lives is becoming increasingly common. From work to leisure, computers are impacting the world in many positive and negative ways. 

On the positive side, advances in computing power and artificial intelligence have made computers indispensable tools for almost every industry. Businesses can instantly communicate with colleagues and customers, expanding markets and creating opportunities for growth. For students, access to a computer and the internet can be instrumental in their education, as they can conduct research, collaborate on projects with teachers and peers, and broaden their view of the world. 

However, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks of computer use as well. Computers can have a numbing effect on people, making them more passive and causing them to become less aware of the natural world. People often experience physical ailments due to spending too much time in front of the screen. In addition, the internet can be a dangerous place â€“ individuals can fall victim to cybercrime and online predators.

It is my opinion that computers are a necessary part of 21st century life, but one must use them responsibly. People should strive to use computers for learning and productivity while tailoring their use to appropriate levels and taking safety precautions. 

I hope that readers will take my opinion into consideration, and understand the potential dangers of improper use of computers.

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
