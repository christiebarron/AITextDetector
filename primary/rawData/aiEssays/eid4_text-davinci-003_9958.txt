Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho ends with this question as it conveys the idea of hope and resilience. The protagonist is determined to take the test again in the spring, when winter has passed and the hibiscus is in bloom again. This conveys the idea that although life can be hard and full of obstacles, one should always remain hopeful and strive forward. The winter hibiscus represents the resilience of the human spirit, and that no matter what happens, one will eventually come out the other side.
