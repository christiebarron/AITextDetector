The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

Under the original building codes, building companies could not fire a laser for two reasons: It was too heavy to hold and the lasers on the roofs would ignite and set off sparks.

An attempt was made to move the building's towers to separate from the rest of the building. The plan fell through when a design committee of the Empire State Building was told the building was not suitable for dirigibles.

The final decision was a hard one. The new building had many of the features of a dirigible but lacked the most of those features.

The design committee recommended, instead, to keep the building free of lasers using a special plan that gave all tower construction a chance at completing.

One committee member said the new design was too heavy for dirigibles because the plan was too complicated for dirigibles. The committee considered other options, but ultimately rejected them.

The commission rejected both the athletically designed dirigible and the one designed by John B. Smith.
