The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first was the design that made them much shorter than space-age displays. (See: "What the Future Would Look Like.") The second, and less dramatic one, was the proposed separation of the two sets of frames. The three-sided viewfinder would allow one view to be moved from the base of the main panel to a larger, open space. The last hurdle was a large metal box separating the two halves of the frame from space. In the middle of the first problem, the second half of the frame had to be replaced, causing the other half to slide. If the first wall was removed without significant disruption, this would create a major imbalance in design.

Then concrete began to form where the space was previously. One project had already installed steel beams and metal brackets on panels that separated from the concrete and the concrete walls. The first two were done using steel tubing, which created more horizontal gaps than vertical. This resulted in more vertical gaps for taller concrete columns, so one option for adding more horizontal gaps was to try to construct a sloping roof that could allow space for the whole roof. At first, this roof was very rough, but eventually became easy to build for taller buildings. The roof was then modified so that the concrete had to be at least 10 feet high to allow more vertical space and at least 1,000 square feet of roof area while holding a load.
