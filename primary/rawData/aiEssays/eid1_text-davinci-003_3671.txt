To the Editor:

I am writing to share my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Since the introduction of computers, many people have had varying opinions on this technology. It's true that with great power comes great responsibility, and I believe that computers have both good and bad effects on people. 

On the plus side, computers have eased communication and research and enabled people to learn and grow. We are able to access information quickly, find jobs faster, and communicate with people all over the world. Computers have allowed us to do more in less time, increasing our productivity and allowing us to gain more knowledge and work more efficiently. 

On the other hand, computers have also brought increased stress in our lives. We are constantly on our devices, checking emails, responding to messages, and scrolling through social media; this can lead to addiction, depression, and other psychological issues. It's also been problematic for our physical health. With long hours in front of a computer, people experience unhealthy levels of inactivity, poor posture, and a risk of eyestrain and headaches. 

Overall, computers have been a double-edged sword. While they have brought many positive changes and advancements to our lives, we must make sure to use them safely and responsibly so that we don't experience negative effects. 

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
