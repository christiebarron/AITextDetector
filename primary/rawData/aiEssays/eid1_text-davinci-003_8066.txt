The story of the Empire State Building and its incorporation of a mooring mast for dirigibles is one that has been the topic of much discussion. This engineering innovation resulted in the famous New York City landmark becoming the first building in the world to host airship docks. In “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the many obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock is outlined.

The foremost challenge when attempting to add a mast to the building was its sheer size. The Empire State Building’s imposing 102-story height made it difficult to place a mast near the top. Initially, the mast was only planned to be 105 feet tall, however the final design was almost four times its size so that it might accommodate larger dirigibles. This was made possible thanks to the efforts of engineer Albert Hermann, who designed a framework around the mast which allowed it to extend to 400 feet in length.

Another issue were the winds that surrounded the building. While the building’s height made it an ideal place for airships to dock, winds could cause docking problems and potential accidents. Wind turbines were intended to be installed near the mast to help mitigate these risks, however this was found to be too expensive, so the engineers resorted to building exhaust fans at the base of the mast instead. The fans worked to create powerful suction, helping the dirigibles stay in
