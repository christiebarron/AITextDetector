Computers have many effects on people. Most likely they affect the ability to concentrate. While at their peak, these effects can be quite intense and include an increased concentration over and above what you would normally see in your brain.

As we all know, high-energy particles may be attracted to other low-energy particles such as electrons, muon, atoms, etc.

This, in turn, increases the amount of energy you put into your brain. When this increased activity occurs, it can cause an increase in your risk of developing Parkinson's Disease, depression, anxiety, and other other brain disorders.

In fact, it's very possible that we've gotten to the point where most of the high energy particles we've become accustomed to and used to experience are still being injected into the brain to alleviate our suffering from the debilitating effects filter we already suffer from our symptoms.

This is why I'm not sure we as a society want to change this and yet even if we do we'd like 305 billion people worldwide to continue experiencing symptoms. I'm not sure if this should be a problem or a cure for the problem; it'd be nice if at least we could have a plan to stop this cycle.

I want to emphasize, by the way, that I'm not suggesting that the idea of a 30-day drug detox is completely crazy. I'm asking, is it as good for the brain as the rest of us think it should be, or
