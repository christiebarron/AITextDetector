I was at a restaurant the other day, waiting for my take-out order. It was taking a lot longer than I expected - what should have been a 15-minute wait quickly progressed to an hour.

I could feel my patience slowly waning and becoming more and more irritated by the minute. I wanted to lash out and demand an explanation as to why my order was taking so long. But instead, I decided to take a deep breath and remain calm in the situation. 

I kept my cool and patiently waited, pushing aside my frustration and anger. Eventually, after an hour passed, my food was finally ready. 

I thanked the staff for my order and took great joy in the fact that I managed to remain patient even in an unpleasant situation. In the end, it was worth it!
