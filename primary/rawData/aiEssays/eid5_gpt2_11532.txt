The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' features the author, Rolfe Sjöberg, who, in his autobiography 'Taken', talks about a tumultuous year. Rolfe is in Berlin writing about his experiences in exile, his life in Berlin in a world in which he was the subject of two novels; 'Taken and The German Idiot' and 'Nervous', about his exile in Berlin which he made as a writer, and his experience living in Munich, who he was able to work with.

While the final chapter of the book is of a longer length, and his memoir remains short, Sjöberg can also clearly tell the reader the history of his experiences and why and how the story ends. 'From Home is like a kind of narrative, a narrative about human life, at various historical moments, like the opening of the railway track, like the struggle that took place here in Munich, like the way that the people came before people.' His story can even be read as a tragic one. 'From Home was not a diary of the ordinary life in Berlin. That may be hard for some people – the people, the work, the culture, the people's personal values – that are not ordinary people. I wanted to tell them what they had to endure, and where they had to go to recover. By doing so, the story of their relationship with their government took place.'
