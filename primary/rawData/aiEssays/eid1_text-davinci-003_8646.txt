I remember the first time I met my now husband, Brad. We were set up on a blind date by our mutual friends. When he walked in the door, I expected serious conversation and awkward small talk. Instead, we burst out laughing simultaneously at a silly mistake I had made. After recovering from my embarrassment, I noticed that everything he said was accompanied by a joke or a spark of humor. 

From that moment on, it was like we were just meant to be together. Every time we get together, we never fail to make each other laugh. We often joke about our opposing views on certain topics and we both appreciate being able to have a good laugh together. We know that when the going gets tough, laughing brings us closer together.

Our laughter is something that has kept us together for so long. In fact, I often joke that it’s the key to our success in marriage. It may sound silly, but it’s true. We never let the laughter die in our relationship and I wouldn’t have it any other way.
