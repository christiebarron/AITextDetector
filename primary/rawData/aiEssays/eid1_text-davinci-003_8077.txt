The construction of the Empire State Building (ESB) was an ambitious undertaking that presented many problems to be solved. One of the most difficult challenges the architects had to face was the issue of allowing dirigibles, also known as airships or blimps, to dock to the building. The task was immensely complicated, involving a variety of engineering and safety challenges related to the construction of the building itself and the dangers of such large aerial craft maneuvering around an urban area. In her book, The Mooring Mast, Marcia Amidon Lüsted explains the challenges that faced the builders of the ESB.

As the ESB began to take shape, it was clear that a large mooring mast would be needed in order to allow dirigibles to dock with the building. Due to the extreme height of the skyscraper, it was determined that the mast would need to be 2000 feet tall in order to allow the blimps to be safely moored. This presented the first major challenge; the mast needed to be incredibly sturdy yet still lightweight enough that it would not overwhelm the building’s existing structure. The architects needed to find a way to construct a mast out of the same steel used to construct the ESB, while also taking into account the building’s immense weight.

The second challenge that faced the builders was the issue of weather and wind. Given the unstable nature of wind patterns in the area, the mast was designed with
