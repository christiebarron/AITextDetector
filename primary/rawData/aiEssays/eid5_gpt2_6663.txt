The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is a very different phenomenon in the UK of recent times. In England there is now such 'unprecedented' support for independence that it is even beginning to seem like there could still be a vote for it even if the polls don't take a clear majority, especially so from the left.

In Scotland there has been even more enthusiasm for independence. In 2015 the 'Leave' campaign had over 200,000 signatures in favour of the No vote. The result was the first time Scots have ever felt so deeply tied behind the Yes vote in that poll (if those numbers are any indication).

And in Wales it is very much the case that those who voted for independence back it. At least in part because the same referendum carried out twice in 2013 was held in the same month that the UK government launched its push for independence.


In Cardiff, the referendum result has created an even bigger sense of uncertainty in the state of Scotland. When that event is concluded – when a new Scotland comes into being under the EU and Scots can be sworn to 'Scotland first' – there will be a strong sense that there are no longer Independents in the UK and all their supporters in Wales will feel relieved.

When that vote was held in 2009 and 2012, two thirds of Scottish voters now supported independence. Of those with a full vote the majority has been in Wales where independence supporters now see a two thirds lead to victory
