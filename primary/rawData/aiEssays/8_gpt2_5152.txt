One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was in the hospital for a cancer. It was all because I'm being held up as an artist who can't get a credit for creating art. I was also on a suicide watchlist with no credit for my work, and I spent a lot of my time getting rid of that. "I like doing weird shows!" I was not going crazy. I had been getting fired many times. In a way every moment was going to be a fight to get it right. At times I felt more at home. No one had ever had me shot, the police would tell me my story and they would say, "I don't know what you're talking about?" So I was just very open about it. I'd always say that I'm very open about this stuff, that I love it as much as I love to live it.

There have been times where you've been working in a small studio around the block, or in a nightclub, or in a movie theater, and it's been interesting, but not quite the same.

They still don't talk to me about that. That's how much I think I'm a very independent person. I was so proud of my other stuff. It's one of those things where maybe I didn't appreciate the attention or the pressure, but I appreciated the attention. Maybe when you think back that night, maybe you can't imagine what I thought I was doing,
