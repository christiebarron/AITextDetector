The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it gives us, the students, the tools to get the questions answered and give them the answers to really get into how things work in their studies in these early years at the university.

I think it is a good starting point. It is the first book I have been doing as I was starting out, so I really feel that it does a lot of good for learning from other people. When this happened, my initial idea wasn't to teach in private classrooms, and I thought, wow it really doesn't make sense. Instead I thought, it's really a big lesson that I need to teach every year.

So I did a couple of experiments and the main thing that I think is important for students to remember is that any problem that can ever occur in real life is either solved (sometimes with a few hours of practice) in any kind of physical or emotional way, and I do some of it by having a great teaching relationship with my instructors every year and doing some really hard and long experiments and real teaching with them. That sort of helps us get the student into that sense that they are getting into something right.
