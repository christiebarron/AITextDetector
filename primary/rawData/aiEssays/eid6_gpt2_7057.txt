The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One project, a private contractor, decided to build a private jet for the state building and, with federal support, leased the aircraft—and after the pilots flew it, he found it impossible to use it.

And to use a jet that has very different, and possibly higher rates of failure than a regular plane, the designers needed a new structural feature to bring its plane to life.DRG.com's new concept uses an innovative jet design. The concept comes from the company's latest efforts, which were based on the design of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner that was piloted by Boeing's vice president and General Manager for Boeing's business operations, Steve Ziegler.

The plane features the iconic 'E' logo on the side of the cockpit window, a jet wing that retracts from the side when thrust is low—a standard feature in any airplane—and a small, noncompact cockpit with a built-in camera system and a full-size camera.

A pilot using the new aircraft for a simulated exercise, which happened nearly two hours after the pilot piloted the plane, sees the main propeller on his new Airbus A340 engine as the wing opens up around the A330, and a small, open-air prop that is pulled out of the wing is raised with the nose of the engine. The prop, or cockpit door, is not open
