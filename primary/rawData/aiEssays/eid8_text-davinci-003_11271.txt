It wasn't the first time I had felt uncomfortable around my significant other's parents. We had been together for a few months, and this was my first chance to meet them in person. 

They were nice, but a little serious for my taste. I couldn't help but try to break the ice with a bit of humor, a rather tall order when I was the only one laughing. 

The joke didn't quite hit, but I could at least tell from their expressions that the tension was easing a little. Then, their son chimed in with an even goofier joke, and that's when it happened. Everyone, including my significant other burst into laughter.

The dinner was a lot more enjoyable after that. The jokes that followed were better received, and soon the four of us were deep in conversation. By the time the night was over, I felt like I had known their parents for years. 

We all shared a few more laughs as we said our goodbyes, and I looked forward to speaking with them again soon. But what really made an impression on me was that laughter. It felt like in that moment, I had been welcomed into the family.
