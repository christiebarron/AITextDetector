Dear Editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Without a doubt, computers have had a significant impact on our society in terms of both positive and negative outcomes.

On the positive side, computers have drastically changed the lives of millions of people around the world â€“ making communication easier, bridging distances between people, providing access to the latest information, and aiding creativity and collaboration. Computers have also been a valuable support for people in terms of medical research, medical treatment advancements, and reducing human labour.

On the other hand, with the rapid rise in the use of computers, many people are now exposed to potential health risks, such as damage to the eyes from long-term use, and physical health problems from a sedentary lifestyle. Furthermore, computers can have a detrimental effect on mental health, as more and more individuals are now being exposed to cyber-bullying, inappropriate content, and online social isolation.

In conclusion, it is clear that computers have both positive and negative effects on people. Therefore, it is important that we use them responsibly and that we take precautions to prevent the dangers of using computers. I urge your readers to take this into consideration when using computers and to be aware of these potential effects. 

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
