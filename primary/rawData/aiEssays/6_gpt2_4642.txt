The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One hurdle was that the Empire State Building was over 600 years old â€” which required all public buildings to be demolished or at least refurbished after a period of almost three decades. The building, built on Pennsylvania Avenue, was constructed under the same lease in 1878 from James F. Cooper, which permitted construction of dirigibles in Philadelphia until 1885. In 1897, a public hearing was held in the Department of Public Buildings, in which the first and last dirigibles were heard during a demonstration of the City's development of a new public hospital. For the first time ever, a public meeting was held for the first time, which lasted at least four hours. Another public meeting took place three days later at the corner of E.

But those who had taken on the role of lawyers for this cause disagreed with the builders: their idea was to place the dirigibles there so that they would not be able to hit the roofs of the buildings themselves. One notable example involved the first large-scale erection of dirig
