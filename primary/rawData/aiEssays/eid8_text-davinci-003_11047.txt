I was walking down the street one sunny morning, when I heard a sound ahead of me that made me smile. It was the sound of two people laughing. I couldn't help but take a closer look and when I did, my heart melted to see an elderly couple, linked arms, sharing a joke and laughing as though they had no cares in the world. 

I couldn't help but stop and watch. They were so connected and seemed so in love, that I wanted to preserve the moment forever. As I stood watching, the couple noticed me and, smiling, invited me over to join in on their joke. 

Not knowing what the joke was, they tried to explain it to me. But no matter what they said, they kept “explaining” it in different ways and they both just burst out in loud laughter. 

Then the wife said to me, “It doesn’t really matter if you get it. We laugh even more when we don’t understand!” and they both laughed again. 

That moment made me realize how laughter is the shortest distance between two people, no matter what age. I said bye to the couple with a huge smile on my face and walked away feeling truly blessed and grateful for the lesson that I had just learned.
