The Empire State Building was a revolutionary feat of engineering when it was completed in 1931. It was the tallest building in the world, and its architects had an ambitious vision â€“ they wanted it to host regular passenger flights from dirigibles, which was a new and exciting form of transportation at the time. The builders had to overcome a number of obstacles in order to make this dream a reality and create a mast on the roof of the building which could dock dirigibles.

One of the most difficult challenges the builders faced was designing and building a mooring mast that was structurally strong enough to withstand the forces associated with a dirigible docking. Dirigibles had to be secured safely and securely, and the mast had to be able to support its weight as well as the strain of the mooring ropes and cables that held it in place. To address these challenges, the mast the builders constructed was made from steel, and was designed to be collapsible and able to bend with the wind so as to relieve some of the pressure. 

The architects also had to consider the wind conditions when designing the mooring mast, as strong gusts of wind could prevent dirigibles from being able to land safely. The Empire State Building was located in a city with a gusty climate, so the designers had to come up with a solution that could counter the effect of wind and turbulence. To do this, the mast had been fitted with specially designed air brakes to
