The setting of Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead" has a huge impact on the cyclist. The story takes place on a rural two-lane road, which contributes greatly to the tension and suspense as the cyclist navigates the unpredictable terrain.

The dusty road is covered in gravel and rocks, making the cyclist feel like they are in an obstacle course. The road is also narrow, winding, and exposed with no trees or bushes to hide behind or provide shade from the hot sun. The protagonist isn't sure what to expect around each bend, which adds to the tension and suspense of the narrative. 

The unforgiving and unpredictable terrain of the road makes it difficult for the cyclist to keep up with the influx of traffic they are receiving. Cars fly past them at incredibly high speeds, barely leaving enough room for the cyclist to move out of the way. This creates a sense of danger and helplessness, making it nearly impossible for the cyclist to protect themselves. 

The heat of the sun drains the cyclist's energy, leading to their eventual collapse. This oppressive feeling of exhaustion causes the cyclist to doubt their abilities, making it even harder for them to push through the long journeys they are undertaking.

The features of the setting ultimately make the cyclist question their journey and challenge them in ways that would not be possible on a different kind of terrain. The struggle of the cyclist on this difficult road ultimately leads to greater self-knowledge and understanding. This
