I remember the first time I told my girlfriend a joke. We had just started dating and I had been trying to find a way to break the ice between us. I mustered up the courage to tell her a joke that I had heard in the past. When I told it to her, she laughed, and I could feel the tension in the air dissipate.

We went on to laugh and joke with each other the entire night. Soon our relationship began to grow, and each time we were together we could always rely on laughter to lighten up any situation.

Whenever we hit a rough patch, we could always rely on humor to help us get through it. That was the beauty of it. Even in our darkest moments, we were surrounded by that same sound of laughter, the kind that comes from two people that love each other.

And to this day, I still tell her jokes and she still laughs. It’s something that helps us connect on a deeper level, something that we share no matter what else is going on in our lives. In many ways, it’s the thing that makes our relationship so strong.
