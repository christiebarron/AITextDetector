I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a fundamental human right â€¦ with a moral imperative to create value for others and to protect civil rights and their rights in society and society at large."

The statement notes that "the rights of all are at stake when it comes to the rights of freedom of expression. When it comes to freedom of speech, there is no 'fair play' for libel and slander, it's a 'frivolous and destructive' libel. The rights of individuals to defend their individual rights are core to our national freedom, and our democracy must protect these values in our democracy as well as uphold the right to freedom of expression against libel."

The statement then explains that "no one should be allowed to say 'all the news is true,' unless they have the ability, through judicial or congressional action, to prove otherwise," and that "there has been no evidence to suggest that the government has ever done so."

The statement was posted on Wednesday.
