I remember the first time I laughed with my best friend. We had been talking for hours, discussing anything and everything that crossed our minds. We were both exhausted, but still so content in each other's presence. Then, out of nowhere, he said something funny. I couldn't help itâ€”I burst out laughing. I hadn't expected such a crack in his serious demeanor, and it made us both laugh harder.

It had started out as a simple conversation, but quickly turned into a true bonding experience. After that moment, we were both more relaxed with each other. We would find ourselves slipping into fits of laughter when we least expected it. 

To this day, the memory of those moments still puts a smile on my face. Nothing compares to the bond we formed over laughter and eye contact. Laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people, and I'm so grateful I have these memories to share with my best friend.
