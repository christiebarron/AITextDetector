I was sitting in my office, going through the to-do list for the day, when I heard a knock on the door. I looked up to see an elderly woman standing in the doorway. She told me that her son had recommended I could help her sort out some financial issues she had been having.

I showed her to a chair, and patiently listened as she told me about her situation. I quickly realized that it was going to take more time than I had initially anticipated. She would often stop and become confused, forgetting things she had already told me, so I did my best to stay patient and understanding.

I ended up taking half a day to work with her, helping her to sort out the details of her financial problems. By the end of our time together, I felt greatly satisfied knowing that I had been able to help her. It just goes to show that patience and understanding are always worth the effort.
