The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because of it. This is a book which has a central theme which is 'a small world in the darkness which is as it is'. What it means is, the story, as always, takes place inside and outside of that world. There are no'mythical' or supernatural stories, there are non-mythical tales, there are fairy tales. That is my main theme, the story is all about characters, so people can read the book because if you are serious about this you will have to go along with it quite a lot, otherwise you won't find this book very much interesting. But, because people love this book, in my opinion this book is one of the best sellers with more than 5 stars on Amazon this year. Even though my husband thinks it is bad, because I read about this all my life, it is one of the best sellers, especially at a store. It is not only the author that offers the most amazing reviews about the book (such as my father once), and his books on this list are the ones to read for the same reasons. He also includes good reviews, so one can see that it is a great little book and some good advice.
