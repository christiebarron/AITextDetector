One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I saw a teacher doing something to make his children better, after all, "Don't laugh, he's trying to teach you nothing."


My daughter's dad told me regained some of the joy of her childhood, but it took several years to recover. Her laughter stopped while I was a student growing up, which still hurt my feelings. I have heard children cry when they were older because it's so very hard for them to see that there is no meaning, no family.

As to the meaning, I've often asked myself, "What do you mean when you say there is only one life? The one with happiness all the time." But for a family, their life seems as endless and meaningless as their childhood.


One of my former classmates once told me: "'A lot of kids grow up with laughter. It's a good thing at first. But when you get older, it gets a little bit more difficult.'"
