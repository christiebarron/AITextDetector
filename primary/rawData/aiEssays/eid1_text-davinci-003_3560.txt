Censoring materials in libraries can be a complex and controversial subject. While many people believe that libraries should provide an open forum for information and ideas, we should also not ignore the fact that certain materials, like books, music, movies, and magazines, can contain offensive material that many people consider to be unfit for library patrons. Increasingly, libraries have begun exercising censorship over which materials can be housed and accessed within their walls.

From a freedom of speech standpoint, some may argue that libraries, as public institutions, should provide access to a broad range of materials, regardless of whether or not they are deemed offensive. But unfortunately, certain materials can be offensive or disturbing to some and can have a negative impact on library patrons. In extreme cases, this can even lead to unsafe conditions, such as when a library has been targeted as a meeting place for hate groups. 

In such cases, library staff must weigh the potential benefits and risks of carrying a particular material. If the potential harm or potential for offense outweighs the potential benefit, then it may be appropriate to exercise censorship and exclude that material from the shelves. This is especially the case with materials containing graphic depictions of violence, pornographic images, or hate speech.
