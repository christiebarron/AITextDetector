I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a violation of human rights, because in the last fifty years I have seen very little government censorship of any kind whatsoever. I've seen no government censoring my work here in California or anywhere else, since it's been banned. I don't know of a single time I've asked for an official government response at my library. I've seen that government censorship, I don't think, is an exaggeration. To ask for the answer is to ask the people of California, for example, if they wish to read those same texts, what they would do with them instead? The people of California, they would stop, they'd make that choice, not just for books, but all the bookstores and the libraries. Of course, they would, not just print them, but in a huge book store, in many cases. That's what it took for the law to be repealed. I don't think that's a reasonable response. I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a violation of human rights. I have no reason to think that the government has this right. I'm not advocating that, no. I'm a liberal and I think we can overcome it. I think those issues are so much more consequential than what it is, for me, that I'm happy to sit where I am. I'm all for protecting free speech; I'm not sure we can fight censorship while we're all in the same room thinking about this.
