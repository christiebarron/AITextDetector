In Joe Kurmaski’s poem “Rough Road Ahead,” the cyclist must navigate a difficult and dangerous terrain in order to reach his destination. The features of the setting in this poem play an integral part in providing context and highlighting the struggles of the cyclist.

The poem describes the cyclist as “simply pushing harder, harder, harder” in order to ascend a steep, long, and winding road. The long winding road serves as an imposing obstacle for the cyclist as he is met with an uphill challenge. The difficulty of the incline is further highlighted by the fact that the cyclist has already been described as feeling tired and is struggling to continue.

The poem also mentions the surrounding trees and darkened sky, providing a feeling of loneliness and isolation as the cyclist continues his journey. The lack of companionship combined with the hard road ahead creates a difficult undertaking that the cyclist must bear alone.

The poem eventually culminates with the cyclist reaching an intersection, which serves to symbolize the decision he must make. Will he take the road less traveled, or will he take the road most conventional? This decision is reflective of many similar ones the cyclist has made and will make in his life, and demonstrates the effect that the challenge of the physical environment can have on one's personal choices.

In “Rough Road Ahead,” Kurmaski beautifully captures the challenges and obstacles faced by the cyclist on his journey. Through
