In recent years, the debate over censorship in libraries has been a source of contention. It is natural for people to disagree about the boundaries of acceptable public content, especially when those boundaries have the potential to affect the availability of materials in our public libraries. As such, it is important for us to consider both sides of the argument when it comes to censorship in libraries. 

On one hand, many people argue that libraries should be allowed to keep a wide range of materials in their collections without government interference. They point out that libraries serve an essential role in the community as public institutions dedicated to education and intellectual growth, and should not be censored. By allowing libraries to stockpile a wide variety of books, music, movies, and magazines, we give people the opportunity to explore the widest range of knowledge and ideas, which is vital for a thriving society. 

On the other hand, a strong argument can also be made for censoring certain materials that are found to be offensive. Many people believe that any material that can be considered to be potentially damaging should be removed or restricted from library shelves. This includes materials that have the potential to incite violence or promote hatred and discrimination towards any group. When libraries remove this type of material from their shelves, it sends a clear message that they do not condone such content and that it is not acceptable in our society. 

Ultimately, the decision to censor or not to censor library materials should be left to the discretion of the library.
