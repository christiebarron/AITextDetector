I recently was having a hard time dealing with something, and I didn't know what to do. I was getting really frustrated and on the verge of giving up. But then my friend stepped in and showed immense patience with me. They reassured me that things would get better, and that they were there for me. 

They kept telling me to take my time, and to not be too hard on myself, and that made me feel so much better. They never judged my decisions or belittled my attempts to work through the problem; instead they remained empathetic and encouraging. 

Eventually, their patience and understanding paid off and I was able to work through the situation successfully. I will be forever grateful to my friend for their patience and encouragement in such a difficult time. I truly believe that without their patience, I would not have been able to steady my course and find the resolution I needed.
