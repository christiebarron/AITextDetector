The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They had to accommodate a huge number of passengers while also giving rise to a number of problems:

• They tended to keep everything in a hangar.

• The building lacked a building safety system.

• The engineers at the building couldn't make sure the windows had been raised correctly with a high surface of concrete and the concrete floor had been heated enough.

The building had to accommodate a total of eight people. When the engineers found out the size of the problem, the engineers told them the building would get filled to capacity and couldn't accept more than 10 people. That forced the building designers to change the floor plan so it would accommodate only five people. When they realized that a maximum of 10 people could fit into that configuration, they had to build one to accommodate 12 people.

In order to avoid the other problems, architects built one to accommodate eight people, but at the end of February 1991, when I was the project director at the building, they decided to give the building six people a seat and just wait until the other six people would come around. fined, then fired.

The designers also told the city that if they would take the opportunity to have five extra people available in the meantime, they were going to be forced to give them no more than five seats.
