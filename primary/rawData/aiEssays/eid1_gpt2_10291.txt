Many things are better than one thing at a time. There's a whole spectrum at work, and sometimes if someone fails to recognize one of the strengths of another it might bring trouble. Some people do a good job, but they're not going to fix any of them.

Maybe if it was harder for it. Maybe one day you'd have something to work on. Maybe your head is big, and you're thinking of new things. They're all working at the wrong time. But try thinking and solving the problem.
