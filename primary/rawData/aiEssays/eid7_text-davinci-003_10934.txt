I was waiting in line at the grocery store, and I noticed the cashier was extremely slow. I could feel my frustration rising, but I quickly reeled in my temper. I remembered how hard everyone at the store was working to keep everyone safe and to make it efficient. I reminded myself to be patient.

I patiently waited, and eventually it was my turn. When I finally got to the counter, the cashier explained that she was having trouble with the new scanner. She was visibly frustrated and stressed. Even though I was also running late, I smiled and kindly greeted her. I asked her if she needed any help, and we worked together to figure out how to solve her issue.

Once we fixed the scanner, I was able to pay for my groceries quickly and efficiently. On my way out, I thanked the cashier for her hard work. This wasn't be the last time I would have to wait in line at the store, but I was so proud of myself for remaining patient despite the difficult circumstances.
