For many, the problem at the top of the Empire State Building and around the world is the complex's architecture because it's comprised of hundreds of structures that are different from one another—an area called "the geology of the Empire State Building."

"It is very important to have a diverse skyline that provides a very different perspective of the architecture," says Toni. "It helps maintain the space and maintain the uniqueness of the space."
