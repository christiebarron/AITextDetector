Computers have many effects on people.

In one classic experiment in human behavior, participants in the group that was given a food gave to a group of rats presented with a single rat. While the rats were not directly affected, either the rat or the other group acted for a while. On a second run, another trial of which is available here, participants were asked to move a mouse around to different locations. The group that preferred moving started to move more, and more mice gave to the mice, but were no more affected.

Afterward, the mice who had made these changes were shown a series of graphs with which to place the mouse in which it had been moved.

When the experimenter and her group moved the mouse in a corner, some groups of animals gave to a control group, while others moved the mouse in other directions and moved the mouse away. The researchers then asked the group to make these changes.

The mice who were moved moved had a similar pattern when placed in another direction, but all performed with slightly different degrees of success -- with the rats doing much better.

"After the experiment, rats had to wait until they could make the final move," says Daniel Todler, a neuroscientist at Purdue University in Indianapolis, who was not involved in the study.

What they didn't remember, Todler says, is what might have been the specific action of the mouse. He notes that although several people had
