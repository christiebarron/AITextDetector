I was out for lunch with my best friend and we’d been talking for hours. We’d gone through everything from our kids’ latest antics to our respective careers and when I finally looked at the time, I realized it was almost 6 pm! I stood up to start the journey home, but my friend said she lacked the energy and couldn’t get herself out of the chair. 

So we just sat there for a few minutes and I began giggling. My friend looked up at me in confusion and I just shrugged and said, “Oh, I don’t know… I guess I just think it’s kind of silly that we’re still here.”

That’s all it took to set off a chain reaction of laughter. We quickly fell into hysterics, uncontrollably slapping the table and trying not to snort. We were still there when the lights began to dim in the restaurant and eventually the wait staff had to come ask us to leave.

We walked out of the restaurant still snickering and making jokes about the whole situation. That simple exchange of laughter brought us closer together than ever before. I was happy to know that laughter could bridge even the largest of gaps and make two people instantly connected.
