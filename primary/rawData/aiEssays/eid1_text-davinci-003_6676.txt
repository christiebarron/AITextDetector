Dear Editor,

Technology is changing the world as we know it. One of the most prevalent changes is undoubtedly seen in the use of computers. Their potential to make people’s lives easier, and even revolutionize certain industries, is undeniable. However, there are also some potential negative effects computers can have. 

It’s no secret that heavy computer use can be harmful for physical health, reducing physical activity and even leading to various problems over extended periods of time. However, the mental health effects that come into play must also be taken into consideration. Spending too much time on a computer can lead to a sedentary lifestyle in individuals, leading to mental health issues such as depression and anxiety. 

Additionally, computers have also had a profound effect on the way we socialize. It’s easy to get caught up in social media, where we become so obsessed with what others are doing that we forget to take care of ourselves. The consequences are addiction, alienation, and a lack of real-life socialization. 

While computers can undoubtedly make things easier and more efficient, it is important to be mindful of their potential effects. I hope readers will agree that it is necessary to take breaks from the computer regularly, keep physical activity in the mix, and focus more on the things we do with our own hands and in person. 

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
