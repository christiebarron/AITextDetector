Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion that the pervasive presence of computers in our lives has had both negative and positive effects on people. 

On the one hand, computers certainly have improved many aspects of our lives. They have allowed us to automate and streamline processes in industries such as finance, logistics, and healthcare. Furthermore, advances in technology have enabled us to communicate more effectively and explore the world from the comfort of our homes.

On the other hand, there are some negative effects of computer use that I find concerning. As businesses and organizations increasingly rely on computers, the potential for errors and malfunctions has only increased. This may lead to serious issues such as compromised user security, breach of confidentiality, and even data loss. Additionally, the increasingly sedentary lifestyle accompanying computer use is a risk factor for poor posture and poor health.

I urge the readers to consider the potential risks that accompanied computer use. Companies should prioritize maintaining tight security measures and users should ensure that they communicate securely, use ergonomic equipment, and take regular breaks from their computers.

Thank you for allowing me to share my opinion. 

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
