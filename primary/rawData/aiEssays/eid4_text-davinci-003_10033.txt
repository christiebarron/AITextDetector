The final line of the poem is a hopeful reminder that with the cycle of the seasons, there is opportunity for new beginnings. Winter Hibiscus is about a young girl who doesn't do well on a test that she takes but finds solace in a hibiscus plant she comes across. This test symbolizes the expectations and difficulties associated with growing up and the worry that comes with not meeting them. By ending with an optimistic note looking forward to a new chance to do better in the coming season, Minfong Ho is conveying the idea that even when faced with difficult challenges, it is possible to move on and hope for a better future.
