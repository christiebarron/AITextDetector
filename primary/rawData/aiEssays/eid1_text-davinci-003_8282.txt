The idea of accommodating dirigibles, or large airships of the type used in the early 20th century, came about in 1931. The obstacles encountered in efforts to have dirigibles dock onto the Empire State Building were numerous and complex.

First, the question of how to secure the airships onto the building needed to be addressed. It was decided that a 200-foot-long mooring mast should be built with a cable running up to the top. This cable was to be attached to the airship, so that when dirigibles approached the Empire State Building, they would loop their ropes around this cable and then the cable could be secured to the side of the building.

The problem of the building’s weight also needed to be addressed. Lüsted’s “The Mooring Mast” article cites that the Empire State Building has “a steel skeleton of interlaced girders and trusses that is supported on footings directly underneath the foundation”. This meant that the addition of a mooring mast, with its weight and cable, could prove to be too much for the building’s frame. It was, therefore, necessary to reinforce the Empire State Building’s steel frame in order to support the
