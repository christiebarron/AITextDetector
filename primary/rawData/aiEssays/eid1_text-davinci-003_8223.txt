The concept of airplanes docking on skyscrapers and dirigibles dropping off passengers at the top of the tallest building in the world is an exciting one. However, the fact that the Empire State Building, built in 1931, was designed to accommodate dirigibles was met with a number of difficulties and enormous engineering challenges. The article "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted explains the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building had to face in order to make dirigibles docking a reality. 

The idea of dirigibles docking on the Empire State Building originated with the airplane designer, William E. Boeing. He proposed it to the architect, William F. Lamb, and the idea was accepted. Soon enough, the Empire State Building's design was modified to feature a 200-foot steel transmitting tower atop the structure, designed with platform 51 on the 87th floor for the dirigibles to dock.

The biggest obstacle the builders had to overcome was structural stability. In order to make docking a reality, the existing framework of the building had to be considerably altered to provide additional support for the transmitting tower, as it was originally designed to sit on top of the 78th floor. The original foundation had to be restructured to carry the load of the added tower. In addition, strong steel cables and other thick components were added for additional structural strength. Since arch-style construction couldn’t be used to support the tower due to
