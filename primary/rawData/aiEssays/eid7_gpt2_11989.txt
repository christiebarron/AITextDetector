An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my wife, who had her first miscarriage at 16. She did not want to suffer from this disease and just wanted the chance to be home with her children and spend more time together.

She is also on antibiotics and has made good progress in her recovery. I have learned how to speak Portuguese, how to read a Portuguese language textbook now, and my husband is now able to be with us. I am now also receiving better medical advice, with improved training. We have given birth with little disruption to the baby and we were quite glad we did.

When I wrote about me for the first time in 2007, then, I said, "I'm just a baby girl. Just like I can't feel the same and I never really get what I want." It went from that.

When I first heard about my mother, not only did I get to meet her, I got to know her. Her name is MÃ¡rquez, and she's not very good with words. She speaks only Portuguese. But I remember very well what I would say or say and see and she replied at the time, "She is so calm. I know all about her and she's so proud of me."

We have now married for 21 years, and this has not really changed my life. It is my experience that life is not so easy when you don't feel connected to any of these people around
