The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In 1967, a team of architects from the United State Building Trust and the Pennsylvania Art Commission teamed up with the state department of interior to attempt to improve the vertical space of the buildings.

This year, the Federal Transit Administration and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation approved the final version of these elevators to allow vehicles to reach an height of 25 feet. They're set to be placed through four platforms, not one.

"It's a very unique concept here â€” it won't be accessible to the public," said Paul Sisson, a spokesman for the Federal Transit Administration. "The only things that will allow that vertical height are the elevators themselves."

These elevators were not designed for vehicular purposes. Rather, they serve as a means of connecting two spaces: one to the ground, and two behind it.

The government of the day called it "sport-oriented" for its use, but those who wished to design cars or other transport-related objects such as lights and trucks needed a way to keep up with the pace of the rush to accommodate new cars and trucks.

"It's like a big airport shuttle that's made up of buses and trains that go at a steady rate to the ground of the platform and that continues to move up and down for several minutes just as they pass by or stay right next to it," said James Wainwright
