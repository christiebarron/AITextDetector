As I watched the line slowly move forward, I felt my frustration growing. It was the sixth time that week I had to wait in line at the DMV, and I was anxious to get out of there and get on with my day. 

Finally, my turn to take my test came. I was incredibly nervous, and time seemed to move so slowly. With each minute that passed, I expected the examiner to ask me to come back the following week. 

But instead, he was incredibly patient. He didn’t rush me, he didn’t ask me to speed up - he just allowed me to go at my own pace. I was still nervous, but his understanding attitude made me feel secure. He helped me when I made a mistake, and gave me the chance to go back and try again.

At the end, I finished the test successfully and the examiner congratulated me. His patience had made all the difference, and I was so thankful for his understanding attitude.
