Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. While 'Rough Road Ahead' was originally conceived as a 'roughness test' on the West End to evaluate the effects of 'Good Or Bad', it was later moved to this setting where a range of other conditions, such as 'Doorways' or other restrictions have been included in the final version. The resulting range (which is slightly more extensive than before) is also slightly smaller. The following table shows two ways of looking at how it compares to 'Roughroad Ahead'.


The following are two of the more notable aspects which have not been shown here. One can point either to the differences in the width, height and weight of the 'Rough Road Ahead' conditions or to the different modes of cycling (in this case, road riding), which differ between each version of the setting. The differences, as reflected in Table 1 above, are most noticeable in the 'Roughroad Ahead' range.
