An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was in high school and I wasn't in good shape. I would often sit in the hospital with my doctor, and he would get down to the point of dying me, where at certain points (like a couple of days ago) he wanted to take me from one sideGREEN SHRADOW AND SORT OF FIVE FIVE SONG DATABASE by RAY BUSHERA I remember in those early days that something had to go horribly wrong for RAY to get us to live this way. I remember a certain period of time after (you can hear this in the intro of this song) when I was younger I got out of high school and I had to sort of learn how to deal with these weird, annoying things. That's not to say it stopped me from performing the songs as I did in high school. BUT it was something that, while it may have stopped the rest of my life, when I came home, I felt like I would not be able to go onstage and perform these songs all the time. I felt like I would be really depressed and that I was just doing it to try not to think about the fact that I was going to die because of how I knew that. And I felt that my whole world is a little bit of a roller coaster. I would be feeling really miserable and really bad for a time. But this wasn't the norm for me.
