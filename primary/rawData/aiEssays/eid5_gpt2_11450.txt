The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is also reflective of Trump's growing concern that Russia and the Trump campaign are being manipulated by Russian intelligence services.

In January, Trump called Putin "a terrible person," noting that he was often portrayed as a "weak" leader and accused him of being a "brave" leader.

Trump's campaign has made no secret of its support for Clinton.

"We're going to be so tired of having Russia go after Hillary Clinton or even Hillary Clinton again," Trump said during the campaign, according to The Washington Post. His comments "clearly showed Trump to have a lot of support."

Trump's supporters point to his "America First" campaign slogan, which includes his endorsement of a pro-Russia law and his pledge to support a "soft on crime" immigration plan that would allow people to stay in the country after deportation if they're caught on video.
