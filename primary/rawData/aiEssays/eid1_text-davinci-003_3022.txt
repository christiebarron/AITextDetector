Dear Editor,

I am writing to you regarding my opinion on the effects computers have on people.

In the past decade, computers have been an integral part of our lives. From maximizing our productivity to connecting with people all around the world, computers have opened doors to many possibilities.

On the other hand, computers can have a detrimental effect on peopleâ€™s wellbeing. For example, extended usage of computers has been linked to mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and headaches. Furthermore, with people spending more and more time indoors on their computers, physical health may also be affected.

I believe it is important to recognize the effects computers have on us and take a step back from them to protect our mental and physical health. This may include limiting our screen time or take part more in activities such as outdoor sports that encourage physical activity.

It is often easy for us to forget the effects of computers, but I urge the readers to consider my opinion and be mindful of the way the use of computer may be affecting our health.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
