The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. By 1938, they had already developed a number of other techniques, including the introduction of laser-etched displays and advanced laser-fasteners to control the beam of the beams, and a number of other improvements.[23] The first one was the concept of a 'Capello Laser' which used beam waves to increase the thickness of light while decreasing its speed. Later they added the use of optical refractory mirrors which would increase the size of the telescope by about 1-1/2 to 3 centimeters. Laser designators and engineers began to refine this idea with the introduction of an anti-sponge (which was made by the Japanese) and lasers, also by the early 1930s. In February 1936, a Japanese laser cutter was unveiled as part of its planned modernization of the Empire State Building.[24] The first phase of the project was to install the laser dish through the roof of the main windows. To put the laser dish through the exterior, the first building to do so was the Empire State House of the State.[25]

In April 1936 the U.S. Air Force issued "Operation Fission Zone". This was just three years after the launch of the Empire State Building. There was much speculation concerning the possible use of a 'Empire State building' as part of the construction of Japan's second nuclear-armed, nuclear-powered, military-independent, and
