The Empire State Building was an amazing feat of engineering, and the challenge of allowing dirigibles to dock at the pinnacle of its structure was an incredible challenge for the builders to undertake. Dirigibles, or airships, of the early twentieth century posed significant obstacles to the designers and engineers working on the project. 

The mooring mast that the Empire State Building was specifically designed for was an intricate structure made of four steel struts that had to be carefully and precisely located. The steel had to be joined so that it had a maximum of strength and stability, yet at the same time not be too heavy to be lifted and maneuvered. The four struts made a circle around the top of the building and they were held in place by two parallel bridges made of steel that ran parallel to the struts and connected them to the top of the building. A thick metal cable ran between the steel bridges and was connected to the mooring mast. This setup was necessary for a dirigible to effectively attach to the building.

As Marcia Amidon Lüsted explains in her book The Mooring Mast, the engineers had to figure out how to securely moor the dirigible to the building, so that it didn’t move or shift. The mooring mast itself had to be able to take the stress of the ship, and it had to be strong enough to be able to hold the weight of the dirigible when it was docked
