Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. It is a very straightforward setting that will allow the cyclist to keep the distance they have been forced to.

However, it is most effective in the more 'unimaginative mode' scenario where the cyclist is only travelling at the "low speed" for short breaks and not to move too much past cyclists.

It is also quite an effective 'fast travelling' setting in other situations that involve the cyclist stopping and running away from dangerous roads.
