Dear Editor: 

I'm writing to discuss the effects of computers and electronics on people, and how we should perceive them. In the modern world, it's hard to imagine life without computers, and the convenience they provide us. We're able to pursue knowledge, be connected with people around the world, and have a wealth of new opportunities that were never available before computers.

However, like most good things, computers can also be detrimental; long hours of staring at a computer screen can cause eye strain, and too little physical activity can lead to more serious health issues, such as heart disease, obesity, and diabetes. Interacting through a computer screen can lead to isolation, and spending too much time in the digital world can lead to difficulties with social communication.

That's why it's important to remember that computers should be used in moderation. While the positive aspects should not be underestimated, we need to remain aware of the possible negative effects, and take steps to minimize them. For example, ensure screen time is limited by setting a timer, and encourage physical activity by going outside.

I'm sure readers can agree that computers can certainly be beneficial when used responsibly. We need to remember to keep balance,
