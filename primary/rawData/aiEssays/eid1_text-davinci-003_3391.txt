Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects that computers have had on people in today's world. computers have had a huge impact on how we lead our lives, from communication and entertainment to business and industry.

The advances that technology has made in computers has drastically changed how we interact with one another and how we store, organize and access information. Life has become simpler and more efficient, with computers performing tasks that were once laborious and time consuming.

However, one major downside to increased computer usage is that it can lead to unhealthy levels of sedentary behavior. Sitting in front of a computer for long periods of time can have harmful effects on our health, including backache, eyestrain, neck and shoulder pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, and depression.

Therefore, I believe that it is important to strike a balance between computer usage and physical activity. It is important to remember to take breaks, do some stretching and walking, and ensure that computers are kept at a comfortable distance and height. Taking steps to prevent overexertion from computers will benefit everyone and should be something we all aim to do.

The increased use of computers has made our lives easier. However
