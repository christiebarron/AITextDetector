The construction of the Empire State Building was an immense challenge, and allowing it to accommodate dirigibles was a monumental engineering feat. Dirigibles had only become popular forms of transportation in the early 20th century, so the builders of the Empire State Building had to come up with a creative way to allow them to dock safely. In Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s book, The Mooring Mast: How a Dog and a Dolphin Saved a Family, readers get an inside look at the obstacles the builders faced in allowing dirigibles to dock.

One of the most significant obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock was the height of the building. At 1,250 feet, the building was far taller than most structures of the time, making it difficult to find appropriate mooring structures that could safely accommodate the airships. Another issue was the winds at the top of the structure. The Empire State Building is surrounded by buildings that can create a typhoon of turbulent air currents, and these windy conditions would make it difficult for a dirigible to dock, let alone steady itself long enough for passengers to disembark.

Additionally, the Empire State Building was constructed atop an unusual bedrock formation known as Inwood marble. This dense rock was difficult to drill through, and finding appropriate anchor points for the dirigibles was a major challenge. Lastly, the bustling city of New York posed its own difficulties.
