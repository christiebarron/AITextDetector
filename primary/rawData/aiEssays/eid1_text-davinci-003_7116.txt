The setting of 'Rough Road Ahead', Joe Kurmaski's short story about a cyclist's struggles, has a significant effect on the cyclist. Set in the Midwest of the United States, the unique landscape of rolling hills and unpredictable weather creates a challenge for the cyclist. 

The hills create a real challenge as the cyclist has to rely on his own pedal power to get up them. This forces him to dig deep in order to reach the top, but the feeling of accomplishment is well worth it when he does. The unpredictable weather also adds an element of uncertainty as the cyclist has to deal with sudden storms or extreme temperatures. This can be dangerous and uncomfortable, but he must press on to reach his destination.

In addition, the rural nature of the Midwest presents its own set of challenges as there are fewer resources available than in an urban area. The cyclist must learn to make do with what is available and remember to pack only what is essential, as well as knowing exactly where he is going and what he needs. This takes a great deal of planning and preparation in order to be successful.

Overall, the features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead'. The hills, unpredictable weather, and rural environment create an enormous challenge that must be met with determination in order to succeed. Despite the hardship, the cyclist is determined to continue and reach his destination, and ultimately does so successfully.
