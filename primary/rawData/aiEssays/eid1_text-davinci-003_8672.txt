I was heading to the airport to pick up my best friend from college for their first visit since we graduated. We had been texting all morning, anticipating their arrival and I was eager to finally see them in person.

When my friend's plane arrived and they exited, we both ran towards each other and embraced. We had so much news to catch up on that we had to share as we headed back to my place.

On the way back home, I hit a huge pothole and my friends started laughing hysterically. I asked what was so funny and they said, “It just reminded me of the time you tried to drive us back to campus and your tire popped! We had to leave your car on the side of the highway and hitchhike the rest of the way.”

We laughed and laughed until tears were streaming down our faces, remembering our wild college adventures as we drove back home. We were both grateful for the chance to reunite and share old stories and even a few good laughs.
