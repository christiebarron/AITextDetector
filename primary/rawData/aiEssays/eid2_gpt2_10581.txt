I believe that censorship of materials in libraries, and especially publications, can benefit the state from the increased freedom to publish those materials," he said.

This report does not cover all of Europe, but it does look at how the EU has used its powers of choice to censor the news and information online in the past few years.

The European Commission, led by Commissioner Jos√© Manuel Barroso, told the Commission a week ago that it was not involved in the ongoing case. At the time, the Commission had expressed shock at how the law could have played its role.

"What we cannot say at the moment is how we would have reacted if itPrefixed the word'spy'. There is no legal justification whatsoever for doing something like that at hand," said Ralf Baaderhut, Director, Media Relations (LPR).

"The Commission wants to give us the maximum and proper space to move on with their process to deal with these issues that, if not already covered by the law, could arise, not only in media but also in public life as well as on social media," he added.
