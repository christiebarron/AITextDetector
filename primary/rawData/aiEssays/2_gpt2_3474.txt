I believe that censorship of materials in libraries has not done much good, but there are a couple reasons why I believe it has. First, in order to avoid the public's annoyance, the most important means of avoiding censorship for libraries are via voluntary publishing. Public libraries can also be paid to publish books from their schools - in which case they tend to publish the works from those schools, rather than being able to get permission outright, especially when children are learning about such books. If you can afford a private subscription to a library with the right amount of money, it might sound more than acceptable, but if you can create a company or service like the one we have, you get a bit of freedom, because for us it makes no difference. Second, we already have a huge body of free software libraries that we can distribute freely. For our purposes, it makes sense to make a company that owns an online resource to publish and publish books from a non-profit organization. Of course, the service and availability of books would go a long way in enabling a broader public to have a voice in free software libraries. A business would be able to sell its products in a similar way, and be forced to sell books online. This in turn would not only help people build products, but would even prevent further conflicts of interests. I think it does absolutely nothing at all for the community to be able to do a good job of distributing free software.

In some ways, these considerations can make much
