I was completely embarrassed when I walked into the room and saw everyone looking at me. I had managed to spill coffee all over the front of my shirtâ€”great first impression on a new job. As the moment stretched while they waited for me to speak, I heard a giggle in the back of the room. Thinking I could use the situation to my advantage, I decided to go with it.

"You guys sure know how to make someone feel welcome," I said, walking over to the desk I had been using.

One of the stern faces in the room broke into a smile, followed shortly by another, and then another. Then, the whole room burst into laughter. I laughed too and it felt like a wave of acceptance coming over me. Everyone in the room saw the humor in me spilling my coffee, and while I still felt embarrassed, the laughter helped bridge the gap between me and the other employees.

Although the laughter was initially about me, it soon shifted to the funny stories and jokes being shared among the group. I knew I had been accepted into the fold as I was included in the conversation and found myself laughing along with everyone else. As the laughter lingered, I realized I had made invaluable connections in a short time and that it was the laughter that made it possible.
