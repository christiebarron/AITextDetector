Computers have many effects on people. Some benefit the most from getting better at their specific skill sets. Even very good chess players might be able to improve their techniques dramatically even if their IQs are low because their mental powers don't improve much compared to them. In a study published in the journal Psychology of Communication, they reported the effects of chess on mental performance in 11 general intelligence test participants who performed identical levels of intelligence in the same room. All of them reported greater mental concentration in the same room and increased mental effort at a similar level in that room. They were in agreement that having more mental capacity is very beneficial to the mind.


One other fact is that there are three main stages in human psychogenesis: evolution, childhood development, and cognitive development. The first stage may be described as the pre- and post-natal stages that the brain developed before the first two stages. This is where the differences between the brains of animals evolve.

Evolutionary Theory of Mind-Behavior Differences

One of the most widely researched evolutionary approaches to mind control, called evolution of the prefrontal cortex, is that brain cells will differentiate into various types of neurons in order to form new, larger networks. All of the neurons in the prefrontal cortex will be in one particular network to function in that particular network, and thus the network will be able to form new connections. The brain and cell are called synapses, and only the cortical networks form connections.

The second stage
