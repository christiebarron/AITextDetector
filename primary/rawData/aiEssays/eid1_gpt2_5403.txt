Computers have many effects on people. On one side, they cause the system to crash in some cases. On the other, they cause the system to break and cause us as a whole to lose our own life.

But for a big part of this equation, the impact seems almost negligible. What if there was a massive quantum computer which could see quantum waves and read them into our system? What if the quantum computer could actually know where our data was and what is in it?

A few decades ago, I wrote a paper in Nature Communications detailing some of these possibilities. In their first edition, a new computer (not my design) could not see the data in our quantum system. Instead, it was able to do so by recording a short series of signals Untold by the quantum computer, known as an entangled state. The signal is a tiny photon: it cannot be seen by any living thing. We can't look at it. If quantum computers could hear the quantum waves, they would be impossible to read.

And in recent years, big quantum computers have brought us closer to a future where the quantum computer can actually see what this entangled state means for usâ€”a world where "we" and "our" are exactly the same thing. I can see this very well here; I'm very excited! I would just like to thank God for such a chance to see this incredible possibility in action. It's nice to hear that there is a strong desire
