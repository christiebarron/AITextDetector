The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, the FAA was reluctant to let dirigibles dock on Federal land from Alaska, and so instead authorized the building agencies to designate their own craft to operate on Federal land. Once again, these agencies were subject to federal limitations, and when the Federal Aviation Administration changed its policy on using commercial aircraft as part of aviation facilities, a portion of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration approved that type of designation in May 1958. The Federal Construction and Regulatory Commission's 1977 final rule changed, but was still not effective in the face of numerous objections from the commercial aviation community who wanted to put their own spacecraft on a Federal land and who felt they were unable to justify doing so.

In late 1954, a new aircraft manufacturer, Dyson, began building a high-performance rocket motor for the National Academies' "Autonomous Atlas V" class of research spacecraft. It was called the "Astronauts Need Launchinational Shuttle" because it was the first to be flown by commercial airlines without a dedicated launchpad to house one of NASA's satellites. (The shuttle was later scrapped after the Apollo program.) After the NASA program was eliminated entirely in the late 1960s, a major obstacle was found, a cost-benefit analysis by the company, and a decision became mandatory. (The shuttle had just been refurbished.) The contractor, Dyson, sold its first commercial passenger aircraft to a commercial
