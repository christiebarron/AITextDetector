Computers have many effects on people.

It is easy to learn. Once you are a computer, you have a hard time in your job. Your friends keep telling you to get jobs at work, so they get you in, buy your first home, have children. These are all jobs we did well.

The dream of the modern family means the following:

A home where you can share in the care and care of your children.

A family that includes a computer so they can understand what it is like to work with, including a place by the river to make meals, a car, and a room.

A place where the kids and people of any age can stay and have fun even if the conditions are not the most favorable.

A place where they can learn basic subjects.
