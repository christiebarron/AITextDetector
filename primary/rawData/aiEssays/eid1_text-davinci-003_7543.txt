The line at the end of Winter Hibiscus is meant to symbolize the inevitability of change and the unending cycle of life. It introduces a sense of hopefulness and acceptance by acknowledging that spring will inevitably come around again and with it, a new opportunity to take the test. Even though the weather is cold and dreary in the winter and it can seem difficult to continue, there is the promise of new beginnings on the horizon. The imagery of the geese returning and the hibiscus budding is a reminder that life can always find a way to survive and thrive in the face of adversity.
