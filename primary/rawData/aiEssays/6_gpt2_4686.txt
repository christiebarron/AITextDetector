The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The largest of the two was their reliance on the building of an overhead projector to record the shots they sent into space, though this did not have much of an effect.

The second obstacle was the use of a projector for this purpose, which was limited to the projection of up to a 300 megapixel (about 20 feet) high projection. The idea was that an overhead beam of a 30 mm wavelength would be able to read the sun's rays and create a very accurate photo of the scene.

This concept was only developed once in the 20th century, due to a technological problem, when it was found that high beam technology simply did not work.

In 1920, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the agency that developed the high beam, came up with a solution, called a high-frequency projector. The goal of this was to produce images at twice the scale of an image that would be produced by the projector of an ordinary projector (a 200 megapixel projection,letes the standard film). This is a high-gain, high-density projector capable of producing 20 megapixel images using only 30 photofibers. This concept was a long time away from becoming reality for the projectors it was designed to replace, and a new projector was developed with a 1.6-megapixel projection that could be mounted vertically by simply raising an object over it. It is
