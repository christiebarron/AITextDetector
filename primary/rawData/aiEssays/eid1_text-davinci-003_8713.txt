I remember the first time I laughed with my husband. It was one of those awkward meet-cutes—I was visiting my friend who lived right near him, and he was her new roommate. He had an infectious grin and a laid-back attitude, so I was instantly drawn to him. We wound up talking for hours and bonded over our sarcastic comments about the mild winter weather we were both experiencing. We were both making fun of it when we both accidentally sneezed at the same time. We were like two little kids, laughing at our bad timing and then rubbing our noses simultaneously. It was then that I knew I wanted to get to know him better. We started dating not long after and now, seven years later, we still find ourselves in fits of laughter over nothing significant and everything important. We make silly jokes, constantly ask each other silly questions, and just enjoy the sound of each other’s laughter. That first giggle we had has turned into a steady stream of laughter, and it’s given us an unending stream of joy.
