The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it's "a bit in the backwoods" or "about the local character," that character will end up in the stories.

"The Snowman's Backstory" is the sort of story that could be written on the fly. It's like a story about a guy trying to convince a person, "Oh the snowman's down there," or "Oh, I have to get down to business." The Snowman can't do that. He's a big guy, but the person he is tries to impress the people they call friends by giving them what he calls his "tribe mentality," which is that he's willing to do whatever it takes and just act as if he's right before they pull his sweater out and go to work.

But even at his worst, the Snowman only makes it through in the end only for two episodes. "The Snowman's Backstory" is an eight-episode book that only gives the reader two scenes in 10 episodes, which is pretty bad since every day you have to find a new story. It's also one of my favorites, so I don't think it needs to be on the page, but it certainly needs another ten episodes.

As for the rest of Season 3, "Snowman will continue to evolve, be more complicated, and have an extremely rich tradition," says Bryan Cranston, season one's voice director.
