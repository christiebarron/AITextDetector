The construction of the Empire State Building in the 1930s quickly changed the way people thought about skyscrapers, transforming tall buildings from a novelty to an expected part of urban life. One of the most notable features of the Empire State Building was the planned ability for dirigibles to dock, which would have been an ambitious feat of engineering. However, the process of building the infrastructure necessary for this docking was full of obstacles that needed to be overcome.

The first major obstacle was the height of the building. Dirigibles could only ascend to a certain height, and with the Empire State Building reaching the unprecedented 1,250 feet, the designers had to decrease the amount of framework interfering with the dock. This meant forgoing the use of steel in favor of lighter materials, such as aluminum alloys. This issue also required the Engineering Department to take into account the various propulsion methods of dirigibles as they could not easily attain the necessary altitude for docking.

The next obstacle to creating a usable docking mast was finding a way to power the necessary landing lights for dirigibles, as electricity consumption had to be kept at a minimum. To tackle this, an inventive method of battery power had to be developed that could sustain the lights without draining the building’s generators. This same method also had to be able to navigate the notoriously unpredictable New York City winds, as the Empire State Building’s aerodynamic design mean that gusts of wind could revolve around the
