Dear Editor, 

I am writing to share my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Computers are now an essential part of many peopleâ€™s lives and, although we often take them for granted, there are both positive and negative effects that we need to consider. 

On the one hand, computers have changed the way we work and play, making it much easier to get things done quickly. We can gain access to vast amounts of information at the push of a button, and we are also more connected with the world at large than ever before. All of this has opened up a wealth of opportunities that would not have been available in the past. 

On the other hand, computers can have some negative effects too. It can be argued that technological advances have made us passive consumers of information, and that we no longer engage our minds to the same extent that we used to. As we have become more dependent on computers, we have become less connected to nature, each other, and even ourselves. 

Overall, it is clear that computers can be both a blessing and a curse. With this in mind, I believe that we should use computers as a tool, rather than an end
