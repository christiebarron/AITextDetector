The builders of the Empire State Building faced various obstacles when attempting to build a docking station for dirigibles high atop the Empire State Building in New York City. The first obstacle was a lack of technical knowledge. At the time, it was still relatively unknown how to build a facility that would facilitate a safe docking of a dirigible. The second obstacle was associated with building materials. At the time of the construction, the engineering technology wasnâ€™t advanced enough to incorporate lightweight materials, such as aluminum or steel, into the design. The third obstacle was the weather. It had to be taken into account that no part of the station could be exposed to the winds that whipping around the Empire State Building from different directions. 

Before any of these potential solutions could be implemented, the engineers had to construct the motor mast or mooring mast, which connected to the anchoring mechanism set into the mooring station. To solve the lack of knowledge issue, the engineers consulted various experts in the field of dirigible navigation, engineering, and airship design. Their input was essential for figuring out the placement of the motor mast, the anchoring mechanism, the type of material to use on the metal plates, and more. 

The experts ultimately suggested a lightweight, titanium alloy motor mast that could resist the winds of the Empire State Building and also withstand the clamping pressure of the dirigibles. The engineers, however, had to find a way to construct such a
