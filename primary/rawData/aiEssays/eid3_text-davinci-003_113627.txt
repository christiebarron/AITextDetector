In the short story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, the features of the setting profoundly affect the cyclist, as the narrator attempts to cycle from Los Angeles to New York. The physical environment is described in great detail and colourfully conveys the dangers faced by the traveller.

The route chosen by the narrator is remote and sparsely inhabited, which adds to the sense of challenge and isolation. The narrator explains that they are “traveling the middle of nowhere,” a notion reinforced by descriptions of “a few lonely buildings” and “empty stretches of road.” This desolation creates a heightened sense of danger - particularly when coupled with the unpredictable weather that trails the cyclist. The narrator is subjected to violent windstorms, thunder and lightning and face near-impossible road conditions due to snow and mud.

The monotony of travelling for such long periods of time is often broken by the broken bridges and dangerous encounters that the cyclist discovers. The encounters with dangerous wildlife and hostile individuals serves function narratively, adding a level of danger and uncertainty that would have otherwise been missing from the story.

In short, the features of the setting in Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead” actively shape the cyclist’s journey, as all of these elements - from the unpredictable weather to the encounters with wildlife - have a profound psychological and physical effect on the narrator’s experience
