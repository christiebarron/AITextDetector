In Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead," the cyclist is affected by the features of the setting in multiple ways. 

To begin, the terrain of the road affects the cyclist significantly. The narrator notes that the road ahead is "dirt and rocks and potholes," making the journey tougher and riskier for the cyclist. This presents the cyclist with an obstacle to overcome, as it is more challenging for a cyclist to cross rougher terrain than smoother, paved roads. This terrain also presents safety issues, as the cyclist must careful navigate their way around any unexpected rocks, potholes, and other hazards that the road may present. 

The cyclist is also affected by the time of day that they are riding. The narrator describes the cyclist "traveling west into an orange sunset," with the setting sun "dipping low across the horizon," suggesting that it is early evening. This makes it difficult for the cyclist to see, especially as the terrain is already hazardous due to the dirt and rocks. The setting sun also means that night is quickly approaching and the cyclist must make it to their destination before the darkness falls. 

The weather of the setting can also affect the cyclist in numerous ways. It is implied that the weather is hot, as the sweat dripping from the cyclist is mentioned at multiple points in the poem. This heat contributes to the exhaustion and discomfort of the cyclist, making it harder or them to keep going.
