The Empire State Building is an iconic piece of the American skyline, its immense size and striking design making it an impressive structure. When it first opened in 1931, however, it was planned to feature something that would have been unique in the world–a docking station for dirigible airships. The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in order for this ambitious plan to be achieved.

The first obstacle was determining how to engineer a structure that could safely accommodate and anchor the airships to the building’s mast. An aeronautical specialist was consulted to design the mooring mast, who recommended an interesting design. Instead of the traditional cross beam design, the mast would feature a “step-lever

system”. This design would use four vertical “steps”, connected by a series of thick steel bands. These bands would be extended downward when an airship approached the Empire State Building, creating a strong structure to which the airship could attach its tether ropes.

The second obstacle related to the basic question of whether the mooring mast would be capable of safely handling the large and heavy airships. To determine this, extensive testing would be required. Thousands of pounds of sandbags had to be hung from the mooring mast in order to recreate the pressure exerted by the airship’s tether lines. In addition, the structure of the mooring mast was reinforced with multiple steel brackets and extra g
