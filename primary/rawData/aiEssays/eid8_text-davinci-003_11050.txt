It had been a long day. My partner had been up since 6 am, hustling and bustling to get ready for the day. By the time I got home at 9pm, he had already gone to bed. But as soon as I crept into bed, he woke up and started telling me about his day. 

Even though my eyes felt like they could barely stay open, his energy was contagious and I found myself laughing, despite my fatigue. There he was, telling me about how his boss had mistaken him for another employee, or how his efforts to finish an assignment early had been in vain. 

As I continued to laugh, he started to join in too. Soon, we were both sprawled in bed, laughing about the ridiculousness of his day. I'd forgotten how much laughter brings two people closer, especially after a tough day.

The best part? We weren't just laughing at silly things that happened to him...we were also laughing and joking around with each other. 

By the end of the night, we were both in tears, exhausted but happier and closer than before. Laughter really is the shortest distance between two people.
