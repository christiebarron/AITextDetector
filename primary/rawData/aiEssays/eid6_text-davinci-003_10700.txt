During the 1920s, the development of the Empire State Building captured the imaginations of the American public and the world at large. A revolutionary new engineering feat at the time, the building was one of the world’s tallest, and it represented the peak of modern technology. Part of this vision included the potential for dirigibles, or airships, to dock at the building’s spire. In Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s book “The Mooring Mast”, she details the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock.

One of the primary design problems the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the structure’s location and layout. Dirigibles were huge airships, and due to the size and weight of the mooring mast, it was necessary to place a landing platform on the top of the building. This platform had to be located in a place that was both secure and able to bear the load of large airships. Initially, designers planned to attach the mast directly to the spire of the building, however, the difficulty of anchoring it securely at that height made this plan impossible. Instead, a platform was constructed at 79th floor of the building -- a much more reasonable height and a much more feasible target for the large, airships.

In addition to the complexity of the mooring mast’s engineering, the builders of
