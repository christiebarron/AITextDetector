The construction of the Empire State Building in 1931 marked a new era in world architecture. The building was the tallest in the world, towering at 102 stories and 1,250 feet of steel and stone. At the time, there was also much excitement about the exciting new technology of dirigibles, or airships. An ambitious plan was proposed to construct a platform on the roof of the Empire State Building so that dirigibles could dock on the roof of the building. 

Although the plan seemed appealing, it faced many obstacles. The most significant one was structural. The Empire State Building, while tall and impressive, was not designed with a platform specifically in mind. Even if the structure could accommodate the platform, engineers were concerned that the weight of the dirigible could weaken the building’s frame. Additionally, the roof was not designed to handle the perils of weather or the vibrations of a grounded airship. High winds and turbulence of New York City posed serious threats to the safety of the landing platform.

In addition to the structural obstacles, there were various legal and financial hurdles to overcome. Lawmakers were hesitant to pass regulations that would enable dirigibles to dock in the city, and if a platform was allowed, it would almost certainly require a significant fee in order to cover passengers’ liability and any additional insurance costs. These fees, estimated to be around 20% of the total operating cost, posed a serious financial concern.

Ultimately, these
