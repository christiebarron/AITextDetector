Growing up, I shared a a bedroom with my brother. We were always in a competition for everything from who could fold their clothes faster to who could jump off our bunk bed the highest. We were always playfully bickering and giving each other a hard time. 

One day, my brother and I were playing a game on the floor near our beds and I spotted something he was trying to hide under his side of the bed. It was a new model car that he had just bought. I knew that he had been wanting it for a while and seeing his face when I asked him about it was priceless. He couldn't hide his excitement and neither could I. We both started to laugh uncontrollably.

It was in that moment that I realized how much closer we had become. Our shared laughter created a bond between us that would last a lifetime. We often look back on that moment and share a smile and a laugh.
