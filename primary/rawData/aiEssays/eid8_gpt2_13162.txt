One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my wife had to leave for work because he was not doing well. That's always funny but I think I've gotten very much better at it. I'm now going on and off and on and I guess I'm getting really good at it. So yeah, there's something to be said for people who take humor for granted and then start going on and off on and off and on. It's kind of my fault. I wasn't trying to make it to comedy, I wasn't trying to make money, I wasn't trying to make a living and hopefully I don't find that now that I've moved on. I'm just trying to just try, just make it fun.

So if you had the luxury of being a writer who knows how to get to comedy I would love to hear about it. You would love to hear of the writers who were able to pull it off. I'm so much better at writing than anybody else.
