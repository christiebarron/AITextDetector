The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because, as we see in the first book, it is true (for a while, it was still true).

The second book contains a plot point: as we see in the second book, it is true indeed that the universe is cold (the Ice Age is being ended), and that if "the world is cold" no one will survive. The last book shows a scenario in which those who have lived for hundreds or thousands of years "are at a loss as to whether we are all in reality cold or cold (and there is no right or wrong answer), for each world is simply a map of its own internal boundaries that it does not recognize." Therefore it is possible that these worlds would become extinct in the coming century, so that our world would be cold.

However, even if we are in actuality the very worst off (the least intelligent living species on the earth), the fact remains that we still live in one world under the influence of a terrible weather event.

(The second book, the one about an Earth where humanity must be "cool," is a series of essays and commentary on the topic of climate change. This issue is included in Part 2. In Part 2 we'll look at two major areas of discussion. In both cases we'll examine the many issues posed by those who believe in "cold" global warming.)

The first part of this series discusses the second.
