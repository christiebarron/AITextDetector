I remember it like it was yesterday. I had just gotten back home after a couple of days away, and was getting ready to check in with my family when the doorbell rang. When I opened the door, I was surprised to find that it was my brother. His face was red and his body was shaking with laughter.

He had been out with his friends and had stopped by to tell me a funny story. He told me that while in a restaurant one of his friends had dropped their fork off the table, and when they bent down to pick it up, someone had shouted sarcastically "Good catch!". The whole group had started laughing so hard at this that they had all toppled over, and the entire restaurant was in hysterics too.

When my brother told me the story, I couldn't help but start laughing. My laughter was contagious and soon we were both doubled over in laughter. It was moments like these that I always remembered: when laughter connected us like nothing else could.

From that day on, whenever we were home, we would joke and laugh about memories like this. And it didn't matter if it was a silly or a serious moment, laughter always seemed to make it easier to connect. Laughter was, after all, the shortest distance between two people.
