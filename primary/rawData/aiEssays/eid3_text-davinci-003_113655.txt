In Joe Kurmaski's short story 'Rough Road Ahead,' the cyclist finds himself in a difficult situation as he is heading down a road he knows is full of obstacles. The features of this setting play an integral role in the cyclist's experience in this story, and ultimately lead to a significant lesson that he eventually learns. 

The main feature of this setting is the road the cyclist is on. It is described as "twisting and winding" with many potholes and patches along the way. The difficulty of this road forces the cyclist to use more energy and be more cautious when navigating this terrain. The physical exertion and the need for increased awareness of the road's difficulty literally tires him out and puts his body in distress.

The setting also features an isolated nature with no other people or cars passing by. This adds an extra layer of difficulty as the cyclist is forced to rely only on himself. Without any potential help, the cyclist has to focus more on his body and the aspects of cycling he can directly control. He is forced to truly rely on his own strength and skills in order to reach his destination.

The setting of 'Rough Road Ahead' provided an excellent foundation for the cyclist's physical and mental challenge. By isolating and taxing the cyclist, it tested both his physical and mental capabilities. As the story continues, the cyclist learns that he is capable of pushing through and enduring more than what he originally thought he could. Ultimately
