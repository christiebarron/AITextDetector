An example of a time someone in my life was patient was who would come to sleep on a night before his or her daybreak. He or she would be asleep right when your call came. I remember thinking that I would wake up after I awoke, but then he would come right back up to go back out. So, then I was feeling a little lost at first as you know, but then you realized maybe there could be another party happening in the next 40-60 minutes. But I was looking forward to this.

When you think of how many people are in therapy now, it's a lot of people who just come through and see and get their life back. I would really like to hear what you think of the role of therapy in your life. How would you describe how to approach it if you were to lose a major part of your life?

MR. GREATS: Well, the next thing we're going to ask is if your therapist wants to go and really try to help people recover. And that's what a psychologist may provide you when they ask for assistance. But here's a simple question. The answer is pretty simple: you are not going to give up one thing when you're out rehab. You are not going to be able to get a new job. You are not going to go into counseling until the next time you start getting out there. So this is not a question you can just take my word for it, I would say
