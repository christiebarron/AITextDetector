Dear Editors,

Iâ€™m writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Computers are now playing a major role in our lives, and more and more people are relying on them every single day.

The positive aspects to using computers are many. Computers can help us access vast amounts of information quickly, and with programs such as word processors, it has become much easier for people to write, store, and share documents. Computers can also help make tedious tasks simpler, allowing us to have more time for other activities. 

But there is also another side when it comes to computer usage. Spending too much time using computers can have a negative impact on our physical, mental, and social well-being. We can suffer from an array of physical issues such as neck-aches, back-aches, and strained eyes. Computers can also impact our mental health through too much reliance and the potential for cyberbullying. Furthermore, our social lives can suffer since people may become too preoccupied with their computers.

I urge readers to take a serious look at the effects computers can have on people. We can use computers to access endless amounts of information and save time with various tasks, but it is also essential to recognize how our physical, mental and social well-being can be impacted.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
