The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Some of the most daunting decisions were the decision not to put in a car-to-car docking station under the Empire State Building, a decision that could be made by one of the designers, the architect, or the contractor. Some of the biggest obstacle was the failure of the station to dock successfully. The building was still very much like a "hot rod" when built. On April the 4, 1948, opening ceremony of the City Art Center in Washington, D.C., was seen as a way forward by the building management and the architects for building a modern, high-speed city. The city had one of the widest selection criteria of any high-rise in the nation, having three primary entrances that can be accessed from the West Side at a distance of ten miles and all of the city's landmarks in the vicinity at a distance of twenty yards. The entrance doors will be locked at an angle of less than ten degrees. To enter and exit the building, those entering will need to pass an entrance test using a safety harness on the ground floor. This will allow the building managers to make sure the entrance would never open. Finally, the entrances will make it easier for pedestrians to make their way to the main entrance. This new security system will be added to the building in a future draft application.

The Empire State Building was built between 1912 through 1924. The plans call for the construction
