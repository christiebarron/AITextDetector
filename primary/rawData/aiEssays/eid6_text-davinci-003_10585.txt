The Empire State Building was seen as an engineering marvel when it was completed in 1931 due to its unprecedented height and use of modern technologies. But for many, it brought about a new era of possibility. One of its original plans was to include docking facilities for dirigible airships, which would have allowed the building to become the world's first sky port. Although the plan was ambitious, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in terms of allowing dirigibles to dock, and ultimately, they were not able to satisfy these needs in order to realize their dream.

The main challenge the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to provide docking facilities for dirigibles was a lack of suitable aircraft. In order to moor a dirigible to the Empire State Building, it was essential that they had lightweight, rigid airships that were able to hold a large number of passengers. Unfortunately, when construction began in 1927, such airships did not exist. Marcia Amidon Lüsted writes in ‘The Mooring Mast’ that the “largest airship of the period, the R-34, was neither rigid nor sufficiently light to moor to the Empire State Building”. without suitable aircraft, this ambitious idea was never able to get off the ground.

The builders of the Empire State Building also faced a number of financial concerns. Dirigibles were expensive to build and operate, and it was not feasible for the Empire State
