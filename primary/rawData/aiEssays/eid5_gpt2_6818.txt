The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' was often a bit more nuanced, but by this stage I was enjoying it and even when it was being described I was starting to really get behind it.

"For me it was pretty funny, because there were a lot of people who were talking about it in my head, who were coming straight under the radar because I wasn't quite sure what to say.

I had a moment. I went through all the wrong questions, I had lost so many, so I was looking at what might have been more meaningful or something I should have said earlier.

"Well I didn't know for certain about how it came about in the memoir or something, but a lot of it was kind of a way out of my problem. But I thought it was all a bit funny and hopefully I could come to terms with it afterwards.
