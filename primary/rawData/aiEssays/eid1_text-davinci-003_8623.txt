 

My favorite memory with my best friend happened recently at our family's annual beach vacation. We usually go every summer, but this was the first time we ever got to drive together. 

On the way, we kept each other entertained with jokes about our dysfunctional family and about our plans for the week. We laughed so hard that it felt like our car was the only one on the highway. 

When we finally arrived at the beach house, we found ourselves in an even funnier situation. We had promised ourselves and our families that we would stay in separate rooms, but the layout of the house confused us and we ended up in the same room. We laughed uncontrollably when we realized what had happened and when we tried to explain it to our family. 

We made the most of the week, with laughter being our bridge to whatever we got ourselves into. Whether it was getting lost on a hike or trying to find the right spot on the beach for the day, we laughed through it all.

At the end of the week, we partied on the beach one last time and we laughed the night away. We knew we would remember this vacation for the laughter and for the friendship we had built together.
