In the short story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, the cyclist's journey is greatly impacted by the features of the setting. The protagonist’s route is hilly and full of difficult terrain, creating a challenge in itself by having to exert extra effort to conquer the steep inclines. The cyclist also faces obstacles in the form of heavy winds and relentless rain. These obstacles, alongside the physical trauma from having to pedal so doggedly, are detrimental to the cyclist's physical and mental state, making his journey increasingly arduous.

The setting also gives the protagonist a sense of freedom and exhilaration as he cycles through the landscape, in spite of its hardships. The majestic views of the mountain range serve to inspire him as he continues, with its presence subduing the loneliness of the journey. The freedom and exhilaration felt by him in his endeavour are further accentuated by the bright sun surrounding him, releasing an archaeological feeling of pure joy as he continues his journey.

These features of the setting immensely shape the cyclist’s experience in this short story. The rough and dangerous terrain prove to be a challenge in itself, while the obstacles of heavy winds and rain offer an unwelcome increased struggle. However, the cyclist is also inspired by its beauty, with its majestic views, sunlit presence, and the freedom of the journey. All of these factors contribute to creating a story that is deeply emotionally-charged and full of character development.
