The builders of the Empire State Building faced a unique challenge in their desire to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. The feat was unprecedented and it was unclear how this could be achieved. Several obstacles had to be overcome in order to make this feat possible. 

First, the unique design of the Empire State Building posed a problem. The mast supporting the docking mast was only one hundred and four feet tall. It had not been designed without the thought of airship docking in mind. Not only was it difficult to design a mast that would be stable enough to support the weight and size of a dirigible, the small size of the existing mast meant that it had to be made out of extra-strong materials in order to provide the necessary support. This posed a challenge as the materials available at the time were not necessarily up to the task. 

Second, the mooring mast had to be designed with precision in order to assure the safety of the airship and those aboard it. It also had to be able to withstand wind and weather conditions, as the mast was exposed to the elements and not enclosed within the building itself. A great deal of trial and error went into the creation of the mast, as the task of making a mooring structure that was strong enough for the airships and yet still easy to use was a delicate balancing act. The engineers eventually settled on a V-shaped structure that allowed the airships to attach securely
