The task of allowing dirigibles to dock the Empire State Building proved to be a difficult one due to a number of obstacles. The Empire State Building was erected between 1930 and 1931, setting a new height record for skyscrapers at 1,250 feet. The scope and height of the building made it an ideal base for docking dirigibles – at the time, dirigibles were the only practical means of conveyance to transportation that allowed use of the upper atmosphere. However, providing a practical and safe environment for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State was a daunting task.

According to Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s “The Mooring Mast”, the most significant challenge faced by the architects and engineers was the need to install a large and strong mooring mast on the building’s roof. Due to the massive size and weight of the mast, calculations had to be made in order to stabilize the structure so that it could safely hold much bigger dirigibles. Fortunately, architects were able to divert the load of the mast to a steel girdle running around the building, beneath the roof. This development allowed for the installation of the mooring mast to be completed without structurally compromising the integrity of the building.

Despite the success of the mooring mast, the task was far from finished. The designers had to find a way to safely and securely fasten the dirigibles to the mast.
