Computers have many effects on people. A few of them are good causes, others bad. I also don't know of a single study conducted that compared data of both men and women (or in particular, women and men who were both underrepresented Values). My main concern is that both sexes have different brain resources in a few ways. For example, a more experienced woman would learn what people say without having to explain it to their male counterparts.

Another reason is probably less obvious but worth talking about. Imagine some way that those men might make connections with you because they're bored. Imagine that they have to be in a particular group so that you can talk into them, or a specific one, like I've done. There's no harm in that; that's fine. It's just that it requires a lot of brain energy and motivation to make that connection with me, and you'll spend a lot of that time alone in those groups.

But if you've already given up on that idea, is there any evidence to suggest that having sex with a man might lead to a better relationship, or that it could lead a sex drive as well? It seems probably not, unless you're just working on your mind and in your home, which I guess most people do (perhaps a lot, perhaps not a lot).

So, are those guys just making out or are there some other people that want to get closer to you somehow? I've seen them.
