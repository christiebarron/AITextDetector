An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the time I stopped using my cell phone. That day before my death I was making calls to my doctor because I was too afraid to get in it because it was raining and the doctor looked at me and said 'what the fuck is going on?' And said, 'you know, you're so drunk, you're getting too intoxicated to hear anything.' So I put on my mask and said I would get into it again until someone got in, which he did, and then I just kept walking with it off and went off with my mom. It was like, 'I am totally insane, no fucking way that I'm living under the stress right now.'"

The singer then told the interviewer that "I'm still going to be singing, I'm not going to do that because I want to look so fucking fucking good on stage."

According to the Huffington Post: "This time he did it with a different instrument. It was a guitar, and the band took it from him. 'There are not too many people who can sing on stage,' he says. 'They're a lot of things.'"

The lyrics about "We have nothing, so who's going to take a song from me, except God?" could be taken from a recent documentary called "The End," which premieres tonight on HBO. Watch the clip below.
