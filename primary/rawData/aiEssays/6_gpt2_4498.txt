The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, they had to come up with a unique set of guidelines for which to install the items and, second, what they][C][C][C] should look like from a design perspective. As with any architectural tool, that was all but impossible, but finally, the designers began to see the value of giving it a place in the fabric of space.

The Imperial Tower was once Rifleman's Palace.

To honor the building, the Imperial Royal Military Building was built and rebuilt, and even later a new Military Building was built to honour the Emperor. It wasn't until the war that Imperial buildings were officially recognised and placed on the map, starting with the Order's headquarters. As such, we see the city once again as a part of its present world. All that remains are the old barracks in Palaven, where soldiers serve in a group, as well as a small town in the south where the Imperial troops are stationed. In front of some buildings is a building and the Imperial Guard stands guard along the way, as well as at the base of the walls which are often covered with rubble after explosions have started, and the Imperial Guard are on the lookout below.
