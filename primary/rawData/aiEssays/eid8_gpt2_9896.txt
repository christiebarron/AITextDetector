One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was walking along a street, and the sound of my friend calling me "Gum" came along after a particularly long speech. It was funny, even in the quiet moments I did. It could be almost unbearable. It is a great comfort to realize the strength and joy in having people around you, even when there is a threat.

I grew up in Northern California. I never felt sad at all. But I grew up with a mother who took me to live with her in every home in the city, and she had a strong and loving husband, who was also a strong and loving mother. I can remember thinking that this would help her keep me in good health. To me he seemed to be the most loving and caring person I ever met.

I began the day I was given birth, and for the first time I saw a baby (the day my mother was born), and was excited to see my new boy play with mine. He had just started playing the piano at the time, so we went to play as he had before.

I remember thinking later I am the best person I obscenely imagine, saying, "You are the best of them all." How dare I try to sound as self-evidently and confidently as he did so much that I am now completely at my own mercy? If some person needs us to care about our child, I will gladly do that. My child
