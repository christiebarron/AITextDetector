I was in the bathroom and heard my husband and daughter laughing uncontrollably. I opened the door to see what was going on and was absolutely charmed by the scene. My daughter had accidentally sprayed her father's face with the cold water coming out of the bathtub. His surprised expression as the water hit him had made my daughter giggle uncontrollably. In response, my husband started to make comical faces and silly noises that sent my daughter into a fit of laughter.

The sight of my husband and daughter in such a happy moment was one of the most precious things I've ever seen. I found myself joining in the laughter with them, and the three of us had the most wonderful time. After we'd calmed down, I gave them both a kiss on the cheek and thanked them for making me remember why I fell in love with my family in the first place.
