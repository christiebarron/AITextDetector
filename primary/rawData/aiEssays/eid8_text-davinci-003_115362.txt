I remember meeting my husband, Ben, for the first time. We were both attending the same dinner party with mutual friends, and we hadn't met in person before. 

When we sat down at the same dinner table, I was so nervous. I couldn't think of anything to say to break the awkwardness, and all I could do was clench my napkin under the table.

Just then, Ben started to tell the funniest joke I had ever heard. When his punchline hit, I immediately started laughing. It felt like something incredibly special had happened between us in that moment - like we had this invisible connection that no one else could understand. 

I'm glad that our relationship grew from that moment of shared laughter and is still going strong after all these years. That joke and the laughter it brought will always be one of my favorite memories with Ben.
