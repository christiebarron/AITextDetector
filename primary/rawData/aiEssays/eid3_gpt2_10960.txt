Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.


* The ROC is a small 'tarmac' that consists of two sections - one flat, one smooth, and one flat. The cyclist must set out to complete their round before descending at high speed, but the ROC will still offer that easy access to the city roads.


* Whilst there are a handful of 'noise' restrictions which prevent the cyclist from descending at any time, there is certainly room to be on the higher level and be careful about the route if you choose to stop at the ROC and attempt to progress.


* There are very few steps to the ROC, but there is significant variation in the route from a 'clean' turn to a 'deep' one.


* If you have a bad experience with the ROC before the round is over, try making an alternate change to use up your allowance at the end of another round. This could save you from having to return to a different ROC location again.


* If you can still make it back to meet the cyclist at the ROC you can make an alternative change to use up all your allowance the next round if you wish to stop again.


* The ROC does offer two separate sets of 'open road' rules on the road.


In short, there is much flexibility to what is permitted on the road in the ROC.
