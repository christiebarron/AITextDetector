The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because when the book gets turned down it opens to a world where the man who once lived with the man who had come back in another life is now here as well, and there's no more to come of it and the time to move on to their future would be now. It's just that the characters are never able to find each other, and yet there they are. And where I feel the book gets really interesting with respect to that was in The Great War, where one of them finds out that he's a Nazi and the other one comes to the knowledge that she's also a Nazi and that they've found an ally and that they had to fight against him. This comes down to someone making a decision that leads the character to become, you know, a good foil for the Nazis and this is just what happens sometimes even when there are better parallels to the stories that follow, and it's just always just more interesting to me. So that's a very important book I loved. I do know it won't be as popular, certainly, with people that haven't read The Last Man on Earth. But as the book gets turned down as "Tales from beyond Space," there's this huge universe that's left to show how humans came to occupy. It's a great place to start.

How is the book approaching its conclusion? How are you feeling about its story's ending? This seems like an interesting question
