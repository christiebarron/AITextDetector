To The Editor:

As technology advances, more and more of our lives have become dependent on computers, but how have they really impacted us? I believe that computers have had both positive and negative effects on people.

On one side, computers have provided us with the ability to access a wealth of knowledge at our fingertips. This has enabled us to learn more and develop greater problem-solving skills. Computers have also made communicating with friends and family much easier, creating a global community.

As beneficial as these effects may be, there are still drawbacks. The increased use of computers has meant that people spend more time engaging in virtual activities instead of physical ones. This can lead to health problems such as obesity and weak physical strength. Computer addiction is also becoming a major problem among young people, as they become more and more dependent on the Internet.

Ultimately, computers are a great tool but they also bring with them potential dangers. We need to encourage people to use these technologies in moderation and ensure that they are still engaging in physical activities. This will help us to truly benefit from the use of computers, without any of the drawbacks.

Sincerely,
