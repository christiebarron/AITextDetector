I will never forget the day I first met Tim. I had been invited to a gathering with a group of friends I hadn’t had a chance to meet yet, so I was a bit nervous. I was pleasantly surprised to find that Tim was just as outgoing and welcoming as the other guests. 

He immediately made me feel at ease with his witty comments and jokes, which had the group laughing hysterically. His contagious laughter and smiles were warming and inviting. We all had a wonderful time that night, and I knew I had made a new friend for life. 

Our friendship blossomed from that moment, and we soon went from exchanging giggles over silly jokes to telling funny stories from our past. We discovered we had a knack of making each other laugh uncontrollably, and those moments of shared laughter and joy were the highlights of our friendship. 

I’m so fortunate to have a friend like Tim in my life, and that the first time we met, laughter immediately bonded us together. No matter what troubles life throws our way, I know that I’ll always have Tim’s warm and inviting belly laugh to get me through.
