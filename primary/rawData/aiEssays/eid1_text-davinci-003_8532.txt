I was visiting my grandmother the other day and I was helping her with her computer. She had been having some trouble with it for a while, and I had been promising to help her out. Unfortunately, the process took longer than expected due to how long it took to get the machine back up to date. We had to download numerous security updates and reboot the machine a few times before it was finished.

Through it all, my grandmother remained incredibly patient and understanding. She didn't get frustrated or angry—instead, she kept remarking how nice it was that I was taking the time to help her out. It was inspiring to watch her remain patient throughout the process. Ultimately, it paid off—when the computer was back up and running, she was overjoyed with how quickly and smoothly it was now performing. I was glad I was able to help her out and that she had the patience to go through the process.
