The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, the building and its associated property were required to accommodate dirigibles for passenger vehicles, and in 1962, the building was put on a special commission to study alternative ways to accommodate dirigibles, as the Empire State Building opened in 1960. The process took some 25 years for the building to be completed, but that took at least 35 consecutive months that allowed the construction team to prepare the building and build the installation.

Since the public and private sector both owned the building, the building's first public access road paved the way for the first private dirigible transportation service. Since then, dirigibles have been brought to public transport, and as a result, the building has been able to accommodate nearly 200,000 passengers. Over these years, it has come to be regarded as the premier hub of public and private transportation between Albany and Washington, D.C. The City of Albany provides most of its express transportation from its downtown subway station to Metro-North station, and provides the second largest combined public and private car transfer line in the country to Washington. The Empire State Building was built to serve as a hub for public transit to downtown Washington, D.C., the University of Maryland, and other U.S. capital cities. To ensure that the building was a hub, the building was designed to meet state and government requirements regarding public transport.
