Computers have many effects on people. First, one's brain doesn't process information effectively, so an environment such as an MRI may not represent a perfect picture. This also limits how well people can learn and be used. Second, a patient's perception of events that are hard or impossible sometimes needs to be enhanced, such as by physical therapy (such as PET scans), or by video monitoring: if an event is not a given then the patient can't take part in the study.

The second major cause of cognitive decline is "lack of emotional connection": some brain areas are hardwired to help you get along, including the hippocampus. Another issue, known as the problem with attention, is that this affects your attention, and it can also interfere with any training that helps you develop the ability to read. Another common factor is learning how to read in order to improve your performance.
