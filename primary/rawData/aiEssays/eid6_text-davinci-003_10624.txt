The Empire State Building was one of the most ambitious projects of its time, and the ambition extended beyond simply achieving the title of the 'World's Tallest Building.' One of the other dreams of the developers was to create an airship docking station at the very top of the building so that dirigibles could proudly enter the New York skyline. However, despite their best efforts, the builders of the Empire State Building faced several significant obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. 

One of the main obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building was the sheer size of the airships. Many of the dirigibles of the day were so large that the open ports at the building's tower could not accommodate them. As Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted wrote in her book The Mooring Mast, "The Empire State Building was the tallest structure of its era, but its mooring mast was not tall enough to accommodate even the smaller, 400-foot dirigibles of the day." This physical limit of the building would have prevented many of the standard dirigibles from docking.

Another obstacle in allowing dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building was the mountaintop breezes atop the building that made docking crafts quite challenging. Many of the larger airships had to take special precautions to moor their ship atop the building, and even then, sometimes the wind would create problems. Furthermore, airships were susceptible to
