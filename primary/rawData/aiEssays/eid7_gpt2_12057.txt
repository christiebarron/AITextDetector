An example of a time someone in my life was patient was in a room with me that my aunt had kept an apartment in for a while now.

I sat in the middle of her apartment, and she sat silently there.

And she was smiling, and I was trying so hard to look like she was laughing, but I could not. I was being very serious. And then suddenly she came in with her hands up above her head.

She said, "I want to come over." And I said, "Oh, Mom, come on down here and take the spoon up here. The spoon has been broken up by the nurse, and you see she's got a broken bowl. You can do something about it." And I said, "I don't mind. You didn't eat out of my glass until after the nurses came by." And she said, "Ouch."

It just took her forever to get used to it. I wanted to give her some kind of medicine, but she couldn't. She just got so worked up about having to work just as hard and so much harder to get used to. But with the spoon, that would have been fine. And she would have been fine without it. After six months, she started shaking very little. She was also very sleepy and so she Diplomat, she was pretty much a little afraid of her stomach. So no, no, no, that wasn't the case at all
