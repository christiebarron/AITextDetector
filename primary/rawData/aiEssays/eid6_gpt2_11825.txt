The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, the ground floor was in bad shape, so it was common for the ground to be wet, while it also meant that every component of the building needed to be dry. While those restrictions were the result of design decisions, more often than not, the owners of the building actually made better compromises like building the structure for a wider area of the ground floor that they had no immediate financial need for. To that end, they built a two-floor "laundromat" that had access from the middle of the building to the lower floors that were normally used for laundry.

"And it was so bad that we all said, 'That's it, that must be fixed.' " says Richard E. Sallinick Jr., co-owner and designer of Echlux Architects. Echlux has built a variety of high-end, large-unit residential and commercial units in the city, and Echlux currently offers two such examples in the city. This past fall, Echlux was able to secure financing from a group of New York architects to renovate the tower's former storefronts into a series of modern high-end apartments.

"That's certainly why we're interested in what we've found in the case of the Empire State Building and what happened to its residential footprint," says Mr. Sallinick.
