One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was growing up. I was in a movie theater one day in my high school, when I got there crying and screaming because I found my father crying that very same day. It took a while for me to fully grasp what that feeling was.

I'm also a huge fan of people's perspective on gender issues because I don't like to say they're wrong. I know in the movie, there's a real "I like to argue' at some point or other for the things that are right, but for me it's different as a female who can be extremely important as an actor with that kind of perspective and to be on that kind of panel with male directors and to be surrounded by great women is just amazing. It reminds me that my dad was my first boyfriend, and as a child, it just came out when I was with my siblings, and there was nothing to fight for. I didn't think it was gonna get very loud as a child. And I mean there were still a lot of people who had that same reaction.

But for us, that whole generation, that wasn't easy because at that time, I did kind of have to go through stuff and be different. There's a lot of things about my own age where you start to have to grow up and do that, and you also have to try and find some comfort areas about your own experiences and experience and know what it's like
