The building of the Empire State Building was no small achievement. As the world’s tallest building, it was not only a marvel of engineering, but a symbol of American power and ambition. One of the aims of the architects was to allow dirigibles (airships) to dock atop the building, making it a hub of air travel. However, this lofty ambition presented significant obstacles that had to be navigated.

The most challenging obstacle was the fact that the building was simply too small to accommodate dirigibles. Aircrafts of the day were much longer and wider than the mooring mast, which capped the roof of the Empire State Building at about 200 feet. It was simply not practical to try to fit such a large airship atop the structure. To make matters worse, the airships’ wings could not be folded down easily, and the powerful engines needed to conduct the dockings were not yet on the market. 

For these reasons, the architects had to come up with some inventive and creative solutions. They concluded that a mooring mast was the only way for the airships to maneuver their way onto the roof. The mast was made from reinforced steel and had two pulleys to help with the dockings. The mast was also designed with an additional cable to assist in keeping the airships steady and secure during the docking process. Despite the hurdles, however, the mooring mast successfully allowed the airships to dock atop the
