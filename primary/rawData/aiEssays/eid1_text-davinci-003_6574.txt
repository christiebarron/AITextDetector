Dear Editor, 

As we stand on the brink of a new era of technology, it is hard to deny the positive impact of computers on our lives. While the advance of computers has revolutionized how we work and communicate, we must also take a pause to consider its effects on people. 

Computers have had a dramatic impact on the way we carry out our daily tasks. The rise of the internet has opened up a vast world of information and digital communication. Billions of people now rely on computers to carry out everyday tasks such as work, communication, study, and recreational activities. This technology has shifted us into a new era of productivity, efficiency, and convenience that could not have been imagined even a few decades ago.

However, as with any machine, it is important to analyze the digitized tools we heavily rely upon. The over-reliance on computers that is prevalent among people of all ages has been of great concern. It is well known that computers can have physical and mental health consequences, such as headaches, eyestrain, physical stress, anxiety, and loneliness. Spending too much time in front of a computer can be detrimental to our social lives, mental wellbeing, and relationships.

We must remain mindful that computers can be powerful devices, but should be used properly. We should be aware of the risks associated with this technology, and consistently enforce measures to reduce our computer time whenever necessary. The promise that this technology offers is undeniable
