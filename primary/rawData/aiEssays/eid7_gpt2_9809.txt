An example of a time someone in my life was patient was with an alcoholic mother. The mother looked at me at the time and seemed very nervous. She had no concern for my safety, though, and she had a great deal of alcohol on the day of the accident.

I had talked to the family about my recovery during a recent radio interview, which was hosted by Dr. Robert Aka, in which he discussed the recovery process for patients having similar issues.

I was very careful about not calling anyone to say anything. At that point, I went to the ER, followed two nurses who were on the side of the line and said, "Hey, don't call me. I'm going to leave." I said, "I can tell you what my best recollection is, but I haven't had any alcohol. I mean, I'm trying." After about 2 or 3 minutes, they told me to just go look for that doctor. I did.

The story does look like some kind of "I Don't Know" or something, but not that important. It wasn't all that hard, but there was a great deal of heartache. You have to put some thought into that. I know I wasn't the only person who had feelings like that. We talked about how tough it was for our family to keep their child, but with the same people.
