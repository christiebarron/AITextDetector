The setting of “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski has a significant influence on the cyclist. The physical environment of the street serves as the backdrop for this story and its features contribute to the cyclist’s experience.

The street is characterized by large potholes, uneven terrain, and broken pavement. This rough road surface makes the cyclist’s journey more difficult, as they must continuously dodge these obstacles or risk potential injury. The cyclist’s progress is further hindered by passing vehicles, which create a distraction to the cyclist as they focus on navigating the hazardous terrain. Their concentration is also threatened by the existence of other cyclists in the area who may be in the cyclist’s path or impede their progress. 

The cyclist’s experience on the street is also made more difficult by the weather conditions. The story takes place during the evening, when the light is fading. This low light visibility makes it harder for the cyclist to make out details in the terrain and adds a layer of danger for the cyclist. The cool evening temperature also contributes to the cyclist’s struggle as they ride, as cool air makes it harder to maintain an efficient, reliable breathing pattern.

Overall, the features of the setting of “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, such as the rough terrain, poor lighting, and cooler temperatures, all contribute to the difficulty of the cyclist’s journey. These
