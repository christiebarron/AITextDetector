I remember a particular moment when I had to practice being patient. I was in a foreign country and had just checked in for my flight home. I had filled out all the necessary paperwork, eagerly anticipating my return home. 

But then, the airline staff informed me that my flight had been delayed. I was immediately frustrated, but I tried my best to remain patient and understanding in the situation. I could feel my temper rising, but I knew that panicking and getting agitated wouldn't do me any good. 

Nevertheless, I became increasingly frustrated with every second that crawled by. But then, something amazing happened. The flight attendant who had informed me of the delay sat down beside me and asked if everything was okay. I noticed that she genuinely seemed to care about how I was feeling. She offered to buy me a snack and a drink, and we ended up having a really nice chat. 

In that moment, I realized that I had been able to stay patient even in the face of the flight delay. I also learned the value of human connection. In just a few minutes, a stranger had been able to turn around my mood simply by talking to me. 

Being patient is not always easy, but it can help us to appreciate the small moments in life. It can also remind us that we should never forget to be kind and caring towards others.
