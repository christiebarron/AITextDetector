Computers have many effects on people. I would make the assumption that if I had ever seen and discussed the issue it would have been very easy, and many people would have given me some time to get it worked out. However, the point is not about that. The point is about the implications. The point is how it plays out in practice. As one of my former coworkers said, it's just a matter of trying to get it to work for the right person and that's probably going to happen eventually. But it would still be a very different book than being able to go and buy a computer that gives you a new understanding of computer science.

What are the most common examples of problems related to building software?

Most problem scientists are very concerned that they will end up being short-witted. They will get overwhelmed. Some may get even more frustrated. If you look over the entire catalog of problem scientists, and you look at a few major problems, you'll see that many have very different problems.

The most common problem is that we are not sure how to solve it. For instance, a person could simply get stuck on a problem or an algorithm. But an algorithm, in a way, is an algorithm rather than a system. We know it, and it works. But the answer is often that it takes one of two things. One is the idea of a 'problems' to figure out about what exactly we are doing. The other
