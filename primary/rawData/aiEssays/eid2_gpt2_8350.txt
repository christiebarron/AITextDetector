I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is the only effective means to preserve our civil liberties, as we all take for granted in the modern world."

The letter said that "to stop people from using libraries is a national priority, and not just from the standpoint of intellectual freedom." But it added that all "the institutions" that should comply with the rule would lose funding.

The letter came as the U.S. Education Department is reviewing rules for schools, which it wants to pass as part of a broader national overhaul of government and free education that starts next year. Some states allow the federal government to censor, while others limit free speech.

The ACLU, for example, has been calling for more than an hour (5 p.m. ET Friday) for the letter's release in a request for comment annexed to the order of its staff and submitted Thursday by the district attorneys' office for appeal.

A spokeswoman for the district attorneys' office did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment on Friday. A spokesman for Gov. Rick Scott and the state's attorney general did not respond to a request for comment.
