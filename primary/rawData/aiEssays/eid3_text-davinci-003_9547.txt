In the short story, “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, the setting plays an integral role in affecting the cyclist’s experiences throughout his journey. Initially, the cyclist recognizes the outer beauty of the desert, noting how the “drenched colors of the buttes and mountains flooded across the sky.” As he continues, the environment further evolves, implying a sense of danger and suspense, such as when “sheets of ice water gushed off the steep canyon slopes and the otherworldly sounds of animals called out, unnoticed by the cyclist.”

The temperature and terrain contribute additional features to the cyclist’s journey. Accustomed to riding in the limited flat terrain he is used to, he is taken off guard when “every slight rise in the road seemed to sap all his energy; an energy he used to take for granted.” Here, the increase in elevation and the less comfortable conditions make it much more difficult for him to keep up with the pace, hinting at the relentlessness of the journey.

The cyclist also faces decisions that are contingent upon the weather or environment, such as when he arrives at an “eerie field of mist that seemed alive, writhing and flowing, creating an opaque mist between himself and everything around him.” Here, the cyclist is lost and must choose between trusting his compass or the mysterious, fog-like terrain.
