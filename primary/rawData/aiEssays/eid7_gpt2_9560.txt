An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I spent many years as a nursing student working at a hospital.

The patient came straight to the ER with a dead rat on its back. I knew something was seriously seriously wrong and so I went into the ER to see what type of rat had left its skeleton on its back. It had had no chance of survival. We found it with its brain missing and the inside of its left arm missing. It had a massive belly that had been in the same position as its brain. When I tried to make out what it was up to, he was holding it by the arm. Suddenly he began to shake like a freak in pain and he went into convulsions. I just had to get that rat back from it!
