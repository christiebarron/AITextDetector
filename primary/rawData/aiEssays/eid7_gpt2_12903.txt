An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my fiance who died in a car crash in 2003. I am very thankful to him because of the impact this senseless act had had on his life.

While they worked on this bill I worked tirelessly to write to the California Chamber of Commerce, where I was to present the legislation. I also saw my own husband die with such a passion because of a bill passed by Congress last week in the Assembly of California. This bill could have prevented more deaths, but instead it resulted in needless deaths and the families of lost loved ones lost.

If they hadn't known Fat Albert was in front of their office at 6:30 a.m., it would now have been a total different situation.

I am the sole member of the California Board of Poultry Producers and also the executive director of the California Food and Commercial Workers Association and also the director of the California Farmers' Market Association. I am the only member of the California Cattlemen's Association who voted Yes on the bill that gave me one of the rights I enjoyed working in assembly. I am proud that this bill has been so passed and a perfect moment to remember this incredible work of work.

Thank you as always for your thoughts.

P.S. Fat Albert would never, ever leave San Fernando Ranch.
