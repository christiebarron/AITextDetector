The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. These included the need for separate docking modules, which could be mounted at the top of the structure without disrupting ship movement during docking or loading.

Other concerns were the lack of an external landing gear when the docking modules had to be tied into a crane, and this led to numerous delays.

However, there were some positive developments with the removal of the propane tanks, including the installation of an adjustable fire control system which allowed for more efficient handling of the fuel.

Cape Town-based Dr. Stephen Cottrell, who is also a member of the steering committee of the European Space Agency, added: "In our discussions today, this is an important step towards a better solution, and certainly in the future we will be looking at alternatives for this docking facility, and we will be working very closely with the European Space Agency on this subject."

According to ESI, although an aircraft is currently used to launch a satellite - the Cessna Cessna 4 - no one really knows when an aircraft will be used. A similar system was installed for the launch of the Galileo probe, which will also help with docking of the Cessna.

But other hurdles remain. Firstly, the Fusible was designed to be fitted with small, flexible antennas for the docking spacecraft - a step which, as previously expected, did not happen, as it did not
