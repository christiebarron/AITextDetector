One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I sat next to a very strong man or woman in an office in California and he was laughing at my legs or one leg. I was standing at a desk, and he was laughing so loudly that I couldn't remember his name. The reason is that he was on television.

I was sitting in, at the far end of the room with a man on his feet. I was laughing so hard I had the audacity to ask for it: he was looking for me without my consent. The laughter was so much louder that I just had to hold my breath.

Eventually we managed to get two minutes' applause from both sides, although by then the man was already laughing so hard that I could barely breathe, and I was still unable to think for one second about his words either.

This is how you get to do your own Laughing With Us. No matter how good your laugh is, you are never truly free for your own laugh.

We now see how people laugh with and against each other, and you will soon read, "There's just ONE WAY to laugh!"

You have your own Laughing With Us. You are a free expression of the human feeling. Your words and actions are a human expression of your emotions. The man is standing near you, a beautiful woman across from you. If the man has no emotions, then he is laughing.
