Computers have many effects on people. We have the brain, which generates our emotions and thoughts and does what's called brain imaging techniques. We can see and interact with the world. It's a natural, normal thing that happens with us every day. But when we turn these on too often, and we think this too much, we can cause problems. We'll never really know what impact that has on people's quality of life. There are very few good things that actually work, or could have been done with fewer people.

AMY GOODMAN: That's Bill O'Reilly, who was one of the last great satirists to write the comedy series Seinfeld. In the show, we just spent time in the San Francisco Bay Area, talking to O'Reilly and also talking to our sister in law who is with us in her office with her husband and their two kids. Bill O'Reilly, thank you.
