The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. By the time the first commercial vehicles (including the Chrysler and Ford Superspeedway) made a comeback, engineers were already beginning to develop their own vehicle designs for such devices. At the time, their biggest challenges were not with the building but with the safety and usability of all of those building systems.

The first "smart" car prototypes were developed by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration in 1934, a year before the first human control is needed. With only a few exceptions, all of the other cars used at the time were considered too "smart" to be able to operate properly. The Federal Trade Commission later ruled that these vehicles could be safely controlled by human hands but not by human brains.

That said, in the early years, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which had become the most important agency in the building business because it controlled the American car industry, took that a step further. In 1944 it mandated a regulation that would protect the public from motor vehicles or any other hazardous object, which meant safety. During the same time, it created one of the earliest and fastest growing government-funded safety plans in America â€” the New Deal.

In the early 1940s, the FAA launched the F-111 program to monitor, detect and control such objects and prevent accidents. Then in 1961, the federal government created the World>[1] Aircraft Safety Act of 1966 to
