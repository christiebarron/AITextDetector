Dear Editor,

I'm writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Technology has undoubtedly provided us with numerous benefits, but there are downsides to consider as well.

Computer use has led to an increase in sedentary lifestyles and is associated with potential health problems such as obesity, vision disorders, speech and language impairments, headaches, insomnia, and even seizures in some instances. Furthermore, the excessive use of the internet and electronic devices can also lead to social isolation, as people don't favour face-to-face contact as much anymore.

On the positive side, computers have revolutionized the way that people receive and use information. They have opened up a world of possibilities for people, allowing them to access information quickly and easily, and allowing businesses to grow rapidly. It is also much easier and cost effective to communicate with people, whether virtually or in person.

However, it is important to recognize the negative aspects of computers and to take steps to reduce their negative effects on people. Increased awareness and improved methods of use can help to limit computer-related health issues, and ensuring frequent breaks from computers can help to prevent social and physical health problems.

If used correctly and responsibly, computers are a valuable asset to people, but we must exercise caution to ensure that their effects are more positive than negative.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
