I remember a time when I was very young and I was at the grocery store with my mother. We had been in line for quite a while and the woman in front of us was having trouble getting her coupons to go through. The cashier was growing more and more frustrated with her and was starting to raise her voice. 

I noticed my mom was getting irritated and agitated. I could tell she wanted to say something, but instead, she remained patient and calm. After a few more minutes, the woman was finally able to get her items paid for and my mom was able to check out. 

My mom was then able to pay for her items, but she took the time before she left to thank the woman for her patience. The woman was surprised and grateful for my mother's kind words and thanked her for understanding. 

This experience has always stayed with me and I still remember it to this day. My mother taught me an important lesson that dayâ€”that it is always important to remain patient and understanding even when faced with difficult or frustrating situations.
