I was out on a date with my boyfriend. We were enjoying our time together, but as the night went on, our conversation seemed to become more and more serious. I felt like I was getting lost in the heavier topics, so I decided to lighten the mood a bit. Flashing him a mischievous grin, I brought up something funny I had seen earlier in the day and waited to see how he would respond.

Sure enough, he started to chuckle at what I had said. His ears turned a bit pink and the corners of his mouth turned upwards in a pleasant smile. I couldn’t help but join him in the laughter; the sound of his laughter was contagious. We laughed together for a few more minutes, and before I knew it, the mood had shifted completely—it was lighter now, and I felt much more connected with him.

The laughter between us that night was a reminder of why I was with him. It showed me that we could be vulnerable together, but also be playful and enjoy the moments that life brings. Laughter is an important part of any relationship, and I’ll never forget that laugh—his laugh—that night.
