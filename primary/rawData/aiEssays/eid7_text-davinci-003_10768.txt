I remember a time when I was waiting in a doctor's office and noticed an elderly woman in a wheelchair. She had come to see the doctor, but was waiting for her turn for a really long time. Despite this, she remained in good spirits. I even heard her joke with the receptionist about how much the waiting room chairs were uncomfortable. 

Finally, her name was called and she got to go in. After about an hour, she came out of the examination room. I was still in the waiting area and she smiled and waved to me as she headed out. 

As I saw her leave, I was amazed by her patience and resilience throughout her wait. It was clear that she had found a way to stay calm and positive even though her wait was longer than expected. I thought to myself how I could learn from her example, and strive to be more like her no matter how hard the situation.
