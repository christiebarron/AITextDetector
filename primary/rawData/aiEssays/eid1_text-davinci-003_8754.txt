I remember the day I met my best friend like it was yesterday. We had been in the same class for nearly a year before we ever even said hello. And then, one day, we started talking about some of the silly things in our class and before long we were both bent over laughing. We had bonded over our mutual love of silliness, and our laughter made us even closer. 

From that day on, we never went a day without exchanging a few jokes or laughing together. Whether we were having a serious conversation or a lighthearted one, we seemed to always find something to laugh about. 

Our friendship always amazed us both. Even if we were apart for months at a time, our partnership felt like it had never left. And when we did get together, the first thing we'd do was erupt in peals of laughter. 

We are now well into adulthood, yet we still remain best friends. We've been through a lot together, but nothing has taken away the laughter we share, and to this day it's still my favorite thing about my best friend.
