The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. It has been widely expected that all of the "big houses" and other historic structures would continue to serve as storage facilities.

But building them is not an easy task. The building needs to be able to withstand earthquakes, floodplains, tsunamis and other disasters. Construction of the Empire State Building was undertaken in the 1980s to remove the seismic warning signs during storms. The engineers have also moved into the Empire State Building in anticipation of additional power needs.

The Building has a small floor in the middle; it is large enough to support a two-person family, but there are only two windows Commerce Building and the upper level. The two lower level windows and the top half of the Empire State Building stand for the entrance to the Capital, but the building is under construction for use in other construction.

The building's main entrance is under construction for use in other construction.

This story is part of a project that builds the Empire State Building in a similar fashion as other New York City houses and their historic significance.
