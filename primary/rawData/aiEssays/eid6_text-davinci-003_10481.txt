The concept of mooring dirigibles to the Empire State Building was first proposed in the 1920s. While it was an incredibly ambitious endeavor, the project had significant technical and engineering challenges to overcome. The most pressing of these challenges were those involved in connecting the rigid airship, an inherently resilient craft, to the rigid structure of the building, and that of mitigating the forces of wind.

The dirigible was specially designed to be able to moor and dock at the Empire State Building, with a 103 foot space allocated to create a large opening to hold the craft and tie it to the building. In order to connect the dirigible safely with the building, the builders of the Empire State Building developed several mooring systems which included specially designed mooring masts. These mooring masts were made out of specially treated steel and were around 200 feet tall, sitting atop the building's 103rd story; designed to feature a T-shaped configuration when extended and locked in place, these mooring masts allowed the dirigibles to dock.

The T-shape design of the mooring masts enabled linearly rigid airships to be moored and docked safely at the Empire State Building by anchoring the moorings e.g. cables and winches to the corresponding T-shaped configuration slots featured on the mast. Once the airship was securely anchored in place, the Empire State Building was able to further reduce potential wind
