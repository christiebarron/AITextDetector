Dear Editor,

As technology advances, computers are being used in every aspect of life. However, we should not overlook the potential harm their use can have on us.

Recent research has shown that children as young as three years are exposed to computers and rely on them for basic tasks and entertainment. Unfortunately, this can have a significant impact on physical, emotional, and educational development. Too much time spent in front of the computer can lead to problems with balance, physical coordination, and test scores. In some cases, it can even lead to computer-and-internet addiction and other related psychological issues.

On the other hand, it's important to recognize that computers can be beneficial when used in moderation. Computers can help kids improve their problem-solving and analytical thinking skills, as well as their overall math proficiency. Taken in moderation, computers can be used to help children become more prepared for school and eventually, the world of work.

I believe that we should not forget that computers are tools, not toys, and must be used wisely and responsibly. As such, adults and caregivers must ensure that time spent in front of the computer is limited, and that children are properly encouraged and supported in their development
