I was recently helping my cousin move apartments. It took a lot longer than we expected and by mid-afternoon, we were both exhausted. We had been at it for hours, carrying heavy furniture up and down stairs.

My cousin became increasingly frustrated and snapped at me when I asked for help with certain tasks. I could tell he was tired and overwhelmed, so instead of getting angry, I stayed patient and tried to give him some space. 

I took on the job of handling the smaller furniture so we could finish up quicker and get done sooner. After a few moments of rest, my cousin apologized for his behavior and I let it go. We both decided to keep up the hard work with a more positive attitude and completed the task with a good outcome. 

Being patient allowed us to finish the move without making the day any more difficult than it already was.
