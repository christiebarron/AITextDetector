An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the time I got my PhD from MIT under George O'Leary, one of my very first jobs. The work was so important. I couldn't afford not to receive even 1% of the NIH grant money from MIT, and I was very lucky to get a job like this. I even had a job that was completely for myself and so I had the opportunity to have what was then known as the "Rio de Janeiro Renaissance."

On the other hand, when people went out into the streets or made a stand against injustice they took something seriously and actually did something about it. There was an American psychologist who tried to give a lot of attention to public policy, because he believed that all of society had a moral obligation to put people on trial because we would become too lenient, immoral, biased, etc. He also found that the most effective way to get people involved in public policy was the "war on drugs." (Of course that was at a high level)

From our point of view, it was not much different from the way the Nazi regime used to put German prisoners of war on trial. The fact is we had a mass murder of people at the hands of these criminals. So even though they were innocent, we had to take measures as to where they were going to be put into prison. This meant that the authorities would go around enforcing the laws by issuing these "exhaustive lists"
