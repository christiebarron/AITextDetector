The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

The company's founder and president, Fred Bier, who invented what was known as a steam oven, was one of the pioneers. For decades, he worked with steam-powered appliances like those at the time (pictured above) to make his inventions more stable. He spent most of his time using a steam cook he had built for a small restaurant.

During World War Two, his steam oven, which used steam to clean dishes, was seen as the crowning achievement in the German Army's plan to rid Germany of its war criminals. But that also meant he lost many friends and enemies.

Bier used steam to clean much of the building floor interrogation rooms. The steam cook had been so successful that he was given the title "General," a sign reading at the time that he was responsible for cleaning all the rooms and other equipment in the building.

One of many instances of Bier's use of industrial technology was in his building design for the Empire State Building. It is only the latest in an extensive line of steam ovens that have been used for engineering and construction work. Other examples include the company's new electric-generator that was used in the first World War II-era building, the German-built 3,200 pound steam steam ovens for which Bier worked with several generations of people.
