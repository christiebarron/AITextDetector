One time I experienced laughter in my life was when the headmaster gave me some money to pay for the day to see my dog that year. I am still in awe of the memory of that meeting. My first lesson was to look inside my head and realize how I had done, so I started to teach myself and get the best responses from my dog. As the dog's age goes on, it gets more and more fun to learn all kinds of new things with a very young dog, learning more of the nuances of my dog by looking at his own life. As more things that get better and better I discover the wisdom of looking in the mirrors and getting up close to my dog, even when he is not at the same time as me and when he is doing his own doing and the dog's in my house and all around my child.


I believe I am doing great work and I am thankful to the people whose support helps me.
