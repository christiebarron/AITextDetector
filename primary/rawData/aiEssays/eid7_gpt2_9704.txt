An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a girl named Kona. We were lucky enough to have a girl named Kona at our house. She was a very caring woman. She was always making me laugh and make my life easier. Kona could have taken the chance to walk a mile to get to the nearest hospital and get a CT scan. But instead, she stayed in my care and told the story of how she had been diagnosed with MSF. She said she was in a group of friends who were being treated for an attack by a group of MSF workers in my county. She went to my home and I immediately took her care of, she's a great person and a caring person. She's gone out of her way to help other people, to take care of her. I know there are people who are suffering by the fact that they all have the same kind of illness, but she is a beautiful person. And that's what makes every day like this so special.

Thank you, Lisa, if you were involved in the MSF incident on May 12, 2012. I am so grateful to all of my neighbors, and to all of the others who were injured. There are many things I can't believe about this family. They will be missed, and I promise I will keep you safe in 2014. The best of the bestâ€”a beautiful woman, a great daughter, etc. We will miss each other with all our lives
