I was out for coffee with a friend when all of a sudden I had an overwhelming urge to start laughing. It wasn’t a joke, or anything that seemed particularly funny, but suddenly I just couldn’t control my laughter. After a few seconds, my friend started to laugh, too. 

In a way, it felt like all the stress and tension between us had just melted away in that moment. We both just kept laughing until tears started streaming down our faces. It wasn’t even about the fact that we were laughing but it felt like the laughter was bridging the gap between us and bringing us back together. We just stayed like that for a few minutes, laughing and smiling at each other.

Eventually, we stopped laughing and just talked about normal things. But even though we had different things going on in our lives, that laughter was a reminder that we were still connected. It made the rest of our night so much more enjoyable knowing that we could still lean on each other when things got tough.
