I remember a time when I was waiting in line at the grocery store and there was a woman at the check-out counter who was having trouble paying her bill. She didn’t have enough money to cover the cost of her items and she was getting very flustered and embarrassed. I could tell that the cashier wasn’t feeling particularly patient and the line was starting to get backed up.

I decided to step in and help the woman. I offered to pay her the remaining amount for the items she had in her cart. She was so appreciative and grateful. I could see how relieved she was and I could tell that the cashier was also impressed by my willingness to help. We completed the transaction and the woman continued on her way. 

I feel that we should all practice patience in times of stress and difficulty. Patience can ease situations and it’s always important to be kind and understanding to others.
