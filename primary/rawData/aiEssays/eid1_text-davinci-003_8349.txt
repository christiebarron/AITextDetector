Not long ago, I visited my family in Mexico for a special celebration. When I arrived to the airport around midnight after my international flight, I had expected to be whisked away to the party, but instead I was told that all the rental cars were booked. I could have easily panicked and become frustrated after such a long journey, but instead I decided to stay patient and calm. 

My cousin, who had come to the airport to welcome me, offered to call a friend to see if they could pick us up instead. The friend did not answer, but my cousin left a message and said that we would wait a bit longer just to see if they would respond. We waited and waited and eventually after about an hour and a half, the friend showed up in their car. 

I was thankful to my cousin for being so patient in such a difficult situation. We hopped in the car and made our way to the celebration, where I was able to enjoy the night with family. In the end, I was glad that I chose to remain patient, as it meant that I was able to spend time with my family.
