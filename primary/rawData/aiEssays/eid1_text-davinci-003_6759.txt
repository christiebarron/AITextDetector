Dear Editor,

It is no secret that computers are playing an increasingly important role in our lives. From the way we work, to the way we consume information and even shop, computers are the driving force behind many of our daily activities. But with all the positive changes that computers have brought, I cannot help but to consider the potential negative consequences that come with greater reliance on technology.

First and foremost, I am concerned about the way computers are affecting our interpersonal communication and relationships. We are increasingly substituting phone calls and face-to-face meetings with digital messages such as emails, texts and video chats, making us feel more disconnected from each other. Although technology can be very helpful, it is important to prioritize being present in the real world.

Second, I’m worried about the long-term health consequences associated with increased computer usage. From headaches and backaches due to poor ergonomics to disrupted circadian rhythms due to late night web-surfing, there’s no denying the physical toll that prolonged work on computers can have on individuals.

At the end of the day, computers are here to stay and have made many areas of our lives easier. However, it is important to remember that they still pose certain dangers. Citizens should think carefully about their approach to technology to ensure that these ill effects are minimized.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
