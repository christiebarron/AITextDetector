Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. It's important to remember that the 'Rough' setting does not affect the cycling of some riding behaviours; rather, it affects other behaviours in the game.


Changing the setting can be tricky, but its one of the easiest ways to do so. A specific setting that may lead to a particular behaviour, for example the 'Bike Lanes' setting, will affect a particular 'Rough' riding behaviour. The 'Rough' setting is one such key, but it may be difficult to understand what you did as it might be impossible for those who do manage to gain a certain distance. (See 'Rough Road Ahead')


There is one additional set that might cause problems for the 'Rough' setting: it's something we will not be covering here.

They're not going to use it

If you have it

You need that

No one has actually done it to anyone (see that article about the different typesetting of modes for more info
