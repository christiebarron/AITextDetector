I was in my local grocery store, trying to pay for my items. I was running late and in a hurry as usual, but knew I had to be patient. I could tell the cashier was having trouble with the machine, as it seemed to be malfunctioning.

Rather than becoming frustrated, I remained calm and understanding. I encouraged her to take her time and do the best she could. After what felt like a lifetime, she was finally able to get the machine to work and I was able to finish my purchase. 

I thanked her for her hard work, wished her a good day, and left, feeling proud of myself for being so patient.
