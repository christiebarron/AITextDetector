The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

In 1942, a number of proposals to build dirigibles, which were planned to have a vertical wall at its entrance and be equipped with one for passenger and cargo planes, died down. The United States government continued to push dirigibles into public use despite the growing opposition over them.

After the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the designers said they wanted to create a single, self-contained, lightweight dirigible built over a span of 100,000 feet. When the government, however, declined to develop a second dirigible, the company started work on the first. And the design was shelved at San Francisco State, a city whose buildings are home to NASA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

When that was completed in 2010, the project drew a lot more attention than was expected.

The two biggest groups for planning dirigibles – the public and private firms – didn't respond in the way planned by the government.

The American National Standards Council, which is the governing body of the U.S. government, declined to comment directly about the case. But a spokesman for the panel told me it "supports the use of materials and structures so they can be used in conjunction with existing structures."

The companies of the three companies that decided to develop and manufacture dirigibles had an advantage of working within the regulations of
