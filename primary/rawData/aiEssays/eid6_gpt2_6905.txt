The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The designers considered not only the effect they'd have on passengers and spectators, but what would happen if the engines overheated or fire up when pilots turned to see him? They also considered an escape hatch from the building.

But in 1962, a team of scientists decided to bring dirigibles into the building â€” and that's when the craft was discovered. Now called the "Great Machine of the East," the machine could take passengers as far upwind as the Empire State Building (which was then on the verge of collapse at the last second).

According to WIRED, they're just the first of nearly 100 other such objects discovered around the Empire State Building. Another is planned to show off in 2007 and have a look in early 2016. In the meantime, the company has plans to put a huge laser at the site of a future capital building at 19th and North. If one of these objects hits, it could herald the beginning of the end for space.
