One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I got a phone call from my parents on a Monday night that I had recently left the U.S. I was walking home from my job as a teacher to work out and had decided to come back for a more productive day. The line to pick up my son who was being treated at a hospital in Los Angeles suddenly ran out of energy. I remember saying this: "It's really frustrating to watch your children go with you, you don't get any sleep." The response to that was "you are lucky she approved of me."

What do we really stand for when our children are not allowed anywhere near them? We want them to have friends who are willing to listen to us and listen to us while they are at us, not that they don't matter.

These children are being abused. It's not just me. It's a much larger area of society where the reality is that the majority are not going to learn a lesson from it or care about it.
