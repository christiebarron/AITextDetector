Consequently, a certain level of censorship strays away from the exact ideas this liberty is built upon. 

Many people argue that restricting access to certain materials is necessary to promote the values they deem important, such as respect and dignity. However, there are other ways of expressing these values, such as book clubs or discussion groups, where individuals with likeminded values can form better understandings of sensitive material. It is not the necessity of removing materials, but of developing stronger sensitivity and context for understanding them.
