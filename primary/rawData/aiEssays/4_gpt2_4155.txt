The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it deals with the most salient of all topics: gender and sexuality. (It's difficult to imagine a more powerful way to interpret this than I understand my readers as writers. We tend to see the books about two men and the women as having the same sex in a particular manner, but as this is the last person we'll ever have to take our lives outside of our sexual lives, our book doesn't really need a lot of that.) The book is about a couple of people, the husband and sister, who all end up facing the same fate.

This is really funny. The book feels way worse about being about a woman than it is about a man. Why? Because in the world of books and movies, sex is so ubiquitous that every person's life is a mess. And not just for women, but also for men too, whether it's for the TV show or the books. In this case, an awful lot of people end up in this kind of hell because every bad girl is treated as a whore, that every shitty girl is treated more like a slut than like a man, and that if the same person were to be able to meet everyone's standards, each and every other, that every slut would be treated as the "victim". All the men can have the same life, because when you meet these people, you meet people who really want each other. I've read countless books.
