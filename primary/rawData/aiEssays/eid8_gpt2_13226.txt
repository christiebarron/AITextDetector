One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my daughter was 5 years old and her father told me I ought to say 'I can't think of anything better to laugh about.' I tried to get her to say 'I think a lot more!' He said yes it sounds like your nose is too small, but if it's big, then it's fine. I don't really have any problem with'stressing my good cheek' or 'dying my cheeks' as long as your eyeliner's on top, which I always tell my kids that has nothing to do with it. I think if I could see the line between laughing at your jokes and being the meanest of people who wouldn't be around me now... I'll say it again in about three minutes anyway.
