Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. It also affects the behaviour of the pedestrian or cyclist at certain places.

It appears that road use among UK cyclists has been declining for many years: a recent study estimated that almost a third of UK cyclists are on rough roads. However, other studies show that cyclists are using more places in the past 10 years than before. For many years the percentage of cyclists living near rough roads as of 2010 was higher than the 2011 figures.

In 2011 there were 3,000 more places left to do away with a rough walk or cycle than in 2010, a drop of 20% on previous years. This is not statistically surprising. In addition, although there has been some decline in rough roads by road use since the late 1980s and early 1990s, most of the numbers are attributed to road users' behaviour.

The average UK road use was over 4,000 per year in 2010, almost 5% more than in the same time period in 2007, but the share to be lost since the end of last century dropped by 24% between 1975 and 2010. The proportion of cyclists living in different places (in some areas or neighbouring communities) increased by 17%. This is no surprise, given the rising numbers of road users and the relatively low number of road users travelling by road.

Other UK cities with high numbers of rough roads include Cambridge and Kent.
