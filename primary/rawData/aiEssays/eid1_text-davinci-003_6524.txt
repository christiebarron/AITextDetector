To the Editor,

As a concerned reader, I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. While technology has provided numerous advantages and conveniences for many, this does not come without some trepidation. 

Computers have become an increasingly prominent means of communication and data sharing over the last few decades. Unfortunately, this has also come with drawbacks. All too often, people become overly consumed in computer technology, leading to an unhealthily dependence on electronic devices. Research has even suggested that this has had an impact on social and mental wellbeing, as the sustained use of computers can trigger negative emotions. 

It is, therefore, important that the use of computers is monitored properly. Organizations and businesses should ensure there is a manageable balance between using technology and regular social activities, especially for young adults who are more vulnerable. The same should apply to the general public, and computer use hours should be monitored in order to maintain adequate mental health.

I hope that this opinion serves to remind readers of the potential effects of technology and that computer use is monitored carefully.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
