One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was 9 or 10. It was a great feeling, and a wonderful experience – it was the absolute best thing that could happen for me.

As an actor, working in the music industry, there was so much to think about — music, film, acting, acting, music, writing – I was working on my own music videos to help my son, so when I saw something very like it that inspired me to write that album, I jumped at that opportunity. No, that was nothing new, that was a dream come true.

What you did to make yourself feel great was by the way you got to do your part. My mom encouraged me not to waste any time on the computer and just do music. Then my wife, too – she gave me a gift that I never had before. I read her memoir for a little while and read about music in her. That book was really good to watch in my early 20s and it had so much energy and emotion in it. I never really understood who she was or where she came from.

You wrote that you grew up in a jazz family. So did the singer-songwriter-writer situation ever take on a life of its own, or did it evolve over time. Was that not something that you heard?

My mother said that, 'If that doesn't make us happy, so be it, I don't care.'
