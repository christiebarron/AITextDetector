I believe that censorship of materials in libraries would not affect the freedom or well-being of our members. As such, we need to educate ourselves by carefully reading and reading carefully what we read. The Library of Congress should not allow this type of censorship to be allowed to benefit the libraries."

The letter was signed by representatives from all organizations, including the American Federation Association of Community College Administrators, Community Association of Community School Departments, and the American Association of Teachers.

"Since we have seen no evidence that censorship does anything more than harm individuals, it is time for the Library of Congress to stop its practices of publishing materials that hurt the lives of other organizations," stated Laura Brown, National Union of Teachers President.

"It would be absurd, though, to place any person in jail who disagrees with other individuals on the grounds that censorship can and should promote democracy. The Library is not 'corrupt,' but it is not a business institution, it is political."

The Library of Congress has long allowed copyright and other issues related to libraries "to be taught among members" in all libraries. Members of Congress can even be elected officials of the libraries of other states. This does not apply to this case.

The letter came on the heels of a lawsuit filed by a group of American Civil Liberties Union workers alleging that their rights under the First Amendment were violated when a school was illegally blocking access to materials by a library employee that was part of its staff.
