The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because the book covers everything you must know about Hibiscus.

He can't speak. He needs help.

There are a few books in the series I don't believe in, yet some of them are actually available in eBook format. I'm sure they're probably in order of their current states, as I mentioned earlier.

There's a lot more information to be found, and I encourage you to read the chapters with the comments you see before you start reading, for example, here (after you have read the chapter).

The main problem with the author of this book is his inability to actually write the rules. You might be able to get him to come up with some rules that work, but there have been dozens of people who have used similar ideas that have been wrongfully dismissed and ignored by some publishers.

I would strongly suggest reading the new book (here) to understand why that happens. One other note for you is that it will probably start out as a fairly standard set of rules, but that is pretty much all that happens to the entire series, so read carefully here.

He also does some very clever writing, which are hard to understand (see this page).

At the end of the day, this book is an exciting work that needs to be read by everybody. Everyone interested should probably get it, in this case, Hibiscus.
