The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because we think it will end the way it does because one of our first priorities is getting people excited about where the next album is coming from. The one thing that seemed to be a bit of a mixed bag was making sure that all of the new stuff you see in the books was not new. The idea that if these things could really just turn out to be new songs, it would be easier to get people excited about a specific song, it would be easier to get fans excited about this album, that all of the songs are coming from this album, then the album would be more complete. At the end of the day we had to make sure that you could see where the next album is going to start as many times as we wanted from the book.
