An example of a time someone in my life was patient was at a hospital giving birth to twins. I had to leave early so she could be the one who made the decision. So the doctor and nurse were with the twins as they were born. And we have had this conversation after they're born, 'What if I am not doing this and this was not right? What if this is it?' I feel like as an adult I am in love with that story.

So maybe a more profound, universal message, and that's maybe not something I would ever want to hear, for example, from other women. But that's the part that we need to tell the most, to change the dynamic in a situation, to be the one who makes the decision or the decision that creates the situation, as the first step.

MS. KORING: Now if you're just going over how my experience and my experience in that hospital changed your life, this is what you might say.

DAN BURGELY: Sure, you could say it has.

MS. KORING: How did it change your life?

DAN BURGELY: Well, it was because of our job. We were in very bad condition the first month of the hospital. It would always be a struggle. And we'd have to come up with new ideas. It was so much of an honor to be able to explain how to get the job done
