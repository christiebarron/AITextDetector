Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. Some of the changes are subtle, like reducing the number of lanes for cars to pass over on corners when needed, making more space in front of the bike lanes, and allowing pedestrians to see the bike and turn in more ways.

One new feature in Rough Road Ahead changes the colour of wheels. This is an ability that makes running in the bike lane slightly more attractive, and creates a slight bit of extra drag. As a rider in Rough Road Ahead, it is still more noticeable, though it would be nice to see the change come into full effect at a later date.

"Rough Road Ahead" is available on PC, Mac or Linux PCs, though the OS is still in development and is still an early prototype but it could be updated more at a later date. This should allow for more of a more open-world experience and the addition of some sort of mode that we might consider for the new feature.

There are several things in the pipeline for Rough Road Ahead where we expect to see the game, as well as features on the upcoming iOS, Android and PS3 games. This list includes an enhanced map and some fixes to several bugs in the game.

If you're interested in getting your hands on Rough Road Ahead, we have a review coming up in a few days, so keep an eye on the site for more features.
