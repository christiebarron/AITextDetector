An example of a time someone in my life was patient was our friend David B. in 1999 at a wedding in New Orleans with our daughter, who was three months pregnant, and she was giving birth to twins at 7 weeks, which was too young to be considered normal. I wrote me back, and then my wife and I went back and read it a lot. This story of my grandmother and me being so patient on and off the set caused many folks to realize that those who live in the world, and those who live in the universe, should be just as patient with the other, and, in fact, that we were very lucky.

The first day I wrote her, David was very gracious, very kind to help me to meet up with my mom to do laundry and to buy our wedding dress and we decided to go to a restaurant which was all over Los Angeles. "Oh, yeah in California, we can do it!" I was so thrilled with myself that it was a week before I actually went. Even though I had a week to live, in Los Angeles I had to go to New York to pick up my wedding dress and I had a car that had to go around to the airport to get to Boston to pick up my wedding dress. I had no budget, no time, and I had already packed my bags at the end of a long night going in and out of airports. I didn't get home, not for the week before it was due,
