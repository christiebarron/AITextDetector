The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because its main characters come and go without ever being dead. It's a shame that they never come out in season two... but that doesn't stop it from being so well received this season.

7. The Game

"A Game has a lot of the same ingredients as a comic book, but some of them have completely different mechanics... A Game must be entertaining and unique, but can still not be made without the players doing some of the same things they did in the comic. One thing I particularly love about this is that it lets the players create a play session, so it is not just one story-based game, it is a whole season with the different storylines of the world and its characters."
