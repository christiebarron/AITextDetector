The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it shows "hippie psychology as a whole," says Robert M. Anderson, a professor of neurology at University of Pittsburgh and a professor of psychology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "This is sort of an all-nighter about the neurobiological basis of everything." We hear of the "repercussions of post-traumatic stress syndrome" and "post-traumatic stress disorder," the former with physical or genetic damage to the brain, and the latter, with emotional distress and loss of self-control. "Many people have seen this as they took on the job of treating traumatic brain injury and felt inebriated, or were in the most depressed state," Anderson says.

Anderson and his colleague, David A. Hines, of Harvard Medical School, look for clues in an old book about the brain's immune response. A team of scientists from Harvard Medical School, the National Institute of Mental Health, the University of Washington and the University of Michigan, among others, studied the
