 

Dear Editor,

I am writing to discuss the effects that computers have on people, and why I believe the readers of this paper should agree with me.

The ever-growing ubiquity of computers in modern culture has brought with it a utility and convenience that few of us could have imagined even twenty years ago. We have come to rely on computers in all aspects of our lives, from banking, communication, entertainment and even education. There is no question that computers have made a radical and positive impact on our lives. 

However, one should not overlook the darker side of computer technology. I do not mean the periodic malicious viruses or scams that one must contend with, but rather the actual effect that using computers can have on human cognition and behavior. Studies have shown that with prolonged computer use, an individualâ€™s attention span can shrink and physical activity can decrease to dangerous levels. Succumbing to these trends can create an almost sedentary lifestyle and negatively affect the physical and mental health of an individual.

This is why I believe that readers should consider the effects computers have on people when deciding how to use them. While computers can be incredibly useful tools, it is important to remember that they should be used in moderation in a manner that is beneficial to us. 

Sincerely, 
 
[Name]
