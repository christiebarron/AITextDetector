Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. These are those points that have received a lot of attention due to the potential impact to cyclists of any extra time spent doing traffic or doing other work and those are particularly important in helping you decide how far you should go to try and save a bike.

Rough Road Ahead In terms of 'Rough Road Ahead', they mean 'the roads you go round in front of' or 'the roads that are at the centre of the road'. Some cyclists may want to take a break and walk to or from a particular road and there may be a gap between the two as opposed to getting back and forth from place to place. The same can be said for others such as road bikers and those who take off and return to their homes when they should be home. There may be other ways to get back and off the road, but I recommend that to your general cyclist it is as simple as driving.
