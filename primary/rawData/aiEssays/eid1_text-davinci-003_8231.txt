The construction of the Empire State Building saw many innovative ideas being brought to the drawing board, but one of the most ambitious was the plan to set up a mooring mast for dirigibles to dock at the building. However, this plan faced numerous obstacles that needed to be overcome before a dirigible could fly into one of the world’s most iconic landmarks.

One of the biggest obstacles to allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was the need for an adequate mooring mast. The two mast designs being considered needed to be able to support the enormous weight of the airships while also remaining steady in the wind. The original idea was to mount four steel beams on top of the building, but calculations revealed this would be unsafe. In the end, the design of the mooring mast was modified so that it was suspended by four cables attached to the sides of the building, with the added advantage of providing additional stability.

Other obstacles that needed to be addressed in order to construct a successful mooring mast included the risk of air turbulence caused by the skyscraper’s size. In addition, the docking mast needed to be securely attached to the building so that it could withstand stormy weather conditions. The difficulty of setting up the mooring mast was compounded by the fact that the process needed to be carried out during the building's construction, when all the existing equipment and personnel were already busy. As a result, it
