I recently had an experience that reminded me of the importance of being patient. I was at the mall shopping for shoes for a wedding I was going to. Everywhere I looked I couldn’t find anything that I truly loved. After several hours of searching, I was getting frustrated and was ready to give up. 

Right when I was about to give up, I heard a voice behind me say, “Are you still looking for that perfect pair?” I turned around and saw a smiling saleswoman who had been helping me for the past few hours. She then proceeded to take me to the back of the store where she had saved a few pairs of shoes that she had noticed me eyeing earlier. She told me to take my time and find the perfect pair.

Even though I had been so frustrated earlier before her help, I stayed patient and appreciative of her help. Eventually I was able to find the perfect pair of shoes that matched my dress. As I was leaving, I thanked her for her patience and understanding. This experience reminded me that sometimes being patient pays off and it's important to stay appreciative of those who help you.
