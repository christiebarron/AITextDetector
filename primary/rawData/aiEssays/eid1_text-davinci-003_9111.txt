Dear [Newspaper],

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. In today's world, computers are an integral part of our lives, and have drastically changed the way we interact with the world. In the past, computers were used mainly for business operations, but are now used in almost every facet of daily life.

I believe that computers have made life better and simpler for people in many ways. For instance, they allow us to be more productive and efficient in our everyday tasks. With the help of the internet, we can access information quickly and learn new skills or conduct research more easily. Computers have also made communication easier, allowing people to instantly connect with others no matter where they are in the world.

However, it is important to note that computers can also have negative effects. With the availability of the internet, people often become reliant on technology and do not take the time to think or engage in creative activities. Additionally, computers present the potential for cyberbullying and other internet crimes.

As such, we must be aware of the potential pitfalls of computer use and take steps to ensure that computers are used in a responsible way. We should be mindful of our own use and the impact it has on others. By doing so, we can make sure that computers are used to better the lives of people rather than diminish them.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your
