I just recently had surgery, and so was out of commission for a while. I was feeling really down and frustrated because of how long it was taking for me to heal and be able to be more active again. It was really hard for me to be patient, but I knew that this was something I had to do. 

My friend would come to visit and talk with me every day, which was really nice and helped pass the time. One day, my friend came to visit but I was in a really bad mood. We had been talking for a few minutes when I interupted her in mid-sentence and started to get mad and grumpy. But instead of getting mad or annoyed, she just calmly looked at me and said, “It’s ok if you’re not feeling your best right now. I know that this whole process is taking a while and it’s hard to be patient.” 

Her understanding and patience with me was really touching. She reminded me that being patient was important, and I was able to take a deep breath and focus on getting better. Since then, I’ve learned to be more patient and understanding with myself during difficult times.
