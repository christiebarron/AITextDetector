Dear Editor,

In today's world, computers are everywhere. From handheld smartphones to gargantuan computers used in NASA, these machines are ubiquitous. As such, computers are responsible for a vast array of tasks across the globe- ranging from providing education to helping solve medical issues. However, it is also true that computers have a significant effect on the lives of the people who interact with them.

From an individual's perspective, computers provide a wealth of opportunities. In many cases, having access to a computer can make the individual more connected with the world. It allows people to locate new information or participate in a wider range of activities compared to if they did not have access to a computer. Moreover, computers can help to encourage the growth of creativity and critical thinking skills for those who use them.

At the same time, long periods of computer use can also have an adverse effect on people. Those who spend too much time using a computer tend to develop physical problems such as eye strain or headaches. It can also lead to emotional consequences, such as a decrease in self-esteem or lack of social interaction.

Overall, while computers have opened up the world for many, their effects can be damaging if not used in moderation. I urge the readers to use computers responsibly and not let them take over their lives, so that everyone may make the most of the opportunities it provides.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
