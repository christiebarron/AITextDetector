I met my best friend in high school, and ever since then we've been inseparable. We quickly bonded over our shared sense of humor, and the times we spent together were always filled with laughter.

One of my favorite memories with her is from our senior year in high school. We had been studying for finals all day long and had reached the point of exhaustion. Instead of using our break to grab a snack or take a nap, we decided to just laugh. 

We started off with a few puns and goofy jokes, which quickly escalated to full-on laughter. I remember being on the floor, rolling around and clutching my stomach, crying out with laughter. In addition to our shared sense of humor, I think it was also the element of relief that we were feeling now the exams were almost finished.

Through my friendship with her, I've learned to not take the little things in life too seriously. Even in future years when our lives got increasingly busy with work and adulting stuff, we've managed to always find ways to laugh together. Itâ€™s something I treasure about our friendship and is something that I look forward to for many years to come.
