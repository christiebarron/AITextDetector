The setting in ‘Rough Road Ahead’ by Joe Kurmaski has a significant impact on the cyclist. Perhaps the most significant feature of the setting is the hilly landscape. The long climbs, cut through with deep ravines, present a significant challenge for the cyclist as they traverse the terrain. The heat and sun serve to increase the difficulty of the ride, and the cyclist has to fight through the relentless terrain. In addition, the setting is remote, and there are few chances for rest and refuelling. 

The cyclist also has to contend with the force of the wind. The roads are exposed to the elements, leaving the cyclist on open ground to battle the strong gusts that come with the wild country. The wind adds another factor to the difficulty of the ride, making it harder to ascend the steep climbs. 

Ultimately, the features of the setting act as a formidable opponent for the cyclist. The hilly terrain, the heat, sun, and wind conspire to make the ride grueling, Dealing with the physical difficulty of the terrain also brings emotional and psychological challenges, as the cyclist struggles against the relentless forces of nature. The triumph of overcoming these challenges is expressed by the cyclist at the end of the story, when he eventually is able to make it back to his car.
