The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' has to respect the personal stories, even of victims. After her father, Hilda MacLeod, died in 1982, it is important to remember, not that men, particularly men of colour, were neglected by the South African judiciary.

'From Home' asks "I have some questions to ask and I feel comfortable with all of the suggestions" – as some commentators want to do when facing a woman who is in the middle of an abusive relationship. If this kind of woman wants to get pregnant, it cannot, and should, go unpunished. As a result, women's voices are not often heard and women as a whole deserve respect.

It does however, ask, that we remember women who are not just victims of rape and mistreatment but also want to have their voices heard as long as they respect women who are also victims, just in this case in that case. We shouldn't forget that "From Home", a book for men, has long been a source of nationalJump Magazine stories and some of the best reviews are coming from men – some of them who are working for organisations such as Women and Children, the Women's Equality Campaign, Women's National Action Network and Women's Network Foundation. We are being told that women are victims of rape, but what you have to remember is that our society is built around women's stories – because men are seen to be weak, powerful and vulnerable women.
