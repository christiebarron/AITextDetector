The construction of the Empire State Building in 1931 was a huge undertaking, and one of the most popular aspects of the building was the fact that it was designed to allow dirigibles to dock within its massive heights. Despite the fact that this technological feat seemed like an optimal way to the indulge in the future, there were many obstacles the builders faced in allowing dirigibles to actually dock on the building.

The first obstacle was figuring out what type of support the Empire State Building was able to provide. In order for dirigibles to dock, the building would need to be able to withstand the weight of the aircraft and any additional passengers on board. This requirement ran the risk of putting too much strain on the building’s structure, which had to be taken into consideration. It was also necessary to invest in a mooring mast, which was a protruding rod that extended from the mast in order to hook the airship in place and stop it from floating away.

The second obstacle was safety. The Empire State Building was in the heart of a bustling city, and the safety of those on the ground had to be taken into consideration. This was especially important when factoring in the dirigible’s size and weight, which had the potential to cause a lot of damage to the building and to those below if it was not properly docked. Building such a structure capable of keeping the dirigible safely moored was a huge task, and thus the
