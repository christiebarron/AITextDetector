The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' reflects that of many who have suffered through the horrors of World War One.

Mikael Zwirmer (C), pictured with his wife Yael in 2015, describes the shock and disbelief caused by her husband of 22 years

In the wake of the shooting, his wife, Yael, posted a video on Instagram that she had witnessed the aftermath of his loss and what Zwirmer called 'what I could not have imagined' when she met him.

Zwirmer had hoped to get revenge for his brother's death after he received threatening phone calls and messages from the couple's own families, The Times reported.

But a few days after the shooting police discovered his estranged brother, who is now 77 years old, was dead. An inquest found he died of a lack of pain and his relatives were still reeling from this tragedy.

A statement from his parents told the paper: 'He was a happy boy. I love him. I'm sorry that it became public. We are saddened by the loss of his brother's life.

'We are praying for his passing, and wishing him the best in his long career.'
