I had recently hired a new intern to help me with some of my projects. I was aware that she was inexperienced and didn't have as much knowledge as I did on the tasks, so I was prepared to have to give her a lot of instruction. 

At first, I found myself getting rather impatient with her--after all, there were a lot of tasks to finish, and I had assumed that walking her through them once would be enough. However, every time I saw her making mistakes, I reminded myself to be patient. 

I made sure to take the time to explain things clearly, and to allow her time to understand and ask questions. I also refrained from getting frustrated or demanding that she pick up on everything right away. I could sense that my patience was reassuring her and allowing her to take her time to learn and develop her skills. 

After a few weeks, she had improved noticeably, and I was glad that I had taken the time to be patient with her instead of demanding immediate results.
