The idea of having dirigibles dock on the top of the Empire State Building was a tantalizing proposition during the early twentieth century, but there were many obstacles that the builders of this iconic New York City landmark needed to overcome. The “mooring mast” of the Empire State Building was the key to allowing dirigibles to dock and the obstacles facing the builders included the need to build a strong enough mast in order to withstand strong winds, the cost associated with constructing it, and the impact of having a large vessel land on the building. 

The construction of the mooring mast was not a simple matter. As author Marcia Amidon Lüsted states in “The Mooring Mast”, “The mast had to be strong enough to withstand winds of up to 70 miles per hour and hold a large, heavy dirigible sagging an additional 500 feet below the top of the building.” The mast also needed to be designed to handle the strong winds that came with the notoriously unpredictable weather in New York City. The costs associated with designing and building a mast that could handle such conditions meant that the project was not feasible without significant levels of investment. 

Furthermore, the impact of having dirigibles dock on the top of the building had to be taken into consideration. The engineers were concerned that the sudden descent of a large airship, which weighed up to five tons, could cause cracks in the building or even cause
