Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have had on people. As a person who relies heavily upon technology for work and leisure activities, I have experienced first-hand the immense potential of computers to enhance our lives.

At work, computers have become a cornerstone of modern business. From data analysis to communication, business owners rely upon computers to efficiently complete tasks that would otherwise take hours. The use of computers enables businesses to save time and money which can be used to further drive innovation and generate profits.

Computers also have a vast range of applications outside of business and industry. From streaming movies and playing games to browsing news websites and connecting with friends, computers provide us with an unparalleled range of ways to spend our free time. While there are certainly risks of spending too much time online, overall, computers provide us with a wealth of helpful options to stay connected to the world.

Overall, computers have had a tremendous positive impact on our lives. They have provided us with the ability to quickly finish tasks, stay connected to friends, and find new ways to spend our free time. For these reasons, I am confident that any reader of this paper should be in support of the profound positive effects computers have had on our lives.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
