An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a person who had a very short and painless career and was working to stay one day at a time. She asked her parents why they were not making the arrangements to move from New York City, she answered, "My kids just told them that my kids are going to school in Brooklyn. They knew from the way her story played out there that she was going to be there."

When we started talking about family and child care, she knew all about this.

"It wasn't just her own family. It was everywhere." I asked about the women who are in the middle of their own stories.

"The mothers and fathers of this young generation may have been in a lot of pain, but they also have had some wonderful, positive things in life that they have experienced, and their support, encouragement and support from one another is just so wonderful."

The fact that there are hundreds of thousands of families with children in New York also helps to create a sense of support for young children, who like their parents, have a very healthy family life.

And we all know the difference between a healthy family life and a broken one.

"So many of you see how so many other families don't go through that."
