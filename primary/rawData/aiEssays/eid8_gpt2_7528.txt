One time I experienced laughter in my life was when courting a Viz. And when someone tried to put a smile on me, my smile came out. I would laugh my head off, always have. I would also look back at you and smile as you smiled. As some people do, because I thought my smile was perfect, I gave your smile more attention. I had the confidence to know if I like that. To be honest, I'm glad I did. Just like they said, I have hope and hope inside. And if it weren't for you, I might have a great day. -M.T. (LOL's Twitter] I hate to be the one and only person to say "thank you" to any character. Just because they do, doesn't mean that they deserve the honor or respect. We should all think differently. But the time to be thankful is only when you have a purpose. No one ever forgets that. The world is broken. We need to do something about the brokenness. We should help make this a better world. But that doesn't happen alone, and when that doesn't happen, our lives come crashing down, too. I see the world one way, but that doesn't mean we don't want to feel it. This world is not our only place. But we should be striving even further. Thank you so much for everything that was touched on. It has been a long time since I have felt anything truly
