I believe that censorship of materials in libraries serves to spread the corruption that is taking place. This is not something that should happen to our universities."

In the end, the university agreed to let Goa's president take the spot "because it was an effective first step toward our political awakening."

In May, Goa, which is home to most of the country's top digital media companies and has seen the most protests, announced it was closing down its campus and calling on the city government to reconsider its plans to open up the university to foreign students.

"You can't just move to Germany without taking in foreign students," Goa's Goan University spokesman said.

Goa's mayor added that Goa University doesn't "feel that it is a good option for foreign students and that it should take steps to educate them."
