Computers have many effects on people. Think about the effect of running a fast computer. You'll notice you run a lot faster on your laptop. This is because you have less space for all these applications and other resources. Now consider a small computer with 256 bits of memory (or 512 if you use a Pentium, with 512 bits available for all these applications). In addition, all other programs on this computer is written to the RAM (1024 bytes by default). That means once you start your laptop, every program on this processor is loaded by the processor. This speed is much greater compared to what's available on the big system.

If in your case you really want to make your computer run on a higher level processor (and you just want a much faster CPU), this is where we'll look at the following problem. Remember how I didn't say computers have more CPU? Well, there's no question that they have a lot of memory (it can vary among different processors, so you really always want a processor which is both a processor and a system (with as many cores available). On Windows 2000 you don't have as many CPU as on Windows XP so you could run on older versions that had only 4 cores on one processor). So if you run on a system where there are two 32-bit processors running at the same time (instead of the 4 cores used by the processor in Windows XP and XP SP2 and SP3), you'll see this. So,
