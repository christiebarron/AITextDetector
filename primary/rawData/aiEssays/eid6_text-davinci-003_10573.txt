The story of the Empire State Building is one of triumph over obstacles. When the building was designed and built, the original plan was to allow dirigibles to dock on the roof of the building, thus becoming a famed symbol of the modernity of its time. However, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges in achieving this dream.

As detailed in Marcia Amidon Lusted's 'The Mooring Mast', the biggest obstacle for the builders of the Empire State Building to overcome in order for dirigibles to dock was the risk to lives and property that might be incurred if something went wrong. Dirigibles had recently been involved in several high-profile disasters, including the Hindenburg explosion, leading to the builders of the building being concerned that something similar could happen in their own building. This was especially concerning given the location of the building in the heart of Manhattan, amidst other expensive properties.

The building planners thus took a number of precautions in designing the mooring mast, the structure that the dirigibles would dock on. They employed the use of a swiveling mast, that could be adjusted to the wind and anchored to the roof of the building, to reduce the risk of the dirigible 'dragging' or swinging off course. There were also safety checks to mitigate the risk of a spark from static electricity igniting the gases within the dirigible, as had happened in some previous instances.

The dirigibles were
