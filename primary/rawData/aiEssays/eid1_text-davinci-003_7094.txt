The issue of censorship in libraries is an issue that requires careful consideration. On one hand, the library exists to provide resources to the public, and these resources should be available to all. On the other hand, the purpose of a library should not be to be a place to access offensive materials.

It is reasonable to ensure that libraries provide materials that are suitable for all to access. Age-appropriate materials should be carefully considered, as younger audiences may not be exposed to certain offensive materials. Additionally, libraries should not be a platform for propaganda, as it may promote certain points of view over others.

That being said, access to information should not be completely removed because it may be deemed ‘offensive’. Libraries traditionally exist as a place for all to have access to different points of view and opinions, and by curbing certain lines of thought, libraries will become biased institutions that do not respect the diversity of thought. The library should not be a place to police opinions, as this may infringe on the free exchange of information.

The issue of censorship in libraries should be approached with caution. It is necessary to consider the materials that are suitable for the intended audiences, without creating an environment in which certain points of view are suppressed. The library should remain open as a platform for free speech and the free exchange of ideas, while respecting the boundaries that are in place in order to protect younger audiences.
