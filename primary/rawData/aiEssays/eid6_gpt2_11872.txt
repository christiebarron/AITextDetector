The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Two-foot-wide tires and wheel wells were a hindrance, the latter of which had to be shut down due to the extreme weight of steel needed to lift the concrete from the ground. Most famously, New York City had its own dirigibles that could only dock with an elevated bar, as were the two-way wheels that required more power. On the other hand, the new height limits permitted dirigibles only to dock with a bar larger than a man's waist. Since the height limits created a high barrier between the builders and the audience, the height of the bars was not the same as that required for a single-family house. In order to prevent the height of the wheels, both the builders and spectators were allowed to mount the wheels on their backs, without any other obstructions. In any case, a number of constraints were imposed on dirigibles, as witnessed in the opening scenes. 1 The new gravity of the floors of the Empire State Building prevented the spectators from reaching heights as high as they would have been capable of under normal conditions. In the following scenes, the gravity of the blocks of concrete was so high that the audience simply stopped.

In any event, the height of one-way, double-wide, single-wide, and two-way dirigs in an Empire State Building were far from optimal. In a few instances,
