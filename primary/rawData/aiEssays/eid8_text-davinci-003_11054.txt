I remember the first night I met my future partner. We had been talking for a week, and we'd finally decided to meet for coffee and chat face-to-face. I was a little nervous, but I couldn't have asked for a better first date. He was funny and charming, talking non-stop and making me laugh with stories of his adventures and experiences. I was quickly drawn in by his wit and charm.

We spent the evening talking and laughing, and found ourselves staying in the cafe much later than we intended. I was enjoying his company and getting to know him, and I felt like I had known him for a long time. The evening ended with one of the most infectious laughs I have ever heard. We both burst out in uncontrollable laughter at the same time and it felt like it could have been a moment captured from one of the romantic comedy movies.

It would be the start of a beautiful relationship and we'd laugh together many times in the years to come. The shared laughs were special and many of my happiest memories involve the two of us laughing until our sides hurt.

It's true that laughter is the shortest distance between two people, and I am so grateful for that wonderful night where laughter so effortlessly brought us closer together.
