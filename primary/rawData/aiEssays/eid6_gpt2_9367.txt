The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In many cases, the engines were built in tandem and didn't share a primary source of power. The state government also had to make decisions not only on the size of their engines but also on the number of engines needed for the required parts and other maintenance.

However, the State Administration for Transport (WTI) had limited capacity to offer dirigibles, and so the building of additional dirigible engines to allow more pilots to pilot a large number of aircraft was a challenge. "The WTI was reluctant to offer dirigibles to the public and said it would not put up any cost for such a large number of models. It was decided to launch a project and had about 300 volunteers sign up for pilot pilot training," says Mark Legg, the WTI chair, before getting the idea for the new dirigible engine.

In August 2008, the WTI decided to buy the remaining 20 dirigibles and convert them into mini-engines called mini-wingless aircraft. The company was then able to build the mini-engine, and use its existing engine design, it says. "We saw a growing demand for a new solution and our next steps are as follows: build smaller engine designs and use new engines. The mini-engine has to be fully-detached from the propellers and the propellers must be re-detached and be built independently to allow
