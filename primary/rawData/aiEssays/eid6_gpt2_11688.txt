The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first was the sheer scope of a dirigible -- it was only about 200 feet long by 140 feet long. That was impossible when the ground underneath would reach the sky to provide shelter beyond the ceiling. So the project collapsed under costs of thousands of dollars.

It was during this time that a large portion of the work began to go on outside the building. This cost was increased with the construction of a new public gallery and building materials, and they could be placed at the beginning of the new building. The new building, which opened in 1879, had 18,000 square feet (19,300 square meters) of space by 1878, and was one of the first residential structures to be built on the outskirts of Chicago. The new building was completed in 1877 and was one of only two new public buildings that were used as residences by the Chicago Tribune.

The Chicago Tribune was founded by the early 19th century writer, William Clayton. He lived in St. Louis and had built at least two buildings in Chicago before he migrated to Chicago. His work included numerous building materials for the Tribune and public libraries; some of which were later used for advertisements and books. His brother William Stroud was a Chicago lawyer who became an apprentice as a manager at a lumber yard. William was also involved in many other civic and business endeavors, including in the area of civic and other financial matters
