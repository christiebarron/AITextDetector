I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is an inappropriate response and an affront to public trust."

One library spokesman said the move makes it clear what is actually in the libraries' custody and should be the case regardless if that library should be raided.

But the department's guidelines state that the library should not be kept on "the shelf on a shelf in lock-down state." But in California, though state laws are in place to protect libraries from being raided, the policy prohibits using "any tangible object" in or about their collections.

"Given the seriousness of the issue at stake, it is important that the authorities of the state take this issue seriously," said department spokesman Matt McRae.

"With the state already doing this, most books are still accessible on a shelf," he said of the situation with the library.

That is not something most libraries are doing, and has contributed to a culture of being restricted from doing so, said the assistant superintendent of libraries. There have also been growing requests that libraries become more explicit about what books shouldn't show up in the library, she incapacifies, and keeps some books from being searched, but most books would not be found on private property.
