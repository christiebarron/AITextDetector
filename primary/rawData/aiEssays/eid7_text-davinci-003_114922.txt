Recently, my daughter finished her first year in college and was coming home for a visit. She usually came home for the holidays, but because of COVID-19, she was home indefinitely. 

We had a lot of different plans and ideas for how she could spend her summer, but it was difficult to know what was safe and what wasn't. We had to be very patient as we waited for more information and guidelines about how to move forward. 

In the meantime, we took things day by day. We watched movies and took drives down to the beach. We made ridiculous TikToks and cooked together. We picked projects that we could work on outside of the house, like putting together a new garden or making a jigsaw puzzles. 

Though it was hard to not know what to do, we did our best to remain patient and flexible. We realized that this was an opportunity to just enjoy each other's company and take advantage of being together again. It was a difficult, but ultimately rewarding, experience.
