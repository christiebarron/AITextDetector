The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' by British singer-songwriter and songwriter Tim McBurney is to put off the project for at least five years, says the singer's ex-girlfriend and songwriter.

'We had a break from the band a couple of years ago and it's been a really long time on the road to come of age and to have this time where we've spent so much time together and have done so much of that, let alone what we started.'

Despite being in love with music from the 90s and beyond, the singer said that his self-satisfaction was only partly due to the fact that 'having lived in a home where we were surrounded by people at all times and listening to music at full volume, the feeling is what has kept me going.'

'It's just the feeling of being able to talk to people about my life,' he added.

'As a human being, I feel like a bigger part of what we achieved this year is the relationship we've developed.
