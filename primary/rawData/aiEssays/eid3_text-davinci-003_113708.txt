The setting of Joe Kurmaski's story, "Rough Road Ahead," adds a sense of suspense and danger to the narrative. The setting is a lonely country road that the cyclist is alone on, the perfect place for an accident to occur. Furthermore, the setting is described in the story as uneven and treacherous, having pot-holes, bumps, and rocks that are often difficult to see until they are almost upon them. This provides a physical threat to the cyclist, creating the possibility of them falling off their bicycle due to unexpected terrain and thus increasing the danger of the situation.

Lighting also plays a role in the setting of the story, as the cyclist does not have much of it. This lack of light, while it does not pose a physical danger, still creates a sense of the unknown and uncertainty for the cyclist. What could be hiding in the darkness ahead? Will they be able to make it to their destination? These questions cannot be answered, thus adding to the tension and suspense of the story.

Finally, the setting of the story creates a feeling of loneliness. The cyclist is alone in a place that's unfamiliar and strange. Thus, if anything were to happen, the cyclist would be completely responsible for their own safety. This further increases the sense of risk and danger, as the cyclist cannot rely on anyone else to save them from themselves. 

In summary, the setting of "Rough Road Ahead" is vital to the story,
