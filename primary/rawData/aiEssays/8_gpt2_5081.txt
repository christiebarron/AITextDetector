One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I had a moment of anxiety and I realized how easily it could make the world a better place, and the world would never see the bad of it.

So now I hope that in just a few years I'll find happiness and begin to feel love through actions.

Do you have a favourite thing you can do if not make a decision that may help a person feel happier in their life?
