Dear Editor,

As technology progresses, computers are becoming an increasingly integral part of our lives. While I believe computers provide users with innumerable benefits and opportunities, I'm also concerned about the impact they have on people's lives. 

The widespread introduction of computers creates a sedentary lifestyle for those who use them on a daily basis. This has numerous consequences on peopleâ€™s overall health, such as increased risk of obesity, diabetes, and osteoporosis. Excessive computer usage can also impair people's sleep and reduce the quality of their sleep. It has been linked to an increased risk of developing psychological problems such as depression and anxiety.

On the other hand, computers offer many advantages such as the convenience of e-commerce, online learning, and social media. Computers can also help people stay connected with the world and keep up with the latest news.

My conclusion is that while computers enable us to accomplish our tasks more quickly and efficiently, we must make sure to use them in moderation otherwise we risk suffering from negative health effects. Encouraging people to exercise regularly and use computers only sparingly is essential to maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

Sincerely, 
Your Name Here
