The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because even though I know more than people about The Dragon, this book is still not perfect. One, I understand the need for an adventure-driven novel that involves all of you and it has never really helped me with an RPG concept, or with genre-bending action-packed romance or romance-mature romance. The other half, writing the book, was tedious and did not feel interesting or important enough. That is not to say the author's story-telling process is without its difficulties. The ending of Winter Hibiscus is a great story-telling adventure. While most of the story is set in the near future, I was not comfortable with it. Because of that, I have written many more chapters of Winter Hibiscus to give you an easier understanding on where I am on how I intend to approach the world-building process, how I write or think of things, and where a lot of the action involves a lot of character development. As a result of these things, the story has a very complex structure, and it has had to be taken care of and expanded over the many years of the book.

We were still able to wrap an A&E book up in one sitting on May 22 and release it in the spring of 2014. Then we had to write a new chapter, I really don't say that in this forum, and the A&E blog's not a great place to start.
