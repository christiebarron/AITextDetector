In a 2012 article, Borkoff said that teachers had also "welcomed censorship," "encouraged the dissemination" of information at critical moments when public awareness of the topic warranted an effective public response when students would have a clear sense for their research.

It's unclear if teachers at public universities are aware of censorship. It Registrar of the University of Calgary, for example, acknowledged that "information available to students at University of Calgary's university libraries could be viewed as a source for potentially offensive content that could jeopardize the reputation and education of the library or other institutions." As pointed out by the Chronicle, there were numerous issues with the system.

One of the most common and troubling concerns concerns teachers were being told by students to read before class or even before, during, or after a class. According to the Chronicle, during "two-hour and six-hour classes at the University of Calgary (including an introduction)," while about one-quarter of students read an external document, only about three-quarters of students read the information aloud before it was presented at class.

When students received notices of inappropriate content, teachers reported it to the school administration. The Chronicle asked the university to correct this problem, as teachers had no way to tell how much to say, for example through non-responses to an explicit, personal and personal question. In
