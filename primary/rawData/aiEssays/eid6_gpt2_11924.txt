The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first was the lack of space for the cockpit. The two main systems involved: a single light-up display unit and a low-def position system. The low-def version of the cockpit that required a single light-up display could not be installed in every building. Also, the new canopy had smaller diameter windows that could have been folded horizontally and rotated in different directions. But, they were expensive and didn't allow for the full versatility of an ultra-secure cockpit.

The second obstacle was the cost. By 1973, the first prototype had cost about $150 million. It was a complex design. A long-term engineering estimate of about $150 million proved to be optimistic â€” a cost that cost not only the Empire State Building; it was the entire Pentagon in particular. A second, more challenging obstacle was the development of a pilotable airplane. A single light-up unit would bring the power to the cockpit's main aircraft. No airplane would have the flight control capabilities of a conventional fighter plane, which required three different weapons systems. That proved to be more challenging from a engineering perspective than one might initially suspect.

A third obstacle was getting funding. After the initial delays and cost overruns for the initial prototype, a consortium called NHTSA put together the first National Defense Systems Agency (NDSA). While it was under the impression that the consortium would not have the
