I recently went to a restaurant for lunch with my friends, and our wait time was taking a bit longer than expected. Everyone in my group was getting antsy, but I reminded to everyone to be patient. I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt given how busy the restaurant was. Everyone eventually calmed down and accepted the fact that our order wouldn't come out as fast as we would have liked. Eventually, after about 20 minutes, our food did come out, and it was definitely worth the wait!
