An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a father and daughter of a couple who had a new child who was going to be a girl. The two mothers said the children will grow up more quickly than they had planned! "You know, there's a lot of fear when a young person goes through things with their parents. And then there's this fear when the person does well. So they'll take things and go to their parents, and it can get very emotional indeed."

To my knowledge, no matter how much you or I try to control our children, and have them develop into people they can become, there are no guarantees. If we want to have the best possible relationships with these individuals and be successful, we need to give those relationships more thought and focus.
