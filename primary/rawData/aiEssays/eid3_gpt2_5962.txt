Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. Firstly, it is more reliable and takes longer. Secondly, it is more stable and faster. The final result is you can do better at both tasks without ever trying to 'waste' a large chunk of the time or even time in the run.

A Few Examples of Training with 'Rough Road Ahead'

The biggest difference between 'Rough Road Ahead' and 'Road and Track', though, is that you'll have to run faster to achieve it. In 'Road of a lifetime' you will almost certainly feel tired at some point on the run, so it's important that you don't use your left arm as much and never use it more than just for walking.

Rough Road Ahead should also be used in the final part of a training session.

For those wanting a more advanced approach, 'Rough Road Ahead' can be used in both runs, and it's worth doing if you're already training for one activity. It may get you some mileage out of it, but to really see a lasting impact on your life and work, use it as you will, with much less effort.
