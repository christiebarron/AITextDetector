One time I experienced laughter in my life was when it took my wife and I sitting in our local bar one evening to watch a show "What Happens In the House" that featured a pair of men trying to escape a crime and then being raped.

He says that he has had to be told that the victims only knew they were being raped by the man who drove them home. Once he was able to explain his view on how the event should have been seen, the man walked out of the hall naked.

The couple decided to come home, only to be assaulted by another man. He was rushed to the hospital with a fractured leg. On his third day of fighting with police, he ended up spending weeks in intensive care. He eventually had surgery to remove two of his right elbow, while doctors still believe he is suffering from brain damage. The damage is the result of repeated blows to the head, neck, and hand and is estimated to have cost the couple $50,000.

Since, a judge has declared the attack was a robbery and the victim has been released. But, he says, the police won't be able to arrest the attacker in the case for a "crime of passion" once his trial begins.
