In the story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, the features of the setting are integral to the cyclist’s experience of the journey. The narrator is cycling a route along a country side road that has become increasingly degraded with potholes, rocks, and other hazards. The road is surrounded by a “welcoming countryside” filled with trees, flowers and wheat fields; this landscape serves as a constant reminder of the contrast between its idyllic beauty and the demanding, treacherous road ahead of the cyclist.

The cyclist experiences a juxtaposition of emotions as they move forward; they take in the beauty of the landscape but must brace themselves for the road ahead. The narrator recounts the experience of the rising pitch of the terrain as well as the physical effort it takes to push their bike through mud and the fear of encounters with snakes and other creatures. The cyclist other details the heightened attention they must take with each pedal of their bike as they struggle to maintain traction or avoid bicycle sabotage by large rocks.

The specifics of the deteriorating road hints at a kind of theme of neglect and disregard for the cyclist; the broken roads are framed as a symbol of failure in the maintenance of the infrastructure, and the cyclist is presented as a weary traveler, struggling to maintain control over a route designed to be unfair. Each of the features of the setting serves to expand the themes of the story, shaping the cyclist’s experience of the journey
