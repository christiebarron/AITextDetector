 

I remember sitting in my aunt's living room with my cousins on a lazy summer day. We were excitedly sharing stories and laughing at the silly things we did when we were younger. I'll never forget the contagious laughter that filled the room as we went back and forth, expressing our most embarrassing moments from childhood.

Before we knew it, we'd been at it for hours, telling stories and laughing until our stomachs hurt. It felt like a blissful moment that lasted an eternity, until finally, my aunt came in and offered us some ice cream. Never had I been so grateful for a processed sugar-filled treat! As soon as each of us grabbed a bowl of ice cream with a big spoon, the laughter started again. Somehow, the sweetness of the creamy concoction made our stories and jokes even funnier! 

We spent the rest of the evening like that, with my aunt even joining in on our stories and laughter. Each of us left her house with sore bellies, smiles, and shared memories of the best laughter-filled day.
