Computers have many effects on people. And one is to make your life more miserable. In fact it can do more harm than good, according to data that looks at the number of people it has hurt.

Researchers from the Australian Institute of Management and the University of NSW had their work examined for the first time by using data from a database designed around the country and Australia to gauge the impact of a business' decision-maker on its employees. They found that people perceived higher turnover rates as a positive because they viewed them as employees that could be better represented by employees who had more knowledge of the organisation as well as more personal involvement.

Of the 2.3 million staff in Australia who were "bad-treating/bad-working-for" and who are currently working in the management position in Australia, only 1% claimed lower turnover rates as a positive, even though their job responsibilities made no difference in the numbers.

"These findings clearly point to the need that the workforce be more inclusive. If we start increasing the number of employees willing to give their honest responses and listen to how you and your colleagues communicate at work, people will change their behaviour and become less of a burden to one another," says study co-author Dr John Pertwee.

Not everyone in the workforce is feeling that way about taking these findings into account. And what a difference it would make if the company would hire many more employees instead of just one.
