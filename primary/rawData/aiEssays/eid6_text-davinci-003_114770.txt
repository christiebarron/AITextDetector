The Empire State Building—iconic, impressive, and unique—created a major engineering challenge for its builders due to its extraordinary height, ambition, and iconic design. The inclusion of a large mast atop the building to provide docking for dirigibles created yet another challenge, due to the complex engineering and technology required. Though this ‘mooring mast’ was a daring venture, many shared enthusiasm for the project.

In the wake of the tragedy that befell the Hindenburg, many had become cautious with dirigibles. It was clear the mast had to be strong and durable and able to withstand the weight and tension of an airship. The builders of the Empire State Building rose to the engineering challenge of providing a firm support for the airships which were expected to draw crowds due to their sheer size and grandeur. Formulating a plan for the mast would require ingenuity and engineering nuance.

One of the first issues to be addressed was the location of the mast. Specific criteria for the placement of the mast were laid out and the engineers adhered to them—it had to be at the top of the skyscraper, it had to be able to provide adequate docking for the airships, and the wind had to be taken into account. After careful consideration, the mast was determined to be put at the very top of the building, 820 feet high.

The next major challenge was the actual design of the mast—it had to be strong,
