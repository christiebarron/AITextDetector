The setting in Joe Kurmaski’s short story “Rough Road Ahead” has a significant effect on the cyclist. The story is set in a sparse, secluded, and subtle rural region in the Midwest United States, which serves as an obstacle for the cyclist as they traverse the area. The open, empty roads set the mood of loneliness and isolation, forcing the cyclist in the story to become the sole inhabitant. This environment of limited resources hinders the cyclist’s process of obtaining necessities such as food and shelter, while also mentally torturing them.

By being isolated from the hustle of society, the cyclist is forced to confront their inner demons, including depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress. This desolate setting also serves as a symbolic representation of the pain and suffering endured by the cyclist throughout the course of their story. The open roads become metaphors for the fight the cyclist must endure and the journey they must undertake. The long stretches of road represent the levels of difficulty, and the obstacles or detours left in their way represent the moments of adversity.

The scene further aids in the exploration of the idea of finding peace and comfort in the midst of the struggle. As the cyclist presses on and continues to face the “rough road ahead”, they are
