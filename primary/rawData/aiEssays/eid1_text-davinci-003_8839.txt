I remember the day I stayed late at work with my co-worker, Lynn. We had been there for hours, trying to finish up the last of our tasks, when we both started to feel exhausted from the long day. Lynn and I could feel a bit of tension rising between us, so I decided to make a joke about something that had happened earlier in the day.

Before I finished the joke, Lynn had already burst out laughing, and soon we were both doubled over with uncontrollable laughter. My joke wasn't even that funny, but it didn't matter. We laughed until our eyes were tearing up and our stomachs ached.

By the time we had stopped laughing, the tension between us had completely disappeared. Even though we finished working on the tasks, we stayed in the office and talked for what seemed like hours.

Since that day, Lynn and I have shared a special kind of bond. It wasn't just the laughter that brought us closer, but the bond shared in that moment. We may have been exhausted from the day, but that shared laughter gave us the energy to get through. 

No matter how hard the days can get, I know everything will be OK because all it takes is a shared laugh and Lynn and I will be back to smiling.
