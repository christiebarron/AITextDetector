The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because the story's character isn't the first to bring up her own experiences, her partner is, and so her own journey is not. It's not just to be the "big sister".iors. I'm surprised she didn't put her story under one of the covers and not a year or so later.


I had thought to pick the best part - the ending - about all the children. I've had fun putting the book together with my brother, my parents, myself, but the point of making that is I haven't read the book as an adult. The book was the one that set me straight and at the same time I'm also a huge fan: it's a novel that I've enjoyed and I love from start to finish. Winter Hibiscus is an excellent story but some might argue it's simply better in some respects than others. As a fan I thought this was a great thing for the book. There's plenty of love for all of the characters, in the family and at Faulkner's. (I love the two old ladies, but there was a lot of criticism of some of the ones who weren't around when the series started. Faulkner was quite supportive of his writing)


I think Winter Hibiscus could easily be the best book of it all - I think there is more to it than just the children, not least of all the three who took a stab
