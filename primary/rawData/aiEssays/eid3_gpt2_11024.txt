Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

Some areas of the country where the setting is most likely to be used have a large amount of rough road. Those wiring around London which will act as the'sailgate', will be found in places where 'rough road' is at its core, meaning rough roads are often used instead of rough roads by the drivers.

These same areas will also likely be places where motorists will regularly ride their bikes while they 'cross' at regular intervals. When one person crosses the first pavement in an odd position (for example, the road or a parking space which has two lanes if they're moving at speeds exceeding 120mph), the other person can be the victim of a 'traveller's impact'. The cyclist can be left driving while the driver tries to reverse the path.
