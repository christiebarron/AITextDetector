One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was 10 and I woke up in school, and people saw me laughing. When they saw me laughing that was really scary for me. But it was the right thing to do. I loved learning a new way to smile, so that's why I decided to study hard and I hope to give it another shot for now. That's what I wanted to do. I want to be an independent writer. I want to write something that people will know is actually funny but still have potential. I want to write about all your favourite things in your writing, that's what I write about.

Can you expand on your journey of writing?

I didn't know I was a writer until I was 11 and started writing poems JOHN CAMPBELL is one of my favourite artists, and it is such an incredible achievement, that I don't know if I can write for another decade. What I did know was this book is beautiful and I wanted to bring it to life. I was fascinated. At the time I was writing about my day-to-day life and how I used to think I would never write anymore. I was happy that my life was different. I was interested and I think some people that have a harder life don't want to be that way. I tried to be the best person for what I was looking for. But I felt like I was trying to reach the right people who gave me this chance
