The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' will likely be positive given that the film is set on a post-apocalyptic Earth, with an urban future in which animals will die off; a future where humans will replace the apes in the film (with varying success at different times of the year due to what they can do in the world today). The fact that the animals are likely to survive a planet with much less environmental chaos also makes it appear that survival is now possible, rather than just a question of changing the present and the world will become what they want it to be.

For the first time, the movie shows that the technology on display will help to create a realistic future for future cities. The technology will be made possible by what has been created in the past with the coming of new and different forms of technology. The technology will be much more advanced and will be made available to future generations. Furthermore, there may be one species or classes of animals on the planet and it will be made possible to create what the novel sees as the future of humanity on this planet. That particular species could also be called humans or a race based on other forms of animals (like humans can be said to be 'the homo sapiens' though the term might come from this particular species that lives on Mars).

The movie depicts the future world of a given region or state with a futuristic world portrayed in a futuristic futuristic way. These characters could also also be called humans
