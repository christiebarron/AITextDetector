The narrator ends the story with this line to suggest that much like the hibiscus plant, the narrator's hopes and dreams will revive and blossom in the spring. This is in reference to the narrator's struggles to understand her American identity and make peace with the dual language she speaks. The test referenced in her final words is a metaphor for her journey of self-acceptance and the knowledge she acquires along the way. The narrator is aware that she is changing and will be more confident in her understanding of herself come the spring.
