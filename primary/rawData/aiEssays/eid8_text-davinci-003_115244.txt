I recently laughed so hard with my best friend that tears were streaming down my face. We had been out for coffee and were walking back. Suddenly, my friend stopped in the middle of the sidewalk and said, "Hey, let's buy that giant blowup banana!" We both looked at the enormous, bright yellow inflatable, complete with a smiley face and decided to take the plunge. 

We ended up paying the shopkeeper our hard-earned money and then painstakingly inflated it with a hand pump. Both of us were laughing so hard by the time we finally got it done that we thought we'd never get it up. 

As we were carrying the large banana down the street, we got quite a few stares and questioning looks. I even heard someone ask, "What are they doing?" But, all that only made us laugh more. Within a few minutes, we were standing outside of my friend's house and the banana was standing tall. 

It was then that we both exploded into a fit of laughter. We laughed so hard that the tears were streaming down our faces. We both grabbed the banana and plopped down on the grass, continuing to laugh and joke about what a grand adventure two teens can have on a seemingly mundane day. 

It was in that moment that I realized how important laughter truly is. It can bring two people together in ways that no other activity could, and that laughter was indeed the shortest distance
