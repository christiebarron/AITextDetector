I recently went to the post office to mail some important documents. I was in a bit of a rush because it was getting close to the deadline. There was only one person in line ahead of me, but it turned out to be a complicated transaction and took quite a bit of time for it to be completed. I could feel my anxiety rising as the line got longer and I started to get a bit impatient and frustrated. 

But then I remembered something my mom used to tell me: "Be patient; good things come to those who wait." I took a few deep breaths and told myself to stay calm. I started to think about how sometimes these things are out of our control, and we have to just accept it and move on. I tried to avoid tapping my foot or looking at my watch, and instead I thought about how the other person in line must be feeling and tried to be sympathetic.

After around 15 minutes the transaction was finally complete. I was relieved that it was over, but I was also proud of myself for being patient. I definitely could have lost my cool at any point during the wait, but instead I stayed in control and handled the situation with a positive attitude.
