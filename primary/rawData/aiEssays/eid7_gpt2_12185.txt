An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was a young man and my dad told me about my dad dying early from a stroke and to pray to God that if I could see him in heaven, I probably wouldn't die, but so was my brother, my wife and my daughter. In the process I realised I would never get this treatment, so it was really an amazing experience because it was one of the very few things I had to fight for. My family lost a tremendous amount of money to care for my mom, and my sister went through something similar. It's great to have a family with God that is giving you a chance to become a doctor.
