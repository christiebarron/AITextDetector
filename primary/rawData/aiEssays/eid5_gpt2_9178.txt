The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' may seem familiar. At that time, the film did not feature a female lead. The first few episodes were actually staged by a male lead and co-starring, with the other actors including a producer like Martin Skarsg√•rd. The idea of the film being portrayed by men is that women must be able to create the emotional depth and impact that actors can provide of portraying a character on television.

The new cast of showrunners is quite different - many of the actors will now make their own choices, while some will be in a different genre, even if the rest of the cast is a member of the same genre. With the success of this series, and with the renewed interest on social media, it makes sense that the film may not be a new phenomenon. However, the producers are continuing their work and in the coming weeks will start shooting another episode of the series, and even a second season with a different cast, to find out how many women still will play their roles.
