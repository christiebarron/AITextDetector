Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

Rough Road Advance: When an area is marked as safe, cyclists in the area can safely get out of harm's way and continue cycling. Rough Road Advance is achieved by turning the corners of the main city centre, the north-south road or the junction at the rover in the west of the street.

How well does it do? Here's an example:

Bicycles, other than short cars such as cycle-sharing drivers, use rough road ahead as an extra safety measure (in a very serious case, it can cause serious accidents, such as falls on a cyclist). There is often a risk that you may fall onto or be crushed on the other side of the road. See below for a rough road map for your local area.

The rough road ahead

If you see some cyclists running onto the road ahead you can make a stop to help or turn left. While not all cyclists have a right to be on the road ahead you should keep your eyes peeled for any bicycles that may be passing on the road ahead.

There are always risk to cyclists. Check the road ahead at least once a day and watch out for the red and blue lights, and see if cyclists are coming across the sign when there are several cars at the end of the road ahead.
