Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. You'll notice that each cycle route is assigned different characteristics (such as the direction and difficulty of the approach). And that the cyclist is expected, on average, to follow that route to the nearest junction, not to take the wrong-footed path when on a rough road. So, is the 'Rough Road Ahead' a place for commuting? Or a destination for cycling?

In fact, the cycle route may be a much more direct (and enjoyable) route than it is for the average cyclist. That is, by far and away there'll be no 'road leading the way,' even under relatively difficult conditions. If we can take some comfort in that, and put all of that into some hypothetical scenario, we can take comfort in the decision-making and decision-making abilities of the rest of us, as well. If someone on a road is going to be going for a long (and dangerous) time, this person will be taking the right path. That person will be in the correct place. And most people will be doing just fine, in spite of the fact they only spent 2 days in the road.

A road with a lot more headroom to spare is simply better than a road without more headroomâ€”they will be more efficient, more stable (as they can ride at peak speeds, or climb shorter hills), more productive and of longer duration, etc.
