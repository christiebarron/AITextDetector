I remember one time when I was traveling on an airplane and the person next to me was a very chatty older lady. She started talking to me as soon as we were seated and kept going the whole flight. I could tell that she was lonely but I was tired from a long week and just wanted to nap.

Instead of being rude and making it clear that I wanted her to leave me alone, I took a few deep breaths and tried to be patient. I politely answered her questions and kept up the light conversation until we reached our destination.

In the end, I actually found the whole experience quite enjoyable and saddening as I got a glimpse into her life. It reminded me to be kind and patient with others, no matter how I was feeling.
