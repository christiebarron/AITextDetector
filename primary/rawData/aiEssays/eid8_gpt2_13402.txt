One time I experienced laughter in my life was when the two-year-old was doing his homework in the middle of the night. As he was out reading aloud his teacher had put out the next chapter with 'Papa, Pills in the Air' all over it to distract them. It was a long read and I couldn't remember what I said. My head was rolling.

I'm grateful for all that I read about. People can say to me why I enjoyed this so much. But for me, this is not how it works and it is not how I read.

When you read this, what do you say to people who can't read?

Happily, with the new library, you may read some essays or short works on other languages that are not from English. That's why you can start reading from your heart. If you want to try others, I would recommend you stop reading and have some fun. You cannot read from my heart. Do not let someone else read but have a friendly face or laugh.

I have found people who have no interest in English because they just want to read things that can be more interesting but not to understand or think. People who want to read have to write an essay, take a walk, read books or watch something with their own words, and they all don't understand English well.

Readers don't mind if their story is shorter, shorter or in a different sense
