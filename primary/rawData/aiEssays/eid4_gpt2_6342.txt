The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because he wrote that, "When I was a kid I'd have the perfect pair of eyes in the house and not a bad person to watch on screen. But this is a guy who has gotten his way and has taken over the entire family by his own hand. I want to make this a book about a family that isn't just another movie star and I want to know when he's going to get his shot and if he does well the other night when he can't play the part anymore. That's what is happening in this life of his, and to see it end up like this is great."
