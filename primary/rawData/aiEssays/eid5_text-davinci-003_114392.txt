Narciso Rodriguez’s memoir, From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives is a highly personal work that touches at the heart of the complex and often conflicting emotions and experiences of modern life. Rodriguez paints a vivid and intricately detailed portrait of his upbringing as a first-generation immigrant in the United States, and this reflection often evokes a wide array of moods. 

The memoir’s setting forges a sense of nostalgia, as Rodriguez specifically highlights the warm familiarity of his home and beloved community in contemporary New Jersey. He remarks on the strong connection he still has to the “warmth of [his] neighbors and friends." He writes fondly of his youth spent running around and playing with his younger siblings and friends on the stoop. Through these moments, Rodriguez creates an atmosphere of familial love, appreciation, and security. 

Rodriguez’s vivid description of his family’s struggles and hardships while living in poverty further contribute to the story’s intimate and emotive vibrancy. His accounts of their experiences, such as being strapped for cash and experiencing financial insecurity, bring forth raw and powerful emotions. This further contributes to a feeling of vulnerability as Rodriguez opens himself up and allows the reader to share in his journey. 

The memoir as a whole establishes a captivating and stirring mood. At its core, From Home is a heartfelt celebration of culture, heritage, resilience and universal belonging. The
