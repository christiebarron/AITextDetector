The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Several issues arose over the decades, including the need to prevent the builders of the American War Cabinet from using their own dirigibles to carry out certain actions during the war. But if they can get Congress to approve dirigibles during the war, and the government was still supporting dirigibles in the 1960s, it wouldn't change all of that.

And yet, the idea of adding a portable diriger in the Air Force doesn't make sense to me, since I believe those people would love to be around, like the ones you mention. This, then, will keep the dirigibles off the public agenda, and it will still be an important part of this theater, so there's nothing inherently wrong with going for it.

When the time finally comes, though, though, as it's now, I will not hesitate to take it back to the people who made it!
