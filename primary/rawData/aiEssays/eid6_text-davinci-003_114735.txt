The building of the Empire State Building posed many engineering challenges, one of the most daunting being the enabling of dirigibles to safely dock at the top. This was a direct result of the ambitious vision of building pioneer Alfred E. Smith, who wanted to make New York City the airship capital of the world. In order to make this dream a reality, the architects had to overcome an array of obstacles and risks to create a platform suitable for docking airships.

The first challenge was ensuring the safety of navigating high-altitude winds. As the Empire State Building is situated in the heart of Manhattan, powerful gusts of wind often buffet the structureâ€™s 102 stories. In order for dirigibles to dock without their heavy loads buffeted away, a new form of mooring mast had to be constructed to withhold the dramatic temperature shifts and the unexpected gusts of wind. Engineers had to be especially careful when constructing the mast, as even slight errors or imbalances could have resulted in a catastrophic disaster.

The mast also had to be built with a financial burden in mind. The cost of constructing a structure that was capable of hoisting aloft a fully loaded airship was a financial challenge, especially within the context of the Great Depression. To make this feasibly, the mast had to be incredibly durable yet lightweight. Many materials, including steel, were tested, but ultimately it was determined that the use of chemically treated wood beams would be best suited
