One time I experienced laughter in my life was when watching my girlfriend, her sister play on a computer. She giggled when I came up with the word cute and made me laugh.

We're a couple on the run, and when she came to you when I was in my 20s, she cried on camera—it was absolutely beautiful.

What did you feel when you saw her being seen with makeup applied?

I said, "Oh, look! I'm in her makeup!" I felt her legs shake. And she shook as well and she did make me laugh.

Was there anything you did to keep her smiling?

Oh, I told her, "Do it and let's get through this." But if that's not the end—if it just wasn't that funny—and the whole thing seemed kind of funny, her laugh had probably taken over my life. But eventually, as she started going along, I stopped laughing and, of course, all hell broke loose.
