Dear (Name of Local Newspaper),

I am writing this letter to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people.

With the advances of technology, computers have become a tool of almost daily use. We can now do many of our tasks more quickly, simply through a few clicks of a mouse. Computers have become somewhat of a necessity for communicating and surviving in todayâ€™s world.

The role of computers has had a great effect on people around the world. For instance, in the workplace, computers have enabled employees to become more productive and efficient in their work. In addition, computers allow people to connect with anyone else in the world almost instantaneously and gain access to vast resources of information. Computers have also provided us with a means of entertainment with activities like online gaming and watching videos, while on the educational side, computers are used in classrooms to teach students valuable skills for the future.

However, there is a downside to the increased role of computers. Too much time using computers can lead to physical problems, such as eye strain, and digital addiction. People may also become more socially isolated, as they tend to spend more time interacting with people through a computer than in person.

Overall, I believe computers can be a helpful and valuable tool if used in moderation. It is important to find a balance between being online and interacting with others in the real world.

I hope this letter has persuaded you to agree with my
