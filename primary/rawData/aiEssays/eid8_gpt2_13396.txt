One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was in the hospital with a very serious case of kidney failure. She had just started and I had to tell her how badly she was going to need stitches when she was dying.

"I don't believe in magic," she replied, laughing when asked how she kept track of his progress, as if an accident had taken place, when he had just finished two months of surgery and had just started breathing again.

A young man is one of the rare few known to have suffered from kidney failure. He underwent an operation to get his kidneys back in order. He will survive until he's 65 and he said he hopes that he will never have to return to his job to get out of the hospitals.
