Narciso Rodriguez’s memoir, “From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,” is an immersive exploration of the intersection of culture and fashion. Through a poignant blend of nostalgia and modernity, the memoir creates a mood of joy, self-discovery, and longing.

The memoir begins with Rodriguez’s recollection of his childhood spent in the industrial town of Hoboken, New Jersey. His vivid descriptions of the sights, smells and experiences of his youth paint a picture of a lively and vibrant community that he still holds close to his heart. Throughout the narrative, he reflects on how the identity of his hometown has shaped his vision as a designer. The old-world style of Hoboken was an influence he drew on heavily as he established himself in the fashion industry.

The memoir’s tone is one of exploration, as Rodriguez looks back not only on his past but on the many different cultures and communities he has encountered in his career. He celebrates the diversity of his experiences, and the ways in which he was able to bridge cultures and transform fashion. His reminiscences are snapshots of joy, from the glamorous catwalks of Paris to the intimate gatherings of friends and family.

At the same time, a sense of longing pervades the narrative. Through his vivid memories, Rodriguez captures the feeling of being homesick; his longing for a place to belong, both familiar and new. This melancholy feeling lingers
