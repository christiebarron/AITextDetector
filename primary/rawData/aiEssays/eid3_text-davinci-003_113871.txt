The setting of Rough Road Ahead by Joe Kurmaski has a significant effect on the cyclist in the story. The cyclist is a male in his mid-thirties who is trying to push himself by taking the “rough” road rather than the “easy” one. This setting creates a challenge for the cyclist that stretches beyond the physical.

The cyclist is surrounded by nature and feels both the beauty and the power of it. He is aware of the potential danger as well as the awe that he feels when confronted by nature. The cyclist is also aware of the strength and endurance that he needs to exercise in order to complete the ride. The road’s difficulty teaches the cyclist to never give up and to use every ounce of his strength even when fatigue seems insurmountable.

Furthermore, the material features of the road also affect the cyclist. The rough terrain, the unpredictable curves, and the looming cliffs add to the difficulty and unpredictability of the ride. These features also remind the cyclist of the physical risk he is taking by riding this road.

Overall, the gritty and wild landscape of the setting creates a feeling of adventure and danger that drives the cyclist throughout the journey. The cyclist confronts his own weaknesses and struggles to overcome them. He is eventually rewarded with a sense of accomplishment that is much greater than if he had taken the easier road.
