I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is an infringement on their free expression rights."


The issue of censorship as a means to promote a political or religious agenda is on the rise. Last week, The Telegraph published an article about a case in which the UK government paid £2,700,000 for freedom of information law in the UK.

Another case against the government was of former Liberal Democrat MP and ex-Lib Dem MP Peter Tatchell, who was jailed for five months for publishing a book discussing the history of the NHS and the role played by Britain in Iraq before the invasion.


The National Library of England has reported a record of up to £9 million for censorship on books since the late 1950s, with up to £15 million for publishing in those days.


The Library of Modern Art, which has three branches throughout England, says that these fees alone are paying "more than £4 million" to the Library of England in 2010.
