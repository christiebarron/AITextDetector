An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a friend of mine who died of AIDS in 1988. For me the story goes that she was a very generous person who helped my dad save her life and was also a great friend of mine and a very loving mom. Then some time after that one or two years and he found out he wasn't HIV positive then I became pregnant. That's when I realized he didn't have to be this way as when I looked back I remember when my dad knew he didn't understand how that's a normal life to live and I think you can look back and see if you were living or not. We have now met where he had been my boyfriend for a while but he wasn't really into me and I thought if so I was wrong but that was the only story I had of him being that way so I had to say I was very sorry and I was sorry for being a good friend. I never had any problems or anything so I can't just go down there and say there's no love lost there. I was thinking of trying to talk to him or something and he never told me he was HIV positive and I just want him to be very brave and I will say that when I start helping men and women that is my message to them. We have a wonderful relationship right now and that is one of us right now. So I have been very blessed to be able to share this with everybody but I am sorry I didn't
