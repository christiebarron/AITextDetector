The book has been telling the story of a girl, Teresa, through fall and winter, and how she and her family are preparing for her big exam in the spring. The scene in which she stands in the snow with her family looking at the hibiscus flower serves as a reminder of why she is pushing herself so hard. Her family are investing their time and energy in her success, and will be there for her when the hibiscus is in bloom, when it is time for Teresa to take the test again. The final line serves as a message of hope and inspiration that she will have the strength to meet that challenge when the time comes.
