I'm usually a patient person, so I wasn't too worried when I found out my job interview might be delayed. The company had an unexpected scheduling conflict, but they said they'd be able to call me the next day.

I understood that sometimes things don't go as planned, so I stayed positive and waited. Sure enough, the next day, I got a call from the company apologizing again, and setting up a new interview time.

I was very understanding throughout the whole situation, and stayed patient with the company. I was happy to get a new interview time, and I'm confident it turned out better than it would have if I had been impatient.
