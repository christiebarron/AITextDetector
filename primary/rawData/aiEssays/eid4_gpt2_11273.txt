The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it includes an awesome twist, but as many of you know that doesn't happen in a book made of bricks and stones. It's a fun book!

"The next thing I know, it's a big red brick. It has the look of something I saw on TV, a blue brick. It's a bit of a weird-looking red brick. I saw it and thought, 'It's going to be in an amazing book that does it'. I thought it was the very first story I ever got."

As you can imagine, that's pretty scary.

You would have to wait until now for "Winter Hibiscus", to see any of the other amazing books like it.

Check out the cover and other goodies that were included in the review.

This post is one of the most awesome looking postcard cover design ever. Not only is it the final product, it is the only cover I've seen all year and it's also the one I own. It will be posted everywhere it goes.

Here's a photo showing the cover.
