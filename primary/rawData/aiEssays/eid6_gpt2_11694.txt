The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They tried building two cabins for each side. There were two cabins in each side with floor fans and the side cabins used to be as small as 1 foot. A side cabins couldDC at 60 to 80 feet. The original building's windows were 10 feet high so an opening of 2 feet should have opened a 6 foot wide area behind the interior, which led to problems with the windows and even caused them to get caught in an open gap between two sides. Another problem was the ceiling that had to be lowered and removed when they would have access to the air conditioning unit. By the 1960s, the ceiling was 12 feet high and the ceiling was 16 feet high. While a building with a 12:1 ratio might appear to have no problems with ventilation and light, the average building had at least 10:5 per inch of floor capacity. The ventilation systems were designed so that all windows and doors were exposed to air in an enclosed area. A large area had to be located to get a full view of the building. There were 2,000 feet in air-conditioning at the time. Although the ventilation of the building is different for each room, the floors are also much higher - at 4,600 feet. Some of the windows used to be 1 foot higher and also had double doors alive, which had to be cut as fast as possible because of the need to keep them
