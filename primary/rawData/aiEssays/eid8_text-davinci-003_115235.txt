It was the last day of my summer vacation, and I was feeling a bit nostalgic. I decided to take a walk around the lake near my family’s cabin in the woods. As I rounded the corner, I spotted someone in the distance. He wavered a bit and nearly lost his balance, and I couldn’t help but smile.

As I got closer, I recognized him. It was my old friend from school. I couldn’t believe it. We had promised to keep in touch, but somehow the years had flown by and we had lost track of each other.

As soon as he saw me, he ran over, and I almost got swept off my feet in a hug. We caught up on all the news, and he told me about his new job. As we talked, we both kept laughing until tears came to our eyes. 

After a while, we said our goodbyes, knowing that life would take us our separate ways soon enough. But the memory of that day will stay with me forever - when two people are connected by a genuine and heartfelt laughter, the passage of time doesn’t matter.
