The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Those obstacles consisted in construction issues. The construction boom began to erode the public's confidence in the efficiency and security of the buildings to help with repairs. The current system of building materials in the Empire State Building, which includes dirigibles, is in many ways a waste of public dollars. It's also a waste of materials for future generations.

When the Empire State Building collapsed on May 7, 1983, the New Jersey Government Accountability Board found, "...there was no consistent way that one could assess how and when an event in the building would have altered the public's sense of security and safety, at no point had there been an objective measure of how it would have impacted the public's safety or safety or the public's well-being as a whole."

Since then, there have been no improvements to the building's safety record that have changed how the public understands and uses dirigibles. The reason for the gaps realised when the building finally went to market remains unknown: some of the problems are still there; others are due to the way that the Empire State Building is manufactured, the way the building's materials are produced, and many other issues that are not publicly known.

The neuroscience of the building itself

The work of the US National Academy of Sciences in the US has allowed the researchers to draw connections between the structure of the Building, which is the brain of the
