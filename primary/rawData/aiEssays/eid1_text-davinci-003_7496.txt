The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho serves to emphasize the motif of hope that is central to the story. The main character, a young girl named Siew, has been struggling to pass an important test that will enable her to move up to the next grade in school. Siew is aware that many of her peers have more advantageous backgrounds and resources than she does, and she finds motivation to continue her studies in the hibiscus flower that she tends in her family's garden. By implying that Siew will have another chance to pass the test when the hibiscus blooms again in the springtime, the author highlights Siew's determination and perseverance. The hopeful ending implies that her hard work will pay off in the end.
