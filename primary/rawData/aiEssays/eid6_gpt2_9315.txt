The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Here are a few of the key points:

• On the Empire State building was a new building designed by the British in 1914, an architectural inspiration for the Empire State building's plans: a steel reinforced concrete roof;

• The roof was installed in 1913-14, and the concrete construction followed in 1914-15;

• The roof was designed by British architect William W. Whitehead in 1912 and painted in 1928 by British sculptor James H. Gray.

• The domes and other structural components, often in the rear of the building (a key element of building layout) were made by British subcontractors under the supervision of London-based architects Norman Regebrun and Nicholas A. Aitken. Aitken produced the final version of the Imperial State in 1940.

• On the rear windows, the roof and concrete pillars, or roof panels, were of the same design. This design, called "the Imperial State," had an extra, double-tiled, horizontal, ventilated window opening to give the exterior space of the main building that was to be protected while the interior was protected with an air-tight sealed metal covering.

The final version of the Empire State building was built in 1942, making it the most ambitious of the six major state buildings in the Empire State Building series. (See the second part of this post.)
