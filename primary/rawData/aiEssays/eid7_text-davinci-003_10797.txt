I remember a time a few years ago when I was struggling with an upcoming test in one of my college classes. I had studied day and night, and I was feeling nervous and frustrated that I wasn't able to comprehend the material as much as I wanted to. 

But, instead of giving up, I decided to be patient. I kept trucking on with my studying. I would take breaks often to clear my head and go back at it. 

I slowly started to notice the material getting easier and easier to understand the more time I committed. I kept my focus and encouraged myself to keep going. 

My patience paid off, as I eventually aced the test. I put in the hard work and, more importantly, I was patient with myself. That was a big moment of growth for me, and it was a lesson that truly stayed with me.
