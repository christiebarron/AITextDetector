The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Many of them had to use two trucks. The first was a company called Dauphin, in which people were given small planes that had been built up in the 1800s and early 1900s. And the other was the government contract for a high-powered machine called the Aircraft Equipment System, which was developed and carried out by the Department of Transportation in the U.S.

In the mid-1950s, Dauphin began to develop a wide-body machine used in the military and law enforcement. It was, like the Imperial aircraft, for helicopters, but it was an upgraded type that was only available in the United States. But its name was changed to the Barge Aarge System and the Barge Aarge Systems, and as Dauphin looked at the possibilities, the Pentagon began to put them on loan. The program was funded with taxpayers money under the $6 billion Defense Department's National Fuel Economy Reduction and Maintenance program.

The other problem was that the government had no idea how many people needed to build it. The idea was that anyone working in the military would have a way to get around it —HTTP-enabled cars — that the DOD didn't know how many people needed to build. Some contractors bought trucks, but not many of the military construction workers used them. So the contract for the Barge Aarge System ended with $30 million
