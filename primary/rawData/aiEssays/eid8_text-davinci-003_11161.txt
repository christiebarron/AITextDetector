I still remember the night fondly. I was on a first date with a girl I had recently started talking to. We had decided to go to a park near my house to enjoy the beautiful night.

We were walking and talking, getting to know one another, when I tripped over a root and, in a comically clumsy way, ended up on the ground. I expected her to embarrassed or concerned, but instead she just broke into a fit of laughter.

I sheepishly got up and laughed right along with her. It was a special moment for me—I knew right then and there that this was going to be an amazing relationship.

That moment of mutual laughter marked the start of a beautiful friendship that soon blossomed into a loving relationship. Even now, when we’re struggling or having conflicts, we make sure to take time to laugh together and remind ourselves of the joy of our connection.
