The Empire State Building was once open to the idea of dirigibles docking at the upper observation deck. However, the reality of allowing such a feat was much more difficult than originally thought. "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted gives an excellent look into the many challenges that the builders of the Empire State Building faced with this endeavor. 

The size and weight of an airship were the first obstacles that opponents of the venture tried to raise. Engineers from the world of engineering related to the project were concerned about being able to accommodate a docking dirigible. "Their main concern was whether the airship’s size, weight and design were compatible with the building’s structure". To make matters more complicated, the sheer size of the observation deck was not designed for accommodating an airship. The original structure already was a challenge in itself due to the need for strength and stability. 

In addition, the observation deck would have to accommodate the mooring mast and security system. This made matters more difficult as the deck was too small and the original design of the building had to be adjusted to make space for starters. Furthermore, engineers needed to develop a special security system fitting the building that would protect visitors from the dirigible as it docked. Moreover, the mooring mast had to be fit within the space constraints of the observation deck and in accordance to the building’s other design features.
