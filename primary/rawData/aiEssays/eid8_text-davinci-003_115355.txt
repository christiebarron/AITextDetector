I was sitting in the park with my best friend, enjoying a sunny summer day. We had been through a lot in our friendship and we always made sure to make time to be together. We were both laughing and chatting away when suddenly, a baby duck ran up to us. Startled, we both yelled out in surprise, and then dissolved into laughter over the unexpected interruption. We watched the duck waddle around us, clearly searching for something, until it eventually settled on my friend’s foot. We looked at each other and burst out laughing again. We had no idea what the duck wanted, but it was a pleasant surprise all the same. We retrieved some bread from a nearby café to feed the duck, and watched happily as it waddled around the park, stopping to nibble on the bread crumbs. We kept laughing and chatting away, but this time, our laughter was a bit softer, more intimate. We shared a moment of connection that day, and I’m sure we’ll never forget it.
