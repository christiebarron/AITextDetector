The ending of the poem serves as a symbol of hope and perseverance - even when times are hard, one can try again. By connecting the image of the hibiscus, which "died in the winter chill" but will bloom again, to the speaker's test, the author implies that even if the speaker fails the test initially, they can try again and eventually succeed. The imagery of the springtime season, the melted snows, and the returning geese all evoke feelings of rebirth, rejuvenation, and new beginnings - as if the speaker is given a second chance. This serves as encouragement and motivation to stay strong and keep attempting.
