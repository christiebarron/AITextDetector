Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. They help determine whether the situation has changed during a test, where the 'hard drive' component of the gearing is altered by a driver, the cyclist might lose traction during 'hard roll', or whether the cyclist's acceleration is the same during those conditions.

The rider is then left to choose their own 'Rough Road Ahead' as a basis to define their own Road of Control (RTOC). In this study, the number of RTOCs produced was not taken into account or the number included in specific settings. In fact, there are only six RTOCs for the cyclist, with the remaining two selected for the whole group.

It is the third study to investigate the cycling performance of various tyre settings. Although the specific settings are largely dictated by weather and conditions for specific cyclist, their effects are not necessarily different. The authors looked at how the performance of different tyre settings is influenced by the changes in the number of RTOCs they produce. Overall, the team was able to assess their effect with specific tyre settings and found that on average, the changes in RTOCs produced (in the case of soft 'B' and softer 'B') in the soft tyre settings was substantially greater than for the hard tire setting (Rough Road Ahead). However, in the case of 'hard', the changes are significantly fewer (in the case of 'B' tyres). These changes
