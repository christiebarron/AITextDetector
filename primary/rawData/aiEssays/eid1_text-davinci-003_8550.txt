As a single mother, I quickly became accustomed to taking on the role of both parents for my daughter. One afternoon, my daughter asked me to take her to the amusement park, and although I was exhausted from work, I made a commitment to take her. During the ride to the park, I was feeling more and more anxious about the long day and the amount of money it was costing me, but when I looked at my daughter in the rearview mirror, I could see how excited she was. 

Once we arrived, all of her enthusiasm quickly transferred to me. Although she was having a great time, I still felt like I was ready to go home, but I stifled my own needs and pushed through for my daughterâ€™s sake. I paid close attention to her needs and stayed patient no matter how many times she asked me to go on the same ride a second and third time. 

At the end of the night, when we finally made it home, I felt immensely proud of myself for being so patient that day. Not only had I stuck with my commitment to spend time with my daughter, but I had also put my own needs aside to ensure that she had had a day filled with happiness and joy.
