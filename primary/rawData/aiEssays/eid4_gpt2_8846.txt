The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because she doesn't quite understand what the story behind all this madness is. She goes on the rampage through the town as part of her plan to take revenge for what happened in her past, and she must navigate the chaos of the city's life.

At least it is with "Winter Hibiscus: Rise of the Snow Queen", the new storybook written by author Dan McCrum. The title suggests that this book will be another'story' focused on children's stories, with new, engaging characters and a twist on the tropes. It's not, for me, quite enough, and I certainly don't know the people who wrote those stories, but there are definitely more to come.

A nice touch: the book's title really helps to separate it from its already dense, already grimy roots. I like how it looks at an age where girls can be 'pro-life' and "feminist", and it opens with an old woman in charge of a town who is really struggling when she learns that men are going to kill her and keep her in the country. Of course, bluffing is an important aspect for both the story and the author, and it was well deserved.

Anyway, Winter Hibiscus: Rise of the Snow Queen is out for preorder now from Amazon for Â£45.
