I remember the day I met my now husband—the day that changed my life forever. It was a summer day, and I had just been invited to a small gathering of close friends. As I entered the backyard, I noticed him immediately—he was so handsome! I try to walk across the lawn casually, but I'm sure it was obvious to everyone that I was definitely a little starstruck.

We started chatting, and I quickly realized that we shared a lot of the same interests and had a great sense of humor. Everyone around us was beginning to catch on to our conversations and eventually, our banter turned into a lighthearted competition that had us both laughing uncontrollably.

The night ended with us exchanging numbers, and I could not seem to stop smiling for days. We kept up our conversations online, and we eventually started spending more and more time together. The thing that always seemed to stick out to me was that no matter how serious life may have been getting, we had an immeasurable amount of joy between us.

We laughed together through the difficult times, and after one particularly hard day I remember us laughing until we were in tears. That’s when I knew that this was real. Laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people, and it showed me that we would make it through anything as long as we had each other. Nearly two decades on, we’re still together and still laughing!
