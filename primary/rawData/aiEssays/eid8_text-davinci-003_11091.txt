As I walked into the room, I couldn't help but crack a smile. There was something special about the atmosphere; it was just so inviting.

My eyes quickly found the source of the happy vibe—my friend, Jane. She was standing in the corner, wracking her brain to think up a way to entertain the rest of us. 

Once she finally came up with an idea, one that we could all agree on, there wasn't a single person in the room who wasn't filled with anticipation. Our laughter erupted before she even finished her sentence, and after a few more goofy jokes, we were all in stitches. 

I had only known Jane for a short while and laughter was already serving as a bridge between us. I could see the joy in her eyes as much as I could feel it in my own heart. 

We didn't have to talk for long that night—the laughter said it all.
