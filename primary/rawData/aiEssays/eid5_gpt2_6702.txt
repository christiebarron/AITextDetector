The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' was very positive. But the world that she had lived in was very different. She had a very small home which was still a tiny little island with minimal trees and an awful lot of trees. Her grandmother went to Europe every day to visit her and this was her story.

When I wrote that book I didn't believe it. I realised all the memories that I had from that early summer of 1990 were all lies. I would think about my childhood, about the family life, about the way that I grew up and the way that I would go to school and what my parents do. But I found no true reality.

What I did find, even in that very moment, is that I was writing about my own mother. I was writing about the relationship between a mother and her children. I was writing about how I am now a single mother living in my own home in New Zealand (which I've never called home). The home they lived in was very different.

Then, in my essay that I did, it was shown that I was writing as I had told the story myself and it was very surprising to me that I found I really was the one who had written about my family's relationship with them when I wrote that essay.

I didn't realise this through the words of Sarah and the memoir. Then there was an element of shock at my words and disbelief at everything the memoir turned out
