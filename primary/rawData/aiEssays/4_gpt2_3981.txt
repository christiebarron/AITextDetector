The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because of a twist in the plot line of the first six issues. The plot of the second issue starts out the way the story of the first six issues starts out - first the Black Swan, then he and his brothers arrive on Earth and the Winter Flu, then in his apartment building. The events here in the novels were much like how they are in the actual movie as opposed to coming directly from the source material. For example the first issues will always feature a new side-plot about the Black Swan and other villains, and then we'll see much more in the sequel, where the Winter Flu is in fact a true monster.

One of the things about the Winter Flu, and I've found more out of it than actually happened, is that the characters are human and the main characters themselves are not that bad - not bad at all. They really are human in the sense of being human and living a normal life within a normal world. The character of the Doctor is not bad in this situation, but the real villain would be the Winter Flu, and this would be his way of telling a good story. But it never really fits the book. It's hard to think of a main character who doesn't have problems with the Black Swan. And even if he does, his best friend is a major character, so the problem is that it's not a big deal to go through the Winter Flu and then let him die on
