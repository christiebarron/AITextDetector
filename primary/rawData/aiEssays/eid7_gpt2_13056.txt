An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the day they were diagnosed with cancer. They'd been doing these treatments three or four years, so I wasn't sure what they needed. I knew I would be there in the year 2017.

Why did your hospital say you might be going home?

Their initial response was that it wasn't a safe place for people. Then they came to my request not to bring up their case, they didn't bring it up for 10 years, or whatever. I was very fortunate with my choice of a medical college and there were no legal barriers there so I had a safe place to be where I was able to live.

Do you think it's fair that the treatment you were receiving there was so far ignored or misunderstood?

This is not the first time this policy has fallen on deaf ears. A number of patients have been told to avoid a private practice because of their conditions. Another health provider of mine was denied permission to move a case in to a private practice because of his condition. A few were told to put the patient to sleep while they wait for their lawyer, and this also happened. They should've already spoken with a lawyer, which they did. This is a shame, but at the moment we're so poor for such things.

A private practice is in its infancy anyway and there often isn't much to do about it.

I've learned to love being in that position
