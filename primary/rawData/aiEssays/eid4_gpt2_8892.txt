"I was shocked that this book was translated so badly," said the writer. "We all know this is so bad, and I had to write something very horrible, in order to make it stand up when everybody was reading it."

On what he did on the first day of running the show, he had to rewrite the second few chapters into a full length story to fit the script for Winter Hibiscus. "I thought they would have been done better than the first, which you know," said the bookrunner.
