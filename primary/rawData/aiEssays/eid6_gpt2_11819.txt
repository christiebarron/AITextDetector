The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, their "hubs of steel" were highly regulated and required a fine of $250 to $200,000, and by the late 1940s, federal statutes forbade the purchase of small-scale, heavy-duty dirigibles, but also restricted use for construction projects in which such a device should not cost more than $1,000. But over time, there was resistance to these laws because many builders worried about the public health effects of large- and heavy-duty machines; at issue was the possibility of a large-scale dirigibles manufacturing plant as a commercial enterprise. Since dirigibles typically require far larger quantities of steel than is necessary to build them, their weight limits were particularly high.

A recent "industry-wide" survey, undertaken by G.M.W. & Co. in Chicago, and conducted through September 1997, found that even small- and light-duty duallying plants sold for under $3 per tonne cost 3,160 dirigibles per day over their 10-year fixed-price (LTP) lifetime. For purposes of safety standards, LTP is the rate of change in the average lifetime of steel used in an actual production plant compared to production at a discount rate of 0.5% per year. In an effort to reduce the cost of the production facilities to ensure that the increased LTP of these devices
