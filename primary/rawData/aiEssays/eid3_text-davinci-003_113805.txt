In the poem "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski, the cyclist's experience is heavily influenced by the elements of the setting. From start to finish, the cyclist's journey is plagued by obstacles and difficulties, all of which are shown through the features of the setting. 

The poem begins with the cyclist's journey taking place on a "rugged mountain pass," painting a picture of a difficult journey on a grueling incline. The road is described as "narrow and crooked," providing yet another challenge for the cyclist to overcome. The sky is also described as a "blustery grey," reflecting a cold and unforgiving atmosphere. 

This similar environment is echoed as the poem progresses, with the mountains and same sky echoing in the background of the cyclist's journey. The cold and unforgiving atmosphere is further developed when "icy snowflakes stung the cyclist's cheeks," further emphasizing the hardship of the journey. Throughout his journey, he is beset by the shadows of distant peaks, furthering the lonely and difficult atmosphere that the setting imbues. 

In "Rough Road Ahead," the setting of the poem serves to enhance and reflect the difficult journey of the cyclist. The rugged terrain and bleak winter sky are all indications of the hardships of the journey. These features of the setting set an atmosphere of isolation and difficulty, further reinforcing the cyclist's journey as one of struggle and fortitude.
