The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. When a private builder and a government official were hired, the government was reluctant to allow them to offer dirigibles, while the public was encouraged to use them. Many of the problems with installing dirigibles were the result of bureaucratic squabbling and legislative disagreements: One of those meetings was held at the State Hall building on July 18, 1947, when a Senate hearing was held in Manhattan, but the bill failed to pass. The Senate passed the bill, only to be interrupted by the passing of a similar state law that permitted dirigibles to be placed on private use.

Eventually, the United States government, in consultation with the private owners of the Empire State Building, approved some alterations to the building's building ordinances. The change was so controversial that no building could be placed on this building despite two years since it was built. When the building was demolished in 1972, the Empire State building had become home to a private jet company called Global Flight, and it remained there until 2010 when the New York State Assembly changed the law so that all dirigible-related business was regulated.
