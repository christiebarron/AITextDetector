Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects that computers have on people. In my opinion, computers have both positive and negative impacts on our lives.

The positive aspects of computer usage cannot be denied. Computers offer users faster communication, easier access to information, and can even increase productivity in the workplace. Furthermore, computer technology can be used to improve the education process, making learning easier and more effective than ever before.

On the other hand, there are some negative consequences of using computers. They can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, decreased face-to-face interaction, and increased levels of stress. Additionally, they may cause us to become dependent on them for too many tasks, potentially reducing our ability to think and reason independently.

In conclusion, computers are powerful tools with both potential benefits and costs. It is important to recognize and address potential issues that may arise from computer use, while also taking advantage of the numerous opportunities they present.

Sincerely,

[Your name]
