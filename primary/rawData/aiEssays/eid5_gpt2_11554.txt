The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' will likely have to be revised and re-purposed if the current administration does not back away.

While he acknowledged he would like to see more clarity within the US, he said: 'As the first-term government, I have tried to make some changes as well, including getting rid of the gag order.'

He said he hoped the US government would start to see the full impact of the new rule from the US on other countries

Meanwhile he said that if the administration was really interested in making good progress, it was time paving the way to make a new approach

'By doing away with the existing gag order, it would save money and would give them a more effective way to make improvements.'

'In order to use the new rule more effectively, we would need to give the US an idea of what the policy is as well as the current policy. It was more than only showing our agreement to the other countries,' he added.

Mr McConkie said there were no concerns that the new policy could have negative effects. He added: 'These are human rights and they are important.

'Any potential adverse effects on human rights would not have been addressed if the 'new rule were not in place.'
