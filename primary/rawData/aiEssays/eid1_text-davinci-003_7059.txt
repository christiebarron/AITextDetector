Censorship in libraries is a contentious issue, but one that should be explored fully in order to reach the best possible solution. In my opinion, libraries have a responsibility to protect their patrons from offensive material and should investigate removing certain materials that could potentially cause harm if exposed to a vulnerable population.

The primary function of any library is to provide access to information. While it is essential for libraries to provide a wide array of materials that challenge their members to think critically and expand their perspectives, it is also important to protect the well-being of those who visit the library. It is a chosen responsibility of librarians and library staff to be aware of and respond to potential threats to patrons’ safety. Any materials that are deemed to be potentially damaging or offensive should be taken seriously and, if necessary, be removed from library shelves.

Some may argue that books, music, movies, and magazines should remain accessible and unrestricted, regardless of how offensive or unacceptable they may be considered by certain audiences. However, libraries should not be considered a place where patrons are exposed to and are required to accept the full spectrum of ideas and materials. Rather, it should be seen as an environment where members of a community have the opportunity to access ideas and materials that are respectful and appropriate to their backgrounds, beliefs, and tastes.

Ultimately, the decision to censor library materials must be weighed carefully and balanced against a library’s responsibility to maintain an atmosphere that is safe and welcoming
