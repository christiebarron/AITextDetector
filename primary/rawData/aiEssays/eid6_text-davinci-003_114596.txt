In 1930, the Empire State Building was unveiled as the most impressive architectural marvel of the time. Topping off at 1250 feet tall, the building was designed to include a mooring mast capable of allowing dirigibles to dock. At the time, it seemed a revolutionary concept, as no other building had ever been designed with the capability for such a feat. Even so, many challenges and obstacles presented themselves to the builders of the Empire State Building in allowing the mooring mast to serve its intended purpose.

The first challenge faced by the builders was the immense size and weight of the mast and its components. The mast needed to be able to withstand high winds and the incredible force of the massive dirigibles that would be docking. As such, the mast had to be incredibly strong and able to handle the weight and force exerted upon it. This meant the mast needed to be constructed out of thick steel and use specialized techniques to ensure its stability and strength.

Additionally, the anchors needed to be able to latch onto the dirigible itself and hold firm. The first design included anchors that were designed to tether the dirigible, much like a boat in a harbor, however this proved ineffective due to the lack of a solid surface to attach to. After several re-designs, the builders of the Empire State Building were finally able to secure levers into the dirigibles hull that allowed the anchors to secure the great ships in place.
