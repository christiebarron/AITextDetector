One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I stumbled upon this wonderful website that provides instant, easy-to-use downloadable version of my latest book, Inside My Bookshop, Inc. and a number of videos.

I've even been on their Twitter page and watched a couple of new posts on the website. This particular site has been one of my favorite.

Before I get into all-inclusive, takeaways that I can confidently say will help you with anything.

1. The Internet is where the greats like Denny Pritzker and the New York Yankees came from.

1. My story (and some of my life's, sadly) is a reminder that a big part of being successful, living a healthy or fulfilling life, is being the best you can be for yourself, and not trying to do too much.

Most women start life well, or fall short of success in every aspect of their life.

That has been true for me myself and my family. And that's why the Internet is for every woman who's ever had the chance to see someone succeed.

2. The Internet is a great place to hear, listen and explore your beliefs about what the world should be and should not be.
