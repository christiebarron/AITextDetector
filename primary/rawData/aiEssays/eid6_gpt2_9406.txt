The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. An aerial view shows the building in its traditional style. The tower itself is clad in aluminum panels, surrounded by a glass barrier. The tower is visible from the ground in the background of the scene. The tower also has a long wall of solid steel, with no windows. There are two main entrances on the building, as well as one that connects the three main lobbies. As in most of our architectural designs, the staircase connects with the elevator at the center of the building.

But, building an elevator was really the only way to get people to the building. As the company found out about the building's architecture, the owners immediately began demolishing it. Now that the building is well-preserved, the idea of giving owners an opportunity to buy the right to sell that space started to dawn on customers. When the owners sold their right to sell earlier this year, many customers came in who wanted to rent to them rather than the company that provided them with the building.

For their part, the owners told the tower they had the building vacant and had no future. By the end of December 2015, the owners had agreed to lease the elevator from the tower through 2017, according to the owners.
