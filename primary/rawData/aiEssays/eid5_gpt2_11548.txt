The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' was almost celebratory even before the publication of the book's third edition on January 14, 2017, an early day for the publication.

"I'm a bit of an upholsterer," said the book's producer, John O'Hanlon. "I think it's great that all these people are going to read it and then start talking about how to write about the book. People talk about how good they think it is with the narrative and how it changes their worldviews, but it's also very accessible and accessible and very funny. That's what makes it all really memorable.

"And for many of the journalists who are now writing on this story, you can see how much we've helped them, but it's important that they understand. And by understanding you also see a lot of good storytellers going 'oh fuck, this is so funny'."
