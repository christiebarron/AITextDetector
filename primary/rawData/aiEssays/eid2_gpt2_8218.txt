I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is necessary, but there is a big price to be paid," said Richard W. Dworkin, a professor at the University of Delaware School of Business.

He said it would be a mistake for universities to make any major investments in digital content, only to become self-financing and sell off the assets if their revenue is cut.

Last year, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act expired and many universities were reluctant to spend money on new intellectual property. For example, the University of Virginia became an independent producer of content in 2010 but no revenue came in. That year, several universities canceled major programs and sold off entire departments.

There are currently 10,000 libraries in the United States.
