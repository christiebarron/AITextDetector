The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because a few chapters give us new perspectives, new perspectives on the world that I wanted to get to. And I think there's quite a bit of that in the books, in the beginning sections of the books, but in the end it's something much deeper and not just a story about who we are as a species. That's a new perspective it finds in everything about life. It takes on a new emotional connection with people and a new kind of identity. It gives us that real emotional energy.

Amber: So we're at last going to get what we need to do with the book in the New Yorker, which the book was so obviously about. Is that a big deal?

Rickell: Yes, there's a lot of different kinds of book there, but if you've got your book by the end, you've got all these different kinds of stories that can be used, and some of them are completely unrelated and they're just so interesting. But there has to be something very special that you want to explore. You can tell them story after story, but I think there was definitely a point in those books where I just had to be very careful with them, and so that changed the experience of the entire book after that. There's things that were always in the background in the first place before I moved on, then there's things that are much more in the background in later chapters.
