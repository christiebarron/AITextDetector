An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a patient who refused to take part in work because he could not go to work. You are not looking at the number of hours in the week because you are looking at number of hours enforcing an anti-social behaviour - you are in your own world of the work and not looking at an overall issue at all. In the example of a patient who was a patient, and was told to work at five minutes a day he was given five minutes. He didn't want that to change because it meant he would not be able to support his family. In the modern day this has been recognised as a form of social abuse. I think it is an important part of the modern criminal justice system. It has very little to do with the quality of service people are paid, but the fact that it becomes a part of the criminal justice system.
