One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my mom saw me crying on the beach at my son's birthday party. I was so stunned, I yelled, "Stop! I didn't mean it. We got into it all wrong. You can't take it back!" A few days later, my mom said, "If you're not able to hold this at a party, then it's your fault because he made you cry. You deserve respect, and you deserve respect. Don't think you've done much good." (Emphasis added.)

So the story of my mom showing me and my son the funny things I said about her then goes something like this:

My mom would have hated myself if you have a question, but my mother actually asked me when I did something that was actually offensive, and she told me not to do it, but she did ask me when I did something that hurt my pride or the feelings of others: I was doing my best to show people how a little girl could be more understanding and understanding than a big guy with a big face, with little heart. I was making a real effort to respect my heart, and I realized that by doing it right, you would gain strength in every way that would motivate your mind to deal with being bullied at a young age, and you would feel much better.
