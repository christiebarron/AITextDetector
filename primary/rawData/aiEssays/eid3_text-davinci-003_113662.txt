The setting of “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski plays a key role in the story. Joe vividly describes the rural setting the cyclist is riding through, where the road winds through the countryside, and the cycle race takes place on a hot summer day. These features of the setting have a direct impact on the cyclist and his performance.

The rural setting of the story adds a unique element of challenge, as the road stretches out for miles, with no end in sight. The unceasing road and terrain create a greater challenge for the cyclist, and his determination to finish the race is fueled by the ultimately insurmountable challenge of this setting.

Additionally, the hot summer day plays a further role in challenging the cyclist. Heat is a known deterrent for most endurance athletes, with cyclists not being an exception. Heat causes the cyclist to tire more quickly due to the increased exertion, dehydration, and heat stroke. The heat in the story, combined with the strength-sapping rural terrain, makes the course even more daunting and difficult for the cyclist.

Ultimately, the features of the setting play an important role in the story, and have a significant impact on the cyclist and his performance. These elements create a more challenging course for the cyclist that test his dedication, strength, and courage. The cyclist is driven by the difficult setting and impressive course, and this is what sets the story apart from others of its kind.
