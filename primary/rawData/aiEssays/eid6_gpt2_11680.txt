The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. By 1859, when the first commercial planes arrived, they had been required as carriers for planes which would then go to sea, when they could travel down the Atlantic. (See Part VII, below.) A few of the "Star Spangled Banner" carriers went to sea in 1859. (See Part VIII, above.) The new type is designed to be ready to drop on a carrier at any hour (sometimes in a heartbeat). The carriers have two primary parts: an engine and stabilis. It is designed to be carried in a single bundle or compartment and the aircraft can be dropped on land or on sea to avoid having to dock at a single location. An engine and stabilis are used to power the fuel tank of the carrier which keeps it stable, so no engines need to be used during takeoff. The stabilis is used when the carrier is refueled, or when its engines fail and it fails and the aircraft lands again. An engine and stabilis are usually fitted on a small deck with two doors that are located on the left, just behind the door that opens. A stabilis would allow a low speed propeller, and could be used to get into the nose of a carrier under heavy seas. The nose of a carrier can have a diameter of up to about 20 feet. A fixed deck allows for easy landing and could carry a large cargo of items.
