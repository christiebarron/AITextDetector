Computers have many effects on people. They can be very detrimental to how they feel or how they are treated. One of the main things you need to be aware of is that you may see things differently in the world outside of your home. You may think and feel different from what you perceive in the world outside your home.

So, what can you do if you are in a situation where all of a sudden an alien creature is coming from different planets (and one of those Earth planets is called Orion), or in a particular kind of time zone? Or if you were just looking for an "all star" planet that would mean you were here long enough for you and the stars to come out to your sky and show you all of that time-shifting history? To my mind that is one of the ways that these are different kinds of aliens and that is how they find their way, and it is incredibly difficult to tell them where to go with that. So a lot of these are completely speculative things.

Then you make a long list of options like where you believe the universe is going, where you believe there are intelligent life elsewhere on Earth. There are probably not much information available about these other planets that can help us to decide where to go, or to decide if there is anything they need to be. So how does a person make a choice between looking for an intelligent (inorganic) life or trying to help something like the Star Trek movies get started?
