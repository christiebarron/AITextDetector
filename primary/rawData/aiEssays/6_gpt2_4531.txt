The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. During World War II, construction engineers were forced to abandon dirigibles built for a limited period of time.

"People wanted it built so that they could go to an airplane show. Even if you were a designer, there would still be space for dirigibles," says Fergus.

When the American military built the first commercial aircraft carrier, the first "Star Wars" aircraft in the United States were built by the company Starwood. The first aircraft was built in 1941 under the name "Unexpression" in St.NRS. When a customer named Robert E. Howard proposed the company to take off and dock his ship, Starwood became a partner in the plan.

"Starwood was the only company whose business was in the building of dirigibles. That is why it looks in great pride now, so that people can see what they built and then know when they want it built," says Fergus.

In his memoir about Starwood, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. writes of an incident in 1958 when the company asked Robert E. Howard and the other architects to design another giant dirigibles. The company objected that, though they didn't have to get the order approved by the Army and Navy, the design of its own large ship would be too large to accept by an agency with all the technical knowledge.
