TO THE EDITOR: 

Greetings from [Your City], 

With the rising popularity of computers and technology, I feel that it’s time to talk about their effects on the people of our community. 

There is no doubt that computers have had a massive impact on both work and leisure activities. They offer us the ability to communicate at a faster and more efficient rate and to access a world of knowledge. However, there’s a tendency among many to overuse computers and the internet, which can lead to addiction and potential harm. 

Take, for instance, the impact computers have had on our sense of community. It seems like people are spending less and less time with their friends and family and more time communicating with people online. This shift has resulted in us feeling increasingly isolated even when surrounded by other people. 

Moreover, the blue light from computer screens has been linked to sleeplessness, headaches, and other health issues. So, as much as we benefit from the use of computers, moderation is the key to avoiding negative outcomes. 

I believe it’s important for us to recognize and accept the growing influence of computers in our lives,
