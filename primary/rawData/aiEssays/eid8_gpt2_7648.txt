One time I experienced laughter in my life was when, after I was 15 years old, my friend went out for a cup of coffee. He stopped him. I was just happy he walked away. His reaction was that God blessed the drink and I felt like my life was finally being redeemed and maybe I didn't have to think, 'I will only be a man if I drink too much.'"

It all began when Michael and his friends went to West Chester, PA to shop at the local Best Buy. Before leaving for Pennsylvania, the brothers got a job working on the road in the coal mine where they'd found their first home. In May of 1972, Michael and his friends were visiting the family of David, a coal miner and friend he'd lost his wife. David was killed in December of that year. Michael was buried in a grave at the West Chester cemetery.

Michael and his friends were hoping to get back to work in a town where they'd found some kind and lasting change. Instead, their hopes fell on a woman named Ann. Ann was married to a firefighter, and Michael and his friends had to make a short trek to see her when, after their trip home, she arrived at the home of the missing man, who had disappeared in a car. When they arrived, they discovered a handwritten note buried in the basement of the home, and a large note which said, "David went missing." Michael was a good guy for sure.
