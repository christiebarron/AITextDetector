 

My husband and I have been together for a few years now, but that doesn't mean that we haven't had our struggles. We’d had some rough times recently that had put a strain on our marriage. Recently, we decided to take a break and go on a weekend trip together. 

One night while we were away, we were having dinner at a quaint restaurant near the hotel and having a nice conversation after a long day of sightseeing. All of the sudden, I blurted out something that was a bit silly and funny, and completely unexpected. My husband immediately starting laughing, and before I knew it, we were both really cracking up. I was so relieved. 

That moment of unplanned hilarity alongside a plate of delicious food and a glass of good wine have stayed with me for a long time. It was the perfect reminder of why we were together in the first place — to share happy moments with each other and to never take for granted the joys and wonders of life. Laughter truly is the best medicine for any relationship.
