I was visiting my childhood friend after years of not seeing her. She had always been outgoing and bubbling with enthusiasm. We had a shared love for laughter and funny stories. 

When I stepped into her house, she welcomed me with hearty laughter and a big hug. Even though I was now an adult and didn’t lead the same carefree lifestyle I had as a child, there was something about being in her presence that brought out the happiest parts of me. 

The afternoon simply passed us by, as we shared stories and laughter. We’d reminisce about our younger years, how we used to stay out late playing make believe until we had to be called in by our parents. We laughed at the nicknames we had given to our teammates in elementary school PE classes. We recalled the troublemaker who was always starting mischief and laughed at her antics. By the time I was ready to leave, it felt like I had been home for weeks. 

From that moment on, no matter how much I changed, the act of laughing when I was around her remained constant and that was what kept us connected.
