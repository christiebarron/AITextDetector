I was recently at the grocery store when I encountered a difficult situation. The lines were very long and the cashiers were moving very slowly. Everyone in line was becoming increasingly frustrated. My patience was tested when one of the customers in front of me simply snapped and started arguing with the cashier. Instead of joining in on the drama, I took a deep breath and allowed the situation to unfold without my participation. I remained calm, understanding, and tolerant. I could tell that the cashier was overwhelmed and simply needed a bit of patience to handle the situation. After the customer stormed away, the line began to move and I was eventually able to complete my transaction. Iâ€™m proud of myself for staying patient in a difficult situation.
