Removing materials with offensive content goes against the fundamental mission of libraries which is to give people access to knowledge, even if it is knowledge that is deemed offensive. By removing books, magazines, music and other materials with allegedly offensive content, we are denying people their right to access the ideas contained in these materials — ideas that may provoke thought and encourage discourse on the difficult topics they bring up. 

In addition, there is an inherent danger when censorship is utilized in libraries. That danger arises from arbitrariness — when materials are removed without any concrete grounds or objective criteria established beforehand. This forces library patrons to rely on the subjective judgement of an institution or individual which can lead to controversial and even biased decisions. Such decisions might end up depriving library patrons of pertinent information and valuable knowledge.
