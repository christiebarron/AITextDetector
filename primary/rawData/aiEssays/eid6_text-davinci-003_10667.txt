The Empire State building was an architectural and engineering marvel when it was completed in 1931. Not only did it soar above the New York skyline, it was the tallest building in the world and had the capability of allowing dirigibles to dock. While the concept of mooring dirigibles atop the Empire State Building was intriguing, there were many obstacles the builders faced in making this idea a reality. 

For one, the initial plan consisted of constructing a mooring mast on the roof of the building. This mast was to be 375 feet tall and weigh 140 tons —80 tons in steel and an additional 60 tons of ballast. The mast would also be engineered to support up to seven times the stated weight should the part of the mast above the mooring cage be subjected to intense winds. Although plans were made, the $500,000 price tag to build the mast proved too costly and the project was abandoned.

Next, engineers devised a plan to build a “boom” or arm-like structure protruding from the building. This arm would be constructed out of lightweight steel and would extend 250 feet in length and 28 feet over the edge of the building. The arm was designed to rotate in order to provide an easier and smoother access to the mooring platform. However, the lightweight material to build such a structure proved to be too difficult to manufacture at the time.

Finally, the final plan was to construct a m
