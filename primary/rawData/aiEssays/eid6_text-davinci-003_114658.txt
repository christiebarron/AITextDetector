The construction of the Empire State Building in New York City marked a major feat of engineering for its time and a testament to man’s ability to create something magnificent. However, what many people may not know is that the building was initially designed to accommodate dirigibles, or large airships. In “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock are explored in detail.

Firstly, during the 1930s, when the Empire State Building was built, the technology related to dirigibles was still in its early stages. This fact posed a major challenge to the builders of the building, which was to find an efficient and effective way to ensure that the dirigibles could dock with the building. To solve this problem, they came up with the idea of constructing a ninety-foot tall mooring mast at the top of the building.

Another issue to consider was the possibility that the dirigible’s rising or falling could cause it to crash into the building. To ensure that this didn’t happen, the builders implemented a complex network of cables connecting the dirigible to the building. This system worked by allowing the dirigible to be secured and controlled by the mooring mast, so that its altitude could be safely managed.

It soon emerged that wind was another factor that had to be taken into account. To
