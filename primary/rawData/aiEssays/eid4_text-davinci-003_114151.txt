The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho is meant to emphasize the idea of resilience and hope. It is a reminder that although things may seem bleak in the present, there is still a chance for positive change -- which is symbolized by the return of the hibiscus in the spring. In this way, the message of the story is that it is possible to persevere through difficult times as the hibiscus will be waiting and ready again once the snow melts. The text serves as a metaphor for the protagonist's own struggle and the reminder that, even if the first attempt at something is unsuccessful, it is possible to try again and work towards success.
