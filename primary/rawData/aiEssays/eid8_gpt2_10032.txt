One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was 5, when my family brought me a couple of stuffed toys, and when they told me when they heard anything about my mom's life, their laughter never wavers. It's just all about the world, and I can not believe we're still not in love with each other, or know each other's stories.

My mom never had any of my love issues, I believe. I am not a fan of bullying, but I have found in my parenting experiences that I do not truly care for my mom or myself. She is an amazing gift to us all and it is with love in my heart, that I am finally able to say "enough is enough." Please pray for me when I get this opportunity and pray for you all, because this is a terrible world to live!

I appreciate you all writing and sharing. Do you still suffer from something like this? Should you just stay at home, or find some way to help me cope? Thank you so much.

Best wishes,

Kristel
