I'll never forget the moment I shared a laugh with my husband for the first time since the pandemic hit. We'd been walking around the neighborhood, taking in the fresh air and talking about the latest stay-at-home restrictions. The conversation felt oddly serious, despite the beauty of the crisp spring day, until a rogue flying Frisbee smacked him right in the face. As he picked himself up off the ground, slightly embarrassed, I couldn't help but burst out in laughter; and surprisingly, his eyes twinkled as he joined in! 

We spent the rest of the afternoon strolling around the park, relishing in experiences that only weeks before we'd taken for granted - like the child laughing on the swing and the smell of fresh cut grass. Despite what 2020 was throwing our way, that laugh felt like a fresh start - a reminder that no matter how much we're challenged, we have each other - and each other's laughter - to get through it.
