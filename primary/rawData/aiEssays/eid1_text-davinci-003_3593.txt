I recently went to a dinner party with a group of friends. We had been looking forward to the evening as a way to catch up after not seeing each other in a while. I was a bit nervous because I didn't know everyone there, but my friends were all welcoming and warm.

During dinner we started to chat and tell stories about our recent adventures. One story was particularly funny and all of us started to laugh. I felt my nerves start to disappear as I felt completely accepted by everyone. 

As we continued swapping stories, the laughter slowly shifted from polite polite to full-on hysterics. I found myself laughing so hard I had tears in my eyes.

It was such a relief to be in the company of good friends and to feel so welcomed and accepted. As the laughter died down, we talked about other topics and enjoyed the evening. 

To this day I still remember the wonderful dinner I shared with great friends and so much laughter. Whenever I’m feeling a bit nervous in new social settings, I bring up that dinner to remind myself that even if I don’t know everyone there, a few laughs can really break the ice.
