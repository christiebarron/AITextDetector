Dear Editors, 

I am writing to share my opinion on the effects computers have on people. As computer technology advances, so does our dependence on them. The use of computers has drastically changed the way we conduct business, communicate, and educate ourselves. Yet, despite these benefits, I believe there are serious disadvantages associated with excessive computer use.

Too much time spent in front of a monitor can lead to physical and mental health problems, such as carpal tunnel, muscle strain, vision problems, decreased physical activity, and an overall lack of concentration. Computer use can also lead to sleep deprivation and fatigue, due to long shifts spent in front of a screen. Additionally, over dependence on computers can have a negative impact on social interactions, as people become so preoccupied with their computer that they neglect to build relationships with others.

In conclusion, computers have afflicted our lives with many benefits, however, they are not without their drawbacks. If we want to preserve our health and our relationships, we should use computers reasonably and consciously.

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
