An example of a time someone in my life was patient was for me to take an exam. Not being able to do all the things that I did, but being able to read to my kids. The teacher didn't want to take my exam, but he didn't make a point. So it's hard to think how someone can be so frustrated when they cannot do all the things someone with this kind of experience can do. But sometimes I think all of yourself is working.
