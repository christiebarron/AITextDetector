Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. For the past several decades, computers have revolutionized the way we live, work and communicate with each other. From helping us run businesses to enabling us to stay connected with loved ones, computers have done more than just change the way we communicate.

As a result of computers, we have been able to make life easier and more convenient in several ways. With the help of computers we can now purchase goods and services online, search for information quickly and easily, and store vast amounts of data. Computers have also made it easier for us to access resources and services that may have otherwise been out of reach.

Despite the numerous advantages of computers, there are also certain disadvantages that we must be aware of. Excessive use of computers can lead to eye strain, headaches, difficulty sleeping, and anxiety. Spending too much time on computers can also have a negative effect on social relationships.

However, with a few precautions, the effects of computers can be minimized. By limiting the amount of time spent on computers, getting enough exercise and making sure to get at least eight hours of sleep each night, we can avoid some of the negative effects of computers.

In conclusion, computers can be beneficial and dangerous at the same time. By managing our activities and taking necessary precautions we can ensure that the effects of computers do not cause serious harm.

Sincerely,
