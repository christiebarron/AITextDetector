In Joe Kurmaski's poem "Rough Road Ahead," the cyclist is presented with an unfamiliar stretch of road and the features of the setting around them. The cyclist is warned of a "rough road ahead" right away in the title, and this is confirmed as they begin the journey. The heavily wooded terrain—the "thick stands of trees" and the "shadowy depths"—creates a feeling of unease and darkness that is not present in other terrain. The trees are so voluminous that the cyclist cannot see more than a few feet in front of them, making the road seem like it goes on forever. Visibility is low, and the cyclist is unable to make out any signs of habitation or safety. This lack of visibility, combined with the terrain, leaves the cyclist feeling completely alone and unsettled.

The darkness of the setting creates an atmosphere of danger and unfamiliarity that affects the cyclist's behavior in the poem. They recognize the risk they may be taking, but they press on despite the ominous feeling of the environment around them. The cyclist exercises a certain level of reluctance and caution, as well as understandable anxiety, which drives the poem's sense of tension and suspense. The feelings of being alone in the dark woods reinforces the cyclist's apprehensive feelings while providing a tangible back-drop to the poem.
