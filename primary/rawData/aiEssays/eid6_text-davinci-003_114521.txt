In 1930, the builders of the Empire State Building had a vision for the future. The 102-story building was to be the tallest skyscraper in the world and the top of the building was designed to be a docking station for dirigibles. The challenges in achieving this goal, however, were vast and complex.

To begin with, the height of the building was an engineering challenge. The building had to be tall enough to accommodate a dirigible, yet still remain structurally sound. The engineers succeeded in designing a structure that was stiff enough to bear the weight of a dirigible and withstanding wind forces.

Due to the large size of the dirigibles, the width of the tower's crown had to be modified to contain them. Consequently, the engineers had to come up with a design for a structure that could provide maximum clearance to the dirigibles while still allowing them to dock safely. To accomplish this, the engineers began constructing a horizontal steel mast, known as a mooring mast, on top of the building. This mast provided the necessary stability for the dirigibles to dock and its streamlined shape allowed them to maneuver in the smaller spaces.

Moreover, the engineers also had to consider the safety of the dirigibles when docking. The mooring mast contained several pressure sensors that were activated when a dirigible was approaching, signaling to those on the ground the airship was nearby. Crew members on the ground also signaled the dir
