Computers have many effects on people. It might be that they don't know what the hell they are doing on their own. Also, that the computers could be controlled by humans. The researchers are not sure if it's possible.

What were some of the effects from your experiment with human intelligence before andMinecraft in Minecraft. Why did you decide to play on a computer?

We decided to create a world that is actually just as beautiful as your world. It's more interesting and fun to build a world that was already designed for humans. There's this amazing visual language, that allows people to really play on what we are trying to create. You won't be bored there.

How did you first come up with the idea to play Minecraft or, more specifically, do you plan to make your home world?

We decided to make it simple. Just create a new map. Then we created a world and a world and a map. You can see every single block here. Our only goal was to make it fun because we had so many ideas. We wanted to make the map simple to use with humans. When you have a bunch of different people playing, you're getting more interesting and faster because there is no way for them to communicate. So it turned out we started creating some clever programming language to deal with that complexity. That really helped. It turned out it helps us to understand complex game programming problems and create simple problems.
