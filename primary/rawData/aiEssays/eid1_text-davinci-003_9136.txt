Dear Editor,

I am writing this letter to express my opinion on the effect computers have had on our lives and why I believe it is a positive thing. 

In the past few decades, computers have become essential in our everyday lives. They are used for work, research, entertainment, communication, and more. As technology has advanced, computers have become faster and more powerful, allowing us to do things quickly and efficiently. For example, computers help us write documents, search online for information, and create presentations. 

With computers, we are able to connect with people from all over the world. Technology has enabled us to stay in touch with family, friends, and colleagues by using applications like Skype, Zoom and WhatsApp. In addition, computers have made learning easier and more accessible. With online resources and educational videos, anyone can learn whatever they want in a short period of time. 

Overall, computers have had an enormous impact on our lives. We now have the ability to share information and ideas quickly, which allows us to collaborate and work together more effectively. Furthermore, computers provide us with access to vast amounts of data, which can be used to make important decisions.

For these reasons, I believe that computers are beneficial to our society. They are a powerful tool that can be used for good. I hope that you agree with me and that you will consider my opinion in your paper.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
