Dear Editor, 

As technology has become increasingly pervasive in our lives, computers have become an integral part of our lives. But, the effects that computers have had on us are a subject of debate. Some argue that computers have been a negative influence, while others may see the benefits that they provide.

As an advocate for the use of computers, I wanted to state my opinion on their positive impacts. Computers can help streamline mundane tasks, such as data entry and analysis. With computers, individuals are able to more effectively and efficiently accomplish tasks in a fraction of the time it would take to do it manually. Moreover, computers also help us stay connected with family and friends. The abundance of social media platforms and communication technologies make it easy for us to make friends, find lost family members, and keep up-to-date with news around the world.

Aside from these obvious practical applications, computers can also be beneficial in the intellectual and educational aspect. Computers provide access to an infinite ocean of knowledge, giving users an unprecedented amount of information that can be accessed in seconds with just a few clicks. There is no denying that computers have opened up more opportunities for students and adults alike.

In short, the use of computers can have infinitely more positive effects than negative. In the constantly evolving world that is technology, I'm glad to be on the side that supports and encourages its use. 

Sincerely, 

[Your Name
