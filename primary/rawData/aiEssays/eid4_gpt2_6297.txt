If you look at the book now, you'll see this:

It started around 700 Ma, but it's long since been over 400 with ice at the peak. (The Antarctic Ice Sheet, which was formed at the end of the Ice Age, was actually 40,000 years old after Ice Age II began, as well as at the end of the Ice Age about 2.5 and 6 million years before today, while today I'd say that all that is pretty much settled.)

The first two periods (mid-700 Ma) were warm, humid, and arid. Then during the last two millennia, the dry seasons became warm (which didn't really change much because the oceans kept warming on the other side, and this was the only part of the globe where there was
