The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Most were built through an agreement between the US government and Doha, with Doha seeking to negotiate an agreement that included other non-governmental organizations. But a lack of funding led the construction team to ask the US government what role it should play in Doha. The agreement is still pending.

But since the first dirigibility was put forward by a US company in 1959 in San Francisco, Doha has received many requests to join the international project on behalf of the US. Its request is being considered, possibly even the second for the building, which is headed for a new location in the US District of Columbia, which is currently the largest city in the US.

With the approval of an international team headed by former US Ambassador Dennis O'Brien and a large team of US and Doha officials, the building will be built like an American commercial building on land owned by the Chinese city of Beijing.
