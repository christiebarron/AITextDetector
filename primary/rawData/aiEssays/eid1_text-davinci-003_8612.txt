I was out walking my pet dog, Scooter, in the park, when I noticed a little girl sitting on the bench. She looked like she could do with some cheering up, so I went over to say hello. 

At first she didn't say anything and was a bit unsure of me. I asked her what was wrong, and she said she had been having a bad day. To try and make her smile, I started making animal noises and pretending to be my dog. 

The girl's face immediately lit up, and she started laughing. I kept up the noises and soon I was laughing too. After a few moments, she asked me if I could make other animal noises and so we spent the next half hour impersonating all sorts of animals, from cows to crocodiles. 

It was so much fun, and it made me feel so glad that I had made a special connection with this little girl. We finished the game with huge grins on both of our faces, and I'm sure I will never forget the precious moment we shared.
