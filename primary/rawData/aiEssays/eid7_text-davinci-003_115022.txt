I recently encountered a situation where I was required to stay patient. My daughter had been having trouble sleeping for weeks, so her pediatrician suggested we see a chiropractor. We made an appointment, but it ended up being rescheduled multiple times. I was frustrated, but I knew this was something that could help my daughter, so I didn't express my annoyance. I stayed calm and simply asked when the soonest appointment could be rescheduled. Eventually, we found a time that worked for us and my daughter began to feel better after just a few sessions. I was thankful that I was able to stay patient during this stressful process, as it allowed us to get the help we needed to get back on track.
