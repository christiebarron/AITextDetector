One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was sitting on the phone on the plane and someone asked whether she knew who Kim Jong-un was. I told her 'that's who you believe in.' And she didn't believe me at all. I remember at least talking to Kim Jong-un a month before.

The woman said that Kim had no political interests whatsoever.

How do we get people in touch with the truth?
