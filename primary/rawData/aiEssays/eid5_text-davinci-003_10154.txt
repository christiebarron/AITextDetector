The memoir From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez creates a mood of nostalgia. Rodriguez recounts his childhood growing up in a small rural town in the Dominican Republic, away from the bustling city life and a traditional nuclear family. His recollections of playing with neighborhood friends, fishing in the river, and watching lizards climb trees are simple but vivid. Though Rodriguez reflects on a hardscrabble life, his nostalgic tone and joyful reminiscences of his hometown evoke a feeling of longing. 

Rodriguez paints a picture of a simpler life, one that is often quite different from the stress-filled, bustling cities of today. He reflects on his childhood experiences with fondness, and his deep nostalgia for the place of his youth creates a powerful mood of yearning. He muses on the sound of the cockerels crowing and the feel of the earth under his feet as he roams through the countryside. He remembers the electric atmosphere of the fiestas, and the feeling of togetherness that his tight-knit community provided. 

The memoir evokes a powerful feeling of longing, with a touch of bittersweetness. While Rodriguez's village may have been poor and his family fractured, he looks fondly on his hometown and his childhood memories therein. The joy of his childhood memories and the sorrow of his broken family creates a unique sentiment that is perfectly captured in this memoir. From Home: The Blueprints of Our
