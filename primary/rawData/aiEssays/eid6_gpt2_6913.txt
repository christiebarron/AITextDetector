The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first was the sheer height of the building to provide the illusion that no room was allowed in the tower, making the building, and all of it, extremely difficult to hide. As a result, a tunnel that once led to the building at 7.62 feet deep was constructed through the construction zone that closed the escape. The first tunnel, which led to the upper level of the Empire State Building now holds a total of 15,000 square feet of additional security. The tunnel from 7.54 feet deep into an open pit, with the tunnel behind it now locked, is called the "Nakubo-Gazeta" tunnel and it is only accessible from the upper floors. This tunnel is about 20 feet deep and about 20 feet wide. In a small area, the original plan for the tunnel, dubbed the "Nakubo-Gazeta" (after the name of the new Empire State Building) was to have a 1,500-seat grand swimming pool. One might imagine, then, that the original plan to use the massive opening to open it up had been more limited and less safe than it was before (and that this would prevent access to other entrances to the Empire State Building, given that the Empire State Building was still surrounded by military installations, the tunnels could simply be kept closed because of the sheer width or height of the pool). In reality, at the
