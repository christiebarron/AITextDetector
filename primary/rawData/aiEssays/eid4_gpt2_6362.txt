The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because you know it, if you ever think about it.

There is a scene where Dr. Hopps is standing at the back of the room. The Doctor stares at him, then says that it feels like he's in a dream, so this shouldn't upset him much either, but when he looks at his head... it's very familiar to him.

He says that the book is "a way to look at things a little differently" - this would certainly be very strange to the Doctor.

In the first half, Dr. Hopps is able to create a special effect of a small child. He does this by taking a tiny ball from a small and then holding it up to one of the children and bending it as if it were a wooden spoon. For a brief time, it becomes quite large for him as the toy continues to grow and he can see it as if it were a doll doll.

Episode 20 Edit

The Doctor explains to Hopps that there are many ways of doing things. In many cases it simply takes one little picture and then the Doctor can use the two tiny pieces he made and turn them into a one picture monster. The two doll-babies who live in this room are Mr. Hopps and his two little ones. Hopps is on his way back to the school for school, so Hopps says they haven't gotten away from Professor McGon
