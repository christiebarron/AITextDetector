In the short story "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski, the features of the setting play a critical role in the cyclist's growing inner conflict. The protagonist, a young high-school student, struggles to find his place in a world dominated by dangerous roads and a culture with little respect for cyclists. The setting emphasizes the feeling of tension between the cyclist and their environment.

The cyclist is constantly surrounded by motor vehicles, creating an intense sense of intensity and danger. Furthermore, the roads are poorly maintained and provide no safe passage for cyclists. This raises the stakes, as a single wrong move can result in serious injury or death. The cyclist is in constant danger, yet he still persists, hoping that he will eventually succeed against the odds.

The environment also plays on the notion of lawlessness. There is no police presence and cyclists are openly disrespected by drivers. The cyclist believes he must develop the strength needed to survive in such a hostile environment. He must learn to adapt to the rules of the road, or suffer the consequences. In order to become fully accepted he must prove himself worthy of respect by consistently cycling with caution despite the constant danger. 

The setting in "Rough Road Ahead" serves as a powerful tool to illustrate the challenges faced by cyclists struggling in a hostile environment, while also offering a powerful message about the importance of disregarding external skepticism and embracing a sense of personal strength to succeed against the odds.
