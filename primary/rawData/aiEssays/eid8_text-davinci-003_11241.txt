 

I recently went on a romantic trip with my boyfriend for our one-year anniversary. We had been planning the trip for weeks to make it as perfect as possible. We went to a nearby beach that had great views and spent the afternoon lounging on the sand. 

As the sun started to set, we decided to take a walk down the shore. Even though it was beautiful and quiet, there was something about the silence that made me nervous. My boyfriend was just as quiet, so I decided to try to break the silence with a jokeâ€”not one of my best kereracking skills, I must admit.

At first, I thought he didn't get the joke, but then he started to laugh. The laughter seemed to be contagious as I started to laugh too. I felt like I had just made the greatest joke of all time. We ended up walking down the beach, just giggling and being silly. We laughed at the silly things we found and made jokes about the people around us.

It was so nice to find a way to break the silence and show our connection. To this day, when we look back at that day, we are reminded of how laughter connects us in different ways. Laughter gives us an opportunity to understand each other a little better, and it brings us closer together in many ways.
