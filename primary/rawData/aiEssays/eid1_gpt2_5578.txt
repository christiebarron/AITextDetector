Computers have many effects on people. They can affect your relationships. They can alter your friendships. They can keep things straight from you. They can turn you into one of those things that are so hard to live for anymore, when things are normal.

What's the best way to find out more about them?

You can start there. But first you need to know how to use a lot of these things without causing us harm and confusion.

You start with some basic information.

You see an area or two, what the hell are they?

You're like, "Where are you going? Where are you going? I don't know."

Your brain recognizes what's going on.

It doesn't know if you're doing this. Or if this is actually happening.

I'm gonna give you some basic examples, like if you go out your backyard with the porch or car, and there's a pool outside.

The place is full of water.

It's almost like a river.

You can't tell where that is or what's going on. You can't even tell what they are by looking at everything. So what you see is all you know. So that kind of information just isn't enough.

You have to find how to help out with this.
