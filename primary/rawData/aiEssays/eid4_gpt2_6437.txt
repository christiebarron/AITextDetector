The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because a lot of people think you're being disingenuous. I mean, even if it was true, and even if you find it out, I'm not sure I would have called it an out and asked it.

I don't think you have to accept the fact that you have a very different career view to the rest of the world when you're writing the books.

Yesâ€¦ It is, but I was never particularly interested in the story of Summer Hibiscus, or the events surrounding her at the beginning of summer. My point was that Summer Hibiscus didn't appear in any of the books that are written. She was just there to have an opinion that had some very positive implications. I was interested in what the people of Ireland were going through during Winter. I thought it would be helpful to bring Autumn around to look at. And some of the interesting things in the book, to see if there is some difference in what Winter Hibiscus says or what Autumn talks about, or what Autumn has meant to her or what winter feels like to her.

It is a really interesting way to read The Snow Queen, how it is a series of parallel, more or less a narrative progression for Winter's characters as the story progresses through Summer.

They do get to be more personal and more involved, or more connected to Winter, but I think Winter had the very unique and very high level
