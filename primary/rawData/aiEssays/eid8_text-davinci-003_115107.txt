I was walking around the park the other day, feeling a bit down, when I heard a loud laugh coming from behind me. I turned around to find an elderly couple, holding hands and smiling. Something about the sound of their laughter filled me with warmth and brought a smile to my own face.

I decided to take a detour and follow them around the park. As I did, it seemed like every few steps they would stop and find something new to laugh about. Soon after, I found myself joining in with their laughter, even the jokes I didn't understand.

Before I knew it, I was part of their afternoon stroll and the two elderly strangers had become fast friends with me. Before they parted, the elderly couple shared the same joke with me, one they had shared with each other many times before. I'm sure the joke wasn't that funny, but we all laughed until our stomachs ached.

It was then I realized that laughter had brought us all together, even if just for that moment, and that's the kind of warmth that can make a difference.
