It is no secret that censorship is a controversial topic. As far as libraries are concerned, the issue of whether or not to allow certain materials to remain on the shelves can be particularly difficult to navigate. It is important to acknowledge that we all have different opinions and sensibilities when it comes to materials deemed offensive, and it is up to us to decide what is right or wrong. 

When it comes to libraries, it is essential to remember that they serve a wide variety of people. Allowing offensive materials can be deemed inappropriate, particularly by those who feel strongly about certain topics. But at the same time, censoring certain materials can unintentionally limit access to important information and can be seen as infringement on those seeking intellectual freedom. 

The solution is not a simple one, but it is possible to strike a balance between safeguarding what people deem offensive and allowing everyoneâ€™s right to access whatever materials they choose. Librarians and library boards could work together to create a filtering system, based on community standards, that would allow for titles to be removed from the shelves if found to be inappropriate. Once these standards have been established, the library staff can then use the latest technology to detect potentially offensive material. It is also essential to employ librarians who are well-versed in these tactics, ensuring a safe and censorship-free atmosphere in the library.

Filter systems can also be applied to other formats such as audio-visual media and online communications. This
