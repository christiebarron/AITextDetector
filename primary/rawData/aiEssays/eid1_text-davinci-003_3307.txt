Dear Editor, 

I strongly believe that computers have had a positive effect on people's lives. Today, computers are quickly becoming an integrated part of our daily lives and they help people make their lives more efficient and convenient. 

Without a doubt, computers have changed the way we communicate, work, travel and entertain ourselves. They allow us to connect with people all around the world, manage our finances, help us stay organized, and make tasks like shopping or booking travel reservations easy. Computers also make school more interactive by giving students access to a wealth of educational resources. 

Furthermore, the advances in technology allow us to be more productive and creative. For example, entrepreneurs can easily start businesses with a few clicks of their mouse. Mobile devices like tablets and smartphones put the power of the internet in our pockets, allowing us to stay connected at all times.

There are definitely drawbacks to using so much technology, and I understand the concern about the effects on our safety and privacy, as well as the risk of digital addiction. But the benefits are clear, and if used in moderation, computers provide us with many advantages. 

Therefore, it is my view that computers have been incredibly beneficial for people
