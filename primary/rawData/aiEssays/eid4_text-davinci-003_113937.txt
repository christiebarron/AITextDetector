The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho conveys an important message to the readers. By ending with this phrase, the author conveys the idea that no matter the difficulty in life, it is always important to keep trying and remain hopeful that better times are ahead. The phrase likens the protagonist's struggles during the winter season to the difficulty of taking a test, yet offers the promise of success with the return of spring. The return to warm, comforting weather, a new chance for the hibiscus flower to bloom, and geese returning to signify the beginning of a new—hopefully better—year, serves as a powerful metaphor that it is always worth facing hardships with the promise of overcoming them.
