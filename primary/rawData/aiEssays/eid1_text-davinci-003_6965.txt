The ever-evolving popularity of libraries, both in physical and digital form, makes them invaluable resources for people of all ages. But with this popularity comes a certain amount of thought and care when deciding what materials to stock on their shelves. Should books, music, movies, and magazines be removed from the shelves if they are deemed offensive? 

I believe that libraries should have the right to determine what items to keep in stock. Censorship and selection should take place under the guidance of professional librarians, not politicians or any other interest group. Libraries should be allowed to stock materials that may be regarded as controversial, so long as they are of literary and/or intellectual merit. Libraries should also strive to maintain an equitable balance between constructive, educational materials and those with controversial subject matter.

However, I do not support the censorship of materials beyond what is deemed appropriate. Libraries should provide a variety of materials to their patrons, from all perspectives; this includes those which may be deemed offensive. Though libraries are expected to make responsible choices when determining what to stock, total censorship can limit patronsâ€™ access to resources, ignoring freedom of speech, freedom of inquiry, and freedom of choice. Libraries should provide a balanced view of controversial materials so as to avoid unfair bias in favor of any particular ideology or perspective.

I believe it is important to protect the freedom to access information. Ashland Public Library in Massachusetts, for instance, has a well-balanced selection policy
