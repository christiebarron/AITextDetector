A few decades ago, the presence of computers was significantly less than it is today. Fast forward to the present day and computers form an integral part of everyday life. But what implications do they have on people? 

The good effects of computers are clear - they enable us to work quicker, connect with anyone across the globe, and open up more opportunities that were once thought to be impossible. Once filled with paperwork, many areas of work, including accounting and coding, are made much easier and more efficient with the help of computers. 

However, research has shown that at times, computers can have an adverse effect on people’s lives. Some experience ‘computer fatigue’ due to the overuse of devices. Working on electronic screens for too long can be damaging for eyesight and cause headaches and fatigue. Repetitive strain injury is also a common effect of excessive computer use. 

Furthermore, certain studies have suggested that computer use can even lead to depression. This is because of the lack of physical and personal contact with people and reduced outdoor activities. 

In conclusion, computers undoubtedly offer us huge advantages, but people should be aware of the potential risks of using them excessively. 

I hope readers agree with me and take steps to prevent any potential harm caused by the
