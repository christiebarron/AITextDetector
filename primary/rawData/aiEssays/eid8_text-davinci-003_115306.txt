I was on a family trip to a nearby lake with my family, and on the first night, we made a fire and roasted marshmallows. I was tasked with the job of maintaining the fire, and I kept an eye out so that the flames never died out. 

About halfway through the evening, I misjudged the size of the flame, and the fire went out completely. My dad and brother initially groaned and started to scold me, but I quickly put on a sly smile, and they both burst into laughter. 

My family had a good chuckle at my expense, but it was a moment that I will never forget. That kind of laughter is something that brings us closer together and really builds unity in our family. It helps us enjoy our time and stress a little less when life throws us a curveball.
