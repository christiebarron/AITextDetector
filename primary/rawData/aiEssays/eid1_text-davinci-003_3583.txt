No doubt, the right of freedom of expression is considered a fundamental right; however, it is understandable that within the context of a library – which is an educational institution meant to act as a barrier to inappropriate material – there is an ongoing argument for censorship to be enforced in order to protect younger generations from inappropriate content.

The key to properly dealing with the issue of censorship in libraries is open discussions with all members of the community about what is considered ‘offensive’ or appropriate in terms of the libraries’ particular collection. Today, there are hundreds of books, films, music and magazines that contain material deemed to be offensive. Therefore, it is important that strict considerations are taken into account before any material is removed from the shelves.
