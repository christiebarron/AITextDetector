I was recently at a busy restaurant with a group of friends. We had all just ordered our food and were waiting for it to come out. It was taking so much longer than we had expected and some of us were getting impatient. We kept asking the waiters how much longer it would take but they had no idea. 

That's when one of my friends stepped in. He said that it was no use getting angry and that these things take time. He reminded us to be patient and that our food was probably taking a bit longer than expected because the restaurant was busy. We all agreed and stopped complaining.

After awhile, our food finally arrived. We were all very relieved, but thankful for my friend had been patient and reminded us not to get too worked up. We were able to enjoy our meal in peace.
