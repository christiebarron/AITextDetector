Dear Editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Even though it is undeniable that computers have made our lives so much easier, I can not ignore the negative effects that they cause. 

One of the main issues I have with computers is the amount of time people are spending on them. Average persons are now spending more and more time in front of their computer screens, and this is taking away from the social and physical activities which they might be able to be involve in. Constant and prolonged use of computers can diminish the ability to have meaningful social interaction.

Another concern is the effects of the blue light being emitted from screens. This blue light, which is created by the backlight of LCDs, is known to interfere with the production of melatonin (a natural hormone which signals the brain to sleep). Without enough melatonin, people may find themselves having trouble sleeping at night due to the higher stimulation they receive from screens.

I believe that it is important to recognize the negative effects of computers on our lives. We need to be mindful of how much time we are spending in front of our screens and the risks it may pose on our physical and mental health. We should strive to limit our usage of computers and focus more on interact with people face-to-face.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
