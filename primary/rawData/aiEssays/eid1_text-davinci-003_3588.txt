I was out to dinner with my best friend. We hadn't seen each other in months and were catching up on all the news since we'd last spoken. We were in the middle of a heated conversation about our holiday plans when things suddenly got a bit out of hand. 

My friend made a crack that revealed something I did not want anyone else to know. We both erupted in laughter and I couldn't help but notice the attention we were drawing to ourselves. I wanted to scold him, but that only made us both laugh even harder. 

In that moment, all of the stress of the day melted away and for a few minutes, the world felt like a better place. I realized in that moment how much I had missed my friend. We were soon joined by a few other friends and we all bonded over our shared laughter and stories. 

That experience showed me how important laughter can be in any relationship. Even in the midst of a challenging or stressful situation, laughter was a reminder of why I value my friendships so much and that laughter and togetherness are what will get us through no matter what.
