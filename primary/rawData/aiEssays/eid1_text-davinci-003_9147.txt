Dear Editor, 

I am writing to share my opinion on the impact computers are having on our lives. As an avid user of technology myself, I can state confidently that computers have opened up countless opportunities for us in this digital age. 

From online education to faster communication with colleagues and relatives around the world, computers have helped us tap into our network and given us access to knowledge and resources that were once impossible. It has allowed us to automate tedious and mundane tasks, providing us with the bandwidth to focus on more productive tasks and use our free time for hobbies and to build relationships with friends and family. 

At the same time, the convenience that computers offer might conversely be holding us back from achieving our full potential due differing aspects of our lives. Spending too much time on the computer can lead to physical health issues, such as eyestrain and poor posture, as well as mental health issues, such as depression and poor social skills. It can also lead to a disconnect with the people around us, resulting in a lack of empathy with our relationships. 

In conclusion, computers can be incredibly useful tools in our lives, however, it is imperative that we keep them in their proper place. Everyone should have clear boundaries when it comes to their systems and should monitor their usage closely so that these powerful devices can be used to maximize their productivity and well being. 

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
