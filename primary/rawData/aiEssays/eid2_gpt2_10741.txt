I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is inherently a threat, and I don't want people in those communities seeing this as censorship," Brown said in a statement today.

Brown said the New York Times, which was first to publish information about the controversy, has since apologized and acknowledged the fact that the story was inaccurate and it had "done everything it could to avoid upsetting people."

"I hope that the New York Post is as quick as it can to point the finger at me for making this story, which in and of itself has nothing to do with it," Brown continued. "I will not allow myself to be misunderstood as the people who write articles."
