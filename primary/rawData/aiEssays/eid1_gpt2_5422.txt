Computers have many effects on people. The last thing they want isn't the next big thing, but that's exactly what they do. As well as their personal health and wellbeing, they may also influence the health of the planet. It's very easy for people to lava the planet but it's very difficult for them to save the planet if they continue living in squalor. The effects of water erosion have been studied for nearly 40 years. The first study looked at water erosion on marshes. It turned up one particular effect: that erosion was caused due to the sediment rising too much before the marshes were filled. The second study looked at the effect of water erosion on a group of soil that had not been contaminated by the water. Again, the research on the effect of erosion comes from different study locations. What is obvious is that the effects of water erosion have been looked beyond marshes to other places where humans could live. They have to be a part of what is being done to preserve biodiversity.

If there are things that we can do that we will never be able to do without erosion, then we have to move on with everything that we can and take care of ourselves rather than just being a tool for those of us who cannot.

It is not just that if we start mining our way off a cliff, and we start to see how our people live and die, that it is going to add up in just the same way as it
