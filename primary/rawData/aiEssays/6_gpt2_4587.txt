The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, they had to have a roof with a glass roof. Second, dirigibles were only required for long flights. To allow dirigibles in a craft to dock, they used special equipment. All of those devices needed to be turned on and off in different positions. One such equipment was a special "lung" that was attached to the ceiling and attached to the ceiling rails to make it a "floater." The laser's design function was to allow the laser to travel in a certain direction across the sky without actually hitting thelass, but the tower was designed to be used very slowly and that required some maneuvering and tracking. In early 1903, the engineers behind the Empire State Building began developing something similar.

After several generations of planning, the Empire State Building finally went up, but was finally too outdated to make the jump up. The buildings that were built later on, with a few notable exceptions, were also quite outdated for those of us who use a flying dirigoid. For that reason, it was leaderless (or otherwise, a great-grandfather-old-grandmother-child). In 1902, the Empire State Building was redesignated as a National Historic Landmark by the Army of the New York and New Jersey, and this was followed by the Army Air Force Academy at Camp Lejeune as well as an Air Force Museum, all of which were
