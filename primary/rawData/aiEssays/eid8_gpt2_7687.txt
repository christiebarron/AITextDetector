One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I watched his father play with his sons at the football game. We had the game on, just having fun."

Coulins said that his father had been a friend to the Raiders, and was often seen with his son after his dad bought the team, even though it wasn't open to the public.

When he arrived, his son had no recollection of the incident and, according to a statement issued by the Raiders, Coulins did not realize his father was in the stands.

The 49ers said at some point during play that the incident would come to light. "When his father was in the stands, he would not recall playing his father's game," spokesman Michael A. McCarthy said Wednesday. "When the locker room door was locked and the coach was not at play, the players would have had a verbal disagreement. That didn't happen."
