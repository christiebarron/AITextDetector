The Empire State Building was the tallest building in the world when it was built in 1931, and its iconic spire was designed with a remarkable intention â€“ to allow dirigibles, or lighter-than-air aircraft, to dock at the top. However, the obstacles faced by the builders to turn this seemingly far-fetched dream into a reality were myriad.

First, the Empire State Building could not have been built until such time as the technology existed to build a tower as tall as the skyscrapers that grace midtown Manhattan. The building materials required, including rivets, high-strength structural steel and specialized clasps and attachments, had to be sourced, and the skills of experienced manufacturers, welders and engineers were brought into the equation. Trained craftsmen, too, needed to be commissioned in order to precisely craft the intricate designs that would encourage the stability of the mooring mast. Once these obstacles had been overcome, the designers and engineers then had to conceive a way of stabilizing the lightweight structure of the mast so that it provided a safe and secure landing area for the much larger aircraft.

At the same time, the Empire State Building's designers had to consider how the docking bay at the top of the mast could sustain the immense load put upon it when inflated aircraft docked, something that required an enormous amount of the calculated engineering and calculation. Debate raged within the engineering community over the best solution to the 'problem' of the docking bay
