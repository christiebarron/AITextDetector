The ending of the Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho creates a hopeful image of a future where the protagonist is ready to take the test again and with the potential to receive a better result. This is in contrast to the start of the poem where the protagonist is feeling dejected and hopeless. The imagery used to close the poem serves to illustrate the protagonistâ€™s progress, and ultimately, her resilience. The snows melting and the geese returning can be seen as symbols of hope, representing the cycle of life and the promise of new beginnings. The image of the hibiscus budding is particularly powerful, suggesting growth and renewal. These images together speak to a sense of optimism, conveying the idea that, despite difficulties, there remains the possibility of hope and progress.
