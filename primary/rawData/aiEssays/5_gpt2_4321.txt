The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' was like a cloud in our minds. It was hard to believe something so deeply personal had been revealed and so utterly senseless. She was brave as ever, full of faith and conviction. She would be missed for many. But it was the most beautiful memory in my life.


She was an amazing writer and an even more enchanting character. What has been most amazing about the story isPodman's willingness to bring this book to fruition and bring to the light what he wrote about a world so different from our own. His talent for narrative driven narrative as well as his own writing with vivid voices speaks volumes to his ability to convey such emotional depth to both sides of the story.Podman and my daughter, Lourda, were one part of a family who was all about their country. It is with the joy of seeing the family together that the entire world of our country is represented.


I am so so happy that the young couple's families have an opportunity to witness the true story behind the book. Please continue reading, and please tell us what you think about the book. Thank you.
