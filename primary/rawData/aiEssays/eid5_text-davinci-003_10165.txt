The memoir “From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives” by Narciso Rodriguez is a powerful reflection on the evolution of his identity and upbringing. Through poignant words and images that capture his family’s history, the reader is taken on a journey filled with love, hope, and acceptance.

The mood of the memoir is one of deep nostalgia, appreciation, and gratitude for the formative life experiences of Rodriguez and his family. Through his stories and illustrations, Rodriguez captures the essence of his enduring memories - from his family’s struggle to make ends meet in Cuba to the culture shock of first arriving in the United States as a young boy.

Rodriguez also successfully conveys his earnest desire for understanding and acceptance, both from himself and others. Through his use of language and imagery, we can see his deep commitment to self-reflection and introspection. He regularly takes time to reflect on the “richness of life”, to ponder the seeds of sorrow which bear occasions for joy, and to explore his emotional landscape with respect and admiration. Ultimately, Rodriguez calls on us to find our own unique expressions of identity, to draw strength from our shared memories, and to be “proud yet humble”.

The mood of the memoir is further amplified by the vivid illustrations throughout the book. Through his art we can feel the warmth and connection Rodriguez has with his family, and his overwhelming sense of love and pride
