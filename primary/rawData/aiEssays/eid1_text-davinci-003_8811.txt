I will never forget the day my daughter and I shared a laugh that I will cherish forever. 

My daughter was very young at the time, barely four years old. We were at the grocery store, and as always, she was being very adventurous and wanted to explore. We were walking through the isles of food and she started singing to herself, making up her own little songs, and acting as if she were in a musical. As she was singing and dancing, I couldn’t help but join in and we were both laughing so hard. 

The sound of her laughter echoed down the aisle and people were turning to look at us. I was so embarrassed at first, but then I just started to laugh even harder. My daughter was so happy and it was such a great feeling. It was a special moment that we will remember forever. 

In that moment I realized how important laughter was in our relationship. There’s nothing like the bond between a parent and child that laughter can create.
