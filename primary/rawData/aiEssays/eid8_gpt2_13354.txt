One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I had a conversation about my mom's hair and all of the people in my family with the same "this is the way it is, it's not going to be a different direction than it is" speech. I didn't believe it, but when I heard the words (and they came across as very rude and personal) it helped convince me that they were true.

How do you use itâ€¦make it look like it's genuine?

Just a little bit of my best friend is going to take his eyes off of me right now (because he doesn't feel my body is being punished) and I'm going to take a little extra help from him, if it means I'll actually do something with my lips (which I wouldn't have thought about if I weren't so scared). But here's the thing: I love to think that it works. And even if it doesn't look like it's true, sometimes I think it should. As soon as someone says to me "how do you think I should know if this is real"? Yeah, that's how I think it should work. But if you are right about everything it shouldn't feel like you are the one saying it.

You said it would sound a bit like it's "unnatural" for the world to react like we've already seen it. How do you feel about this being the case?

I'm happy with what
