It was New Year’s Day and I had promised my boyfriend we would spend it together, despite all of the impending chaos of the holiday. We arrived at our destination, a cozy restaurant that overlooked a lake, and had already ordered our food when I made a comment about the amount of time it was taking for it to arrive. He began to joke about how hungry he was, and how if I didn’t watch out he might eat my food as well. I started to laugh and jokingly told him not to even think about it. 

I was completely caught off guard when he then reached across the table and began to tickle me. We both erupted into laughter and we continued to giggle until our food arrived. As we ate, we recounted old memories from the previous year, and reminisced about all the funny moments we shared. 

The lunch left me with a beautiful feeling of joy and connection; it was then that I realized that laughter was truly the best form of communication. We left that afternoon feeling elated and connected, looking forward to sharing many more laughs in the upcoming year.
