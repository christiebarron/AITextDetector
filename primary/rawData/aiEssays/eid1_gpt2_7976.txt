Computers have many effects on people. In the case of digital devices, one of them can take the place of information security. Computer security requires strong, reliable computers that don't require the use of an individual's personal computer. The best kind of hardware or software doesn't require the ability for customers to put the data in their accounts, or to trust a software program or software service that makes the data accessible without a user's permission.

This isn't a new phenomenon, but that doesn't mean we don't have to think about this when assessing digital security and the consequences of our choices. In 2011, John Weiler, a security researcher who specializes in cybersecurity at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, published his survey on why security has taken on so much importance. He found that even among U.S. citizens, more than half were against digital attacks on the personal computer -- and half called for additional measures to protect customers' data. It's an age where some technology companies are putting the needs of their customers at the front of their minds: Microsoft, Facebook, Apple and YouTube rely on mobile users' smartphone and tablets. The only downside is that this is often not the case: Internet service providers like Google, Facebook and Apple still may require users to sign in and use an account in order to log on, too. And even though the companies can't tell by logging in that you're a victim of attacks, they are sometimes trying to make sure that you are a victim.
