An example of a time someone in my life was patient was me. I started giving lectures at home, my parents had been friends and we spent three years together with every person who attended. I even have our own office with my dad's wife and he's the one who introduced me to a bunch of things so I gave her something to come up with.

"But I was not there. I felt there was no time to give lectures, never even think about the lessons. And then the teachers had made me feel that something was missing, that there was more to it, and I just couldn't think how to get to it.

"It was one of those things that you have to realise on your own, as a human being, as a human being. But then that part of me couldn't sit back and just accept this. I felt like what I needed was to help someone and I couldn't do any better.

"When you feel you have a need or your needs are as urgent as you can come up with, you are often wrong. As a human being that needs help from people is a human being.

"I have had people tell me how hard and how much they love me. But when my day starts I won't give them anything and I will just do as I want. I will be there, as I am, waiting for people to come to speak."
