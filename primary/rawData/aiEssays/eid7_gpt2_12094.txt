An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I discovered that I was the mother of three. I started by putting the name on the envelope and I started asking if he was having an abortion. His first response was no. I told him I did not want one in his life. He then replied that I was not interested. A few moments later I wrote on my Facebook page:

My message to all those who choose not to end a pregnancy is that you shouldn't make someone's life impossible by giving them an abortion. Even for someone whose life is in danger, the prospect of being stuck at a life-threatening situation could be scarylooking. Some people might say abortion does not help. They may not agree that abortion makes people less human, less capable of caring for themselves, or that it saves the world from disaster. It would certainly be a mistake to make someone's life impossible by forcing them to give the life they believe in. Even for those who don't fully understand why abortion is so bad there can still be a lot that can go wrong for those who find it difficult. Don't be afraid to talk about what should have been easy decisions for you and how to make things like this less hard.
