I remember one time I was waiting in line at the store and the person in front of me was having trouble with their payment. They were trying to use cash and it seemed like the clerk might not be able to accept it. It was taking a really long time and I could feel myself getting impatient and frustrated.

But then I remembered how much patience I needed when I was a new traveler, so I made myself stay quiet and be patient. I watched the clerk and customer work through the issue, and sure enough they were eventually able to get it sorted out. I felt proud of myself for having been so patient. Even though it took a little longer than I would have liked, I knew it was important to allow them their time and space to figure out the issue without rushing them.
