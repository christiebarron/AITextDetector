The features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead" play a large role in the cyclist's story. The dark damp alley in the city gives the cyclist a sense of foreboding even before the story starts. The fact that it is dark and dank suggests that bad things can happen in such places. This adds to the tension and suspense of the story. 

The road also has characteristics that influence the cyclist. The dirt and potholes make for a difficult ride and the cyclist has to adjust their speed steadily in order to get through the course. This difficulty causes the cyclist to remain focused on their ride in order to make it to the end, which helps to keep the story moving as the cyclist works to make it through the alley.

The danger of the setting is also highlighted by the presence of an unknown man lurking in the shadows. This creates a sense of danger and gives the cyclist the knowledge that their ride may have an untold danger waiting for them. This danger adds to the suspense of the story and the cyclist's actions become based on the fear of the unknown. 

Overall, the features of the setting in "Rough Road Ahead" are integral to the cyclist's story. The dark alley provides a tense atmosphere, the potholes and dirt add a difficulty to the cyclist's journey, and the presence of a lurking stranger increases the feeling of danger. By conveying these elements, Joe Kurmaski
