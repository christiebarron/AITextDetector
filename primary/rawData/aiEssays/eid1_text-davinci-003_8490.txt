There was a time when I had to wait a long time to receive something important. I was understandably nervous and anxious, and I really wanted the item as soon as possible. Despite my anxiousness, I could sense that rushing the process would only make it take longer.

So, I took a deep breath and decided to be patient. I thought of things I could do in the meantime to take my mind off of the waiting, such as reading a book, taking a walk, or catching up on some TV shows that I had missed. I also continually reminded myself that I had no control over the situation and that there was nothing really I could do except be patient.

Eventually, after what seemed like an eternity, my order arrived in the mail. In the end, I was glad I was patient. Things could have been much worse had I tried to rush the process.
