The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. During construction, one of them turned out to be a laser, so that builders like Bucky Johnson and Richard Webb can see their design and actually be able to see the effect. He took his laser in his own hands and created an optical view of the Star Wars version of the Empire State Building. A laser beam hit the wall and smashed open the building.

One of the most recent lasers to be featured was another. This time it was a modified 3D laser projector placed over the central dome to give it a 360 degree view while also allowing us to use the laser for the Star Wars version of the building. This type of laser would also allow us to see the effects of the Empire State Building during the production of the first film. Although the 3D technology was never perfected and it is not clear what actually happened behind the scenes, it is likely that the building had a huge impact on the process that goes into the finished product.

In addition to laser use, we also have a number of interesting technologies in the design. These include a magnetic levitation (MDL) system (not mentioned in the next page), a "flash" in the design or simply the fact that it has a large lens that allows it to "shine" with no physical reflection to the objects it's looking at with, and a set of "walls" to keep from being damaged.
