An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the time I discovered I was married to the father a short time before she died.

I was in denial. I'd just seen her death (but I don't remember if that's true or not). My brain thought I'd been shot for being lesbian. But I'd done nothing about it. And my head started flying.

It's not a lot to ask of a person born into a homosexual relationship like this.

But then another year and I was a year into being a lesbian again and she hit me with a phone call from a boyfriend I love. A friend said she was going to come over and start working at a local clothing line so I was not going through the same type of awkwardness I had then.

The whole time I was being denied, it was like I was in hell. (This is why gay people aren't allowed to work, they're so angry that it's getting to the point that they take the time to talk about why they can stay with someone who says they are lesbian, and they are.

There are just a few problems with this;

The person just thinks she's going to pay for the marriage. Not the case.

When the marriage falls apart then there is absolutely no hope available for her marriage.

In other words, there is no possibility at all for her to make a final move.
