One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I tried this recipe. It became a one off when I was in college. I was a super lucky person. Not every new cook I tried has done anything of that character type like this. It worked out as I had a very good time. This was my recipe for a party-friendly summer-summer and a quick one time visit the website and check out my recipe for a "Christmas Tree" cake from The Kitchen Appliance.


Enjoy!
