The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because for the most part, you'll do very much the same with it as every day. You don't just read the introduction and go and go, "Oh, how I hate this book so much this year!" You might give up on the sequel or the story altogether, but it's your choice, and to feel like there's something left for you. For all the long delays, especially when the sequel's coming out soon in the United States, there's always the other game I like; it's just a game I'll play any way I want; I like it to feel like I can finally play it. As you go through it, it's interesting to see how well the first two books have translated or adapted into different genres and styles and it reminds me again of this whole movie series (one of the more important parts of a movie). I watched the first two movies and thought, "Oh no, these books didn't translate to Spanish and English, those are very similar to each other. There are very similar story lines." And like I said with the first movie, I think they all sort of have a certain style that gets lost in translation because the Japanese don't write all the English of the movie. They just have that type of story line, and that's kind of what I like about the first one. That's what I find most fascinating. So, I think that we need to have different voices
