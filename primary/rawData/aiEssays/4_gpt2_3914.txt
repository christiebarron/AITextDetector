The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because of how much effort it takes to put together this complex and beautiful narrative. It's such a joy to read it.

This is why I am so thrilled that I'm getting this book (if you have ever seen it before, check out my review here ).

It is an engaging novel about a very good boy and a very happy family, which is why I love how this book opens with the two women in the home doing the same magic on top of each other.

As well as being fun to read, the book is an exercise in personalization, storytelling style. The characters' stories end in stories that are not their own; rather they do a combination of stories, like how, at a meeting, when, after the kids are out, they fall into the kitchen and the kids can talk to one another, and the kids can start to figure out how one of them is doing. You are not allowed to tell this story in a way that would leave you unable or offended by the story-to-be, but this book actually makes this story more challenging to tell so I am happy to hear that it has finally been published.

It also does very well with different types of art work, and I think that's why I am not quite sure how I want to describe it. The story is very detailed, with each detail in this book I feel I have a lot more of.
