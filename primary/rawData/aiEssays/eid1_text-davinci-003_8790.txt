I remember the first time I met my partner. They were visiting some friends of mine, and I couldn't help but notice how much they laughed. I could tell right away that they were very easy-going and fun-loving, and I knew that I wanted to get to know them better.

We started talking, and it didn't take long for us to feel comfortable with each other. As we talked, the conversation started to get more and more animated, with plenty of jokes and plenty of laughter. We were talking about one of our mutual interests when they joked about it, and that set us off into a laughing fit. We couldn't seem to stop; the laughter just kept coming! 

Our laughter created an instant connection between us. We even finished each other's sentences as we laughed, and it felt like we'd been best friends for years. It was like we'd found a shortcut to understanding each other - we'd already laughed together!

That laughter ended up being one of the reasons we decided to start a relationship. Whenever we got together, laughter was always a part of our conversations. We would always end up in fits of laughter no matter what the topic of conversation was, or even if there wasn't a topic! To this day, laughter is one of the things that binds us together, and I wouldn't have it any other way.
