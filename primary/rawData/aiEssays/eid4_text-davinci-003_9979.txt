The author ends the poem with these lines to represent the cycle of life, and the idea that nothing ever stays the same. The winter brings death and hibernation, and the spring brings forth new life and growth. The poem ends with this hope that, like the hibiscus flower, the narrator of the poem will overcome and persevere. The narrator will take the test again in the spring, as if to start anew.
