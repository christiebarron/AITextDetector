The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' by James Blake and the book 'A Song of Ice and Fire' by Jonathan Swift has been praised by some of Swift's fans and received a lot of negative feedback.

Fans said it was difficult to write, and many of them were critical of Swift's decision not to release her latest album, which was due out January 18. But some also thought it had been a great thing for Swift "to put out two new works right after making last year's music," according to one fan.

"It's so cool, really, to bring back these two people and show them what you're saying," said others. "People are so glad to have us work with her because we know she's not the type of music critic we want to see at all," added another.
