The building of the Empire State Building presented many unique challenges and opportunities. One such challenge was allowing dirigibles, or airships, to dock at the very top of the building. This dream was first proposed by the developer of the building, but was quickly met with many obstacles. 

The main problem was the wind. Wind can be unpredictable and strong at high altitudes, making it difficult to bring the vessels to a safe stop. The mooring mast had to be tall enough so that dirigibles could moor securely without worrying about getting blown off course. The 80-foot mast that was needed was no small feat. In order to adhere to New York City's building codes, the mast needed to be fire-proofed and built out of rust-resistant materials like aluminum.

Due to the weight of the mooring mast, the additional layers of metal and other features, engineering challenges emerged. The mast needed to be carefully crafted to ensure that it was strong enough to withstand the weight and movements from large dirigibles over long periods of time yet also remain structurally sound. A special connection between the mast and the building would also have to be developed in order for the mast to remain safely attached to the building. 

The other concern was getting the approvable from the US government. While the developers had the Capital to undertake such a venture, they would need permission from the government to make such a significant alteration from the original construction
