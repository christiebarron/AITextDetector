The ending of the poem is meant to invoke a sense of hope and possibility that the protagonist will overcome the challenges presented in their school life. The imagery of the winter hibiscus (which is usually a summer bloomer) is a metaphor for their perseverance and resilience in the face of difficulty. Additionally, the imagery of the geese returning, the snow melting, and the hibiscus budding is meant to symbolize the idea that no matter how dark and bleak things may seem in the dark winter months, there is always a chance for rebirth and renewal once Spring returns.
