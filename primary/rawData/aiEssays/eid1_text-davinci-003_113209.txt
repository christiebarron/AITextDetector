Dear Editor,

I write this letter to share my opinion on the effects computers have on people, and to persuade your readers to agree with me.

Today, computers are integral components of modern society. They help people of all ages to stay connected, communicate, access information, and more. There is no doubt that computers are invaluable resources, both at home and in the workplace.

However, some potential negative effects of computer use must not be overlooked. For instance, frequent computer use can cause physical health issues, such as headaches, neck and arm strain, and fatigue. Studies have also shown that prolonged exposure to computer screens can cause eye strain and vision loss.

Moreover, excessive computer use can lead to digital addiction. This is particularly true among young people, who may become isolated from loved ones, neglect their studies, and experience severe mental health problems such as depression. 

To prevent these negative effects, it is important to use computers in moderation and in a balanced way, taking regular breaks from computer work and engaging in other activities such as physical exercise. 

I hope your readers find this information to be useful. Thank you for your time and consideration. 

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
