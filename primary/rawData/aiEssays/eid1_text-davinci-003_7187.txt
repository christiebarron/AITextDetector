The rough terrain in the story “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski affects the cyclist in many ways. The road was riddled with small stones, large rocks, and dirt, making it difficult for the cyclist to ride. The rider had to be constantly looking ahead for obstacles, and dodging them as quickly as possible in order to make any progress on the road. The steep inclines and declines meant that the cyclist had to expend extra energy to reach the top, especially when dealing with the larger rocks and stones. 

The changing weather also had an impact on the cyclist's ride. The wet and muddy roads made it even harder for the cyclist to make any progress. The muddy conditions also increase the risk of crashing if taken too fast. The hot weather also made it harder for the cyclist to stay hydrated and motivated. 

Overall, the features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead” provide a challenge to the cyclist, making it a difficult journey. The cyclist's perseverance, however, is admired throughout the story as he faced and overcame the difficult terrain. The weather conditions and the physical terrain provide an interesting setting for this story, allowing for an entertaining and encouraging story.
