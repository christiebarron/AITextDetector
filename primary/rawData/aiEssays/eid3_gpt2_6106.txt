Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

It covers all lanes of traffic, including cross schema, parking lanes, lane width (per car-lane in general), lane and turn lanes, and any other sections such as cross, curbside, side alleyways and other types of traffic. Most zones are also designed with the intention of being used for pedestrian access.

Rough Road Ahead

A zone will be defined by the location and conditions of the road, including whether there are any cross markings, markings in the corners or curves, or any markings so constructed as to appear to be "unmarked" or marked "undmarked" within the existing road. This zone may apply any colour, including red or green, if it is clearly marked and, if marked, does not appear to be any of those coloured features.
