I recently had an experience in which I was able to practice being patient. I took a week long road trip with my family to a beach resort. We had packed the car, and all of us were excited for the long drive ahead. 

However, I soon realized that we had grossly miscalculated the time that it would take to get to our destination. What we thought would take four hours ended up needing six hours. Not only that, but traffic was sticking us in bumper-to-bumper gridlock for what seemed like eternity. 

The situation was quickly getting tense and I could sense impatience building between my family members. But I realized that if I made a big commotion about how long the drive was taking it would just make the situation worse. I took deep breaths, worked on my laptop, or randomly talked to everyone to divert their focus from the reality of the frustrating situation. 

By doing this, I was able to stay patient, even though I could feel my own impatience from time to time. Eventually, we made it to our destination and my family had a great time on vacation. Itâ€™s moments like this one that have taught me the importance of being patient.
