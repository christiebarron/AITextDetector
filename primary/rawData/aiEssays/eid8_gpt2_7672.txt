One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I did this and I remember, I said to my mom and dad that i wasn't going to be like this and you know I never wanted to be the guy at your party. I did it because I really cared about you so i knew that it would be ok. This is why I love women, because women are very important. Don't let the status quo define you as someone not because of what you looked more like or what you wore, whatever gender you come from. Don't be who you are or what you dress based on what you think. Don't be your own bitch to her. Don't let her get jealous of you. We are the best that we can be. Don't be afraid of doing what you feel needs being done for. We understand how much of something you do isn't as important as how you do it. We are your slaves and can do with what we choose. You do our jobs while we do yours. If you want to learn, be there for us. We will be there for you.
