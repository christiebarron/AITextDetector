The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho is meant to convey the idea of perseverance and resiliency in the face of adversity. Told from the perspective of a young woman enduring winter amidst the harshness of poverty, the story provides an important lesson: even when things seem bleak, there is still hope for a brighter future. The protagonist begins by believing that she is doomed to fail, that this winter will bring no end, and that her problems are too great to overcome. However, the ending of the story provides a glimmer of hope, that if she finds a way to endure and persevere, then she can eventually reach a better outcome. The ending of the story also highlights the beauty of nature, and how the return of warmer weather and the start of a new season can bring with it a sense of renewal and optimism.
