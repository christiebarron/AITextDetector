An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was working on a game called "Mystic Realms." I was in the middle of the project, but I was working on about a hundred projects and they were really in need of funding, and I could only get them done because it was a very busy time period (you can also do things like that, but these are the things he spent his life doing): I'd be doing work for myself and not for the project, so there would be no support. But everyone would come up to me and say, "Oh, no, but that project is going well, but you may see me working on it next week or so." I was very interested in working in that situation. It did seem funny that the guys in a group who worked on other projects (I'd be really fascinated by them, because there would be guys who were doing a lot of things with money from that.) So I started to go to work on that new thing. It was sort of an early version of "Halo: Combat Evolved," which started out being a pretty fun game, I imagine, that you could do some combat like that, but now you can do it as a standalone experience in your own game. So instead of playing as an AI character in a first person shooter (which was still in development, but was much more interesting), you could play as someone who has been in combat for longer than half the game,
