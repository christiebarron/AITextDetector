Computers have many effects on people. They are part of our social structure as well as our health. One is how we are raised and our education is structured, how we act and how we perform. Our education is our social space and our economy is our economic economy. Our work culture in society can be both hard and difficult for a lot of people and we can learn a lot about how people operate and how people think.

We also need to think about how we deal with some of these things in the context of what the next generation of leaders will lead. How they will make progress as society turns forward and what role we will play in its progress, it will be vital that we make it work for us, both for our kids and for our future generation as well.
