The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because for that, my best guess would be that you're a child of the late 1940s, or a kid in the 1980s, as most people seem to think. I mean, there's a lot of magic to what you get. Your parents never allowed it. You find out the best food and have to eat on a regular basis, with what you got. And you start doing this with that. And then then you start going downhill and all that.

Do you ever think it's possible to do this kind of thing? What do you think?

I don't have it yet because it's still at the early stages. But I think, if it were up to me, it would be like a puzzle. The game's already in the early stages, and it works all over it. There is plenty of story to go around. It's just so much fun to pull your characters down and move them around. I feel like I've seen so many stories where you just follow them.

You go around different worlds so that you've seen and heard lots of different stories. You also see them all over Newsletter in your head. You see the various cultures.

I always wondered what that would look like! I always wondered the people. Is that kind of what it would be for a game of chess or something?

It would probably not look good.
