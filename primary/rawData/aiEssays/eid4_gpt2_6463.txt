The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because the other one will have to be reread, but I was hoping it would take all the other two books down in order. I was hoping for a different story so hopefully I just went with the one they're doing now. Also I'm not a huge fan of the other characters, but I'm glad they are back as I'm sure many of you will be.

Also. First off, my first love for this book is the title. I am not a fan of any of the other books on this list because they have a title that really needs to be made up. It's a beautiful, moving and inspiring book. (Also, I do like the end. I feel like I should have liked it. Maybe some things had to change.) The book ends with you trying to find a way to save a dog from going all the way up Mount Everest. It was nice to have the characters back in the story. As I was saying, this is quite long. If I had to pick an author, it would be the one I'd pick. I also have no real problem with the way in which the stories are put together. I have read many other well written authors and this one is a treat to read if you like to read on your own, or as a side story. That being said I feel my love for this book a lot for it being an original story.

A quick note
