Some believe that it is necessary to censor certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, to create a “comfortable” atmosphere for all patrons of the library. However, censoring certain materials can lead to many unfortunate consequences.

First and foremost, censorhip stifles free speech and expression. By removing materials from the shelves that someone finds offensive, library patrons are denied the right to access a full range of information. This denies them of their right to access literature, movies, music, and magazines that could be used to educate themselves on a particular topic, seek out new perspectives, or simply entertain themselves. 

Censorship can also have an adverse effect on creativity. When certain materials are censored, it can lead to the public misunderstanding certain key messages that an authors or filmmakers were trying to convey. This can lead to fewer artists knowing what they are able to get away with when creating their works. 

Finally, censorship can lead to an unhealthy form of “groupthink”. When certain materials are censored, it could lead to the public believing that material that is not censored is the “acceptable” viewpoint, and any other viewpoint is wrong. This can lead to a decrease in critical thinking and close-mindedness.
