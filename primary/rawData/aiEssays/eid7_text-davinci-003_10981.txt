I remember when I first started working, I was eager to impress my new co-workers. I would put in extra hours and do whatever it took to get the job done quickly and accurately. 

I soon learned that a big part of the job is being patient and learning the process. There's a procedure to everything, and I had to take the time to familiarize myself with the protocols.

One day I was tasked with a large project that was due very soon. Naturally, I was a bit panicked about the task and wanted to get it done as quickly as possible. But I had to remember to remain calm and take the time to go through each step accurately as I had been taught.

I knew that rushing would only lead to mistakes and delays, so instead of trying to rush through the task, I forced myself to take my time and go over the process and the details with great care and patience.

It felt like it took forever, but eventually I was able to get the task done correctly and on time. It was a great feeling of satisfaction for me and my co-workers assured me that I had done a great job. Ever since then, Iâ€™ve been instilled with a lesson of being patient and taking the time to do the job right.
