Computers have many effects on people. We may all be aware that we've made mistakes in computing history and have gotten into some more legal and financial situations. But most people would not dream of a day where our systems can't fix every single problem that we put in place. It took a lot of people to make things safer than they are now. While all we can do, we all have a right to be afraid of our computers.

There are many websites dedicated to understanding the subject of our work, but ultimately we only want to be as diligent as humans is willing to be, because we believe in our work. But there are a lot going on when the computer has completely lost all meaning, and when some parts of our life become so overwhelmed that our ability to perform our tasks has drastically diminished.

We would like to ask you, perhaps, how can we have a more informed and more productive world to live in?
