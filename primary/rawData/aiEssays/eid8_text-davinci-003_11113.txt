I remember when I first met my now-husband. We had just finished a double date with our best friends and became separated from the group. We decided to get a late night snack and started exploring a nearby neighborhood.

We stumbled across a store with a unique looking pinball machine and decided to give it a try. We were both terrible at playing, but our laughter made the game twice as fun. Our attempts to control the pins and flashing arrows only resulted in more inability to control the situation. Soon, we were rolling on the ground in laughter, not caring who saw us.

That night I knew I would marry this amazing man. He made me laugh more than anyone else ever has. We had an undeniable bond that had been sealed by our laughter that night. We are still laughing together after all these years together.
