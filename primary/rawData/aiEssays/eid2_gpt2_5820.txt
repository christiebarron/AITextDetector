I believe that censorship of materials in libraries and research facilities could lead to a decrease in scholarly performance. However, in response to these findings we would encourage organizations, both public and private, to promote the safe dissemination of materials in public libraries around the world:

1.) Free library staff should be able to share their personal information without fear of being scammed and harassed; 2.) All authors and students should be informed if they are to receive an email with a personal statement or link from the library; and 3.) If possible, make sure to ask any individual or group that might be interested in receiving the email to inform them of our intent.

On October 21nd 2011, the Internet Archive officially launched the online free online resource library, freephics.org. This web site has been designed in part to help the Library of Congress and the general public to understand and use free electronic materials, which are generally free.
