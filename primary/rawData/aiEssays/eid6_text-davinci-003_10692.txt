The Empire State Building was home to the world's first commercial airship mooring mast, making it an integral part of the transportation industry at the time. The engineering feat was achieved despite the numerous obstacles the construction crew had to face. From designing dedicated machinery to the need for public consensus, the road to a successful mast was an arduous journey.

The first challenge was the design of the mast itself. It was necessary to incorporate a secure anchor feature at the top of the building that would facilitate safe attachment of dirigibles. In addition, the mooring mast had to be long enough to accommodate the entire airship length. As a result, plans were made for a mast nearly 200 feet long that extended through the 85th floor of the building.

The second obstacle was that of public opinion. While airships seemed like the wave of the future, public acceptance was by no means a given. The construction of the mast would require the building to be closed for renovation, potentially hurtling the business interests of the entire building and its tenants. To ensure a successful mooring mast, public opinion had to be addressed head on with groundbreaking promotional campaigns and educational sessions on the proposed new mode of transport.

The third obstacle was the mooring equipment itself. While the mooring mast was design to break free of the airship should the craft fail, this difficult engineering feat proved to be just as tricky. It took every bit of the engineering
