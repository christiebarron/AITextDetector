 

I was out with my best friend for an evening walk. We had been close since elementary school and our friendship had stood the test of time. 

As we strolled through the park, she pointed out a small dog running in the field, and both of us erupted into laughter. It wasn't just the sight of the little pup that made us laugh—it was the thought of how cute and silly he looked as he chased after a squirrel. 

I don't know how long we stood there, literally doubled over with laughter, but it felt like a special moment between us. It wasn't about the jokes we were telling each other or the funny stories we were exchanging—it was just a time for us to trust and laugh with one another. 

That moment of laughter brought us closer together and reminded me of why our friendship has been strong for so long—it brings us joy and comfort. To this day, I'll never forget the moment we shared together, exploding with laughter in the middle of the park.
