The idea of allowing dirigible airships to dock at the Empire State Building was a novel idea which presented a myriad of obstacles to builders. Although the main tower had originally been constructed with a vertical fin of protruding steel and the necessary infrastructure already in place, the possibility of accommodating a docking mast for a dirigible was still far from a reality. 

The first major obstacle faced was the fact that the cage of steel surrounding the upper observation deck was too light to serve an effective air mooring station for a mooring mast. In order to prevent the mast from swinging wildly and overturning with the ship as it attempted to dock, this would have to be rectified. According to 'The Mooring Mast' by Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted, the engineers had to construct an array of heavy guy-wires and girders linking the structure to the building, providing the necessary stability for a stable mooring.

Another obstacle was the risk of fire, as these airships ran on huge amounts of combustible hydrogen gas. To prevent any fires, the engineers had to take measures that would provide the surrounding area with a necessary buffer zone between the ships and the building, protecting the general public from any mishaps. This included surrounding the mooring mast with a water curtain, which would also prevent the hydrogen gases from igniting.

The most difficult aspect of allowing dirigibles to dock was making sure the mast could withstand the
