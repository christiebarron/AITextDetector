The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first was an engineering obstacle, at the bottom of which was a wooden plank. Since builders must attach more walls and more height to their towers, the bridge could be opened and closed to allow for movement. The second obstacle was a high-velocity rock that was buried under the bridge, which the builders had yet to see. At some point, even though the building could be closed, the building designers decided that it was too dangerous as it lay low in the open, so they placed more rocks and cement below the bridge. In late 2013, the building was finally demolished, allowing the bridge to remain standing at a height of 25 feet.
