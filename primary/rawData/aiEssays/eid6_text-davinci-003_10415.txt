The Empire State Building presented a unique challenge to architects attempting to build a docking station for dirigibles. The concept of docking airships to a skyscraper was revolutionary when the Empire State Building was completed in 1931, and the builders had to overcome a number of obstacles in order to make it a reality.

The first challenge the architects faced was the actual structure of the building itself. The shape of the Empire State Building was not conducive to docking an airship, as the spire and its leading edge made it difficult for an airship to approach. To solve this, the builders designed a mooring system which was capable of accommodating the large airships. This mooring system, known as the 'Mooring Mast', was created by suspending a 200-foot tall mast from the 102nd floor observation deck. The mooring mast was capable of securing dirigibles even in high winds, and allowed them to be easily tied off and secured.

The designers of the building also had to consider various safety issues when creating the mooring mast. Because of the height of the mooring mast, its cables had to be made of a material very resistant to corrosion and breakage. Additionally, the Empire State Building included a network of strong cables which connected the mast to the building in order to ensure its stability in case of a docking accident.

In addition to the challenges faced by the builders of the Empire State Building, there were logistical obstacles
