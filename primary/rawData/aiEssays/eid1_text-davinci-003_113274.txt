Dear Editor,

As many of us have certainly noticed, computers have become an integral part of our lives in recent years. Although they can provide immense advantages, I'm starting to suspect that the reliance on computers in this age of technology has not been entirely beneficial.

I am of the opinion that computers can have both positive and negative effects on people. On the one hand, they are very useful for those who want to learn new skills and knowledge or to work more efficiently. For instance, computer programming allows students to learn programming languages and algorithms faster. In addition, computers make it easier to stay in touch with people because of the internet and social media.

On the other hand, I think that there can be detrimental side effects of computers and the internet. Internet addiction is real, and those addicted to computers can suffer from health issues such as poor eyesight, headaches, neck and back pain, and insomnia. Too much time spent in front of a computer can also lead to weight gain and social isolation.

In conclusion, I believe that computers are a great tool if used correctly and in moderation. By understanding and recognizing the potential negative effects of technology, we can all benefit by being mindful of our computer usage and managing our time accordingly.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
