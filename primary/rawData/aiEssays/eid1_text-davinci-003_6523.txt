Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. With the surge in technology over the past few years, computers have become an integral part of our day-to-day lives. Although they can be a great asset, many people are concerned about the potential risks to our physical and mental health.

Early research into the effects of computers on the human body suggests that extended use of computers can cause physical health problems such as eye strain, neck pain, and headaches. Moreover, extended sitting can increase your risk of metabolic diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease.

Computers can also have a negative effect on mental health. Studies have shown that too much time on the computer can lead to feelings of isolation, stress, and depression. The internet can be a great source of information and entertainment but it can also expose us to information overload and the dangers of online gaming and social media addiction.

In conclusion, computers are a great asset to our lives, however, we need to be wary of the potential risks associated with their prolonged use. We need to ensure that we take regular breaks from the computer to allow our bodies and minds to rest and relax.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
