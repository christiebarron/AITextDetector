Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho ends with this line to offer a hopeful perspective for the reader. The line suggests that despite any obstacles that may arise from taking the test (i.e the snow and geese coming back), the narrator is still determined to take the test again in the spring when the upcoming challenges have been overcome. It serves as an uplifting reminder that no matter how overwhelming life may seem, if the narrator can get through the winter and the snow melts and the geese come back, they will still have the opportunity to take the test again in the spring. Additionally, the phrase "hibiscus is budding" serves to symbolize growth in the narrator's life, further embodying the idea of hope and renewal.
