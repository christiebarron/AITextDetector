The Empire State Building has been an iconic symbol of architecture and innovation since its erection in 1931. Aside from its impressive stature, the building also carries with it a unique historical connection to dirigibles, or airships. In 1931, there was an intent to construct a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building, allowing dirigibles to attach and dock on the mast in order to load and unload passengers and cargo. Although this concept had great potential, it soon became evident that there were a variety of obstacles which would prevent the mooring mast’s success.

The most pervasive obstacle faced by the builders of the mooring mast was the lack of knowledge on how exactly an airship would dock with a building. This uncertainty was largely due to the fact that the concept of attaching large airships to stationary objects was relatively new, and there was a lack of prior research and experiments to provide any sort of guidance. With no definite answer on how to successfully moor a dirigible to a building, it became necessary for the engineers to further explore designs and create a tangible mast which could support a dirigible’s weight and size.

The second obstacle which must be dealt with was the added wind resistance created by the 500-foot mast, as it could potentially affect the stability of the dirigible while attempting to dock. The mast was also designed to rotate in order to counteract the force of the wind, but there were serious concerns about whether
