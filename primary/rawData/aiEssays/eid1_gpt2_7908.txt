Computers have many effects on people. The more people in their family or college that live at the same time, the more likely that the difference between what the computer thinks and what actually happens actually happens to their health. According to the National Institutes of Health, there are over 9,000 genetic variants that appear in about 25 million people with autism. There are over 2,500 genetic variants that appear in 12,000 people with Tourette syndrome, or Down syndrome. And there are 1,000 genetic variants that cause menopause. And there are about 5,000 genetic variants that cause Alzheimer's disease and other things that can give rise to any variety of disease, from arthritis to diabetes mellitus to cancer. So if we look at a single gene out there, that is one of the most easily associated traits with autism among people with Tourette syndrome. There is some evidence of that. We know that some people who have Tourette syndrome are at higher risk for developing Alzheimer's disease. Our research is starting a bit after it, we're getting a little bit more of a handle on it. In fact, as that gluten sensitivity gene comes up around 6,000 times in human genome samples, we are using it to know if there are more genes for autism, and we need to figure out what the role it may have on different kinds of autism. And because it's in our data so early, our results can be pretty specific. But because there's a lot more data,
