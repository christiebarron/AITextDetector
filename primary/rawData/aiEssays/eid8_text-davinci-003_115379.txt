I was out with my friends at a party, and I was feeling down because of a disagreement I had with my parents. We were all having a good time, when suddenly my friend came up to me and started making strange noises and faces. I was so shocked that I couldn't help but burst into laughter. Her silly antics completely changed my mood and all the terrible thoughts I had were forgotten.

My friends joined in, and soon enough the whole room was in hysterics. Even though it was completely random and there was no particular joke, we had a great time just laughing at each other.

After that, our spirits were higher and we were all more relaxed and happier than before. I realized then how important laughter is in a relationship, and I was grateful that my friends were there to lift my spirits. In that moment, I felt that laughter was the shortest distance between us.
