The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' revolves around the love affair between the two young women. However, in the movie, the friendship doesn't have a foundation in romance but in reality an open relationship between two women in common. According to the film, a young woman has "no need but to know that her love for him is unconditional and she takes pleasure in his every movement", and that's "something that comes naturally to her."
