I remember when I was in elementary school, my best friend and I were neighbors and practically inseparable, so naturally we hung out almost daily. We would play tag, pretend to be spies, make art projects with items from the recycling bin, and tell jokes to one another. Whenever we met up we would make each other laugh hysterically and just laugh and laugh until our sides hurt. 

One really memorable moment was during summer break when my best friend invited me over to her pool. We were running around the backyard, taking turns to dive in the pool, when she stood up on the deck and said “Let me tell you a joke!” We stopped immediately and watched as she started telling us this extended joke about a bee and a pineapple that made absolutely no sense whatsoever. We didn't understand a single word she said but we laughed and laughed and laughed until we had tears in our eyes and our stomachs were aching with laughter. 

It was possibly the funniest thing I'd ever heard and it's one of my favorite memories of childhood. We were laughing so hard that we couldn't even finish the joke - we just kept repeating parts of the joke to each other and laughing until the sun had gone down. It was a beautiful moment of friendship and laughter that I'll never forget.
