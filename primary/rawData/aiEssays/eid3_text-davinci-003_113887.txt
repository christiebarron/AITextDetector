In Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead," the setting plays a huge role in affecting the cyclist. Through each mile, the cyclist is faced with constantly changing and sometimes treacherous terrain.

The cyclist is initially on a county road. Here, the cyclist has to makes sure to dodge animals, large potholes, and muddy spots. What's more, the cyclists must deal with drivers going way too fast and dangerously passing. This part of the journey acts as an obstacle course to the cyclist.

Soon enough, the cyclist is on single-track trails. Here, he's faced with roots, hills, and sharp curves. The hilly single-track trails eventually become rocky with ledges and steep climbs. The cyclist must carefully maneuver each obstacle with precision and finesse. If he's unable to adapt to the changing terrain, he can easily get injured or crash. 

Lastly, the cyclist must take on an old railroad grade. At this step, he's forced to tackle thick bramble bushes and other overgrown plants. Here, the cyclist has to carefully make his way around the pitfalls and undergrowth before his fall.

Ultimately, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in immense ways. By strategically overcoming each obstacle, the cyclist is pushed to his limits and pushes his bike to its full potential.
