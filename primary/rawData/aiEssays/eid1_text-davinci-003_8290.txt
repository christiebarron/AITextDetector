The builders of the Empire State Building faced immense challenges in developing a safe and responsible approach for allowing dirigibles to dock atop the iconic skyscraper. The project entailed not only complicated construction of the mooring mast itself, but careful consideration of navigational concerns, safety precautions, and public opinion.

The mooring mast atop the Empire State Building would need to be hefty and secured into the steel frame of the building, as it would need to hold a dirigible, or airship, several stories up in the air. Issues of structural integrity, as well as weather-proofing, needed to be taken into account. Without proper guidelines, the airship would have run the risk of ripping apart the mast during the docking process, endangering both the passengers and the building itself.

Unfortunately, the actual design of the mast posed another problem. Due to the high buildings surrounding the Empire State Building, the mast could be difficult to see. This would make it hard for navigators directing airships to spot the unassuming piece of metal projecting from the heart of the building. As a result, extra navigational aids had to be added to the mast, including lighting and other visual identifiers, to make it easier for airships to detect their landing site without overshooting or veering off course. Additionally, navigation protocols had to be established and enacted to regulate the speed and distance of airships approaching the building.
