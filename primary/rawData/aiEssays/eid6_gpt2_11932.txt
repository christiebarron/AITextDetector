The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. If they could use the same gear at the end of the day as they had during the Civil War, most military and civilian contractors wouldn't pay, and with such a large budget, the new build-out cost would be expensive.

The second hurdle was building the new structure. The designers of the Colonial-style building had made the original plan to let building debris fall off the old side of the building (or from it) and build what it was to be a monument. These towers are used to represent the Civil War and were built between 1900 and 1910. However during World War II these towers were replaced by modern design features such as a raised platform, raised platforms and new stairwells in the back and sides. The construction of the new structure required an increasing number of construction projects every year and had its ups and downs.

When building a tower it needed a large piece of concrete to support the structure (think of the high bridge built into the Empire City). Some builders had to cut down on cement in order to create this structure. The concrete was considered so heavy its use in New Orleans to cause damage to the original structure necessitating a new crane. The new construction did work, however.

Since New Orleans had the upper deck and lower part of the tower, several design features were needed:

The roof roofing had to be a large square, approximately a
