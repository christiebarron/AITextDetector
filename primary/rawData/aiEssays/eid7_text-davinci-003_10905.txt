I was in my hometown, walking around and enjoying the fresh air. I found myself strolling by an area in town that was often filled with unhoused people. As I was passing, a woman stopped me and asked if I could spare any change. Now, I don't usually carry cash, so I told her I was sorry but I couldn't help her out.

She became noticeably frustrated, and I could tell she was planning to walk away. But instead of leaving, she stayed put and started to question me. She asked why I couldn't help her, was I too good to provide any assistance, did I think she wasn't worthy of help. I could feel my patience wearing thin, but I knew this woman was hurting and needed someone to talk to.I took a few deep breaths and started to calmly explain that money wasn't the only way to help. I asked if she wanted to talk, offered her some food from a nearby cafe, and suggested ways to find more long-term support. 

At first, she was hesitant to trust me but gradually she started to open up and share her story. By the end of our conversation, she was teary-eyed and thanked me for listening. I was proud of myself for being patient and using the situation as an opportunity to show kindness.
