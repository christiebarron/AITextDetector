Dear Editor,

As technology has advanced, computers have become an important part of our lives. While some argue that computers are beneficial, I am firmly of the opinion that the effects of computers on people are largely negative.

The negative effects of computers are numerous. For starters, they contribute to the increasingly sedentary lifestyle of many people nowadays. People become so hooked on technology that they spend hours and hours sitting, with no physical activity whatsoever. This lack of physical activity has caused the general health of society as a whole to deteriorate.

Moreover, computers have led to increased levels of stress in society. People who use computers on a regular basis often lead a rushed lifestyle and are often multitasking, leading to exhaustion and frustration. This leads to mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety.

The advances in technology have also led to a decrease in face-to-face social interaction. A lot of people are now interacting more with their computers or smartphones than with their actual family and friends. This has caused a decrease in meaningful relationships and an overall lack of connection in society.

I believe that people should be aware of the downsides of computers and its effects on people. It is essential to create a balance between spending time with technology and living an active, healthy life.

Sincerely,

[Name]
