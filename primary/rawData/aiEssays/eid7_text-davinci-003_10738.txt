I was in line at the grocery store, waiting to pay for my items. When I finally got to the front, the cashier told me that the store had run out of what I had planned to buy for dinner. I was feeling frustrated and wanted to leave, but then I remembered that practicing patience is important.

So instead of giving in to my feelings of annoyance, I took a few deep breaths and asked the cashier for some suggestions of alternative items I could purchase. He consulted with the store manager and, eventually, they found a suitable replacement. Even though I was disappointed, I was grateful for the patience of the store staff and was able to finish my grocery haul. 

At the end of the experience, I reminded myself that being patient is often the best way to handle difficult situations.
