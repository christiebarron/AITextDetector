The building of the Empire State Building was one of the most ambitious and luxurious undertakings in world history. Not only did it possess grand architectural features such as its steel framework and intricate Art Deco detailing, but it also intrigued the public by its inclusion of a docking station for dirigibles. This was a lofty goal as the builders had to overcome many obstacles in order to make this feature a reality.

The first obstacle was engineering-related. The dynamics of airships make them difficult to be precisely controlled, so the welcoming mast and mooring mechanism had to be carefully constructed and maintained. The mast had to be tall enough, straight enough and strong enough to be able to safely receive the airship. The mooring was also an important element as it had to be strong in order to firmly hold the huge airship, yet provide enough flexibility for its gentle landing. The cable was linked to several anchor points and pulleys to create a robust and secure mooring system.

The second obstacle faced by the builders was related to safety. As the airships would be containing explosives, precautions had to be taken to make sure the mooring mast and other areas around the building were completely safe. It was essential that the tower and mooring mast stay durable during extremely high wind speeds and powerful weather conditions. Maximum security measures were taken, such as the installation of a fenced perimeter, for the safety of passengers on the dirigibles.
