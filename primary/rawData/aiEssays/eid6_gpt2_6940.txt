The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One would have to make the airship look smaller to be able to dock. Another obstacle was cost. An estimated $10 million had been spent on new elevators and new controls in order to bring the Empire's two tallest buildings, the Empire State Building and Empire State Building 2.

More than 10 years later, it now has an estimated cost of $1 billion, which is far above the average annual average for private projects.

According to one expert, the cost to build the building — a modest 5,000 square feet — is nearly $3 million more than last year's 1,550 square feet, which was a budget that required some changes to the structure.

At least 12 other states, including New York and Virginia, have similarly tried to build high-rises or other skyscrapers, although they often end up with small, overgrown buildings that don't add much to the cost. The state is looking to a federal approach to build an Empire State Building. According to U.S. Building Industry Manager Dave A. Davis, the
