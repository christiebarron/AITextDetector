The Empire State Building was the first skyscraper to provide a place for airships to dock, an impressive feat of engineering when it first opened in 1931. At the time, airships had become a popular way to travel and even speculated to be the future of air transportation. To allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the architects had to overcome several challenges.

The first challenge was the design of the Empire State Building itself. Architects had to come up with a way to incorporate a mooring mast on top of the building, which stood more than 1250 feet tall. The mooring mast was also designed to resist strong winds at the higher altitude, as airships would dock while suspending over the city streets below. To facilitate this, the mast had to be incredibly strong, made of steel, and surrounded on all sides by a tangle of cables.

Another obstacle that had to be overcome was the fuel supply. Since airships were limited by the amount of fuel they could carry, they also had to be able to refuel while docked on the Empire State Building. This problem was solved by the installation of a pressurized hose, which allowed airships to refuel directly from the ground.

Finally, the most difficult challenge the architects faced was convincing the public that such a feat of engineering was possible, and that it provided a safe place for airships to dock. Commercial airships ended up only utilizing the Empire State Building as a
