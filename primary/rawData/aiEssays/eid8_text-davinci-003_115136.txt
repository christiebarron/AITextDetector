I had just moved to the city and had been searching for a job for weeks. I was feeling a bit down from my lack of success. One day, I decided to take a walk around the city to clear my head. After a few minutes, I spotted a street musician playing a beautiful tune. I stood for a moment and listened, and then decided to close my eyes and to just listen to the music.

A few moments later, I heard a loud snorting laugh from behind me. At first, I was startled, but then I turned around and saw an old man with a wide smile on his face. After his laughter subsided, he gestured to me and asked if I wanted to dance. I was taken aback, but before I could decline, my feet were already moving.

The old man and I continued to dance until the music ended. When the street musician started to play the tune again, he spun me around in a circle and gave me a big hug. He then told me that he was glad to have found someone to laugh with.

I thanked him for brightening up my day and continued walking with a lighter heart. As I left the street corner, I heard the old man's last words: "Keep laughing and always remember that it's the shortest distance between two people."
