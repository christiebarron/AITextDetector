I had been married to my husband for just over a year and we were still figuring out how to make marriage work. We had just moved into a new house and were feeling a little overwhelmed, but determined to make it work.

One night we were sitting on the couch, going through some serious discussions about bills and other issues. We were getting a bit frustrated with each other when my husband suddenly remembered something funny from the move. We couldn't help but start to laugh and soon were having a full blown laughing fit. I was so caught up in it I almost fell off the couch.

It felt like a moment of clarity in the midst of chaos. We realized at the same time that all of our troubles suddenly weren't so important, and that we could take some time to have a bit of fun together.

From then on, laughter has been an important part of our relationship. No matter how stressed out or angry we might be, we can always find something to laugh about and it often helps to diffuse the situation. I'm so glad we have laughter in our relationship.
