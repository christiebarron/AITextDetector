To the Editor:

Every single person should have the right to browse and read books, music, movies, and magazines of their choice. Censorship in our libraries is a growing issue that should be strongly considered. A library should be an unfiltered platform to explore and gain knowledge from all forms of information, regardless of its content. 

Many people believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies and magazines should be removed from the shelves because they might be seen as offensive or inappropriate. Additionally, they carry the risk of damaging the quality of the library, both in terms of the services it provides and the reputation of the institution. Yet, restricting the information available to the public does not prevent people from being exposed to the kind of material they find offensive. Moreover, the censorship of materials may cause a person to be deprived of important information and perspectives.

Censorship in libraries is counter-productive and antithetical to the purpose of providing access to a variety of information. People have the freedom to explore a variety of material within the library and should be left to decide what is suitable for themselves and their children. Libraries should not serve as handcuffs to their patrons but as a safe space that fosters learning, growth, and understanding. Moreover, it is the responsibility of parents and teachers to guide children to make informed decisions about accessing the materials.

Censorship of materials is a sensitive and complex issue that should be handled with caution.
