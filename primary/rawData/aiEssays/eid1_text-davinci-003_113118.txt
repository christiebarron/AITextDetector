It is no secret that computers have become an integral part of everyday life. The effects of computers on human beings are far-reaching, and the implications of technological advances are undeniable.

From a personal standpoint, computers have made it easier for individuals to access information and advance their knowledge base. Education can be improved as students can find information on any topic more quickly and be up to date on the latest news. Professional skills can be perfected with digital tools and another layer of career opportunities is open to ambitious professionals.

At the same time, computers can also have devastating consequences. For example, computers can lead to psychological issues such as addiction, anxiety, and depression as people become increasingly reliant on digital technology for basic functions. Computer addiction can also lead to physical health problems such as insomnia and poor posture. In addition, computers can also lead to an increase in cyber-bullying, which can also lead to both psychological and physical issues. 

Despite the potential drawbacks, there is no denying that computers have had a positive impact on society. By making information more accessible, computers are pushing the boundaries of knowledge and creativity. From advancing knowledge of science and technology to providing new opportunities for entertainment, computers are encouraging the growth of innovation and ideas. 

In conclusion, the effects of computers on people can be both positive and negative. While computers undoubtedly have the potential to lead to serious issues, they also have the power to promote creativity and knowledge
