Dear Editor:

Iâ€™m writing to express my opinion about the effects computers have on people.

We are in a time of technology where almost every aspect of life, from entertainment to communication, revolves around computers. There is no doubt that computers have made life much more convenient and easier for us. However, the side effects of this technology should not be ignored.

Many studies have suggested that the use of computers can lead to increased anxiety, depression and even vision problems in some cases. It is not conducive to our health to stay glued to the screens for prolonged periods of time. Moreover, the ease of online shopping and gaming can result in us overspending and losing control of our finances.

Therefore, while computers have tremendous benefits that we should all appreciate, it is important to be aware of the risks that come along with the use of this technology and take measures to avoid its negative impacts. By only visiting credible sites, taking regular breaks from the computer and limiting the time spent on the internet, we can all reap the rewards of technology without sacrificing our mental, physical and financial health.

I am sure that given the alarming implications of excessive computer use, the readers of this newspaper will agree that we all need to be extra careful with this technology.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
