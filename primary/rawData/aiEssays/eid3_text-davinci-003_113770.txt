The setting of “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski has a number of features that serve to challenge the cyclist as he makes his journey. The first feature of the setting is the terrain itself that the cyclist must traverse. It is described as difficult and full of rough obstacles, such as rocks, bumps, and hills. The difficult terrain means that the cyclist must constantly be on guard against falls and be prepared to exert more energy than he would along a flat or easy route.

The second feature of the setting is the nearby rainforest, with its thick foliage, darkness, and unfamiliar creatures that could surprise the cyclist. The darkness of the trees makes it harder for the cyclist to navigate and creates a sense of danger and mystery as he rides on. The presence of wild animals can further increase the sense of unease as the cyclist contemplates the unseen creatures around him.

The final feature of the setting is the winding road with its frequent turns and drops. This winding road is especially difficult for the cyclist as he must be constantly aware of the terrain and where the turns will take him. It also serves to build tension as the cyclist worries about making the correct turns or being unbalanced and falling over. 

Overall, the features of the setting present a number of challenges to the cyclist. The terrain is rough and filled with obstacles, the rainforest is dark and full of unknown creatures, and the winding road presents its own potential pitfalls. All
