In the short story, "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski, the cyclist encounters various obstacles as they travel along the road. The narrative focuses on the cyclist as they maneuver their way over the difficult terrain. The setting of the story is important in understanding how these physical features create a challenge for the cyclist and can even impede their progress. 

The environment of the rough road provides the first challenge. Potholes, ruts, rocks, and other terrains that are difficult to navigate are described as the road is treacherous for the cyclist. Even if the cyclist feels comfortable on their bike, these obstacles can derail them and cause injury. If a cyclist is inexperienced, these elements of the road can provide a difficult barrier, even if none is present. 

The cyclist also confronts the threat of fatigue. As they continue over the rough terrain, their energy is depleted and their strength fails. This is further exacerbated by the varying weather conditions. A sunny day will cause them to become overheated and further tire them out. Rain, meanwhile, can make the roads muddy and slippery and create an additional obstacle for them to traverse. 

The cyclist in the story also must contend with wildlife, specifically birds. As the cyclist pedals, the birds fly up, startling them and causing them to lose focus on the road and their journey. This distraction can cause the cyclist to become unfocused and unfocused cyclists are more likely to make mistakes.
