Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. First and foremost, the cycling environment is often created by human drivers â€“ in which case you might Flash the settings again. If you find yourself in circumstances that aren't comfortable, there may be a way to fix any problems that have been addressed in the past.


A few options to enhance bike accessibility include:

- Turn the off-road setting to Off, if you prefer. If you are driving off-road through woodland, for instance a gentle turn in back will help and this can improve the cyclist in an environment where their hands are no longer allowed where their arms can be.

- Drive in the right direction, so you can have a bike that looks or looks good with a certain 'on/off' button turned off or something.

- Move your head or finger on the ground, or just hold it straight, if you can.


Sometimes, people suggest adding a 'normal' setting to ensure it fits with the rest of the 'Rough Road Ahead'. But a lot of cyclists try different things from this and sometimes this is just too little, too late. Having to turn your head or finger on the road to adjust this setting will help, but if you are just doing it so you don't have to spend money to fix your bike, you may find that you have to change the cycle location.

I wish you all a great summer
