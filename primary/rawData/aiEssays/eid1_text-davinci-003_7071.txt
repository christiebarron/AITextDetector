Censorship has always been a controversial topic, and it has been especially relevant in recent years. No one can deny that libraries have a moral and ethical obligation to make sure their materials are appropriate for their patrons, but censorship goes too far when the library begins to remove items that some people find offensive.

The simple act of removing books, magazines, movies, or music from the shelves of a library on the basis of perceived offensiveness strips people of their right to access information freely. It restricts people from forming their own opinions, because they no longer have access to a wide range of material in order to do so. In this way, censorship could even be considered a form of censorship by the library itself, because it is suppressing the free flow of information.

Not to mention, censorship can lead to a slippery slope. If one book, movie, or magazine is deemed offensive, it is only a matter of time before more materials become restricted. The library will be left with an incomplete catalog of resources that will ultimately limit peopleâ€™s access to knowledge. 

Admittedly, libraries should be mindful about the materials they make available to the public. However, instead of removing items, librarians should instead provide effective tools for people to screen material of their choosing. For example, the library could place ratings on materials so that people can decide for themselves whether or not they would like to read, watch, or listen to a certain resource.
