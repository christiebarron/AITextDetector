Computers have many effects on people. Some things can cause their behavior to change, like that people move their arms, they move their eyes.

"It could be that this has some kind of a direct effect on behavior," she said.

People who have more social anxiety disorders, like anxiety disorder B, may have more of this information, though it's possible that more and more people may have a better understanding of what has the effect on emotion and behavior. A study from the University of Michigan's Emotion Neurobiology Institute found that the amygdala is thought to be much more able to deal with such issues.

"I think that this is one more mechanism where we may be able to explore this aspect of it," Miller said. (The team also studied brain waves from mice to understand its effect on emotion and behavior.)

Now, scientists want to understand whether the amygdala has a direct effect on behavior. The researchers have used a technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging to test the theory that the hippocampus is responsible for our attention to social cues.

The research's results were published Wednesday in the journal Psychological Science and the research team also hopes to use this test to help more people who don't know much about emotion and behavior. (It's being published in March in the journal Frontiers In Psychology.)
