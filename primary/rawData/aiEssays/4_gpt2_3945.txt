The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because you have the possibility of changing it from the original novel into a short story. This time around it's more of a puzzle to figure out how to pull off, but also to give the book as much context as possible. This is a series that takes place after the events of Winter Hibiscus, and although you can't skip those events, there's more to it than that.

The story, which is almost a continuation of Winter Hibiscus, will take place around a small plot point, and will have a more major plot point, especially in the ending, when Ice Lake is pulled away from Earth. It could take place much sooner than you think.

The idea of giving Ice Lake its own set of rules when it turns into the snow-covered lake is awesome when you really are starting out, but there are a few key things that could be improved upon the book. If you're willing to give it a try, I'd suggest waiting a week for the book to finish before continuing on with it. Also, if this part of the world is too dangerous for you to have an ice bucket on hand, you might have to change a little bit of your schedule to put this one back in and let the book focus on the story instead.

But while this is a book that is well-known in the book fair, it just happened to be a completely different book by a different author
