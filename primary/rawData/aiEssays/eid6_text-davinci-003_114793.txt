The Empire State Building was a feat of engineering when it was constructed in 1931 and the design engineers had to consider many factors in order to make the building a success. One aspect of this was the possibility of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. While the idea of having airships docked at the top of the building seemed like a great idea, the builders faced a number of significant obstacles in making this a reality.

The first of these obstacles was the buildingâ€™s height. The building was 1,250 feet tall, making it too tall to support the masts needed for airship docking. The mooring masts for airships needed to be at least 600 feet tall, while the top of the Empire State Building was only around 400 feet tall. This meant that the builders had to find a suitable alternative method for dirigibles to dock.

The solution was to identity and excavate a large depression on the 68th floor of the building. This depression would then be fitted with a metal pole that could be used as a mooring mast, so that the dirigibles could dock with the building. In order to make the metal pole strong enough to hold the airship, it was surrounded by 200 cubic yards of concrete and reinforced with enameled steel. The mast extended 350 feet above the rooftop and contained guides at different heights that dirigibles could utilise to dock with the building.
