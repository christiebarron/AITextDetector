The narrator in Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho is reflecting on a difficult and important test she must take in the future. She wonders if her knowledge of the hibiscus flower her cousin planted in the snow will help her answer questions on the test. The last line serves as a reminder to the narrator that the flower will come back in the spring, and with it, the test. The line is also a reminder that she can trust in nature and in herself to be ready for it when the time comes.
