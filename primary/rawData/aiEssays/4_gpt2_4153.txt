The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it puts a new perspective on the events of the past. This book tells anecdotally the story of the events that took place before the invention of the Internet in the late 1860s. It then explores the past of what was lost, not what is preserved, but what was made – and, with the help of an extraordinary collection of artifacts spanning several decades – of what is believed to be the earliest known written record of a human being; by way of the Roman Empire. The book then brings together more than 400 stories from all over the world about what happened that inspired mankind in its quest for immortality and that became known as the "The Last of the Human Race." As a result of this, the book serves as a great example for people who live or die in the next 50 years of their lives, of those that died in great numbers during this time that were already living up to the promises of human immortality, and of those who are today dead but for something so important.
