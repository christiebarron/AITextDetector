Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. For example, they are better and harder to follow (although a rider might try to steer their bike on their way, then fall and crash through their vehicle), and there are lots of extra things in there (such as a 'rut' that might cause a serious crash). For example:

This makes it harder to drive, and you will usually be driving at a reduced speed in a safe spot.

If riding a flat-climbing bike in a congested street, there are lots of extra things on the road (such as pedestrians and cyclists), so you don't want to have to contend with them.

The same goes for parking spaces. There are lots of places where you can park at night (and also in the wrong place at night), and you also have to deal with more 'climbing zones' in order to get round.
