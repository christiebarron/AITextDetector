The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In 1883, the London Civil Aeronautic Engineer, John Haldeman, wrote a series of reports showing that a dirigible in the fleet can climb up to 6,000 feet without falling. Though a little less than two miles (10 km) wide, the length of a dirigible was roughly 1,700 feet (900 m) in diameter.

Because of the way the airplane is carried, the pilot takes care not to be spotted on the airplane in an extremely wet or rough environment, which is why many people call it "unstuffed." Daedric wings are no longer permitted.

What's missing is the proper mechanism for ejecting the mangroves with the airplane. So far no one has created the necessary aerodynamic control mechanisms to do it. The aerodynamic requirements have been determined to a certain extent by the Federal Government, which in 2001 set up a research and development program to solve these problems.

To take a close look at the mechanics of a mangrove ejection, please see this video:

According to the Federal Aviation Administration, ejection means "the evacuation on flight or landing of any structure of the body under the circumstances, e.g., while in an enclosed area such as those shown in Figure 1, such as a house, enclosed building, or public utility structure."
