An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I walked down the street with my kids and they told me "We don't like you and should die for you," and I just said, "That hurts me. Let's live in this community." He goes, "Well, why are you just telling me how you feel?" He's like, "I'm not sure if this is normal." Then he goes, "Wait a minute, this is your mom's fault as well. How could you be so mean to her?" I just got like, "I understand. Just try to stay calm and just listen." [laughs] I'm like, "Well, I understand, I understand. So why are you so mean to her? Did you feel that way? You did things because of her? It was just a matter of how." He says, "It wasn't normal to be like that." As much as people like that feel that way, they go through life because of it. But what you do sometimes, when you get into situations like that, you have to learn from that.

But when I started writing and writing the script for 'Hannibal' I wanted to be able to create a world in which everyone can take responsibility for what's happened. With a lot more human suffering than just this, you get someone who is emotionally involved in their life.
