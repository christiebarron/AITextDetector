Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have had on people in the modern world. While it is certainly true that computers can be incredibly helpful tools, providing people with access to tremendous amounts of information in seconds, there are undeniable risks associated with them as well.

The abundance of computers in homes and offices as well as the increasing dependence on them calls into question the impact of this technology on our lives. Many people have become so accustomed to the convenience of computers that they have become less willing to think for themselves. In addition to this, using computers has been found to lead to less productivity, due to the time people spend on them for purposes other than work, such as surfing the internet, playing games, and social media.

Moreover, computers can be a source of distraction, leading to lower concentration levels and lower attention spans. This can be an especially serious issue for young people, as studies have shown that overusing technology can negatively affect academic performance and overall health.

Given the various disadvantages of computers, I believe that people should be encouraged to use computers only when necessary. It is important for us to remember that computers are simply tools, and should not be used as a replacement for physical activities and interpersonal relationships.

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
