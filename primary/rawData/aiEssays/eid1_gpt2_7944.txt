Computers have many effects on people. A few more than others. First, they create the power to make your PC more powerful. More so, they allow you to keep your data on your desktop. This is why I have seen PCs that run Windows 7/8.0. This is because the PC is more easily removable and can not be replaced with other units. In fact, if you replace a PC with another, one that you have built-up already, some of your data will continue to be erased and your work will be no longer usable. This is why I can't say for sure what effect this can have on me physically. If the damage is severe enough, I would consider replacing the PC, but that would probably take longer. If not, then it could mean a complete failure of the PC. The PC also requires a lot of power to operate. I would expect these to be noticeable when the system is not powered on.

In summary, we can conclude that, at first, most people who buy a new computer grill a case of PCs for their main-board and then some to use as a desk. They buy this so that, if something really bad happens, they can go the way of the dodo in the park and get into a case full of these. Then the good news is that there are other, more economical PCs and the costs to move the desktop parts can easily rise.
