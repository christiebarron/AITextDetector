I remember the moment so clearly. I had finally worked up the courage to ask my friend on a date. I had been thinking about it for months, but I was sure he would say no. But he said yes! I was so embarrassed that I had been afraid to ask, but I was so happy he had said yes. We had agreed to go to a movie that night.

When we got there, we found that it had already started and the theater was nearly empty. We couldn't find a seat anywhere near to each other, so I ended up sitting a few rows up. I was so embarrassed that I'd been too scared to ask for a seat near him.

But a funny thing happened as the movie progressed. I started making small comments here and there about what was happening on the screen, and a few of them were pretty funny. Soon, I noticed that even though we weren't sitting together, my friend was actually laughing at my jokes. It made me feel so relieved.

The most miraculous thing of all though was that after a while, we eventually found seats right next to each other. We had both been laughing at the same jokes, so we naturally started to laugh even harder when we were sitting together. It felt like a tiny miracle, almost like it was meant to be. 

We laughed together throughout the movie and it felt so good. To this day, it still feels like that moment is the best kind
