I remember that time when my best friend and I were discussing some of our plans for the upcoming summer. We were both so excited about what was to come and neither of us could contain our laughter. I thought I might burst from the sheer joy of anticipation we felt. We dreamed of all the places we wanted to visit and the people we wanted to meet.

Then, without warning, we both broke into a fit of laughter. We had been planning so intently that we hadn’t noticed our pet cat had joined us at some point and was now meowing at us for attention. We laughed so hard at the interruption that tears started streaming down our faces.

We laughed and laughed and laughed until we had to take a break for a few minutes to compose ourselves. Then we laughed even harder when we realized that was the first real laughter we had shared with each other in a long time.

The laughter reminded me that, no matter what happens, I’ll always be able to count on my best friend to make me laugh.
