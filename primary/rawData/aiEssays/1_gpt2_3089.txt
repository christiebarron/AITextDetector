Computers have many effects on people. One of them, obviously, is that they go back to their home countries and try and get rid of some of the people they didn't want. So you also have social and cultural pressure, and if you get rid of people from your society and leave them, then you also want to stop putting your name on the passports of some of the people you want to make sure you got rid of. Some people in my country have really been affected. We have been dealing with immigration too many times for many years now. We cannot let others take our kids to school. Our country has always been so important in our lives that it's an important thing to be left, not taken advantage of. And when government comes up with rules that make you leave, that they want to force you to, all of a sudden, you find yourself in a situation where, now you're very anxious, and it makes it impossible for you to go back. This is one of the key issues. All the other things I'm trying to deal with.

Q: But are we doing enough to help the United States fight to be able to attract foreign students?

A: I have no doubt the government will say no. And I do believe this will be a national issue, whether they have the best case scenario. But I can tell you it isn't getting any easier because we just have to work harder to get our student out of the United States.
