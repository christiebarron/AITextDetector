The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. But the biggest hurdle was their lack of space and their inability to build them vertically. The design concept for the Empire State Building was that a building could not be built vertically with horizontal walls, which means that no elevator or elevator shaft could be built vertically with vertical walls. This also meant that there would be many openings in the tower itself, which was necessary to accommodate the enormous cargo ships that kept these ships. Eventually the city built the Empire State Building, which was built with two sides.
In an effort to solve this problem, the city commissioned architect Richard D. Anderson to design three large elevators. Those three elevators had room for four or five passengers for the three elevators: A, B, C, and D in the lower level. The designers chose to use a standard curved elevator that would fit the two main sides of the building. The lower tower was connected by a narrow shaft to the second and third elevators on the right and left sides of the building.
As soon as Anderson began to work on both dimensions of the building—the lower level and the upper level—he began thinking of a way to connect the two sides to support the passengers seated on them in the lower tower. Anderson wrote down the steps of constructing this vertical elevator from his original drawings for the Empire State Building: 
I had previously designed a vertical elevator with a forward passageway to the right
