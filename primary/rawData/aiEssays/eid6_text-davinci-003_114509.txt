The construction of the Empire State Building presented the challenge of allowing docking of dirigibles, or airships. To accommodate this, the builders had to surmount many technical, financial, and safety obstacles. While the building's height and design were designed in part to facilitate an observation deck and dirigible mooring mast, the endeavor was not without its difficulties. 

The first obstacle facing the Empire State Building's builders was the expense of construction. Dirigible docking systems were expensive, costing in the tens of millions of dollars, and on the public level, such financing was difficult to secure. The building's owners were forced to pay most of the costs out of their own pockets. In addition, the airship docking system had to be able to accommodate the specific size, weight, and attitude of the ship. Building a mooring mast that accounted for all of these variables was a difficult engineering task.

The second obstacle the builders faced was a technical one, as creating the dirigible mooring mast was a complex engineering feat for the time. The mast had to be designed to resist the strong winds of the upper New York City atmosphere and take into account the motions of a large, airborne object. It had to accommodate both the flight crew and a sizable number of passengers to disembark for their destination, adding another layer of complexity to the design. 

The final obstacle was safety. With the mooring mast having to extend many hundreds of feet into
