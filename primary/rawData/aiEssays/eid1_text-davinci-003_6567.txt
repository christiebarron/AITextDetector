Dear Editor,

As someone who has been surrounded by technology since childhood, I wanted to take the time to share my opinion on the pervasive effects computers have had on people. While technology is an important part of life in the 21st century, I would argue that the increased prevalence of computers and other similar technologies has had a negative impact on us both physically and emotionally.

Most notably, using a computer on a regular basis can lead to physical health concerns. Studies have linked it to everything from increased risk of headaches to eye strain and muscle pains. Furthermore, these devices can also causes a person to become increasingly sedentary. This can lead to a number of health issues, from obesity to mental health conditions. In fact, an increased use of computers has been linked to higher levels of anxiety and depression.

These issues can be exacerbated due to the basic nature of computers. They often require us to stay in close proximity for long periods of time, which can be detrimental to our physical and emotional wellbeing. This is even more serious for young people who are still developing a sense of self-awareness and self-regulation.

In my opinion, it is important that we take the necessary steps to ensure that computers do not consume our lives. I appeal to all readers to take control of their computer use and to find balance in their lives by participating in physical activities and socializing with others.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
