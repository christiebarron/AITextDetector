The Empire State Building has long been a symbol of innovative architecture. When it opened in 1931, it was the world’s tallest building and the idea of having dirigibles dock atop its mooring mast was a revolutionary concept. However, it wasn’t easy for the builders to make this idea a reality. In Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s book ‘The Mooring Mast’, she lays out some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock.

First, the building needed to be modified to accommodate the docking of a dirigible. While the original plans for the building included a 110-foot steel mast positioned atop the building’s spire, this needed to be made much longer in order to make it suitable for airship docking. This required the installation of an extension to the mast that was a total of 200 feet high.

The next obstacle was the technical engineering problem posed by creating something strong enough to support the weight of a dirigible. The builders had to come up with a solution that would allow the airships to stop and remain stable at the top of the mooring mast without damaging the structure. To solve this, the engineers created an “eight-stranded steel hawser” that was capable of holding up to 400,000 pounds of airship.

The last obstacle the builders faced was the weather. Wind, rain
