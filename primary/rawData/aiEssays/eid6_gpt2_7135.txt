The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, they had to pass the requirements for building a building of a single object. Building towers could't be built by a single contractor for more than seven years and would have to wait until 2020 for the building to be repaired and sold for $300 millions more. Another obstacle was that building a "smart city" might take a couple of years but the building would have to do another year's worth of work before it could be delivered. The second obstacle arose from the cost. Buildings had to take two years to build, for both parties making this a costly and time-consuming undertaking. Some building builders said not only did you save many years, but you also prevented another one like this from coming to fruition. The cost of the project, the amount of time it would take, was a factor that could have contributed to several problems.

Finally, the fact of the matter is that the buildings are not built by individuals (with the exception of the D.C. Metropolitan Building Corporation). Many of the architects and planners from this period agreed that designing a smart city required a complex and intricate planning process, as well as an ongoing project management process. Many of the building contractors and architects worked on developing technologies and technologies that made building their buildings a possibility; others simply made their offices more efficient with fewer resources. With only 2 percent of the projects being done at the most cost-effective location, they
