In Joe Kurmaski's short story, "Rough Road Ahead," the cyclist protagonist must contend with many obstacles in his journey, in addition to his own fear and lack of experience. The hurricane-level winds and rain is one of the physical features of the setting that challenge him. The strong winds cause the trees to sway, creating the possibility for branches to topple on the cyclist. The low visibility of the storm also creates a navigational hazard, as he is forced to rely on the small red blips from passing cars and the occasional storefront in order to stay on course.

The rugged terrain of the mountain in which the cyclist must travel is another feature of the setting that impacts him. With a steep incline in the road, the cyclist encounters a slow and trying journey. Steep grades require more than just physical strength; they demand a good sense of balance and control in order to remain safe. Without extensive experience in cycling, the cyclist is challenged to maneuver the treacherous path.

The lack of support from among the character's peers in the setting of the story also see affects the cyclist. He enters this journey facing overwhelming sense of doubt and fear, hampered by the fact that no one has the courage to join him. His fear and exhaustion build as he faces the physical and mental elements of the race; he is denied a sense of companionship and this absence of camaraderie further feeds his fear.
