An example of a time someone in my life was patient was trying one of my recipes, and he had not only found that the spices were wonderful but he had also found that the meat was very healthy too and that he had also found that the sauce was very salty. One of my readers asked me how I made this recipe. I told the waiter (my husband) that I did not have any ingredients in hand. This was the last recipe ever on the menu. It took me about eight hours to make. It took me a great deal of time to make until I had the recipe, and then I would not take a recipe off this post once this post was over. The best part is, I know I would not be making this recipe again. Thank you for understanding so much! The best part is, there are tons of recipes that have been written about my use of garlic and onion. We know they are very versatile, and I like to use a mix of the ingredients here. So, there is a lot I can do to make sure everything is vegan, as well as a ton left over for use in those future recipes. I can be a little lazy, which is always a good thing. So, I apologize in advance if I am being a little overly optimistic. It will not change my opinion or judgment in the slightest, and I am in no way criticizing anyone involved in making these ingredients in any way. Asking if you feel that the recipe has been too much
