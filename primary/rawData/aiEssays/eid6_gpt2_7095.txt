The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The lack of air conditioners made it impractical to do so.

But eventually the Empire State Building saw a way to improve the efficiency by incorporating new material on each floor, so they can now move up and down the building. They also added a glass bridge, which is a common feature on older buildings. The building on West 57th Street will still be wheelchair accessible as of 2012.

The plan also included a new garage in the basement with new lighting from Seattle Electric & Light.
