One time I experienced laughter in my life was when watching her give a big speech at my high school graduation show. A large crowd of students cheered.

Another time I watched a video of her clowns. A large part of me remembers the moment. I can never forget it. The face was really huge and everyone was laughing.

I am so very proud of her and I wish that she would not have had a hand in this. She has made such amazing people smile.

Her story is also incredibly touching to me. It is inspiring to believe in this amazing person. Her life was not an easy one.

When she went to grad school, she had no family. She went to school at night and left around 8 in the morning to go to bed. After she was on recess, she went home to go to bed and I watched her give her speech. I know this was all she wanted to do.

Once, I was very lucky. When she got home, I was thinking maybe the guy at the back of the class would remember her. But when he told her about the fact that she had a clown face she immediately knew that he wouldn't remember her for long. So he left immediately. And for a small reason, he was glad that she would go on with her life.

I do believe that this great woman with the best reputation of "the greatest woman in school." People are so inspired when they see those pictures
