As I drove down the winding mountain road, I felt my worries slowly melting away. Soon I'd be in the presence of an old friend and laughter was sure to follow.

We'd grown up together and shared so much over the years, but recently things had taken a turn for the worse. Our friendship had been tested in some pretty trying ways and I was really hoping that the time apart had allowed us to heal the wounds.

When I arrived at her house, I was greeted with a warm hug and a huge smile. We talked about the events of the past few months, and laughed over the memories that felt so distant. 

We ended up spending the whole night laughing about everything that had happened to us since we last saw each other. It felt like no time had passed and I was grateful for our easy camaraderie.

The simple pleasure of shared laughter reminded me of why our friendship had lasted so long and I was filled with hope for our reconciliation.
