I remember a time when I was at the airport trying to book a flight for my family’s upcoming vacation. Everything was going as planned, until I had to pay for the tickets and realized I had left my credit card at home. I could feel my anxiety rising and I was ready to just give up and go home, when I looked over and saw a patient woman helping out the lady in front of me. She had clearly been there for quite a while, but her patience never wavered.

I explained to her that I had forgotten my credit cards and she offered to help me out. She loaned me hers so I could purchase the tickets, and told me not to worry about it. She assured me that I could simply send her a check or an online payment for the cost of the tickets. I was so relieved, and thanked her for her kindness.

That experience taught me the importance of being patient and open to helping others. The woman’s patience is still something I strive for even today.
