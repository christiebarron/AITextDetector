Censorship in libraries is a controversial subject and one that evokes strong opinions from people on both sides of the argument. On the one hand, there are those who believe that materials deemed offensive should not be available in libraries. On the other, there are those who believe that any book, regardless of its content, should be made available for public consumption.

Though I understand concerns about the availability of potentially offensive materials in libraries, I have to firmly advocate that censorship should not be used in libraries. By censoring books or other library materials, we are denying individuals their right to freely explore ideas and information. Libraries should be a safe haven in which those who are curious to learn more about a certain subject matter can do it without judgement. 

The freedom of information is paramount when it comes to education and academic pursuits. An informed and aware public is essential for a thriving democracy. Therefore, library collections should be open to all types of information, regardless of how offensive it might be. Furthermore, libraries should provide a safe environment where patrons can explore topics that they might not feel comfortable discussing openly.

Censorship in libraries may seem like the answer to limiting access to offensive material. However, by banning certain types of information, we are doing a disservice to the public in more ways than one. Therefore, it is important to understand that while some materials may not be appropriate for everyone, no materials should be withheld from the public completely.
