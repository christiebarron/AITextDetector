In the story "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski, the setting contains many features that affect the cyclist on their journey. These features include the physical environment, such as terrain, altitude, and weather conditions, as well as the psychological environment, which includes the cyclist’s fears and anxieties.

The physical environment plays an important role in the cyclist’s journey. The terrain can determine the level of difficulty the cyclist will face and the type of training they will have to undertake to be successful. The altitude at which the cyclist is riding can make the climb even more difficult by reducing the air pressure and making it harder to breathe. Additionally, the weather conditions can impact the cyclist’s journey by decreasing visibility, adding slippery surfaces, and increasing wind resistance.

The psychological environment also affects the cyclist’s journey. The cyclist’s fears and anxieties can be a major factor that could hinder progress. Fear of failure can lead to unrealistic expectations or can cause the cyclist to underestimate the task at hand. Anxiety can lead to fatigue, which can be dangerous for a cyclist trying to make progress.

Overall, the features of the setting in "Rough Road Ahead" play an important role in the cyclist’s journey. The physical environment can affect the journey in terms of the terrain, altitude, and weather conditions. Meanwhile, the psychological environment can hinder progress by introducing the cyclist’s fears and anxieties.
