I recently had to pick up my older brother from the airport late at night. It was a two-hour drive and by the time I got to his terminal, there were long lines at the baggage carousel and his flight had been delayed. To make matters worse, I had been stuck in traffic and was running low on gas.

My patience was put to the test but I chose not to complain or be discouraged. I decided to focus on the positive, such as catching up with my brother after being apart for so long. I stayed in my lane, waited in line, and managed to embrace the situation. 

Finally, after what felt like hours, I reached the carousel and our luggage came around. I found my brother, graciously thanked him for his patience, and drove him home. 

Having patience during this situation taught me how to remain calm and take control. It was a good reminder that patience often pays off.
