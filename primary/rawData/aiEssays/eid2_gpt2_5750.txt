I believe that censorship of materials in libraries may well be the first serious attempt to abolish a certain form of expression," he said.

The move has long been seen as an attempt to take control of the media industry.

"We now want to see some sort of mechanism where the media can become more powerful without being controlled by our government," N. Chandrabab Filipa, Deputy Director-General of the U.N. Human Rights Council, told an event here.

He added that all publishers would not be able to accept censorship of their content and would have to submit their own lists to the United Nations for review.

The US-based Human Rights Council of France has been calling on the council to take action against censorship of materials.

Speaking under the banner of Reporters Without Borders, the World Association of Newspaper Publishers said the move "does not provide a reasonable basis for an independent organization to review and regulate" the media industry, saying more than 10 million papers "do not have rights and freedoms that may promote freedom of expression, due process, democratic decision making and the rule of law" within the United States.

It also noted that publications such as the New York Times and San Francisco Chronicle "would no longer find themselves under protection in our country" if they were able to produce "free, balanced voices, content and a balanced work ethic."

The US-based Human Rights Council last month accused countries of imposing restrictions on media outlets
