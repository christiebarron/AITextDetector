I believe that censorship of materials in libraries can lead to significant harms. But censorship of such materials is harmful because it causes those who have chosen the path that best serve the needs of the public â€” an attitude that is often more hostile than helpful and is less harmful at the current time."

Alderman, who is also the Democratic leadership's chief supporter, said he was inspired by a recent poll commissioned by the Santa Fe Association showing that about half of Colorado residents agree, while a full quarter disagree.

"In an age when students are increasingly demanding government spending on education instead of investing in alternatives and the arts and humanities, the people of Colorado know we stand against both of those things," Alderman said from the Assembly floor.

He cited a recent study by the nonpartisan Tax Foundation of Pennsylvania showing that only 27 of the state's 42 counties had enacted laws against making them public. Other states saw similar results, including Kansas, Florida and Nebraska.

"It doesn't get better than that," Alderman said. "It makes you wonder if you're an atheist who actually knows what's in this bill."
