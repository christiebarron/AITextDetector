The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it brings the reader into the heart of the supernatural: a man who was in the wilderness and survived in a place that he thinks is home by day, and he finds it more alien and sinister than anything he has ever seen or heard of. He realizes that he is haunted and, by his own actions, knows about his own fate, the horrors that await him and the consequences of his actions.

The book's title is also based on an excerpt from the novel by Josephine Rowntree, which features a foreword by Stephen F. Aachen's (Luther) sister.

Hibiscus:

Bizarre and often shocking, the novel takes us beyond the realm of science fiction fiction (or, more specifically, "science fiction is the language used by the mind to represent a world without boundaries"). A man named Hibiscus, the man who grew up in a small town in Western Maine, began dreaming as well, and the next year, when he saw a tree fall from a tree stump, he jumped out to rescue the fallen tree from its branches. As the man went to fetch him, Hibiscus saw an angel with wings hovering over the fallen tree, and his excitement grew even greater. A few days later he became the hero of the event that took place, and he saw the whole thing with that same angel, and how he was an icon of goodness and hope
