The Empire State Building was no ordinary building. When it was first completed in 1931, it featured an innovative and novel feature – the world’s first permanent docking site for dirigibles. This revolutionary engineering feat posed a series of challenges to the builders as they worked to make this dream a reality. 

The first major obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock was the size of the building. At almost 1,250 feet, the Empire State Building was the tallest building in the world at the time. This made it an imposing structure, and engineers had to achieve a difficult balancing act – they needed to remove enough of the building’s roof to create an opening large enough to accommodate a dirigible, while also constructing the mooring mast strong enough and tall enough to support the dirigible during docking and mooring.

The second obstacle was designing the mooring mast. The mooring mast had to be capable of supporting the weight of a large dirigible, and it had to have a method for controlling the height of the docking mast as the dirigible descended. To achieve this, engineers designed and tested two different mooring masts – a vertical mast and a telescoping mast – before settling on the telescoping mast. Eventually, the engineers designed a system of internal and external cables and a unique type of dynamic brake system, which allowed the mast to remain stationary while the dirigible descended
