The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The opening of the Empire State Building in 1914, following the World War I World War II, severely hampered that purpose. The building itself was built in a more industrial structure, while the building's design was geared towards the public with its focus being on the building's safety and security concerns.

The Empire State Building was built to provide for future generations. It's heritage was kept in reserve, and it's history continues to serve the citizens of both the Empire State and its surrounding areas, from the time it was rebuilt in 1914 to its present-day.
