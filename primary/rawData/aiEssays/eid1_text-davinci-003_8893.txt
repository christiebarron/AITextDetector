I remember it like it was yesterday. I had been out of town visiting family for a few days and was finally able to come home and see my wife for the first time in weeks. Of course, we had talked on the phone and FaceTimed a few times while I was away, but there's nothing like being able to hug someone after a long time apart. 

When I walked in and saw her face light up with a huge smile, I couldn't help but let out a laugh. That's one of the best things about our relationship, the amount of laughter we share. We laughed so hard and couldn't stop, so much so that others in the room looked at us like we had lost our minds. 

The laughter continued as we reminisced about funny moments we had shared together until tears were streaming down our faces. That hug and laughter was exactly what I needed to make me feel at home. I cherish any moment we can laugh together, because it's the laughter that binds us together, no matter how far apart we are.
