 

I was finishing up a long, stressful day of school. My friends had gathered in a circle and were having a conversation about our finals. I was starting to get a little overwhelmed by the pressure of the upcoming exams. Suddenly, one of my friends started to laugh at something the other one had said. It was a funny comment, but the best part was that it had broken the tension in the air.

Soon everyone else was laughing as well, and I found myself joining in. The laughter was contagious and it spread throughout the circle. We continued talking and joking, each moment feeling a little less intimidating.

After a few minutes, our laughter began to subside. We all looked at each other and smiled. I felt more relaxed, more connected to my friends than before. It was then I realized how powerful laughter was in connecting people. No matter the situation, laughter is the quickest way to bridge a distance between two people and make things lighter.
