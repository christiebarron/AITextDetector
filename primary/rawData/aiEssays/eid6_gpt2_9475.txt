The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The earliest known attempt was made to permit a car to dock without the need to change a window before opening in the middle of a rush hour. It was also rejected because its construction involved tearing down a large concrete pillar and cutting it into a concrete ball instead of simply taking the outside off. It was a particularly difficult decision to make since if the building or its builder were able to make it, it would be the first and only built dirigibles building in the U.S.

Though it was largely left intact, what still remains of the building is still an ongoing work site, used often as a dump at some point during the New Deal's administration to dump trash from industrial buildings. It was also used as a dumping ground for waste from buildings when the building was not used during the Great Depression.

Bryan M. Smith, a foreman and one of the original builders, lost his life on the site but survived many similar accidents. His next death happened in 2004 when he was struck by a car, striking a man on the left side of the building before he struck the other building by the other end. His death may have had less to do with his ability to walk forward than with the design of the building itself.
