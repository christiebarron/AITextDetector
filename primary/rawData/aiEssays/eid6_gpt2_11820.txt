The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

One of the most complex was the Federal Building in Washington. The government constructed its own dirigibles, built for the space-age era, in the 1950s, and was responsible for the building of many more before the building burst into popularity in the late '90s but a number of them later were scrapped, the most recent being the massive, seven-story, "Lincoln National Capital of America" that was built with four dirigibles in 1966.

In the 1970s and early '80s, the Federal Building was the site of a number of controversial public art programs and even a handful of films based on its original architecture.

Most recently, two high-profile examples of NASA's "Starcraft" space observatory were built, and both were intended to use solar radiation to build a solar system-expanding craft, or "SOLV-4." The plan was to build an aircraft to look like one. But there is no space-age history of what happened to NASA's S-4S shuttle, a two-generation space launch vehicle that ran from 1976 to 1977 with 2 and 1/2 megawatts of thrust.

While space technology has developed dramatically from the end of the 20th century, much of the building industry still controls the ability to build commercial space systems.

SpaceX, for example, built a massive
