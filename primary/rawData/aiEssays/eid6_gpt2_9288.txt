The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They required a central line of water to dock a crane on an airport block, and would have had to provide a fixed platform or a roof to allow the crane to move freely. "You can get them into motion if you want, but you will need the whole building built up, and then there are no openings," he said. A second obstacle was using a crane in the middle of the building, a feature created during the World War II campaign, to lift vehicles. "You know, there is no such thing as an elevator, and there is no such thing as a lift, or so-called elevators." When the buildings saw the "curious" rise of American military aircraft such as the F-35, the planners asked for them to be set between the base of command and the Pentagon.@#

With all these obstacles in place, the builders of the Empire State Building faced an unprecedented challenge, though it was not a failure. They could use any existing structure for the lift â€” although they faced a great risk of dropping the building if new materials became available (the Empire State Building began working on a roof roof system in 1942 at the age of 40). It was already well known that if the steel roofs on the Empire State Building collapsed during World War II, their original purpose would be to lift vehicles to the ground. To that end, the builders had to construct in a new
