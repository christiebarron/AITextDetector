My experience of laughter in a relationship happened when I was out with my best friend on a night out. We were sat in an Irish bar chatting and having a few drinks. Suddenly, a drunk man stumbled over to us, hand outstretched, and asked us for a dance.

My friend and I were both quite taken aback, and yet, something made us both laugh. Not wanting to be rude, we declined the request. But our humorous reaction seemed to please the man, who began to laugh too.

This continued for a few minutes, with the man joining us for a chat in between brief moments of dancing to the music, and each of us trying not to laugh too much. It was hilarious and fun and even though the man left after a while, we couldn't stop talking about it for days afterwards.

At the time, my friend and I had only been friends for a few months, but this experience was a moment that truly bonded us together. We shared an experience of laughter that we both thoroughly enjoyed, for a memory that will stay with us for years to come.
