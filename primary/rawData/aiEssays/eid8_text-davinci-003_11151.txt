I had been friends with Mark for about four years when he asked me out. I was initially hesitant since we were such close friends, but he persisted until I eventually gave in. We went on a few dates, but nothing seemed to click between us. 

Then, one evening he invited me to a stand-up comedy show. We had a great time, laughing until we cried at the jokes. As I was wiping away the tears of laughter, Mark reached over and took my hand. I finally felt a spark between us.

From that moment on, we had no problem connecting. We kept attending standup shows and shared many laughs over the awkward dates that followed. He eventually became my boyfriend.

Laughter sparked a connection that brought us even closer. I always joke that it was his sense of humor that won me over, and in a way, that's absolutely true.
