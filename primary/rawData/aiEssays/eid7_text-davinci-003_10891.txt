I recently had a job interview at a company I have been wanting to work at for a long time. I was really nervous and my palms were sweating and my heart was beating rapidly. I took a moment to take some deep breaths and remind myself to stay calm and patient.

The interviewer asked me a few questions that were challenging for me to answer, but instead of getting frustrated, I remained patient and composed. I took some extra time to think about each answer carefully before I responded. I also asked thoughtful questions and took some time to listen to the interviewer's response. 

By remaining patient throughout the interview, I left the interviewer with a positive impression of me and managed to land the job.
