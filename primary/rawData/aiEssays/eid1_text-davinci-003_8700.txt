I was spending the day with my closest friend when I let out an unintentional burp. He burst out laughing and I soon followed, clapping my hands together and shaking my head in disbelief at my own embarrassing outburst. We laughed until we were both in tears, my friend even having to hold his stomach from all the laughing. Afterwards, we just looked at each other in amazement. We began to compare our stories about the silliest things weâ€™d done in our 20-something years on earth. I think that moment was the start of the absolute trust we now have for each other. Laughing together became a safe, intimate connection that grew our bond. Whenever I found myself in a place of uneasiness, I knew I could relax if I just shared a joke with my friend. Laughter really is essential to any relationship.
