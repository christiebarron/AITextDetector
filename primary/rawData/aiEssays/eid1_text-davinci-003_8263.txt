The construction of the Empire State Building marked an incredible feat in the engineering and construction world, and within its limits, was a pioneering effort to house the first of its kind—a docking system for dirigibles. As Marcia Amidon Lüsted insightfully details in her article “The Mooring Mast,” these dirigibles presented an opportunity for people and freight to travel with greater speed and comfort than traditional air transport. However, the challenge of building a mast and the dock necessary to tether a dirigible in mid-air would prove to be an immense hurdle for the project’s engineers. 

The primary issue in designing a mast to dock a dirigible was the size and weight of the structure. Unlike traditional airships such as zeppelins, the larger and heavier dirigibles required a much sturdier docking system to be constructed atop the Empire State Building. The mast itself had to be small enough to fit atop the building without taking away from the structure’s aesthetic appeal, yet sturdy enough to handle the strength of the wind as well as impacts from a heavy airship. Furthermore, construction of the dock also presented a tricky problem; columns had to be set up to form an open landing circle, and the entire structure had to be mounted on a pivot to allow the dock to move and sway so as to prevent the ship from bumping against the building. 

The complexity of these engineering hurdles did not dissuade
