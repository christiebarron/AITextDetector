Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

The setting determines whether the bike is at a low speed (usually a few km/h) or at an increase speed (around 20 km/h).

The cycling performance test ensures that the rider's frame fits well at slow speeds. The test will allow you to judge the bicycle's performance in a specific situation (for example, it determines if it is too fast or too slow, which has to do with the gearbox etc) However, it also provides the opportunity to look beyond the specific position of the seat to find the best fit at a certain temperature.

Here's how the tyre performance test works for your choice of rider:

After the first and last test, there are 4 choices of tyre. (See the example of 'A1' below, see Rounding the Wheel at the bottom.)

As the testing is done, the bicycle starts as fast as possible, and continues in a very gentle (evening) pace (a few percent of the time). After the cycling rate is taken into account, which comes from a variety of factors, there is a clear line in the middle that goes from strong to weak, from low to moderate, from medium to high, and so on.

Finally, at each pass that we do the cycling rate test, we put an extra note on where we feel we've placed our position on the bike
