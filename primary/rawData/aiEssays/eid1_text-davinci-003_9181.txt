As technology advances, so too have our reliance on computers. We have become primarily dependent on them in many aspects of our lives, from organizing our work lives, to maintaining personal and professional relationships, to simply browsing the internet. However, with this comes certain potential drawbacks that can be difficult to identify and change. 

One of the biggest problems is the amount of time spent on computers. People will often find themselves hours deep in an online game or reddit, with no real end in sight. This can take away from commitments made to family and friends, or take away the time needed for rest and self-care. Additionally, this practice has been linked to an increased risk of sleep disorders, depression, and anxiety. All of these factors can be very dangerous long-term if not addressed. 

Another issue is the lack of social interaction caused by computers. While the internet has made it easier to keep in touch, it has also left some people feeling isolated. Face-to-face communication is a crucial part of developing strong interpersonal relationships. Without it, people may become more distant and emotionally disconnected. 

Ultimately, though computers can have positive effects, it’s important to remember the potential risks they also present. It’s important to find a balance between using our computers and taking time away from them. I urge your readers to take this into consideration as they use technology in their everyday lives.
