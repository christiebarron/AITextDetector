The Empire State Building was one of the greatest architectural achievements of the Twentieth Century, rising towering 102 stories above the landscape of New York City. An engineering feat, the building was also a significant technological advance, as it was designed with the intention of hosting dirigibles, or airships, on its roof. However, it must be said that allowing the lofty craft to dock at the Empire State Building was no small feat. There were numerous obstacles that the buildingâ€™s architects and engineers had to overcome in order to make the dream of mooring dirigibles atop the iconic skyline a reality.

One of the most formidable challenges that had to be overcome was the fact that the dirigibles were incredibly large and heavy. Not to mention, the turbulence of the winds posed an added hazard to their control. Because of this, the designers had to ensure that the mast and the surrounding structures surrounding it could confidently take the strain of the airships upon docking. This meant that the mast itself had to be reinforced to handle the heft of the craft and the stresses of the wind, and it had to possess the strength to be able to keep the stern of the dirigible away from the side of the building while in a mooring position.

There were also issues around the potential weather conditions that the dirigibles might encounter. Large storms posed a particular threat as the Empire State Building rests atop four stories of underground bedrock and could sway in high winds
