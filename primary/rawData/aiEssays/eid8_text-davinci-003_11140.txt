I remember it clear as day—the first time I laughed with my daughter. She was just a toddler of two years old, barely able to string her words together, but that didn't stop me. Whenever I was with her, I tried to find humor and joy in small moments.

One day, I was lying on the floor with her on top of me, tickling her. She was full of giggles, and when I stopped for a moment she looked up at me with a look of total contentment. I pulled a silly face and made a goofy sound, and that's when it happened. We both broke into peals of uncontrollable laughter, and in that moment, it felt like time stopped.

It was the recognition of being on the same page that lit it up. She intuitively knew that I was being silly, just like she was, and from that moment on, we shared many more precious laughs. 

That's when I realized that laughter really is the shortest distance between two people. As anyone who has shared a genuine laugh with someone else knows, that connection can't be broken no matter what life throws at you.

And I think that’s why I love laughter so much—it’s a pure and simple way to bring people together, regardless of all the other differences out there.
