The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because at its heart lies the notion that things can never change. It describes what's happened during the life of a beautiful, but ultimately ill-tempered, young woman who finds love, acceptance, and acceptance of the world just as it always did, in one of three ways: at the mercy of her mother's rule, as well as the need of one another in order to save their lives.
