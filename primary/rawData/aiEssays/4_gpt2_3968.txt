The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because in this one, I saw what happens when scientists and medical students take a long time and find something that makes their brain grow and becomes like a cell wall between the neurons, and, when they finally do find the secret, they learn what it really is, as it were. It's great, it is well written and it has quite good plot.


The book I really enjoyed reading was the medical school book of 1962 announced the beginning of the first human generation. I also read in 1968, with J.D. for those that don't know, the book about people who became an "Eurasian" living during World War II. It has a good story arc centered around a young boy (with a strong medical background) making his way around the world and ultimately taking a job as a nurse and becoming a military medic in Berlin, Germany, in 1946.

Now that, of course, is about people. There is a lot that I have not finished, so it's easy to go wrong. I would say the book is on a pretty great line in terms of writing for people, as if there wasn't a point in getting to know someone if they are not a good communicator, or even as for someone to feel validated, rather than just just someone who has to be in the same room with you every day.
