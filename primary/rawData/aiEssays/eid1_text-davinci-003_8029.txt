The engineers and builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of challenges in allowing dirigibles to dock, due to the unique structural considerations of the building. According to Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s “The Mooring Mast”, the two main obstacles that had to be addressed were the size of the mast required to allow the ship to dock and the type of mooring procedure that would ensure its safe connection.

In order for dirigibles to safely dock, two requirements had to be met. First, the mast had to be long enough to accommodate the length of the ship. Initially, the engineers believed the mast would only need to be 15 feet long, but it was later determined that the mast would need to be a minimum of 200 feet in order to provide adequate clearance for a dirigible to dock. The sheer size of the mast posed a significant challenge, as it needed to be securely mounted to the top of the building while also able to withstand the strong winds which were common in the area.

The second obstacle was to determine the best mooring procedure that would ensure a secure connection between the building and the dirigible. The engineers had to develop a specialized system that would be both reliable and easy to use. This involved working out the best materials to use, as well as establishing the layout of the system. Additionally, an appropriate braking system was needed to help counter the strong winds and prevent the ship from drifting away
