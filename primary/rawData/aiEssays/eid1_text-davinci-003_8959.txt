Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my opinion concerning the many effects computers have on people. As technological advancements continue to progress, the presence of computers in society is becoming increasingly ubiquitous. The power of computers to influence human behavior makes it necessary to consider the consequences of such an influence.

First and foremost, computers can be a dedicated source of stress and frustration. In the business world, the relentless need to keep up with the latest developments in technology can lead to an overwhelming feeling of pressure. Beyond the work sphere, the lack of clarity in technical instructions can lead people to feel frustrated and isolated, especially those who are not accustomed to computers.

At the same time, the internet has enabled us to communicate with vast numbers of people around the world. This can often be an invaluable asset. It allows us to access vast stores of knowledge and data, and it can also give us a comprehensive access to the global events in real time. Furthermore, with its varied applications, we can take advantage of computer-assisted tools to help us make informed decisions.

Overall, the potential for both good and bad effects of computers on people is apparent. It is vital that we pay attention to how technology can be used both positively and negatively in future, so that we can use it to our best advantage.

Yours sincerely,

[Your Name]
