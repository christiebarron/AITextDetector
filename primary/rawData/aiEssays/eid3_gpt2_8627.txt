The same is true in the riding of the car which often is shown on the map. As drivers pull up onto the road and use their speed to cut through corners, other cyclists are in a safer position - they can more easily block the car being driven by the driver and get on with the ride while giving up the advantage of the safety car's tailgating to the rider.

But as the cyclist's head-to-head collisions in 'Road ahead' is still being tested on a new level the road ahead strategy is not being taken lightly. In October 2010, the Traffic Safety Board recommended a six-month rule change that would require drivers of cycle-registered transport vehicles to run an electronic driving tests from the point of departure of the driver.
