Computers have many effects on people. A group of computer scientists created a set of neural networks of sorts to study what happens when a small number of neurons move across your brain.

The system allows you to write code and understand complex mathematical models â€” so that the researchers could quickly model the world you'll face and learn about it much more rapidly.

"You have just been told you know a whole bunch of other stuff than you do," said James Schmitz, the chief scientist at the Stanford Brain Imaging Laboratory. "To test it out, we showed how they could build it out in a way that's like using one of their MRI scanners."

Since the first time you used this system, your brain has been telling you how many different kinds of neurons can move across your system. One example is the difference between how your brain works and the size of the individual neurons that you have. One of the researchers developed a system that mimics that, instead of just having separate units, it could have large numbers, making each unit of information much larger.

"It's sort of like the next-generation of MRI," Schmitz explained.

And then there are people like yourself who are having problems learning and performing complex math operations.

Those that have tried it say they cannot understand all of the instructions given and had to resort to the computer's special method of counting down and writing down.

Some also describe it as "shocking
