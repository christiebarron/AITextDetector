In Joe Kurmaski's poem, "Rough Road Ahead," the cyclist faces a treacherous journey full of winding paths, narrow bridges, and treacherous drop-offs. Throughout the poem, the cyclist's struggle is described with vivid imagery, allowing the reader to feel the cyclist's fear and helplessness in the setting. 

The cyclist's struggle is heavily impacted by the features of the setting. The winding curves and rocky edges of the paths that the cyclist rides on serve to increase the physical difficulty of the journey.

The narrow bridges add an element of danger, as one wrong move by the cyclist could lead to a sudden fall and the cyclist's inability to maneuver quickly enough could also cause such an accident. The sheer drop-offs of the sides of the paths also increases the danger and difficulty, as this danger cannot be navigated around and creates a constant terrifying presence.

Moreover, the nature of the setting itself creates a sense of struggle for the cyclist. The rocky and winding paths, narrow bridges, and sheer drop-offs serve as a metaphor for the journey that the cyclist is facing. The cyclist knows that each obstacle along the way must be conquered and the fear of possible danger must be kept in check in order to reach the final destination.
