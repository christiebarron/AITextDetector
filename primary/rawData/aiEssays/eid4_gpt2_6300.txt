The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because people seem to get the idea that this is not only a long story but, as a matter of fact, the first in a long series of books to make it. And this brings us to Springbok. Winter Hibiscus turns 28, and when he's done he's on his way to finishing his PhD dissertation.

So here's a bit of a spoiler: I know what you're thinking is that this won't be a long story, but this is just my attempt from a different angle to sort it out. Also, that's how I feel like these are supposed to end.

Episode 8

When Summer asks where our next summer begins \\

When Summer starts

'cause her sister didn't say

'cause Summer's sister looked like she wanted

'cause Summer was the exact opposite, she was perfect for this

'cause when Summer didn't see a girl she would do one

'cause Summer couldn't even talk when her sister told her everything this has the power to turn her into a princess
