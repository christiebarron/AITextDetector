I remember a time when I was helping my friend study for an important exam. We had been studying for hours and she was clearly feeling overwhelmed and frustrated. She was starting to get discouraged and wanted to give up, but I stayed with her, calmly explaining each concept until she understood it. I urged her to take breaks and stay positive. 

Eventually, she began to get the hang of the material and even found herself getting excited about the exam. Even when she made mistakes or got confused, I was patient with her and kept encouraging her. By the end of our studying session, she was confident that she was going to do well on the exam.

I can still remember that feeling of accomplishment when she finally understood the material, and I felt proud of myself for helping her along the way. Though it wasnâ€™t the easiest task, my patience paid off when she was able to succeed.
