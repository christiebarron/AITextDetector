The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' by poet Paul Hodge, who describes being one of the first people to walk into the club because it was a very strange way to experience that strange world.

"When I left on a train last Saturday night, the moment I saw the sign and thought 'oh no' was when it suddenly dawned on me it almost made me feel like I had just escaped a burning building," he says. "And then when I realised I had done it I knew it wasn't all just a little bit of a wild goose chase, I was instantly hooked." That instant-tragedy – and that moment has given birth to new themes in Hodge's new book How Many Women Shoulda Run To Sleep – began just as the new book appeared, and has since led to a tour of the club in the U.S. and New Zealand, where he has met in more than 40 clubs since the beginning.

There are still quite a few unknowns in How Many Women Shoulda Run – how many women have walked into the club, and by what and from where – but the world of How Many Women Shoulda Run began to grow when it appeared in the New York Times Magazine, titled 'What People Really Think and Don't Tell About You: A Love Story With Everyone.' How Many Women Shoulda Run follows how the group's members feel about being single, or having given out birth or having been denied social recognition
