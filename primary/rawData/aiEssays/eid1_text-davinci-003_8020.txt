The Empire State Building was built with a unique feature – an airship docking mast – in an effort to allow dirigibles to dock there. The idea was initially conceived of in1928, and the whole concept was revolutionary. Unfortunately, due to multiple obstacles, the docking mast was never used for what it was originally intended.

The first obstacle builders faced when planning the airship docking mast was funding. Establishing the docking station required its own budget, separate from that of the rest of the Empire State Building. Additionally, the technology was not yet in place to safely and successfully dock dirigibles in a vertical mast, so the risks associated with the project dissuaded potential investors.

The next obstacle was engineering. A 200-foot-high mast on the Empire State Building’s observation deck, with its intricate anchor pulleys, gears, and other parts, posed a few design issues that had to be addressed before the mast could be constructed. For example, the engineers had to figure out a way to make sure the station was able to retract in order to make way for the dirigibles to dock.

Finally, the federal government posed an obstacle. Federal regulations required that the dirigibles be required to keep a certain distance from the building, as well as from other buildings in Manhattan. The government required air traffic controllers to be on hand when dirigibles docked, which presented more logistical issues.

Ultimately, the combination of
