Dear [Newspaper Name],

I am writing in to state my opinion on the effects computers have had on people and to persuade your readers to agree with me.

In this day and age it is undeniable that computers have become a strong presence in people’s lives and have drastically changed the way we interact with the world. Whether it’s used for research, communication, or entertainment, computers have provided us with unprecedented access to information. With this access comes great benefits, as it has allowed us to become more informed than ever before.

Additionally, computers have made many of our previously labor-intensive tasks much easier. We are now able to automate processes we previously would have had to do by hand, such as record-keeping, paper filing, and communications. This has allowed us to work more productively and be more efficient with our time.

Unfortunately, computers also come with a few drawbacks. Too much reliance on technology can lead to people losing the knowledge, insight, and memory retention that were previously the hallmark of successful functioning. It is important that we are cognizant of how computers have had a negative effect on our ability to make decisions without relying on technology.
