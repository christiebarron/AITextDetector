The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They were expected to work within the bounds of current federal law, which prohibits all uses of vehicles with a "full or partial turn" in any part of the building.

In March 1967, John D. Rockefeller, then the president, proposed making use of a second, and more efficient stage of dirigibility to be installed on the structure.

The construction of the new stage of dirigibility was delayed until 1967, when the National Transportation Memorial Act (NTRAA) was enacted, which allowed a state agency to decide for future stages of construction how many acres can be built in a given year. After that, the state could take steps to develop dirigibles and other devices. A few years later, with the passage of the National Fuel Economy Standard, Congress passed the Commercial Construction, Transport and Maintenance Regulations, which allowed commercial airlines and trucking companies to construct dirigibles.

In an effort to reduce delays, federal regulators enacted the Clean Energy Act, which made the use of fuel cells and other devices for power generation and transportation of electricity and carbon. These rules also exempted certain light and secondary lighting systems from the regulations (hence, the commercial-fueled lights seen in the commercial airplane), and their operators have even been fined. A few decades later, the Commercial Aeronautics and Space Act of 1975 was enacted to create the private sector.
