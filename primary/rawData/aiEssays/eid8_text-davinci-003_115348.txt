My best friend and I had been inseparable since we met in kindergarten. We had seen each other through everything that life throws at you: first loves, break ups, successes and failures.

One evening, we decided to take a walk and just talk about the mundane stuff that usually fills up our conversations. About fifteen minutes later, we'd been discussing the usual, when something ridiculous popped into my head. I blurted out a ridiculous, completely random statement and started to laugh uncontrollably.

My best friend, seeing me in hysterics, just started laughing too. We must have laughed for a solid five minutes as we walked along the street, eventually clutching onto each other for balance. As the laughter subsided, I shook my head and remembered why I valued my friend's companionship so much. No matter how silly or trivial the topic, we'd always be able to find a way to laugh together. 

For me, laughter was the fountain of youth and friendship - a way to keep our bond strong and vibrant no matter the situation.
