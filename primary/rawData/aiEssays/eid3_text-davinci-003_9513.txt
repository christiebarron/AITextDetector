The setting in the short story "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski plays an integral role in the cyclist's experience. Most notably, the setting of this story is a mountain biking trail; this contributes to the cyclist's feeling of physical exertion and difficulty. By being outside, the cyclist is faced with the challenge of traversing the hilly terrain, tight switchbacks, and bumpy dirt roads. In addition, the sunlight filtering in through the trees creates a certain beauty, which paired with the motion of the cyclist, helps create an almost cathartic experience. 

The cyclist's journey is further illustrated by the challenges he must face. He encounters sharp inclines, speeding vehicles, potholes, and narrow spaces. This adds to the idea that the cyclist must overcome challenges and obstacles in order to complete the journey. Additionally, the scorching heat may symbolize the efforts and trials of undertaking such an ambitious journey. 

As the cyclist stops and takes in the beauty of the surrounding area, the imagery and descriptive prose helps to further solidify the sense of elevation. The described smell of mustard and sage, along with the twinkling star-like specks of dirt, create a sense of peacefulness. By stopping and reflecting, the cyclist is able to take a mental break before heading out on the more treacherous parts of the trail. In this way, the setting provides the cyclist with both a physical and mental challenge.
