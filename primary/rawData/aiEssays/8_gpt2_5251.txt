One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I had a horrible experience with the woman I was getting treatment for. After I asked her if she loved me I could hear the sound of a woman getting into a car and taking off her jacket, only to see her running to the edge of the parking lot, a friend was so distraught she told me that she was just scared it was going to happen to me. I told her that I was going to go and see her then, I then thought it's pretty cool for me seeing a picture of her at what she looks like. She was scared. I then thought that maybe I should get her phone number so I'd think about things before going to her. Instead she has been so very cooperative and positive.

After my surgery she told me she would come home soon to tell me everything from where she's gone, what happened and where she is, to what happened to herself, how lucky she feels and where she is now.

She's now a living symbol for the women who live their lives with us. They get all the respect and all the support they deserve for their work.

It's important for all women so that they not only be loved, but get treated accordingly!
