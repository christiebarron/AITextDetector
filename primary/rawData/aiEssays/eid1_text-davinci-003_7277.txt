All of these features add to the challenge that the cyclist faces, while also making it more difficult to maintain a steady pace.

The ruggedness of the trail creates a sense of risk and danger which heightens the adrenaline and puts the cyclist in a state of alertness and focus. This allows the cyclist to be more agile and respond quickly to the challenges posed by the environment.
