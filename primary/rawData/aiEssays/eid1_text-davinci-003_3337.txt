Dear Editor,

Technology has come a long way since computers first appeared on the scene. But are computers really the boon to society that we’ve been led to believe? I believe it depends on how computers are used and how we as individuals use them.

On the one hand, computers have brought amazing advances to medical science and given us unprecedented access to information. They’ve also made our lives easier, allowing us to shop, bank and communicate with people from all over the world in a matter of minutes. 

On the other hand, computers can have a number of detrimental effects on people. For instance, frequent use can contribute to the development of physical and mental health problems, such as eyestrain, posture issues, anxiety and depression. In addition, the current trend of replacing physical activities, such as socializing with friends or playing sports, with activities on the computer can reduce the amount of physical activity we get each day. This can lead to various health problems.

In conclusion, computers have the potential to be incredibly beneficial to society if used responsibly. However, it is important to be aware of the potential detrimental effects and take steps to mitigate them.

Sincerely,
