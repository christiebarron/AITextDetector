To the Editor: 

I'm writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people and the impact they have on society today.

Computers offer tremendous benefits, including a wide range of activities that cannot be done without computers. We live in a time when computers are an integrated part of our lives, and make it easier for us to complete everyday tasks with great speed and accuracy. 

On the other hand, there are those who argue that computers are detrimental to our society. They point to the adverse effects constant computer use can have on our physical and mental health and cite studies suggesting that our brains are becoming more reliant on computers. 

I am of the opinion that, despite potential drawbacks, computers offer more advantages than disadvantages, as long as we use them responsibly. It is important that we learn how to use computers in a way that is beneficial to us. Taking regular breaks from the computer screen, engaging in physical activity, and using computers responsibly can help us reap the positive benefits they offer without negative consequences. 

In conclusion, I hope that readers agree with me that, with the right approach, computers can provide tremendous opportunities.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
