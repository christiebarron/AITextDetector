The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The tower has been under contract for nearly 80 years, so its cost-efficiency and maintenance record will need to raises again as the city grows more accustomed to dealing with the ever-present threat of massive disasters.

But there are other advantages to moving to a low-to-mid-rise, like high-end condos and small office buildings, from the building being too big to handle at a high end, to higher end buildings, like these office towers here on Broadway. The current structure, called the L-shaped building, has a total of 300 floors and is a 5.4-story building. The new tower will be the longest such building to be built in the Lower East Side, and the tallest in the entire Upper East Side, and the top three highest-floor, most complex towers of all time.

So what will those three towers accomplish when the project is completed? Probably something they'll have to do in order to replace the old structure on St. George Avenue, the third and final tower, and possibly change the layout of the three other skyscrapers on the block. The Empire State Building would also allow for a new entrance on the city, to add a lot of space and possibly allow more building space onto it.
