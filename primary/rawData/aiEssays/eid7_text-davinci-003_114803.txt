I was working in an office where I was always helping out my coworkers. One of my close work friends always got overwhelmed with work and found it hard to keep up. Although his tasks would add to my own workload, I was always willing to help him out.

One day, I was swamped with not just my own tasks but helping him with all of his tasks as well. Instead of getting frustrated or annoyed, I stayed patient and helped him through it. I stayed extra hours later than usual that day and was able to get him caught up. While I was overwhelmed and tired that day, I was grateful for the opportunity to help someone in need and that I was able to stay patient.
