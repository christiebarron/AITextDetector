Minfong Ho ends Winter Hibiscus with this line to emphasize the idea of starting again and hope that things will turn out better the next time. It is a reminder that one must keep trying, that the seasons will eventually change and bring new hope. The protagonist has failed the test in school but it is implied that he will try again, a task made easier by the changing seasons that will lead to a new start. The line is also a metaphor for the protagonist's journey as he navigates his own identity: while he feels out of place in school, he will keep striving until he finds a place where he belongs.
