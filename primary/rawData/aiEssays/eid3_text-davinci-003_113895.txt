The setting of “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski affects the cyclist in various ways. It takes place in the Rocky Mountains, where the cyclist is exposed to the harsh weather of the mountainous terrain. The climate is characterized by cold temperatures, strong winds, and higher altitudes that make it difficult to breathe. The terrain is also rocky and uneven, which makes it difficult to find a good path and difficult to make progress.

The cyclist is also impacted by the wildlife in the area. The road they are on is full of deer, elk, and other wildlife that can be hazardous to cyclists and add to the hazards of the road. The cyclist also has to be aware of the occasional bear or mountain lion that may be in the area. 

The cyclist is also navigating a winding road that is full of twists and turns that make staying on the right side of the path more difficult. The narrow width of the road and the hills in the terrain also affect the cyclist’s ability to stay on course.

Overall, the features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead” pose a great challenge to the cyclist. The harsh weather, rough terrain, and narrow path all pose great risks to the cyclist. The cyclist will have to navigate carefully, remain aware of the wildlife, and take extra caution while traveling through the Rocky Mountains on their bike.
