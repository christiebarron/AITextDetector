I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is in essence a fundamental human right for everyone:

"[…] We cannot prevent [censorship], because we cannot compel others to, and without compulsion… we cannot compel others to pay us to read books. Our obligations to one another are of a moral obligation to each other. We may disagree on what constitutes moral obligation or how much. Yet we have different moral obligations to each other, and different legal principles, including, for instance, the fundamental principle of equality of rights and treatment, which forbids the infliction of pain to one another and to one another's property."

In most other countries, the concept of copyright is just one of many aspects of a person's right against censorship. As stated above, such a law does not require the collection and preservation of all the material, not just those that we deem harmful, such as images, music, and text. The right can be applied to other types and types of material, such as books and films, including art, books and other media, with no obligation upon people to give them or others copies of the contents.

Similarly, for publications that are "commercial" at best, such as newspapers or magazines and for websites that serve as a source for media content, the right of "commercialization" may be taken into account. This would also apply to "commercialized" texts and video, including books. As noted before, some restrictions on free speech are also applicable to
