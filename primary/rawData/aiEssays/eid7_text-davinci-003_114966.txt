As I was walking out of the store to leave, I realized I had left my bag of groceries behind the counter. I immediately went back, expecting to find it long gone or carelessly handled. To my surprise, the bag was still sitting there exactly as I had left it.

The cashier, an elderly woman who I hadn't noticed earlier, asked if that was mine. She told me she had been patiently waiting for me to come back and retrieve it. I thanked her sincerely and asked her why she was so patient. She said that since she was also getting older, she knew it was important to be kind to the people around her.

I left feeling grateful for her patience, and I'm reminded of her words and actions every time I think of being patient.
