In “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, the physical features of the setting have a direct effect on the cyclist. As the narrator passes through the small towns and rural farms of the Midwestern states, the landscape challenges the cyclist and affects his perceptions. The roads are rough and pitted with potholes, making it difficult for the cyclist to move smoothly and quickly. Moreover, the hilly terrain forces the cyclist to continuously rise and fall with the undulating hills. These physical features also present hazards to the cyclist. As he traverses the countryside, the narrator must watch out for the wandering wildlife that often traverses the roads unexpectedly. In addition, he must take caution and slow down when passing through the active farmyards with their various machines and equipment. The cyclist also faces the threat of rain, sleet, and snow as he continues his trek. Such unfavorable weather conditions can make the roads dangerous, discouraging travel and forcing the cyclist to take caution. 

All these physical features of the setting profoundly shape the cyclist’s journey as they challenge his journey, both mentally and physically. Moreover, they contribute to the narrator’s overall perception of the landscape and its associated dangers, causing the cyclist to be wary of his environment and preparedfor any eventuality. The features of the setting, therefore, affect the cyclist in both meaningful and significant ways that are integral to the narrative presented in “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe
