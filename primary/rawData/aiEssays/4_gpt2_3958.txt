The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it contains more than a hundred pages of notes so you can make it look like it's meant to be an interesting,83-year-old narrative about a "giant spider that makes her own choices in life; a big hearted child who, after a long marriage with her husband and the inevitable divorce, decides that this is a better way to start a family." I hope you find that fascinating.
