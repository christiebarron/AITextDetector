One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was trying to make it through the pain of not playing my best. Then in March, while sitting on the corner of the stage with my family and friends, I felt something burning inside of me. How could I let all of those emotions get in the way of playing? I did it every day.

After we returned to my room, I noticed our favorite things in the house were all in the box. It was nice to see the beauty or simplicity of a room, I thought. How could it be harder to learn the art of music when so many elements are at the same time used in a music form? It made me realize why so many of the things in our house were so beautiful; the joy of playing music at the same time, when so many are so intricately designed and sculpted.

How about if you will?

It's so exciting.

I love teaching when you can say everything!

When your time permits, you can even create something more original, which is why we did this project together. We didn't want to lose any of our love for doing arts. Music is how it is played. And when this came to be, we did have a chance to make some amazing gifts for you, all made by our friends at the Music Academy in Orlando, Florida. It's fun to show you everything you saw inside of the box from music!
