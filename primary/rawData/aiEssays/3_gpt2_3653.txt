Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. There is very little difference in how many of these points are in the map compared to a cyclist riding the same road to get from one point in the city to another. All these points are taken from one of the very large, most visible towns in the state: Ousevka. This region is particularly well known for its beauty and its huge town centre, and is easily the most scenic place in the country.

However the real effect is far more pronounced: it contains many rural areas, but with only a small number of villages. But even in these, in places like these, there are always towns with large numbers of people.

The villages which form the base of a road also form the centre of the map. In other words, this map of the state of the North of Sweden looks a lot like the way it does elsewhere in the world: it has not been designed to look like Norway at first glance, but looks more like Norway at some point down the road from Oslo. Norway is not so different from the map of the world because it contains a large number of villages and towns which are completely independent; each one is more isolated.

The Norwegian landscape is different but, at the same time, it is as similar as Norway to the map of Denmark, with all the same boundaries, towns, and cities which are already well known and recognized in this world.
