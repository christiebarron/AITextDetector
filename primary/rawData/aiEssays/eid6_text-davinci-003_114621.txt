The construction of the Empire State Building in the early 1930s presented an ambitious challenge for builders: the creation of a dirigible docking station atop the building. To accomplish this feat required skill and ingenuity, as the builders faced a multitude of obstacles.

First, the windows facing the planned docking station had to be replaced with solid steel, in order to provide a strong docking point at the top of the building. Additionally, the metal frames of the windows were filled with solid concrete in order to further strengthen the point for tethering the dirigibles. The plaster and terra cotta stone façade was purposely weakened to help secure the docking mast in place.

The next obstacle was the construction of the actual docking mast itself. It had to be incredibly strong and designed not to sway in the wind. This required builders to use only the strongest steel and specially engineered bolts. The mast was also designed to be wide enough to accommodate the largest possible dirigibles. To ensure the highest level of safety, the steel was also specially treated and painted to minimize corrosion. 

Lastly, the laborers had to retrofit the top of the building for the mooring mast’s installation. This involved creating a platform capable of supporting the large dirigibles and also required the creation of an elaborate series of pulleys and winches. The total height of the mooring mast was 200 feet and was one of the tallest structures in New York City, towering over
