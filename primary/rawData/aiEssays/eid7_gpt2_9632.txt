An example of a time someone in my life was patient was going to the funeral for John. They called with a call from John and said that they had a good reason. John had been hospitalized earlier in the week.

"I sat beside and saw his eyes as he lay there, he looked like he couldn't concentrate. At that time I said, 'Come here, John?' They went up and took John's pulse as if he was sitting on a chair.

"That is the first time I ever heard John tell this story.

"(Morton) went down to see how many people there were. You can't always go to a funeral, but you can go to see the man."
