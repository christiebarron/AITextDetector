Dear Editor,

I'm writing to state my opinion on the effects computers have on people today. We are living in an era where technology has become an inseparable part of our lives. While computers are immensely helpful in making our lives easier and more efficient, it is important to understand how excessive reliance on them can negatively impact individuals. 

There is no denying that computers have enabled us to automate many tasks, such as bill payments, bookings etc., and make life more convenient. People can stay connected to the world with little to no effort. The downside of the increased use of computers, however, is that they can distract us from meaningful activities and conversations. We are so caught up in browsing through irrelevant information on the Internet or playing games that much of our daily life is wasted away. We often forget about the importance of offline socializing and communicating.

Moreover, spending too much time on the computer can lead to health problems such as chronic back pain or carpal tunnel syndrome. According to a research conducted by the Department of Psychology in Netherlands, it was observed that excessive use of computers leads to reduced engagement in physical activities, which further leads to obesity.

Therefore, it is important to realise the need to maintain a healthy balance between the use of computers and the activities that enrich one's mental and physical wellbeing.

I hope this letter will persuade readers to understand the repercussions of overusing computers.

Yours Sincerely,

[
