The construction of the Empire State Building in 1930, a feat of engineering and an icon of tall buildings, presented a unique challenge — allowing dirigibles to dock at the structure’s top. This innovation required the expertise of engineers and the collaboration of the designers, builders, and early aviators. In “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, she recounts the numerous obstacles the team behind the construction of this grand structure needed to overcome. 

The first great challenge was the design of the mooring mast — the large steel mast that was to be attached to the building. The mast had to be strong enough to withstand the wind conditions potentially caused by the large dirigibles, and so, it was designed with a quadruple tiered base and made from steel, the strongest material at the time. The engineers also had to account for the downward force of the mast which put a great deal of strain on the mooring cables that had to be secured to the building and not topple the structure. It was determined that the cables needed to be firmly attached on the 102nd floor’s central core for maximum anchorage and stability. 

The greatest challenge was creating a safe and efficient way to dock the dirigible since there was no existing example of this engineering feat. A safety team designed a unique “Y shaped” aluminum tether which allowed a cable to connect dirigibles to the moor
