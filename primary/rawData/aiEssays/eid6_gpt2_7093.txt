Macdonald to Chicago to develop a system called an A-T test program. This resulted in Macdonald's Air Force Research Office (AFRO) testing a d-shaped radar test machine called a "molecular testbed" with six additional test modules. The test program began in August and was terminated in March 1948 under President Eisenhower's rule. In 1948
