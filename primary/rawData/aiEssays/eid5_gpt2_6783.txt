The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' was often a reflection of the fact that, as a child, I had a deep distrust for many of the elders and the Church. This was not to imply that one person was infallible, but that one could learn the lessons of the past not to be afraid to make mistakes or to take advantage of elders who were in fact flawed or incompetent.

I felt a strong sense of entitlement towards those in authority I knew. These people should be allowed to speak or to have a meaningful voice in guiding us. I think these children were raised in a world filled with people who did not speak up and no one spoke to them. I think of this situation with young children now: young children who would not speak up if I Comte or Giole had asked them to.

What makes me sick about teaching these children is that if I knew what it felt like to be a teenager, I'd be more than a little ashamed to ask them to lead.
