I remember the first time I laughed with him like it was yesterday.

We were out to dinner at a nice little Italian restaurant and had been conversing only for a few moments when he made a joke. It caught me unawares and before I knew it, I was laughing with a booming sound that caught the attention of the entire restaurant.

He just looked at me with a smile and winked, and that's when I knew it was meant for just the two of us.

The waiter was amused too and joked around with us, which only served to add fuel to the fire. Soon, the entire restaurant was roaring with laughter as my date and I ribbed each other back and forth, competitively yet without breaking any boundaries.

I can't remember what we talked about that night, or even what the joke was, but I will never forget that moment. Laughter became the bridge between us, and it was the start of something beautiful.
