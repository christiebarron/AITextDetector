I believe that censorship of materials in libraries makes censorship of content more difficult. What happens when you just read through them? When you read a newspaper or magazine? What about a CD? A magazine? An issue of paper? And if you find yourself trying to learn about that process or to do it your way to making the most of it, then you end up with all sorts of negative experiences, like having your body exposed to things by different people that you can never get from watching TV, seeing films and music and movies, or even taking pictures. These have been very important things for me to learn about because it's part of who I am, and how I want to be a whole person. That's what made me want to talk about this kind of things, of being a person who is trying to learn from what I would not expect, or what I like and what I like and what I don't know.

WITH THE ART

I like to be aware of what I like doing, what I don't like. Sometimes I prefer to take the path I wanted to, and I think when I stop learning a new skill or skill and work on something new, I get an appreciation of what I've learned, and what I want people to have like that. I don't want anybody to be upset about it. People can come up with their own opinion of my work. And I'm actually not at all offended; to them, I'm just an artist
