The ending of 'Winter Hibiscus' by Minfong Ho builds on the metaphor of the titular flower as a representation of resilience and hope. By having the protagonist, a Chinese American student taking a standardized test, finishing with the thought that she will take the test 'again' when the flower (a symbol of her own strength) blooms, it serves to affirm her hope and courage in the face of adversity, showing that no matter the amount of hardships she faces, she will always come back and persist. Thus the uplifting ending gives the message that with enough determination and perseverance, even during dark times, you can achieve great things.
