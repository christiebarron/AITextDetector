This is a metaphor about the cyclical nature of life, and the idea that each time something is experienced, it can be seen from a new perspective. Furthermore, the line is meant to give a sense of hope and optimism to the reader. By ending the poem with this line, Minfong Ho is suggesting that no matter what happens in winter, the warmth and beauty of spring will eventually come. People can try and grow and become stronger, no matter how cold and daunting winter can be.
