The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because of the book's introduction to the world of Ice Fairy, which takes place in the years leading up to the Winter Hibiscus event. This event takes place in the year 10,000 BCE when Ice Fairy is being hunted by the Ice Queen, as shown in Winter Hibiscus.

The Ice Fairy is a powerful magical dragon that resides in the Great Woods of Ice Fairy, which was also seen in Ice Fairy 3. A new Ice Fairy appeared and is not seen from other locations in the book - instead, it is displayed in the forest across the water from the Fairy, as seen in Ice Fairy 3 (Snowcrest and Snowball) and Ice Fairy 5. However, in Ice Fairy 3, it was still in snow, though it has disappeared in Snowcrest.

The Ice Fairy is the "mothership" of Ice Fairy, and they were once both in the same place for most of the movie. Even though their mother is lost, they return at least to Ice City to return to Snowcrest, where they continue their lives.

The following day, after giving Snow, the first Snow Fairy, to ice and snow, she decides to stay there for the rest of her life.
