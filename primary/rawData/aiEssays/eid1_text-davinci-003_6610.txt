Dear Editor,

In this modern age of technology, computers have become an integral part of our lives. We use them for work, entertainment, communication, and research. But, while computers have many advantages, I believe they can also have some damaging effects on people.

The most obvious effect on humans is the physical one. Constant sitting and staring at a screen can lead to neck and back pain, eye strain, obesity, and other health problems. On top of that, our relationship with technology can cause psychological issues such as anxiety and depression. We can become dependent on our computers to the point where we lose our ability to engage in real-life conversations and activities.

Whatâ€™s more, computers can have a negative effect on our social interactions. We become so absorbed in our screens that we spend less time engaging with each other, which can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness. This is particularly true for young people who use technology in place of developing meaningful social relationships.

For these reasons, I believe that we need to be aware of potential negative effects of computers and learn to use them responsibly. Practices such as setting time limits and taking regular breaks can help minimize the risks.

I hope that my readers will take these points into consideration and be mindful of the impact of computers in their lives.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
