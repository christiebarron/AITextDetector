The construction of the Empire State Building in New York City presented one of the most challenging feats for the engineers of the 1930’s. With the addition of the state-of-the-art mooring mast, they would have to face an additional obstacle in allowing dirigibles to dock. Marcia Amidon Lüsted's The Mooring Mast gives an account of the various difficulties encountered in constructing the mast, and of the extraordinary achievement that this would represent.

The foremost challenge was the engineering of the mast itself; the plans proposed a lightweight metal structure that soared higher than any other man-made object, reaching a height of 1,250 feet above the ground. The mast would have to be strong enough to withstand the wind and weather, as well as the enormous weights and forces that came with docking a dirigible. The Empire State Building's designers based their plans off the lighter-than-air mast on the Zeppelin hangars in Germany, but theirs would have to be much bigger and sturdier.

The mast required precise and skilful engineering to ensure the safety of both the passengers and the structure itself. The docking process was incredibly delicate and needed to be without a hitch. Specialized mooring ropes were woven, enabling the airships to be lowered and raised in a secure manner. 

A special type of shaft elevator was also added, capable of transporting passengers during adverse weather conditions. The engineers also had to consider
