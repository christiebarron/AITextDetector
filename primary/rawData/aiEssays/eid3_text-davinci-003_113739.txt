The setting of “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski has several features that affect the cyclist. The most obvious is the physical terrain. The cyclist is on a narrow, winding, and hilly mountain road. The road itself poses challenges for the cyclist, such as steep ascents, sharp turns, and the potential for rocks and gravel that can cause the bike to slip or skid. The winding road also interferes with the cyclist’s sense of direction, making it difficult to plan a route and stay on track.

The weather is an equally important factor in this setting. The cyclist is dealing with strong winds on the mountain ridge, which can make the bike difficult to control. There is also the potential for rain, which can make the road slippery and dangerous. The wind may also carry moisture in the form of fog, making it difficult to see ahead.
