The construction of the Empire State Building was no small feat. As one of the early skyscrapers of the twentieth century, the building's designers and engineers encountered a multitude of difficult technical and logistical challenges. One such challenge was the call of integrating the docking of dirigibles into the building's design. According to Marcia Amidon LÃ¼sted's The Mooring Mast, designers and engineers wrestled with numerous practical and structural implications posed by accommodating dirigibles.

The first issue for builders to grapple with was the sky-high mooring mast they would have to construct to serve as a docking point. Given the height of the building, it was determined that the mast needed to be an additional 200 feet high---a feat of immense engineering complexity. Furthermore, this new structure needed to be strong and durable enough to serve as a stable platform for dirigibles as they discharged passengers. Furthermore, strong wind circulation around the building posed a serious danger to the airships during landing; safeguards had to be built to protect the dirigibles from the gusts of wind.

The logistics of constructing the first dirigible dock in the Empire State Building was incredibly difficult. Ground crew had to be trained for dirigible mooring procedures, and the docking area had to be equipped with utilities and machinery to aid with the docking process. Furthermore, issues of privacy were taken into consideration; separated areas were designed for passengers to disembark without disruption to the other occupants of the building
