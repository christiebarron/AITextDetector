I was shopping at the grocery store the other day, and the line was incredibly long. Everyone was becoming impatient and some people even started complaining about how long we were waiting. I remained calm and instead took out my phone to occupy my time. I figured that since the store was packed, the lines were going to be slow and I wasn't going to let it bother me. 

I saw the cashier helping out an elderly woman whose card was not working. He patiently spent about 10 minutes with her to help her figure out what the issue was. He was so kind and never let his frustration show. I was so impressed by his patience and understanding. He could have given up a long time ago but he stuck it out and eventually helped her out. He ended up helping around five more people in that line before I got to the register. His patience was so inspiring and made me recognize the importance of staying calm in trying situations.
