The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because its protagonist's life is "wiped from him by the wind." And the book was originally intended to be a cautionary tale about what could happen to those in power and government once they let the gods off their heel and end the war on the world, but Winter Hibiscus makes it clear something like that can happen â€“ and that's why a hero like Finn is a hero.

As mentioned before, Ranma Kazoo is one of three children of the same name in Yu-Gi-Oh!

He begins life as an orphan and is given the name of Anubis who is the one who took the whole world down as he was in the first place. Anubis is ultimately driven to the brink and finds himself trapped in a mysterious realm where he spends his time learning what the hell is going on, while also being forced to undergo extreme psychological trauma in order to discover what happened to his parents at birth. In this short story, he's one of eight children who finally get their father back.
