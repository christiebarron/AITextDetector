The issue of censorship in libraries is a hot button topic, and one that I feel strongly about. I am writing to the newspaper to voice my opinion that libraries should not remove books, music, movies, and magazines from the shelves as a form of censorship.

The primary purpose of libraries is to provide access to knowledge and information. By removing potentially offensive content from library shelves, we are depriving our citizens of the opportunity to understand different perspectives and make their own informed decisions. Libraries that censor material do not defend our right to access information, instead limiting the ability to explore ideas.

Furthermore, to remove something from the library shelves suggests that we’re telling people that certain viewing materials are not acceptable. This disrupts the idea of diversity, and the ability to explore different points of view. By exposing our patrons to material they may find uncomfortable and offensive, we’re allowing them to form opinions and make informed decisions, which is vital to a healthy society.

For these reasons, I feel strongly that libraries should not remove books, music, movies, and magazines from the shelves as a form of censorship. We should not infringe on the rights of our citizens to access and consume material available at the library. Instead, libraries should continue to provide our citizens with the access to information necessary to expand their knowledge of the world and create a more comprehensive view of the world.
