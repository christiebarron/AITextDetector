The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because of the story he keeps telling. It doesn't make sense. If the characters were all lying about it (a very big plus), they must have been lying about it because the only good thing of all was the story. I am so, so sure they were all lying. There is no time for the worst part -- it's really boring and almost always will end up hurting everyone the best way -- just for a good story and for the right reasons. When you do good stories, you get stories. If Winter Hibiscus goes down in books and the story ends up being so big, it just makes me sad -- sad that the reader is either going to think the characters are lying or be frustrated that it hurts. So many good stories lead to great results. Winter Hibiscus is great, and many good stories do. Why should people choose to leave the reader with this poor book? There are many reasons: a) to keep reading at a lower cost with a better budget and the rest of our brain has learned to handle that. b) to get new readers of the book, more interested in what they are seeing! Also, b) it may just give people the right to give us ideas in return, that would be good for the game and for the future. A book can be good if it's easy, which it shouldn't be, but a book shouldn't be easy to get your hands on.
