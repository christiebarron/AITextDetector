An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when he took drugs that made a person crazy. After they were arrested, he began to ask them questions. I wanted to take a drug that's making you paranoid about getting hurt, but not sure how to tell someone 'no' unless your thoughts are being influenced by someone else.

But the more often people read about their experiences through their stories, the less they realise they have seen a better person â€“ or worse. When I was working as a police officer, if I noticed that someone would be making a point of telling me how they are mentally ill, I immediately went for a look at how the things they are writing about can get in the way of their personal improvement. It is much easier for me to tell those people the truth about what they want to be and the things they do not want to be and that will make them less depressed. I know a lot of people who have already achieved this and are currently having their lives ruined without any meaningful benefit to themselves, and it is clear why this is the best way to help these people deal with their mental health problems.
