To the Editor: 

The issue of censorship in libraries has become increasingly relevant in our society. Libraries should absolutely have the right to determine what materials are deemed suitable for patrons of all ages. That being said, I firmly believe that certain materials should not be removed from library shelves merely because they are found offensive.  

We live in a diverse society that is made up of people from many different backgrounds, beliefs, and values. Allowing libraries to censor certain materials based on their own tastes and beliefs restricts our collective access to a variety of perspectives. It is important to have access to a range of ideas, including those which we may disagree with. Libraries are a unique learning resource, providing insight into not only different points of view but also in literary works, history, and other topics. 

Furthermore, censorship can be subjective. What one person or group believes is offensive, or inappropriate for a certain age group, may not align with another group's values or beliefs. If individuals or groups are given the ability to pressure libraries to censor certain materials, it gives them an overreaching power to limit other people's access to information. 

I strongly believe that libraries should have the right to enforce age appropriate restrictions on content, such as books deemed inappropriate for young children. However, they should not be responsible for labeling materials as offensive. By censoring certain materials, libraries are unnecessarily limiting our access to a variety of ideas, which can be detrimental to our society
