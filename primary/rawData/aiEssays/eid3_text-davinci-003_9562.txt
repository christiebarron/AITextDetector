The setting of Joe Kurmaskiâ€™s "Rough Road Ahead" has a huge influence on the cyclist, and this is felt throughout the story. Through the writer's detailed description of the environment, the reader quickly becomes aware of the intense struggle that the cyclist faces in navigating the perilous journey.

The most significant environmental feature is the mountainous terrain, which the cyclist encounters. The sudden changes in incline force the cyclist to expend enormous amounts of energy in order to make it to the top of the mountain. The effort is so significant that the cyclist begins to tire rapidly. In addition, the steep grade of the terrain leads to a dangerous downhill run, which causes the cyclist to feel an overwhelming sense of dread.

The uncertain weather conditions of the setting also pose a challenge to the cyclist. A sudden rainstorm complicates matters and forces the cyclist to battle against the force of the wind. The intense gusts of the wind cause the cyclist to lose his balance and even lose control of his bicycle, adding further danger to an already perilous situation.

The cyclist's journey is further complicated by the darkness of the night. With only the moonlight to light the way, the cyclist is moved to a deeply contemplative space. He has little idea of what the future holds, and is left to ponder the potential consequences of his journey.

The setting of "Rough Road Ahead" has an undeniable and immense effect on the cyclist's experience throughout the story
