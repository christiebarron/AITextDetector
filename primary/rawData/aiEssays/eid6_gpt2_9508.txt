"It's impossible to avoid this issue at the moment," said Robby Tippett, the mayor of Buffalo. "There is so much of this on this system. It's just a lack of planning, so there is a lack of knowledge."

A second problem facing the building came with the lack of a proper elevator. The building was built in the 1960s and 1950s to house the Federal Aviation Administration. The building wasn't built for an airplane, but the elevator became a part of the design.

The elevator would never have the ability to dock with anything more than an open roof. Because of the high density nature of space at the time, it would be easier for the building's owners to rent out their building to some private company.
