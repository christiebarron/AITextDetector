One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I woke up in the morning wearing nothing but white socks and a dark sweater and saw Whoever's laughing at me. It was a small group of people, and they looked very tired. It was about three hours from the stage, and I got my glasses out and set my shoes on. When people started laughing, I got up and said, "I'm fine, there's laughter again."


The next morning was in December 2003, and I was working this night at the Museum of Art in San Francisco on the same day. It was a great day. But at one point I fell off my chair and there was a strange flash. I had a sharp cut on my face, and my eyes were red and swollen, and my left arm was bruised. I said, "I'm alright. I can't move or stand still." One of the women who approached me and said, "No, no. You don't have to do this. Just go. Go and enjoy yourself. You're going to miss the great work." The next day I went to work for a while and got out of bed early. The morning after, I had trouble breathing, and I had no idea where I was. We left for the night feeling very tired, but the next morning, I was very excited to go back and enjoy this moment.

It was a great night. People were dancing and dancing and dancing out of the car
