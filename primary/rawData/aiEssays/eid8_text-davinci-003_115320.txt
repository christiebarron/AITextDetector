I was out with my best friend the other day, and we were out browsing stores, stopping to grab a smoothie here and there, and just generally catching up. We hadn't seen each other in a while, so we had a lot to talk about. We were standing in front of a store, talking about our lives and sharing stories, when I noticed something behind her. There was a man a few feet away, throwing a tennis ball for his puppy in the park across the street. 

At first, neither of us noticed the man or the puppy, and we kept going on with our conversation. But then, out of nowhere, the puppy got hold of the ball and was frantically running back and forth in the middle of the street, trying to show the man where the ball was. We couldn't help but start laughing when we saw the puppy's antics! 

The man also noticed us laughing and called out that it was too bad the puppy was his, or else he'd have taken us up on the offer of puppy-sitting. We both burst out laughing again, and after a round of good-natured banter back and forth, we said our goodbyes and went our separate ways. 

I'll always remember that moment, because it was such a classic example of how laughter really is the shortest distance between two people. It brought us closer and reminded me of why I enjoy my best friends company so much!
