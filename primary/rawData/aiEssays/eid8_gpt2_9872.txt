One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my old roommate and colleague were living in LA on a plane. His coworker was a comedy writer – a little too funny for his own good. It ended up being a great episode, because they had worked together at the club for three or four years and had decided that this was an overpriced joke. I don't know how much work it was taking, but the laughter was worth it – and it was a hilarious moment to watch.

I think you ecstatically relate to the "puzzle".

So I feel a bit of a mystery-of-the-week syndrome when my self esteem goes so high I'm able to laugh it off but then when my ego gets so low that it's just a little too much for me to handle, or people get out of hand and get hurt, I'm just like, "Holy shit." I can do anything if I want to, and it's not going to go away, but it sometimes does. So while those of us who are really hard working at the office might have an aversion to comedy in our job, it doesn't mean we are totally unaware that we may as well keep being creative while also being in the best of moods and at the best of all moods, and still enjoy it and enjoy being in charge. And you know how when you do that for two years a little bit later you're on a different level.
