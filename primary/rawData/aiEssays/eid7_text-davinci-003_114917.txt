I used to volunteer at a local animal shelter, and one of my tasks was to take out the cats for playtime. One cat in particular was very skittish, and the volunteers had learned to take her out separately from the rest of the cats. Every time I tried to coax her out of her cage she would hide, claw, or bite, so I knew that any attempt at getting her out was going to take patience.

I decided to sit and talk to her after her food one day and see if I could get her to trust me. I talked to her calmly and used soothing tones whenever she seemed anxious. Gradually, she came out of her cage and after an hour or two, she was purring and rubbing against me. I eventually was able to carry her out and take her into the playroom. It was clear that she felt much more comfortable around me.

This experience taught me how important it is to be patient, especially when working with animals. I'm glad I stuck with it and was able to help this little kitty feel comfortable with my presence.
