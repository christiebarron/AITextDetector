Narciso Rodriguez's memoir 'From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives' is a profound look at life from the perspective of a Latinx immigrant. His family's saga of constant transformation is narrated with an overall feeling of hope and determination.

Rodriguez adeptly spends time establishing a sense of place and ancestry that captivates the reader from the start. The story begins with vivid descriptions of his Cuban-born parents' journey in search of a better life in the United States. He weaves an atmosphere of possibility and escaping limits throughout the narrative, which gives a feeling of fierce pride and resilience. He shows this by making sure that elements of his Cuban heritage and traditions remain connected to their lives in a new country – such as prepared food, music, and cigars. 

The memoir's mood shifts emotionally, from nostalgia to wonder, when Rodriguez moves to his new school. Here, he discovers the possibility of a new identity composed of a mix of American and Cuban cultures, with a hint of nostalgia that tugs at his sense of who he is. 

This idea of exploration and the tension between remembrance and new possibilities runs through the book. Rodriguez’s style gives vivid detail to his family’s experiences, laying a perfect foundation for a mood of warmth and acceptance. They discuss everything from family to identity to dreams. In doing so, Rodriguez shows readers how home is really made up of the people and memories you carry with you
