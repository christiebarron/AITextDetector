Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. If you are planning on a ride through the hills and don't have much to say about the surrounding, open streets of New Westport, then it's important that this section remain relatively quiet. Some areas don't have high public spaces such as parking with signs of high public visibility, so if things are really quiet, you can always go down to the side of the road and use the narrow little street with some pedestrian access to the other side.


Cultural and economic factors make these roads a major priority. However, you likely don't have to be a high official cyclist to experience these areas well. A majority of cyclists will be in New Westport at your favourite times of the day, but there are also some areas known for great scenery and good roads that can be enjoyed by anyone. For example, New Westport Park, where your first round is only 30 minutes away, offers everything you want - walking, cycling, hiking, birding, walking the distance, even cycling in the wind. Other areas of New Westport include the River Ranges and the River Green, which offer a lot of bike lanes, some areas where you probably need to turn left or right to access the river or the river bank and the city centre, but they are also safe and some areas where you want to do some extra business.
