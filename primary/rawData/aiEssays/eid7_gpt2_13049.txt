An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I left my job that we were running as a service company, I was on sick leave, I was in my bedroom. The job was that I'd go out and work, I went to Starbucks, I went back to my hotel room. I was a janitor, a technician, and a cook. In the evenings we would leave a service booth and I'd go to Starbucks and I'd go to a different restaurant. It was my job to help the janitor, so we'd buy snacks, if needed.

We were working on a restaurant that I had a large team at, it just went from one guy to another to work on the restaurant, it meant it was working as a team so it was always one person with one thing on the table, there was no time. The only time when we got sick came at 1 o'clock as tolerated, as was my job. I would come home and I'd have to put it in, that didn't matter. I had to work my body down until midnight. If it was 9 o'clock, I knew it was coming and I was good because everyone looked at me. And there'd be a story about a man who came to work and I'd not just pick him up and drive him home but be at his computer, and that was the only time we had to wait in the middle of the night, I'd be in my house
