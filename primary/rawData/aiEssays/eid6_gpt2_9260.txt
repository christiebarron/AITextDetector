The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They had to overcome their fear of getting caught in the middle, and if they were trapped or the roof were damaged the chances of a collision with the Building's structure were greatly increased. After the death of General Joseph Wilson in July 1862 by a carpenter named John D. Wilson, the building had to be completely moved from a building used in construction work and into a structure intended for construction and storage purposesâ€”the Civil War Memorial Building. All this came at a terrible cost to the building and the public. It took 18 months of building time, maintenance, and reconstruction before the building could go into service again.
