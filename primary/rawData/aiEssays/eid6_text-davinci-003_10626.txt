The process of constructing the Empire State Building with the intent of allowing dirigibles to dock was a major challenge for both the workers and the engineers involved in the project. While the building was being constructed, dirigibles were a popular form of travel and their ability to dock on the first tallest building in the world was seen as a potential technological advancement. Unfortunately, structural and technical obstacles posed significant challenges to the endeavor.

The first obstacle to allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was the sheer size of the mooring mast. The mast had to be constructed from a series of steel beams, since the weight of the mast had to be light enough to support the dirigibles when landing. This presented a challenge, since the cross section of the beams chosen had to be thick enough to support the mast while still being light enough for a dirigible to dock there. In addition, the mast had to be built in a shallow V-shape to provide enough space for the dirigibles to cling to it while docking. As a result of this unique requirement, the engineers had to design a mast that curved more than 250 feet up the building, creating a complicated engineering challenge.

The second obstacle the workers and engineers ran into was the actual process of mooring to the mast. Dirigibles had been designed to dock on mast with a simple hook and rope arrangement. This method was outdated for the Empire State Building, however, as the mast
