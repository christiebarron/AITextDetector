Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. They can include:

In a flat landscape, the Ropeway for a wide straight is very close to the road at the end of the Rope.

In the countryside, people do not have to turn their backs to cars and can walk in between the cars.

People drive at a higher rate of speed than people used to.

People carry more luggage than they used to.

People tend to be more social, with people being more social by being more social.

People walk to places they can easily get around, such as walking or driving. The Rope itself has the same area for a wide straight but a more open end that is very close to the road at the end of the Rope.

There are plenty of places for cyclists to go, with a few places still very far from the Rope.

Driving a bicycle in the mountains is much safer in some ways than driving a car. It is more comfortable and people are able to follow their destinations more easily.

There is more of the same for children riding.
