One time I experienced laughter in my life was when we moved on to make a big project and had our own little party on our big budget room in order to have fun.

We had a wonderful time here as we managed to break the wall and a little piece of the ground between the walls is the perfect spot for a little celebration.

We have a lovely garden, a beautiful patio â€“ these little beauties would have been more fun with the whole little one thing instead of our whole living room!
