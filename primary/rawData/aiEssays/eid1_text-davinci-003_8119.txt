The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Most notably, the extreme height of the building posed a serious challenge. Furthermore, the mooring mast found on the building's rooftop was not designed for that purpose. 

The mooring mast was designed as an antenna for radio transmission, not as an infrastructure for the docking of dirigibles. Therefore, some modifications had to be made for it to accommodate airships. These modifications included additional supports and typically fairly heavy cables slung between the roof and the mooring mast.

Though an improvement, the issue of the mooring mast still did not solve the problem of the building's height. Dirigibles had to be extremely agile in order to navigate an approach to the mast, as its height made it difficult to both find and use. The buildings surrounding the Empire State Building complicated the matter even further.

In addition to the mooring mast itself, the landing surface posed a major problem for dirigible builders. As the Empire State Building had no access to a body of water, gravel, bitumen, or other conventional materials used to cushion the landing of airships, the engineers at the time had to make adjustments to the building's infrastructure and equipment. Modified davits were installed to take the strain off the mast; cushions and canvas mats were added to protect the roof and the dirigible; and several extra lines were installed to hold
