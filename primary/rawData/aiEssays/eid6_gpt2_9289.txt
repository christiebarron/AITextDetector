The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. For example, many of the tower's three entrances would have been open to vehicles but the building's roofed windows were designed for a single-room building with just one-story windows, and the second story was designed to have one floor that could fit a living room. Additionally, the building's ceiling was rather low, making the height of the building much less than necessary to give room to two vehicles.

The Empire State Building's design also required a new bridge between East Side Avenue and Fifth Avenue. By the late 1920s, the bridge was planned to be completed by the end of the '40s. The new bridge was built by the New York City Bridge Authority and was to accommodate the Empire State Building for up to 10,000 cars. The bridge ultimately reached its initial peak in 1930, with the construction of the Empire State Building in 1932.


By the 1950s, the Empire State Building had an abundance of amenities, including elevators and escalators, light, television, restaurants, and a new television set.


Despite its early improvements, the building eventually collapsed. The building's original layout (first proposed in 1856) was changed in 1956, leaving only the roof and second floor of the Empire State Building as the master plan. In 1961, it was repainted to its original colors which, in addition to the original lighting, changed the look and feel of
