I remember walking into my classroom on the first day of school and being so incredibly nervous. I had never been in this situation before; I hadn't yet met my new classmates or teacher, and I was an outsider to the school.

My teacher was a kind individual who was patient with me as I slowly made my way around the room. He didn't rush me or pressure me to make friends right away; instead, he gave me the space I needed to get comfortable in my new environment.

He respected when I wanted to be alone and when I wanted to interact with my new peers. He was patient and understanding as I slowly began to make friends, and he was always encouraging me to take risks and put myself out there.

I am extremely thankful for my teacher's patience with me that year. It enabled me to feel safe in an otherwise intimidating new school and made it possible for me to learn and grow.
