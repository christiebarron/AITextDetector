I was out to lunch with an old friend the other day. We talked about all sort of random things from new trends to our plans for the future. After talking for a while, it seemed like the conversation started to get serious. Suddenly, my friend joked about something, and it was so random and absurd that it caught me off guard. I burst out laughing, and that just seemed to set her off, too. We were both laughing so hard that tears came to our eyes. It was one of those moments where everything else just fades away, and you are simply enjoying the moment. The laughter was pure, uncontainable, and really brought us together. In that moment, laughter was truly the shortest distance between us.
