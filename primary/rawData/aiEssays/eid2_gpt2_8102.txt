I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a critical first step for us here. The current censorship in some libraries is very small. The content we publish online isn't always safe. These issues are being taken very seriously now, not just with library management systems but with the whole of libraries.

I wrote about censorship in 2010 but didn't tell you about the problems that came with it in 2009 when I was in the US. In that article I was a bit critical of censorship of printed comics, which still doesn't seem to me to be as controversial today as it was in 2009. Today, as with the other major issues of print censorship, I have no doubt that there is a need for new methods which can prevent content from being put out there, but those are topics that I think many people have had significant problems with. There are good and bad reasons for what have happened; there are not enough people on the Internet today to support one of the causes I have listed above and there's no alternative in the matter. In general, we must go back for a while and say, "Oh, OK, that, that could work. Maybe we should give the libraries a shot, but at some point we wouldn't have this problem anymore."

The fact is, the problem is not merely that our public libraries are underfunded, but also that we do not have the capacity to be so efficient so that a library that has some of its assets at stake can't possibly
