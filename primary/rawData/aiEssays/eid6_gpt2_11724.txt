The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They did this because the Empire State was under attack by enemy forces, with many civilians and diplomats in distress. With the aid of a number of private firms and the help of a number of military officers, they were able to secure many private houses and buildings as part of their defense of the State Tower and the National Palace.

The first private sector sector building of the time was the Federal Building. This large, brightly-lit piece was built under the patronage of former Deputy President Joseph J. McCarthy, and was made up of three parts: the National Palace, Federal Building and the Federal Building. The Federal Building stood atop the Federal Building, which was about 30 feet in diameter, and was built in 1882 for the federal government. For this purpose, the building underwent a great deal of change.

A large portion of the Federal Building had to be demolished to accommodate the need for a new Federal Building, designed to facilitate foreign competition for Federal Government contracts. Under the previous Building, there were seven private dwellings spread across two acres, all under a single office building. The Federal Building in 1885 was located next to the Federal Building, located about 300 feet from the National Lobby. That building's interior had been partially completed in 1882, and in 1895, it was opened for the public to observe the ceremonial opening of the Great Hall before its dedication.
