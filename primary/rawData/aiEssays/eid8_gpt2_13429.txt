One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I review videos from The Simpsons and then see if I can get through a sentence without getting lost. I have become so obsessed with the humor aspect of the series and to me that's a great thing.

When do you think of yourself as an author when you're getting paid?

Honestly, it's been a great joy and a lot of fun just trying to sort of write and write. This year? I'm pretty sure it will be two years before I'm fully aware of how long time I want to live, since this is something that is absolutely in my bones.

Is there anything you're sure you're going to do differently this year?

Well it's definitely a really fun year to be at home and to be home thinking about projects and projects. It's a really great time, it's got a blast, we can actually get to know the community better because with this year I got to get all the resources I needed from Reddit for me, because there's a lot I can do about this.

So is there anyone else you'd like to interview?

You'll read my interview with Mike Fassbender on April 7th.

Update: As usual, my interview has been finished and will begin tomorrow.
