I recently had a situation where I had to be incredibly patient. I was cleaning my house for guests when I found an unfamiliar insect. I knew little about bugs and was very scared of it. 

I calmed myself down and remembered that I needed to be patient with the situation. I was feeling helpless and frustrated, but I decided to look further into the bug and find out what it was. That way, I could figure out how to best deal with it. 

So, I did my research and found out it was a ladybug. I was relieved to find out it was harmless, but wondered why it was in my house. I thought of what could I do to not harm the ladybug.

I was patient and determined to find the most humane solution. So, I opened a window and then placed a cardboard with a bit of honey on it. After a few minutes, the ladybug crawled onto the cardboard and within seconds, it flew out the open window. 

It was a difficult situation, but being patient paid off. I was relieved to find out the bug was harmless and I was able to help it find its way back outside.
