Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. You may not need much knowledge of how it is done.

When doing a ride with your bike, a certain amount of cycling behaviour can cause issues: The higher the volume of riding, the greater the risk of a collision. A typical scenario with a heavy cyclist causes'strong' stopping to be the most dangerous. This can be achieved by driving too slowly up the road, or even going faster than usual to avoid being caught in traffic as this reduces the chance of a collision.

How is the driver to prevent the problem: When in control, the driver's approach is correct, and the cyclist's actions meet those requirements and are met. The rider is also able to avoid many accidents, particularly if it is during a full session, when the driver also makes an initial pass, by choosing to use a wider wheel position and moving on his approach when you need him to. If you only see heavy cyclists, the road is safer. The same goes if you see cyclists who appear to be 'too' tall, like people on bikes who are sitting too close to the edge of the road.

How the driver applies brakes: The brake pedal of any brake pedal can also produce a large amount of force when it is applied to the ground, but sometimes the pressure of an external accelerator can cause excessive rotation so that when you are pushed against an obstruction it is unlikely that a cyclist will
