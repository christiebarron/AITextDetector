The winter hibiscus is a metaphor for courage and resilience. The protagonist, a young girl, had failed a test at school and felt very sad and discouraged. The winter hibiscus blooms despite the cold winter temperatures and inspires her to have the courage to try again. The closing line highlights how the return of spring is a metaphor for the need for strength and optimism to try again; when the winter has passed and the fresh flowers bloom, she will also have the courage to try again. This serves to encourage the protagonist to stay positive and continue to grow despite failure or difficult circumstances.
