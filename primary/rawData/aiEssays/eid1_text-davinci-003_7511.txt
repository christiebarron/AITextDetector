The ending of Winter Hibiscus evokes a feeling of hope and possibility, even in the face of doubt and fear. By suggesting that the hibiscus will be budding in the spring, the speaker is communicating that they are looking forward to the future and that they can find signs of hope in the passage of time. This hope is symbolized in the line, "then I will take that test again," which implies that the speaker will try again and that they are not giving up despite the difficulties they may face. The passage is also a reminder of the ability of nature to endure and the power of resilience and determination.
