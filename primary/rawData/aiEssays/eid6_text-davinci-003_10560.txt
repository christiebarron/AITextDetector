The attainment of permission to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was no simple feat. Despite the great technological and engineering achievements of the 1930s, nearly twenty years of legal and technical obstacles needed to be tackled before dirigibles could moor at the Empire State Building.

The journey began with a visionary engineer, Dr. Hubert Dean Phillips, who recognized the potential of allowing dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building. Phillips drafted plans in 1927, but unfortunately died during the Great Depression. His vision seemingly died with him, as the technically and legally complicated process of mooring dirigibles was deemed too difficult and even dangerous to pursue.

That all changed in 1939 when the Empire State Building Company engaged Marcia Amidon Lüsted to help them with the problem. Problems to be solved included how to ensure the comfort and safety of dirigible passengers while safely keeping them at the upper observation levels of the building, and how to arrange for a safe transport from the Empire State Building to the ground. Additionally, Lüsted had to propose just how the building should be modified in order to allow enough room for the dirigibles to dock.

Lüsted set out to prove that dirigibles could safely dock at the Empire State Building. She suggested installing a “mooring mast” 460 feet up the side of the building, which would be made of steel and feature special notches to hold the dir
