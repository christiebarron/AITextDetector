The Empire State Building was an audacious feat of American ingenuity and engineering when it was constructed between 1930 and 1931. However, one of the most ambitious aspects of the building was the plan to allow passenger dirigibles to safely dock at the building's top levels. Unfortunately, the plan to give dirigibles access to the building faced numerous difficulties.

The lack of a suitable location for the dock was an immediate problem. The setbacks needed to avoid obstruction of views and to create a safe operating area for the dirigibles would have drastically decreased the revenue generated from the upper floors of the building. After rejecting initial ideas to build a modular dock atop the building, the engineer, Reverend William Steven, designed a true mooring mast to be affixed near the top of the building, allowing the dirigibles to dock safely at any time. 

The design of mooring mast was the next major obstacle. Modifications had to be made to prevent the mast's pivotal action from interfering with the building's structural stability or the safety of the passengers on the dirigibles. Steven's ingenious design compensated for the changes in the mast's center of gravity as the dirigibles became attached and released, preventing the mast from becoming a hazard to the building or its occupants.

The most challenging part of the process was the endeavor to keep the mooring mast weight light enough that it didn't constitute too much of a strain on the building's structure. This
