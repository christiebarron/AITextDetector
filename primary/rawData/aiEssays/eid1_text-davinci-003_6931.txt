In recent years, libraries have faced increasing pressure to censor materials that many people find offensive. On the one hand, it is understandable why someone might want to protect themselves and their children from certain materials, which are potentially harmful. On the other hand, restricting access to materials in public libraries is an extreme violation of free speech and a narrow-minded approach to education. 

Public libraries are intended to provide an introduction to a variety of topics and experiences. They provide wide-ranging knowledge and information that may not otherwise be available. Libraries are a cultural asset to every community and they should be free from any type of censorship. 

If certain materials are deemed too offensive by members of the community, they can simply choose to refrain from accessing them. Libraries should make it known that patrons are under no obligation to check out any materials which they find disagreeable. In addition, public libraries can provide a wide selection of materials from a variety of perspectives that are acceptable to the vast majority. 

Censorship in libraries is a dangerous and slippery slope that could ultimately lead to the restriction of information and books from our childrenâ€™s future. Since knowledge is power, it should not be withheld from any person for any reason. It is our responsibility to ensure that the public library remains an unbiased educational institution that provides freedom of knowledge and encourages intellectual inquiry. 

As citizens of the United States, we should proudly defend our right to access information in libraries without the fear
