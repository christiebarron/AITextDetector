An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I came out of a dark tunnel, I felt something come over my face, I felt another. I think of it as one of the most terrifying things that a child might ever experience.

"I know the last time I was told a child died, that was at my school. After I went through class, one of my teachers asked the children the same way, she said she thought she never had a child at any school in that time. One day I saw her face, I was at home, and she had taken away the keys, which were found at the back of my school car with her note, and you don't hear the voice of her or even hear the words. I was so scared I ran into my office for help.

"The child on the back of my car was not only in pain, she had not even touched anything she had placed within her bag. The key on the driver's side of my SUV was with the dead baby. My friend, from my class, and her friend from the other one's class had been with them for three and a half hours, and they were all very excited to see us. I have just finished taking her home, and I heard her talking with her father. After that I went to see her mother. The last time she left my school was at a family reunion. I remember her giving a statement to the family about this incident
