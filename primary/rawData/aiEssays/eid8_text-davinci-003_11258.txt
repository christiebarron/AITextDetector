It was my graduation day and I couldn't have been more excited. I was ready to start a new chapter in my life, but my family wanted to make the day special. We decided to visit some of the landmarks around town, and when we saw the first one, my dad couldn't help but break out into a cheesy tourist impression. We all burst out laughing, and it was a moment that forever will stay with me.

It wasn't just that particular moment, though. I remember vividly many other moments with my family where laughter helped us create a strong bond. Whether it was making fun of the silly things I said as a child, having fun during family game nights, or just telling jokes, laughter was always a way for us to connect.

Laughter is powerful in a relationship, and I am forever grateful for the amount of laughter my family has shared over the years. To this day, laughter is still what helps us get through tough conversations and disagreements. It's one of the reasons why my family's connection is still strong today.
