I used to volunteer at a donation centre and it was a great experience. Every day, we would have hundreds of people lining up outside waiting to donate food, clothes, and other essential items. The people were very enthusiastic, but it was clear that they were also very confused and overwhelmed.

One particular day, there was an elderly gentleman who had been waiting in line for quite some time. He had brought some donations for us but, due to his age and failing health, was unable to carry them inside. I offered to help him and walked up to him with a friendly smile on my face. He may have been disoriented and uncertain, but he kept his composure.

He smiled back at me and thanked me for my help. We carried the donations into the hall together, and I could see the relief on his face. 

Seeing how thankful he was for my help gave me a feeling of fulfilment. It also reminded me of how important it is to be patient towards others when faced with difficult situations. Patience is a virtue that everybody could benefit from.
