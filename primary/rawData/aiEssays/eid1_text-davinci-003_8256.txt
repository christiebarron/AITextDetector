The building of the Empire State Building was a major undertaking, and one challenge that faced its builders was enabling the Empire State Building to accommodate dirigibles docking there. 

The architects of the building believed that accommodating dirigibles would be a noteworthy and iconic feature of the building. However, allowing a dirigible to dock posed a host of safety concerns and technical issues. 

One of the first issues was finding a suitable way for the dirigible to attach to the building. Initially, the architects considered a metal mast that would be affixed to the roof, but this posed several problems. Deploying the mast would be a dangerous and complex affair, as it would require sending a team up in a cage onto the roof in the hope of locating a sturdy anchor point and securing it. Furthermore, the mast posed a new issue of creating a heavy wind load on the roof of the building, which it may not be able to withstand. 

After considerable consideration and debate, however, a better solution was found. It was decided to construct a mooring mast corridor that connected the thirty-fourth floor to the roof. This corridor, designed from lightweight duralumin, would also provide a shelter from wind and rain for the dirigible's passengers during docking.

The construction of the corridor was no small feat. Its structure was designed to prevent the dirigible's anchor line from staining the walls, and multiple safety measures had to be implemented to ensure
