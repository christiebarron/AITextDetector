The ending of the poem provides a metaphor for the struggle of overcoming challenges. It reflects the idea that the strength of the protagonist gave her the courage to face her fears and anxieties, and to try again. The return of the geese, warm weather and blooming hibiscus in the spring represent a new opportunity for her to face her exam again, perhaps with more confidence. It also serves to show that even though there may be difficult times, there is always hope that things will get better.
