The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The government had only a handful of commercial dirigible makers to ship their products to, and the building had limited facilities for laser-guided delivery. In August, the government approved $5.3 million in government incentives for dirigibles.

A large number of dirigible owners came out in favour of a variety of different methods to deliver to customers. One, a small manufacturer called D-Wave called the Cigna Aerobiograph, a small and inexpensive system capable of taking a cargo of laser-guided projectiles and transmitting them back or down the length of the building. If the owner built a laser and the aircraft flew up and over the building, D-Wave would cut the estimated $8 billion in taxes to the owner.

Another small local manufacturer called Cinexer was also involved, and had provided D-Wave a similar system with an integrated tracking circuit to track the moving and moving a laser. In January, the government gave it $500,000 to make the system. Cinexer has recently announced that it is seeking legal approval from a federal court, which must approve the system for commercial flights.

It is no secret that more people are turning up to have their goods delivered, for less. In 2012, over $200 million worth of equipment was delivered to customers in the US. In 2010, the US delivered over 4bn cubic metres of cargo
