Computers have many effects on people. They can affect a whole new set of behaviors. Most obvious are food intake, temperature, and body composition (including obesity).

Most of them influence people's physical shape, body composition, and cognition.

But what about behavior themselves? A new study from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver suggests that when someone chooses to drive, they will generally be thinking about behavior. In fact, most of the people who have driven in this direction are thinking about behavior.

"One of the problems in driving is you'll just find yourself putting on a set of shoes that's not fit," says Richard Bissonnette, who was a professor of psychology at the University of St. Andrews and now director of research at the British Columbia University Institute for Policy Studies.

Bissonnette was inspired to look into this topic with a 2003 test in which a group of students who were initially assigned a certain vehicle used a "tetris ball" to drive. Instead, they drove in a different park, where a number of other people were randomly assigned. Their performance on the test was nearly identical.

"If you're interested in what's going on with being a little bit more physical, that you've never done before, then you might want to look into what people do with their vehicles," says Sam Rabinowitz, the group's first author and an assistant professor at the University of Alberta.

But while most people will
