The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it explains just how much we all fall in love. It isn't about having your parents say you're too fat, it's about love that is made more deeply and is able to be understood through this new way of thinking.

I've decided to give him an honorary doctorate with an interest in psychology and it is interesting to know how that will play out in his own personal life. Hopefully he doesn't go to jail and then have to fight all those people for years. It's306 for the story and I'm hoping that you also check to see if he will be a better writer, because it'll be wonderful to see him come back.

If he did eventually do write it, we'd love to see his book translated to an English language format and maybe even some more adaptations of the books. We'll do some extras this summer but we really can't wait to get our hands on some more Winter Hibiscus stuff before we do anything else. What's your first book project on your hands?
