The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it was written by the same author that I have found it so very fun. This book also had no "no-words" warning and had been edited to the best of my knowledge. It is a work of art and has a great deal of potential to turn the book into something fantastic.

One of the most interesting things about Winter Hibiscus can already be told by reading this book. Every now and then you come across this book in your collection and just never hear of its owner! I can tell you that my wife had been a HUGE fan of this book from day 1! Winter Hibiscus is now on sale at the local bookstores all over America and I would not be surprised if it is in there when I see my old collection. Please tell me if you ever find it anywhere near your new collection!

I recommend trying out Winter Hibiscus and you would be a disaster if you try to go back and read more!
