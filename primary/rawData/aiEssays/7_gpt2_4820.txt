An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was 20 years old, it was two days of sleep... I was in bed, my wife sleeping. She died a few minutes after my bedtime show at 8 o'clock.


I remember waking up and there was my wife. She started to wake me up in the middle of the night and I didn't recognize her. I knew for a fact she "%s", but I didn't think it was the time. But the point was that she had given birth to my baby and she was pregnant. That was the last of my knowledge and I knew. After that experience I realized I loved her. That was the first thing I wanted to find. If nothing else, I wanted to know more about how we can make a difference in the lives of others.
