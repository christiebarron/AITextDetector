The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it provides an essential starting point for anyone new to my thinking to read with a good understanding of some of the ways in which you can become more self-empowered. It is a great introduction to the book and helps guide you step by step to becoming a better player instead of simply watching the same old stats over and over. The author will tell you how to take risks and how to survive, but, for the most part, doesn't even attempt to tell all the details. The author will teach you a few of the tricks that can help you succeed in the long run. The game is written in Ruby, so you can pick your favourite languages you can learn, but, as a gamer and a good friend, this should cover even the basics of how to play the game.The chapters end with a short and nice chapter called "The Sword of the Lion Prince", "The Dance of Thirsk", and the following chapter about hunting the "Daughter of the Bear Queen". It also had "The Secret of the Lion Prince", "The Magic of the King", and some very useful links and tips about how to play the game and get a better understanding of Magic. You may not agree with this chapter one, I know that, as a gamer, I think it's a good starting point. So stay tuned!


My take: If you read this, you'll find this game fantastic. If you don
