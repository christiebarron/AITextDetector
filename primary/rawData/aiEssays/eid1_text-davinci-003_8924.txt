To the Editor,

As technology continues to advance, computers are becoming increasingly ubiquitous and inescapable. But with this progress comes great consequence; how are computers affecting people today?

It is undeniable that computers offer us great power. These devices provide us with knowledge, allow us to communicate easily with each other, and connect us with those from all around the world. However, there's no denying that there are negative side effects that come with prolonged use of computers as well. From hand and wrist problems caused by constant typing, to sleep disturbances caused by night-time monitor usage, excessive use of computers can take a toll on our bodies.

Furthermore, computers can disrupt our relationships, interfere with work, and lead to obsessive behavior. Without proper regulation, we can easily become consumed by the internet and neglect our responsibilities. It can also lead to feelings of anxiety and isolation, as people spend more and more time in front of their screens.

That's why it is so important that we take the necessary steps to ensure that we don't fall victim to the unintended consequences that come with using computers. We must set limits for how long we use our computers each day, and we must be mindful of how our devices are affecting our lives. We should make an effort to use our devices responsibly, and be aware of the risks they pose.

I urge your readers to consider the effects of computers and take steps to protect themselves.

Sincerely,
