The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho provides a hopeful message. The protagonist has taken a test that she is anxious about and tells the reader that when the spring comes and the hibiscus is in bloom, she will retake the test. This conveys the idea that, just as the hibiscus will rise again in the spring, the protagonist will also have a chance to take another try at the test with more confidence. The metaphor of spring and the hibiscus blooming gives hope that the protagonist will make a fresh start and have a chance to prove herself.
