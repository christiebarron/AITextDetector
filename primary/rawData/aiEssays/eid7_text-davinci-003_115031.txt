When I was younger, I was always impatient about any and all tasks. I always wanted to rush and get things done as quickly as possible. That all changed when I started volunteering in my community.

One of my favorite volunteering experiences was working in a soup kitchen. Here I learned firsthand the importance and value of patience.

Every morning, I would arrive at the soup kitchen excited to make a difference. I quickly learned, however, that patience was key if I wanted to get anything done. There were often long lines of people in need, and we had to take the time to listen to their stories and help each person as best we could. We weren’t able to move on quickly from one person to the next. Instead, we had to be patient as we interacted with each person and served them some food.

This taught me an important lesson about the importance of patience. I learned that rushing through tasks didn’t necessarily mean they were being done efficiently or effectively. Sometimes it was important to slow down, take the time to engage with people, and make sure that everyone’s needs were being met. 

I developed this respect for patience that has followed me throughout my life. I now strive to stay patient through difficult tasks and challenging interactions.
