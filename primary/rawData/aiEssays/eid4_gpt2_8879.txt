The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because of its simplicity. But I've always liked its style, and even though there's a reason for the story to have this kind of structure, it doesn't have to! A good story starts with a simple set of goals for the story and ends with big goals, which I guess is what happened here.

And, of course, there's the 'donate' and 'win' missions for all you awesome writers out there. That was the best part.

And, as for setting and story design, I was so impressed by the way the author ended this game without having to change anything from the game. There wasn't much to write about in that section and everything to build on. I think it's great that the author spent half the book on this one.

I wouldn't be writing a simple RPG without a lot of story development. There's really no point in this story if you really didn't want to go any further and build on something that didn't existâ€¦

It doesn't get better until there are a bunch of different stories told, maybe. But I have to say, I think
