I was once helping my big sister take care of her four young children during the summer. She was a single parent, mired in a tough situation, but she was always incredibly patient with her kids. Despite their constant energy and impulsive behavior, she never lost her temper or yelled. Even when they were running wild in the house and refusing to clean up, she remained composed and calmly asked them to help.

It was amazing to watch her stay so patient with them. Sometimes her patience would be tested the most - like when she had to cook dinner and do laundry at the same time, all while trying to keep the kids occupied. But she was always adorably patient and persistent.

She taught me so much about being patient that summer, and now I strive to apply some of that same patience to my own life and relationships.
