The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. These included heavy machinery, the need to build a high-speed rail system and a system for charging electric cars.

One such obstacle was the fact that the building is so narrow, many of them could not be lifted out onto the deck.

The first of these problems was realized when the state agency that built the Empire State Building decided to add a high-pressure elevator in January 1999.

It cost $2.9 million and was financed by $1 million from the U.imental Army Foundation. After that the state had to pay for a third project.

With an additional $300,000 built from the Federal Railroad Administration, the project was completed in January 2001.

The first major issue with the high-pressure elevator program was that it could take up to two minutes to install, or even more, than the standard 3-minute installation on the building deck.

These requirements went unfunded. The state finally spent $22 million on the project, or 6.6 percent of the state's overall total, in the fiscal year 1999-2002 school year, or 4.3 percent of fiscal year 2004-2005.

But the construction and maintenance of the building was not an easy task. Many of the many engineering challenges involved in designing a high-pressure elevator were too large to be tackled by just one team.

The solution was
