One time I experienced laughter in my life was when in middle school I heard a joke about making a woman feel really bad so that's what led me to learn to smile more honestly, and as a teenager I didn't try. I had lots of experiences dealing with anxiety from bullies but didn't really understand the point. You have to learn to look at things in a positive way. When I was growing up, I always looked at that face of the bully. This day is more of an emotional face of the bully's than a reflection of their reality. Being in a high stress situation often brings you up to speed, and you think of things and what it means to them and that makes you more happy. It will teach you things about being a good parent, for yourself and for your child, and it will teach you to look at things you can handle more.

I learned to be grateful the most, to help and protect myself and my family after being bullied, and it taught me much about myself and about how I needed to look after myself, especially after school, when I can get home and spend as much time and energy as I can in a positive way that I believe is important to helping out others. I think that's very inspiring, and this is a part of an important journey to learn how you can go big for your family and how you can take it to the next level when you become a mom.
