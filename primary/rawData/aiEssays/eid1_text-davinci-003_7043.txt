Dear Editor,

As a patron of our local library, I am writing to voice my opinion about censorship in libraries and its effects on our community. The library is a place of learning and expression where access to a variety of materials, both good and bad, should be provided to all patrons. While I understand the need to protect our young people from adult and inappropriate materials, I do not believe that certain materials - such as books, music, movies, and magazines - should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.

Censorship in libraries limits our access to knowledge and new perspectives and could create an unhealthy atmosphere of censorship in the community. If certain materials are deemed offensive and removed from circulation, then it sends a message that some views are not welcome in the library. This could be damaging to the expression of free thought and opinions. It is not the libraryâ€™s place to become the moral authority for our community; that should be for individual patrons and their families to decide what is suitable for them.

In addition, censorship in libraries could be viewed as an unwelcome form of government regulation that has no place in our community. Libraries should remain a safe haven for patrons to seek out knowledge and entertainment without fear of being judged or censored. Removing materials from circulation infringes upon our right to access information and be entertained without fear of censorship or restriction.

I strongly believe that libraries should keep their selection of materials open and should remain free from
