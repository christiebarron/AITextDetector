When I think back to the first time I met him, I can't help but smile. It was in the theater, just after the movie had ended. As the lights went up, he turned to me with a funny comment that made me laugh, and looking at him I realized that I hadn't laughed so genuinely in a long time. Without having to say anything, we both knew that our friendship was going to be full of laughter.

Over the years we’ve been through a lot, and that first moment of laughter just set the tone for our relationship. We’ve bonded over bad jokes and puns, shared laughs over inside jokes, and watched countless hours of comedy together. We’ve created endless memories that are so rooted in laughter that they’ll stay with me until my last breath.

That’s why I’m always so thankful for the special bond that laughter has given us. We both know that nothing can take away the closeness that we feel, even when things around us start to feel chaotic. Laughter has allowed us to keep reconnecting to each other, and I know I can always rely on it whenever I need a smile.
