One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was playing chess on my computer when there was nothing funny to worry about. Now I know why it's so funny. My favorite line is about a young woman going for a stroll and making her way home. Even though she only knows a few words, she says, "I need you to do this." Why does she need me and can I do it now?

I am glad I got to the point where I realized that the joke was worth it. It doesn't only make me laugh. It makes me feel good about myself. The truth is, this is what gets people who are "tired" into their day lives. It's the whole point of not getting enough sleep.
