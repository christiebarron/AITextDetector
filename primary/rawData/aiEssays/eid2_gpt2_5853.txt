I believe that censorship of materials in libraries and public areas, including those of religions and ethnicities, is a fundamental right of free expression," Boudreau said.

The legislation would also bar organizations engaged in promoting terrorism. The National Rifle Association and another group named "The League for Nonviolent Coord Wetlands Protection," both of which promote their wares.

The law does not apply to public health work, but it would give the executive director of the New York Times the right to hold a reporter in contempt of court, while he was still on leave. It would also create new rules for how journalists may be fined or imprisoned for violating its law, according to Boudreau, who said the language was "pretty harsh".

"There are a lot of people out there who are very angry about anti-hate laws that are not in existence," said Boudreau. "They want these laws to be repealed."

The bill would set a $25,000 fine for anyone who uses or promotes terrorism, including those involved in the Sept. 11 attacks in New York and London, as well as its $5,000 fine for a reporter who reports on the death of another person or event cited in the legislation.

The bill drew outrage from civil rights organizations, which praised the move at a news conference.

The National Association of Evangelicals said Boudreau's words "are a step backwards from the days of the NAACP's first days"
