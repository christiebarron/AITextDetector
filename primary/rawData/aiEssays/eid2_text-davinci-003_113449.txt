In today's world, censorship in libraries has become a controversial topic. While many people believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive, I argue that such censorship is not only unnecessary but also damaging. 

Censorship of offensive materials discourages intellectual freedom. To be well-informed individuals, library goers should be exposed to all types of information to form their own opinions on the matter. Censoring materials limits a person’s diversity of perspectives and may result in bias-basedthinkings. Libraries should provide open access to different kinds of materials in order to promote intellectual freedom. 

Moreover, censorship in libraries can lead to unequal access to information. It is hard to define universal standards of what is offensive, and this can be especially true in diverse communities. Once materials are removed from the shelves, some readers may never have the opportunity to learn from them or to explore their own cultural heritage. Therefore, censorship of certain materials in libraries fails to serve the public benefit. 

Ultimately, libraries are institutions that serve to inform and educate the public. Censorship of materials can limit a person’s intellectual freedom and compromise a person’s access to information. Taking away access to different kinds of materials and ideas defeats the purpose of public libraries. Therefore, I argue against censorship in libraries.
