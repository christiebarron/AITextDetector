At the time of the construction of the Empire State Building, dirigibles, or airships, were becoming increasingly popular with the public. This presented a unique challenge for builders of the Empire State Building: allowing dirigibles to dock on its roof. In Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s book “The Mooring Mast”, we can better understand the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock safely.

The first major obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock was the size of the structure itself. At 1,454 feet tall, the Empire State Building presented a challenge for the builders, as any dirigible docking apparatus built on the roof would need to be equally large and sturdy. As no other building had been constructed that could accommodate such a large airship structure, the builders had to design and construct the dock from the ground up.

The second major obstacle was created by the size of the airships themselves. The largest dirigible at the time was the USS Akron, which measured 785 feet in length. This size presented a unique challenge for the builders of the Empire State Building, as the airship dock had to be large enough to provide a safe and wide landing for the airship, while still being able to withstand the powerful winds generated by the airship when it docked.

The third obstacle posed by the proposed airship dock was
