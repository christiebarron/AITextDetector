Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people and why I believe readers should agree with me. 

Technology has allowed us to make advancements and progress in almost every industry, and computers have undeniably revolutionized the way people live. We can now access information and communicate with others from around the globe. Technology has also created job opportunities, improved healthcare, and enabled people to stay connected with loved ones. 

However, there are also drawbacks to the use of computers. It can place people in a sedentary lifestyle, leading to health issues such as obesity, depression, anxiety, and physical discomfort. Too much screen time has also been linked to decreases in concentration and critical thinking skills.

This is why itâ€™s important for people to have a healthy balance between their digital and real life. Taking a break from screens can increase productivity and our overall wellbeing. Taking time to complete activities offline such as going outside, spending time with friends and family, and taking up a hobby can be great alternatives to browsing the internet. 

In conclusion, computers have revolutionized the way we live and can be beneficial when used in moderation. I strongly believe readers should embrace the good and be aware of the bad effects it can have.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
