I remember a time when I had to be very patient. My family and I were at the airport, waiting to board our connecting flight. There was a delay due to mechanical issues and it felt like we were stuck in limbo. As the flight status was changed a few times, people started to get frustrated and began complaining.

I wanted to join in the grouching but I reminded myself to be patient. I knew that things like these were a part of travel and that it was out of our control. So, I chose to remain calm and embrace the delay. Everyone else around me was still complaining but I chose to focus on different things. I wrote in my journal, listened to music, and talked with the people who chose to stay positive.

Eventually, we were able to board and our flight went on as planned. This experience reminded me to stay patient in challenging situations. It's easy to get caught up in all the chaos, but I know that if I remain patient and focused, even the most difficult situation can be manageable.
