 

Dear Editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects that computers have on people. After years of research, I firmly believe that, on the whole, computers have been beneficial to society. 

We are constantly exposed to computer technology every day, both in work and life, and it has changed our way of living for the better. Computers have revolutionized the way we communicate and work, enabling us to be more productive and efficient. People can now access information more quickly and effectively, share data and documents across the globe, and stay connected with each other from all over the world. Computers have helped us solve tough problems, from medical research to space exploration.

Of course, there are some drawbacks, but the vast majority of people find computers to be an indispensable tool. We use them to shop, learn, work, and play; they have become our go-to source for entertainment, news, and information. Therefore, I believe that computers have been incredibly positive and effective in our lives, and that society should embrace the advances that come with them. 

Thank you for your time and attention.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
