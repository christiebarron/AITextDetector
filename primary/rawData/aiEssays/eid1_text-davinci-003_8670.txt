I was walking down the street on my way to meet my friend for lunch when I heard a loud laugh coming from a nearby alley. Out of curiosity, I stepped closer to investigate the source of laughter.

At the end of the alley, I saw two old ladies. One was sitting on a bench next to a mail box and the other was standing in front of her, holding a can of paint and wearing a large paintbrush. Both of their faces were lit up with laughter, and I could see why the moment I heard their conversation.

The one who was painting was telling her companion about how her husband had just put in an order for an oddly shaped chair from the furniture store. The other old lady was shaking with laughter and kept wiping away tears of joy, prompting her companion to carry on the punchline with ever more exaggerated details.

I stopped in my tracks and watched them, smiling along with their laughter. Listening to their conversation helped me break out of my day-to-day monotony and for a few moments, it felt like nothing else mattered. I soon went on my way but the moment of laughter stayed with me until it was time for me to meet my friend.
