When I think back to that moment, that moment when I first met her, I can't help but smile. I remember walking up to the coffee shop, my stomach knotted with nervousness. Approaching the table where she was sitting, I couldn't help but feel like I was going to fall flat on my face.

But then she looked up and smiled. Suddenly, the words that had been lodged in my throat seemed to flow freely and the nervousness I had felt instantly melted away. Before I knew it, I was laughing. And I genuinely meant it.

We talked for hours that day, about everything and nothing at all. We talked about books, music, films and politics and everything in between. We shared jokes and stories. We agreed, we argued, we laughed.

It was always like this when we were together. Our conversations could turn serious or silly, but the laughter was always there. That's when I realized that laughter was more than just a punctuation, it was a bridge, connecting us two souls together. 

As time passed, our relationship grew and the laughter never stopped. No matter how much life seemed to throw our way, we could always count on laughter to bring us closer.

That's why I cherish our laughter. It's that small thing that we turn to when words fail usâ€”and it's that kind of laughter that truly brings us together.
