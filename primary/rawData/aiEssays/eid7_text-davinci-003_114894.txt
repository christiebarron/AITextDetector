I remember once when I was at the post office to mail some packages. The line was incredibly long, but I didn't mind. Everyone was frustrated, but I just kept to myself and accepted that I would have to wait. I kept my calm and remained patient. Then, things got worse when the teller got to me and realized I didn't have enough stamps. Instead of getting frustrated, I just stepped out of the line, bought some more stamps, and eventually got back in the correct spot in line. 

It was a challenging experience, but I was thankful that I was able to keep my patience and get my packages mailed.
