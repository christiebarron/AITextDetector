The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' by actor David Stoller reveals that the author has not even been able to go by the title since he was a kid. It is a very sad story.

"He is my hero," he said. "He's a man who did what you want, took risks and changed the culture of the theatre world. His career has just passed me by, he does not regret it â€¦

"Maybe he thought he was going to die in 2003, but then he took the chance and decided that was his choice. This is a man who didn't regret all. He does not regret doing his part."
