Ho ends the poem with this question to emphasize the cycle of life and hope that no matter how many times one may fail, there will be a new opportunity for growth. The hibiscus flower, which is being used an extended metaphor to represent the speaker, is a resilient symbol of regeneration and strength that emphasizes the idea that just because something ends doesn't mean it won't someday return. This idea of renewal instills optimism in the speaker even though they have faced failure and are feeling uncertain about their future. This ending line helps remind us that hope is never lost.
