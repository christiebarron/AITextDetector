The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it leaves you with quite a certain kind of feeling about whether to take this to another level in any way. And at the same time, it gives you some great ideas for how to do it that you should feel more comfortable with and I certainly hope that it could do for you a great deal to bring you joy in your work. At the very least, Winter Hibiscus doesn't just show a level head who is just coming from a background point of view and I hope that that gives you some much needed context for making choices about what you're going to do to move forward in your career. And I hope that it allows the publisher to come up with a way in which it can really take advantage of that. It leaves you with a sort of confidence in how you can bring a certain intensity to your work. "And with that said, I just want to thank you for putting this book online. Thank you so much. Thank you so much, and I hope to see you next year, and I want to thank you for having fun."
