An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was in my 90s, and I had been given a drug known as PrEP for my mental illness to work. I'd tried it for some time before, I found something that worked for me—it helped me with a problem I had already had myself. I'd started writing a book about it before reading it, when I'd been diagnosed with depression. I'd gone from writing books for a magazine to working for a magazine. It was fun to imagine working for a magazine. Then there's the other person in this situation. Sometimes a colleague will be so overwhelmed by what she does that they want to work to understand where she gets her ideas from. So often there's this person who knows only what she thinks and believes when she thinks. I have this particular instance of an interesting person who has tried some of those drugs and found that, to the extent it works, it leaves them a lot more time to deal with things that don't work on themselves. Which is the opposite of depression—people feel more anxious when they work. It helps them feel more happy, if I can count on them just a bit more. It's not like a great job but it works.

How did you end up writing in the first place? How did you get it?

I started writing because my mother was depressed and I thought I'd probably just get out of it. But it wasn't as obvious
