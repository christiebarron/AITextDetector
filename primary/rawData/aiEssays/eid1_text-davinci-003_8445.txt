I recently had the privilege of volunteering at a local soup kitchen. As the day came to an end, I noticed an elderly man waiting patiently by the door. He was clearly in need of help and I asked if I could assist him in anyway. He looked at me with an expression of great relief and said he was there to pick up food for his sick wife who was too weak to leave the house. He then thanked me for my time and said “God bless you” as he left.

I felt so moved by this experience. Here was this elderly man, who was so patient and understanding even though he was dealing with such a difficult situation. It really made me think about how we can often take patience and understanding for granted. It was a reminder of how powerful those qualities can be in making life easier.
