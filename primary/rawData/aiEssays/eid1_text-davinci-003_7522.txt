In Winter Hibiscus, the speaker is reflecting on the metaphor of the plant as a representation of her academic struggles. The hibiscus is a symbol of her own strength and perseverance despite the difficult odds she is facing. By ending the poem with the assertion that she will take the test again in the spring, the speaker is suggesting that she is undeterred by her current struggles and will continue to work hard to achieve her goals. The ending serves as a reaffirmation of her commitment to her own journey, and her confidence that she will eventually succeed.
