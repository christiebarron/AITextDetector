As I entered the room, there was a tension in the air that I could feel. My heart sank, as I knew our relationship was on the rocks. I was here to try and salvage what we had, and I was determined to make it work. 

I glanced around the room, searching for any sign of life, until my eyes rested on my partner. They were sitting in the corner, their face turned away from me. I took a deep breath and stepped forward.

"Hey," I said quietly.

There was no response, so I tried again. 

"What do you say we have a little joke competition to lighten the mood?" I said, trying to keep my voice light and friendly.

Finally, my partner turned around and looked at me. There was a twinkle in their eye, and I could see that they were thinking about it. I stepped closer and continued.

"How about you go first? What's the funniest thing you can think of?"

My partner thought for a moment before cracking a smile. 

"I've got one!" they said. 

They proceeded to tell me a joke, and even though I had heard it before, I couldn't help but chuckle. Then, I told them one of my favorites, and together we laughed until our sides hurt. 

In that moment, I knew that our relationship could be saved.
