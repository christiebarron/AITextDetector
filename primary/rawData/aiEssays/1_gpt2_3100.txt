Computers have many effects on people. They influence everything from our lives to habits, lifestyles and preferences. So the question now is: Can we do more.

"It is possible to design a device with just some of the potential benefits that come with those benefits," said Lasseter. "There are more than 100 different kinds of devices you can put in there, all of which have been created at the computer level. Those all work with the same effect. It's very early in design. It's a little early, but it's very early."

If design is more important than computing, what matters is to enable people to make more choices, to create new ways of experiencing and living. If computer technology does that, how can businesses, communities and governments get to the point of wanting to create more and more of a culture of choice for their customers?

"If a few simple rules can't be implemented without some kind of'me alone' feeling, then you have to build systems that enable people to feel more comfortable together, rather than having to spend time each day being more isolated," said Lasseter. "That is a very hard challenge."

To understand why things aren't all fun and games all the time, we had to dig deeper into the human brain, using deep learning and deep learning paranoiacs to try and understand what makes people tick each other off each time.
