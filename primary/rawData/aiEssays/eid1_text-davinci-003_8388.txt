I recently had to deliver a presentation in front of a room full of people. I remember feeling incredibly nervous and my heart was racing. I already had a lot of ideas in my head and was eager to get started with my presentation.

As I talked to the crowd, I could feel my pulse quickening. I was worried that I was going too fast and that I wasn't making my points clearly enough. I worried that the audience wasn't understanding me. 

Instead of panicking, I took a deep breath and focused on being patient. I reminded myself that the audience didn't expect me to be perfect and that it was okay if I stumbled. I went back to the start of my presentation and made sure to speak slowly and clearly. I repeated my points a few times and answered any questions that anyone had.

This patience helped me get through the presentation without getting too flustered. It was a success! I was proud that I had learned to be patient in a difficult situation.
