I can remember it like it was yesterday. I had been struggling with depression for a few months, trying desperately to break out of my funk. I had no close friends and was wallowing in self-pity.

One day, while waiting in line at the store, I felt a tap on my shoulder. I turned around and saw a young woman looking me in the eye. She was smiling widely and holding out her hand for a handshake. I was so taken aback I couldn't think of anything to say, so I just shook her hand. 

To my surprise, she started making fun of me, but in a good natured way and with a wink. Soon, we were both laughing uncontrollably at ourselves, like two friends who had known each other for years. I felt so energized by this simple interaction that I was immediately in a better mood.

Since then, that young woman has become one of my closest friends. We still have a good laugh almost every time we see each other, and it's always reminded me that a simple shared moment of laughter can be enough to break through even the darkest of emotions.
