Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. For example, a rider's 'feel', an element of judgement to assess the current speed, may be affected by whether to slow down or rise and fall at speed.

What is 'Rough Road Ahead'?

Rough Road Ahead is defined on the website as a bike and a public accommodation. It was first introduced in 2015 by the Department of Transport and Environment, the National Bicycle Advisory Committee (NBMAC), Cycling for Work, and Transport in 2017.
