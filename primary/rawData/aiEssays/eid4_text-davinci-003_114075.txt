This line serves as an uplifting ending to the story, expressing hope and optimism. The winter hibiscus symbolizes the protagonist's difficult journey, and by ending the story with her anticipation of the seasonal change and promise of a new beginning, Minfong Ho implies that the protagonist is ready to move forward and take up the challenge of her dreadful test one more time. It also conveys the idea that things can change when the seasons do â€“ that the winter hibiscus may eventually bloom again, and that the protagonist, too, could have a brighter future ahead.
