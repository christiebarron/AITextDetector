Once, I was visiting my grandparents in rural Pennsylvania. It was the middle of summer and the heat was oppressive. I was exhausted from the long drive and really just wanted to get my suitcase in the house, take a shower, and relax. As I pulled up to their house, I noticed many of their neighbors were sitting outside enjoying the evening. They waved and said hello, but I was too tired go over and greet them properly. I wanted to make a good impression, so even though I was exhausted, I stopped to say hello and chat with them for a few minutes. It was really kind of them to take the time and talk to me, and I was grateful that I showed enough patience to take the time and not come across as rude. After I said my goodbyes and finished my conversation, I was finally able to go to the house and get settled in.
