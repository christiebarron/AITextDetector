I was visiting my mom at her new home when I first experienced a real moment of connection with my mother through laughter. It was a pleasant summer day and we had been chatting for awhile about her new neighborhood. Our conversation began to slow, and I was about to get up when out of nowhere my mom said something so completely unexpected that I couldn't help but burst into laughter.

It was a silly comment about why it seemed like her neighbor's porch light was always on, and for some reason it just tickled me in just the right way. I'm sure it was the combination of being away from home for so long and the sheer absurdity of what she said that made it so hilarious. 

My mom and I both laughed until we had tears streaming down our faces. The rest of the conversation that followed was a lot less awkward than it had been in the beginning. We opened up to each other in a way we sometimes don't, and even after a few minutes of complete silence we were still able to carry on a casual conversation without the usual dread that sometimes come when re-engaging in conversation. 

That was the moment I began to truly appreciate the relationship I have with my mom, and the bond we had through laughter. I'm so thankful I had this experience, and that the simple bond of laughter can bring two people closer together.
