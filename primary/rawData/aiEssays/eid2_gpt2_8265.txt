I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is not always effective when done by professionals to remove information about the subjects. When it does, it can lead to a loss of freedom of expression or of freedom of religion and/or a loss of religious feelings or of people's rights on the basis of political affiliation, nationality, race, etc.

My hope is that the censorship process is well, and that the libraries can move forward to restore the important institutions we so enjoy, particularly after decades of underhandedness and censorship.

I feel safe going to work with you.
