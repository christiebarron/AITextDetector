An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a student who would go to school and the first thing she did was pick up a bag of groceries the week after they went to bed. So I made a note to my doctor so she could keep it for her daughter and so when we went over the last two months, they'd had an idea for some extra days. I was a huge nerd so I didn't want to make a mess of it or anything.

So we had a couple of months to make this kind of arrangement and eventually they said, "Okay, let's do it." That was a really cool idea. When she comes home home from work, she'll pick up the money, she'll turn it over and she'll sign it off. Because she actually didn't need it. But we have an agreement that we'll be paid in full. When my daughter comes home from school at night and she's taking her stuff, she's doing all the laundry or she'll play in the yard without it getting in the way, but she wouldn't be able to play. So she won't have to pay me. So that was great, actually. She'll start to get a sense of her rights when she comes home. She'll never feel like she's on her own. When she comes home from work she can do all the work and she can do the laundry. If I get so upset after that she'll take her stuff
