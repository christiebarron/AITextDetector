The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho is symbolic of hope in the face of adversity. The speaker in the poem is a student who is struggling to pass a difficult test and is feeling overwhelmed and discouraged. Since the hibiscus is a winter blooming plant, it provides a symbol of hope in the midst of the winter season, when everything else seems dark and difficult. The ending of the poem suggests that, just as the hibiscus will bloom in the spring, the speaker will also be able to rise above their difficulty and pass the test when the circumstances are more favorable. Through this ending, Ho suggests that, even in the midst of adversity, there is hope for a better future.
