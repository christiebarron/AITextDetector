I remember the first time I met my husband. We had been talking online for weeks, but neither of us had the courage to ask for a date. This day, however, I had finally decided I had to do something. So I took a deep breath and asked him to meet up.

That day, when we finally met, I remember being so nerve-racked I couldn't say anything at all. Thankfully, my husband had more confidence, or maybe he was just as nervous, and he started making silly jokes. Before I knew it, we were both laughing hysterically.

I was so relieved to find out he had such a great sense of humor. After that, we started seeing each other every week and would always make each other laugh. We would come up with silly nicknames, crack up at stupid jokes, and spend hours simply laughing.

That's when I knew that the bond between us was strong. Even though we were up and down from the beginning, laughter was like a constant in our relationship. Our laughter kept us going and always filled our hearts with joy and warmth.

It's been five years since that first meetingâ€”and I still laugh with my husband every day.
