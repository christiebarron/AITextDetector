It was the night before our anniversary, but all week had been full of both of us being very busy with work and not really able to give each other any special time. I was feeling a bit down about this and was trying to think of ways to make up for it. 

My partner had decided to surprise me with a romantic dinner for two. We were walking to the restaurant, both feeling a little bit awkward and not knowing quite what to say to each other. Then, out of nowhere, my partner said the most hilarious joke I had ever heard. I laughed so hard that I couldn’t even breathe. 

As I was trying to catch my breath, I looked up and saw my partner looking at me with such a soft and content smile on their face. I knew nothing was more important to them in that moment than to make me laugh.

We finished the evening with a full belly and just as much, if not more, love in our hearts. Before we parted ways, I gave them a big hug and thanked them for the best anniversary that I could ever ask for. 

Laughter is truly the greatest gift of all and I’m so grateful to have it in our relationship.
