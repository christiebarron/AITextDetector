The ending of Minfong Ho's Winter Hibiscus reflects the protagonist's internal struggle to take the upcoming test and achieve success despite the obstacles they face. By symbolism of the hibiscus, a flower which normally does not survive through the winter, the protagonist finds strength and determination to pass the test by renewing themselves during the long winter. The hopeful return of the geese in spring signifies the possibility of success for the test taker, by putting their focus not on the difficulty, but the hope of what might come after. The ending is reflective of the protagonistâ€™s renewed sense of determination and hopefulness, which will make them take the test again after the winter and potentially achieve success in the future.
