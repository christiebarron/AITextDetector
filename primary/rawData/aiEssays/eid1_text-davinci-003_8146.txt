The Empire State Building was a remarkable feat of engineering when it was completed in 1931. While it was designed with amenities and features that made it an iconic skyscraper, one feature stands out in particular: it was the first commercial building to have a permanent mast designed for docking dirigibles. Despite its innovativeness, the engineering and construction process of the mooring mast was met with numerous obstacles. 

The first challenge was finding a safe and cost-efficient way to construct the mooring mast. The mast was needed to be strong enough to hold the weight of a dirigible, but also light enough to be able to be constructed on the top of the Empire State Building. To address this issue, the designers decided to construct the mast from aluminum which was light yet still able to bear the weight.

The second obstacle was finding a way to secure the mast to the top of the building. The designers had to come up with a way to ensure the mooring mast was attached securely, as wind and vibration caused by the dirigibles had to be taken into consideration. To achieve this the engineers decided to build a circular mooring platform and install four guy-wires to provide stability and withstand strong winds.

The third challenge was the lack of technological capabilities as pilots had no precise way to control the ascent and descent of their dirigibles. The pilots had to rely on their visual perceptions and estimations when approaching the Empire State Building
