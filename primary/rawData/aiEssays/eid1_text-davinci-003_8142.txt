The desire to provide a safe and convenient public air transportation system was great throughout the 1930s. This was especially true in New York City, where the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building became a reality.  However, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of obstacles when it came to allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the building.

The first major obstacle was the environment. In order for a dirigible to dock safely, it was necessary to control the wind and wind variables at the top of the building. To this end, innovative engineering had to be used to install long steel tubes or “mooring-masts” atop the Empire State Building, which would act as wind shields and mooring points for the dirigibles. This was an expensive and time consuming task, and required the builders and engineers to work carefully in order to ensure that the mooring-masts were effective in controlling the wind.

The second obstacle in allowing dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building was the size of the mooring-mast itself. Due to the sheer height of the Empire State Building, the mooring-mast needed to be exceptionally long to reach the upper decks of the dirigibles. This not only increased the cost of the project, but also presented several mechanical and engineering challenges. The mooring-mast needed to be strong and durable enough to
