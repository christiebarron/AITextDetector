The cyclist in Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead” is faced with a situation that is a mixture of challenging and perilous elements. The cyclist is situated atop a mountain, and according to the lyrical description is draped in fog and "gray". The fog shrouds the cyclist in uncertainty; the limited visibility of the fog prevents the cyclist from seeing what lies ahead, thus emphasizing the haphazard nature of the trip.

Additionally, the darkness of night further increases the cyclist’s uncertainty; with no celestial lights to illuminate the route, it is as if the cyclist is navigating the mountain in the blind. The combination of the fog and darkness adds to the cyclist’s vulnerability, creating a false sense of being outside of reality.

The cold weather of the mountain exacerbates the cyclist’s peril, as the coldness of the mountain descends and forces the cyclist to shiver and feel "frozen" in the environment. This seclusion adds to the theme of inexperience; being alone and cold in such a desolate setting can be both frightening and awe-inspiring for someone not familiar with the environment.

The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski all contribute to the cyclist’s perilous situation atop the mountain. The fog, darkness, and cold all heighten the uncertainty and vulnerability of the cyclist, bravely taking on the dangerous environment.
