I was waiting in line at the local store to buy some groceries when I noticed the person at the head of the line was puzzled and filled with confusion. I assumed the cashier had a technical issue or maybe the shopper couldn't find what they were looking for. So I patiently stood there and waited as shop assistant and the customer worked it out.

Finally the cashier called for the manager to come and help figure out the issue. The manager was running late so I watched as the customer waited patiently for almost 30 minutes! I was beyond impressed with their calm and collected nature in a situation that could have easily gotten out of hand. As a reward for their patience, the manager not only resolved the issue but gave the customer a discount on their purchase too!

It was a much needed reminder of the importance of patience in life.
