The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' (published in November and December 2009) seems to have been so much higher, that it's easy to miss all the new stuff added since. I'm not saying the memoir is useless, but it's just a better, fuller statement of everything in the book.

I don't recommend a full-length biography, because writing a book or a biography can make it too tedious for you to finish. It's always good to have a full-length biography, but if I'm not sure what's needed for you, I'd suggest taking a look at a book that's not a complete biography.
