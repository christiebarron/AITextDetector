The idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was highly ambitious and came with its own challenges. As described in ‘The Mooring Mast’ by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in trying to make it possible for dirigibles to dock.

The first obstacle dealt with the actual construction of the building and creating a suitable docking station. A mooring mast was designed to give passengers the ability to alight into the building, but the mast was significantly higher than any other mooring mast ever constructed. It was important for the mast to be strong and cable-dependent, allowing a large airship to be attached. This was a difficult endeavor, as the mooring mast was 1,250 feet high, and was subject to all types of wind and weather. 

The second obstacle involved the wind. The ideal wind speed for an airship to land is around 5 knots, but the wind velocity at the Empire State Building was much higher than that. In order to combat this, a framework of guy wires was installed around the mooring mast – this provided the necessary stability for an airship to dock. 

The third obstacle was security. The mooring mast had to be outfitted with the necessary safety measures to ensure that passengers and crew were safe. The walls around the mast had to be lined with protective panels to shield airships from contact
