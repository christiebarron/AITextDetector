Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my opinion on the effects computers have on people in today's world. It is my belief that computers offer a wide range of advantages to our lives that, when taken advantage of, can improve our quality of life.

In the past decades, computers have been used to complete mundane tasks much faster than people would have been able to do them manually. Furthermore, computers have allowed us to gain access to vast amounts of information quickly and from any geographical location. This has obviously been immensely beneficial, especially to researchers, scientists, and students.

Additionally, computers are capable of assisting us with everyday tasks, from providing us with entertainment to helping us with meal preparation and shopping. Computers can even help to manage our finances and remind us of medical appointments that we may otherwise forget easily.

Finally, computers can open the door for individuals to connect with each other at any time. One can contact friends and family who live far away, as well as find and form new relationships. This has made the world seem much smaller and created an arguably better quality of life.

In conclusion, though computers have their risks, such as cybercrimes, they have had a great positive effect on our lives. I implore the readers of this paper to make use of all the advantages that computers offer in order to improve their daily lives.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
