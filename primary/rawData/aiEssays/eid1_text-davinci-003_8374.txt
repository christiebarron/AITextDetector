I have always been a very patient person, especially when it comes to dealing with family. A few years ago I remember taking my son to his first ever baseball practice. He was only five at the time and was of course very excited but also quite nervous. I tried my best to help him and be encouraging.

As practice started I could sense he was overwhelmed. There were a lot of other kids and when the coach asked them to run he started to cry. I remember feeling embarrassed at first, and wanted to do everything I could to help him. But instead of getting frustrated, I stayed patient. 

I went up to my son and first just hugged him for a minute. Then I started talking with him and telling him even if he didn't get every play down, as long as he tried his best that was all that mattered. After a few minutes, my son gained his confidence back and was ready to join the team. I stayed near him throughout practice so he would know I was there if he ever needed to talk. 

In the end, him staying and completing practice made me so proud. The patience I showed was worth it in the end and it made me realize the importance of being patient and understanding, especially with young children.
