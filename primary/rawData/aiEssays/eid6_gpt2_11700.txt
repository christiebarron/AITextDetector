At some point, that dome had to be replaced â€” because the dome was invisible and couldn't be lifted or lowered from the ground. And they couldn't lift the dome from a ledge above it (so the first obstacle is Woody. And it was always Woody in those days, too!). These days in Seattle at a small city council meeting, a bunch of planners who had been trying to make big projects have all said that they had to go back to drawing, for example, so you Minoritized the dome a bit, because "it never came down."
