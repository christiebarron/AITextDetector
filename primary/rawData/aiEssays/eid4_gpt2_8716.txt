The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it breaks down the entire thing into two parts for each section. The first part takes place in an uninspiring castle where everything is perfectly arranged, the second part is in a vast maze and in its very fabric, the second part has become a nightmare. The novel was built through the need for an explanation and through so much fun and humor in the book, which takes me back a couple of centuries and is absolutely a joy to read and to read. I wish I had that in my life; I guess I just didn't know how to read it.

4 of 5 people found this review helpful This is a great book for anyone who is looking to get some good insight on some of these topics. The author's work often is pretty much out of place in terms of a single topic. I agree that I'm a bit of a nerd, but that's about it. Although I can tell you from experience that it is a very well written book and I'm sure the author will be well-read by those that prefer other books.
