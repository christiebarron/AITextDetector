One time I experienced laughter in my life was when everyone told me that I'm not funny and that I need to be like this, that I am a good person. I don't have anyone who can pull themselves out of that shit. I've seen them laughing, you know, or if they're mad with something, because their first laugh is "It's not funny!" They like to shout in English and yell something at you from the top of their lungs. That way they don't get so close that you realize how far from your own brain that you've heard them. So, I think they're gonna laugh in English. That being said, if you are into that sort of thing, I would say it's better if you are out to get me. I haven't been to Japan in over 20 years. Even though I've lived there for the last 20 years. I've gone to Japan 20 years. The way I live now is that once a while in Japan people ask which time would I be in, but I'll tell them if I was in Tokyo, which one would I be playing in? I really don't care. Sometimes I have a chance to be on the opposite side of things. I just go home and go get a nice dinner. That's it.

Worst Case: If there's an example that strikes a chord for fans, it's The Hangover. From the moment you watch it, how was it before it was released?
