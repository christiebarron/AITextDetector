The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is particularly bitter, with the ex-girlfriend of a former colleague in a very poor way â€“ she even called him "the worst fuck", writes the former coworker. When she tells him he is "drowning shit like a child", that really sucks for her, she is so unhappy she stops writing, as does her daughter, who has an almost impossible time writing on her own:

I feel like a child. I want the truth to come out, the truth to be told out loud. I'm terrified that now that my daughter's name has been exposed to the media, I might not know everything about my daughter's life or have the courage to step forward and challenge them to believe they had a right to learn. I think I'm probably making a terrible case that one of my daughters is a child.

So many things seem obvious from within this account. These are just the most typical traits. It doesn't feel authentic like a memoir does, so it really comes down to personal experience. All of these are hard to define and all are difficult to share, but I have done so with love and concern and even courage.

In fact, one of my favourite memoirs and I love you for that. It's one of my favourite book. I love that you are able to find this deep, wonderful feeling, to take it all in and move on.
