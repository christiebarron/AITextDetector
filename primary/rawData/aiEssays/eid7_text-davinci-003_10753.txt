I recently went shopping at a busy outlet mall with my teenage daughter. As soon as we arrived, my daughter dashed off in a hurry to the shops that she wanted to explore. I followed slowly behind her, trying to keep up with her as she skipped from shop to shop. 

After about twenty minutes of aimless wandering, my daughter finally found something she wanted to buy. However, the store was incredibly crowded and the line to get to the cashier was long. In my mind, I was getting a bit frustrated, but I didn't want to show it to my daughter, so I forced myself to stay patient. 

I suggested that we take a seat and wait our turn. As we waited, the line shifted slowly forward, but it took a very long time for us to get all the way to the front. By the time we finished, I was feeling pretty exhausted, but I still hadn't let any of my frustration show. 

My daughter beamed when she finally got to the register and paid for her purchase. As we walked out of the store, I held her hand and thanked her for her patience. I'm so glad I was able to stay patient and enjoy the moment with her.
