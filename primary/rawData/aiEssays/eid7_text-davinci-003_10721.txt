 

I remember once when I was grocery shopping in the middle of a pandemic. I was in a line that was unusually long and it stretched down the aisle and around the corner. I could feel the rising impatience of the other shoppers, but I was determined to remain calm. 

Although I had been waiting for what felt like hours, I still smiled and remained friendly despite all of the people pushing and shouting around me. I wasn't going to let everyone else's lack of patience discourage me from showing mine.

Eventually, after what felt like an eternity, I was finally at the front of the line. Although I had been the one waiting, I was still grateful to the cashier, who had to deal with all the irritability that had come before me. I asked her how she was doing, and we even ended up chatting for a few seconds before I left. 

It was inspiring to see how she was able to stay so patient and friendly while being constantly surrounded by stress and hostility, and I hope that when I'm in a similar situation in the future, I can remain as patient and understanding as she was.
