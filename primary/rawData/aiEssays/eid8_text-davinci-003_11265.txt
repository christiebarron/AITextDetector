I'll never forget the first time I met my partner. It was one of those moments that you know will stay with you forever. 

We had been talking on the phone for weeks, but when I arrived on the day to meet her, I was nervous and unsure of what to expect. As I pulled up to her house I steeled myself for what came next. Yet, I couldn't help but be a little hopeful. 

I stepped out of my car and I could see her silhouette waiting for me on the porch, and when I got close enough to see her face, I felt my heart race. I couldn't believe how beautiful she was, but even more than that, I loved her big, bright smile.

As we began talking, I became more and more nervous, until I stumbled over my words and ended up saying something ridiculous. But instead of being embarrassed, all I could do was laugh at myself.

And as I laughed, I looked over at my partner, and I could see that she was laughing too. In that moment, I felt a connection with her that surpassed anything I'd ever felt before. She understood me, and I understood her.

That moment of understanding, of finding laughter in even the most awkward of moments, has become the foundation of our relationship. We both recognize that a few shared laughs can go a long way to connecting us with each other and the world.
