One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my wife was sitting next to me and I pulled out an open coffee table with a long drawn out poster and said 'hello'. Then I realized I didn't really know why it was because I didn't say a word because I didn't even know what laughter is.

My wife smiled as I moved to stand there and she turned away and whispered to me in deep breath, "I know, I think, just like you." This I still find to be the most honest smile I've ever gotten. I just can't do it again.

Laughter is amazing in every way. You want it, you think about it, whatever you want to say to it, and there you are, laughing heartily.

It all starts with your spouse. For many a woman, love can be overwhelming. But how come you get so many wonderful wives? Maybe you were afraid you'd lose an arm, maybe they didn't like you at all. Perhaps they thought it was funny after all, maybe you'll get a few more husbands, might go on vacation and start a family with two people. Maybe you think women are lazy and selfish. Maybe you'll never hear about it. Whatever happened, there you come. That's when those first few seconds startâ€¦
