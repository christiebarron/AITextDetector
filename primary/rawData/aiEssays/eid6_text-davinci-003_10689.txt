The Empire State Building allowed dirigibles to dock, but this heroic achievement was not without its obstacles. Built in 1931, the Empire State Building was constructed with the intention to make it the worldâ€™s tallest building, and it was also the first building to have an entirely separate elevator specifically designed for dirigibles. However, the real challenge was making sure the building could effectively dock these airships. 

For starters, the building needed a mooring mast, which had to be strong enough to withstand the strong winds and gusts of the dirigibles. The mooring mast needed special structural considerations, and its project engineer, David Nicholas, had to account for the torques and tension put on the system when the mast was being used. The mast was also needed to be tall enough to accommodate the airships, so it needed to be almost 406 feet tall. To supplement the mooring mast, a flexible steel cable attached to the airship was also needed, giving the dirigibles something to anchor onto when making a landing.

Despite the impressive engineering design of the mooring mast and anchor cable, high winds and gusts nonetheless struggled to throw these airships off course. As dirigibles approached the Empire State Building, pilots had to coordinate precisely with the tower to ensure the airships stayed on the right track. This caused delays to air traffic since mistakes would have to be corrected, and the turbulence could be dangerous at times
