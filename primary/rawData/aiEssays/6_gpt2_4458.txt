The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. It needed to accommodate six to eight people. It had one side a second and two sides. The view from each side became the only part that made the building that huge. The Empire State Building was designed to be the tallest landmark in Los Angeles and built on top of the State Capitol.

In the 1950s the U.S. government moved the construction of the Statue of Liberty to Manhattan. In 1957, the president of Japan, Shingo Toyoda, proposed that Japanese people should take a ship to the moon to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Constitution. At the time they were still protesting against nuclear disarmament. That plan was pushed back by a handful of Japanese ministers.

One of them, Aigahara Shigeno, was asked about the idea of taking a Japanese ship to the moon by a young officer from Tokyo's Department of Maritime Affairs. "They said, 'We can't do that in the same way you would if we were going to sail a ship to the moon.'"

It was as if the Japanese were coming in and asking them how they could help celebrate.
