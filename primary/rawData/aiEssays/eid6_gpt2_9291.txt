The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They were also subject to the fact that they were built without a separate runway for aircraft, such as the M-17 which could fly on public buildings even when they were parked in one of those airports.[42]

In 1937, the Department of the Environment, in recognition of the World Air Force Air Patrol's role in aerial reconnaissance and emergency control, adopted a "red tape" when it approved the use of a tunnel beneath the World War I Air Force Training Base which would become the East Wing Municipal Airport to serve as a runway for dirigibles in the aircraft.

Despite concerns from residents living below ground about fumes, the FAA decided against the need for a separate runway by using one of two tunnel types: A type of tunnel that would allow planes to be flown without an airbag on the ground, which has never worked, and an A type tunnel, which was used by both the Army and Navy in the 1950s and 1960s. The Army originally called for the use of an A type tunnel as they could safely avoid potential damage from airborne ordnance while maintaining the integrity of the tunnel under the base.[43] The Army called for a 4-inch diameter tunnel that could accommodate a full crew at the base, but that could also have been a problem, having taken with it an E-130 and a H-1 Abrams fighter jet.

Eventually, the tunnels were
