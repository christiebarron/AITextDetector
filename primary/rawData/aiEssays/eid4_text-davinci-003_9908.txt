The author uses the winter hibiscus to symbolize the narrator's struggle to learn a language. The winters are like an absence of the language and the spring is a renewed opportunity for the narrator to try again and, hopefully, succeed. The ending metaphor of the flower budding and the narrator taking the test again implies that the narrator will soon have the opportunity to connect with the language again and tries one more time.
