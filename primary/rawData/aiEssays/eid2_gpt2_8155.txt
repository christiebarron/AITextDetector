I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a matter of good conscience," SÃ¸rensen said. "But I fear that there will be greater censorship when it comes to other kinds of content, so for the foreseeable future, we will be trying to ensure that this censorship remains on a level playing field."

The first book distributed by the university in Denmark for the year 2015 was No Man's Sky, which came out in September 2014. The second came out in May 2015.

"This censorship is actually just the beginning," said a spokeswoman for one of the publishers of No Man's Sky.

"We will continue our work on this issue together with other publishers around the continent."
