There was a time when I had to go through a really difficult business negotiation. The other side was making it hard, refusing to give in on anything â€“ it seemed like an unlikely agreement could ever be reached. I kept my cool though, reminding myself that good business relationships were based on trust and respect, not stubbornness.

The negotiation dragged on for a while, but eventually, I was able to remain patient and maintain a good dialogue with the other party. By staying calm, we were able to come to an agreement that worked out for everyone. It wasn't the outcome I had initially wanted, but it was fair and mutually beneficial, and that's what mattered in the end.
