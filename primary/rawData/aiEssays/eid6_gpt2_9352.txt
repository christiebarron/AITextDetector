The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first obstacle was the cost of the building, which was quite high. A dirigible costs around US$1m, more than $3m (about $5.5bn now). Building dirigibles, in the end, didn't have the same benefits to their owners as in the past.

However, dirigibles were also cheaper than aircraft, and there was a sense that they could help bring down the cost of air travel and transport. On 11 December the Times's "New York Times" wrote, "It seems the aircraft industry wants dirigibles to be used for transport. They've already achieved this and are making significant progress." Although air travel has steadily boomed, the amount of money that dirigibles will be able to save remains limited â€“ especially in the US.

Even if this were to continue, aircraft would only provide a handful of the total transportation cost for passenger travel. That means that any extra money that could be put towards a dirigible would likely only contribute to building a small number of the many passenger aircraft. But if aviation was to save its owners money on a daily basis, most of it would actually go towards passenger aircraft rather than taking on the full cost of flying the planes.

There's also the question of maintenance. If a car was to get replaced, it might only be a 50/50 chance that the new car
