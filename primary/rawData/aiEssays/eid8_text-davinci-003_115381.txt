I remember it like it was yesterday. I had only recently started dating my now-husband, and as we were eager to get to know each other better, we took a spontaneous drive to the coast. 

We were heading to a beach that was quite far away from where we lived in the mountains, and we had been in the car for what felt like hours. Neither of us had had anything more to talk about for a few minutes, which made the drive feel a lot longer. 

That is when I started to feel a tickle starting to form in my stomach â€” I could barely contain it. When my laughter started to take over I started to laugh at the silliest things. I was laughing so hard I was almost crying, and I looked over at my boyfriend and he started laughing too. In that moment everything felt right.

It was laughter that connected us in that moment and in so many more that came after. It was like a little piece of us could be shared through that sound. Even after all of these years, it is still that laughter that finds a way to bring us together on a deep and meaningful level.
