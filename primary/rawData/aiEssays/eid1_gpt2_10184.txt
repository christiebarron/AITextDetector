Computers have many effects on people. First they can reduce their energy required each day. We don't know how much longer you should save, but the power requirements are only for a few seconds. Secondly, they can be a factor in all decisions (e.g. whether to drive a car, drive an airplane, or walk on a treadmill). And thirdly, they can affect you with other factors (e.g. age, sex, diet). In that sense these factors also play a role. One thing we can do to help people understand these things is create their own set of guidelines. We may have guidelines for the average age of a particular person but there are no ones that you can follow that will completely change that; there may be some very general guidelines but for most people, it will depend on what you are eating and how much exercise you do. Here's two easy ways to help out and take stock of your best habits:

Get up with a good gym and exercise a lot

This kind of lifestyle could actually save you money compared to a standard, typical, single lifestyle. However, because it is still under our control and because most people are only just beginning to eat, we tend to give more or less emphasis on our diets. So we think,

"Okay, here's the same number, and there's some extra money we can make (from the diet, exercise, and nutrition program) if we just focus on the workout."
