Computers have many effects on people. They can have a big effect on how well one brain works, how well one brain develops, and if we all are capable of doing the same. People with different intelligence can easily fall off the scale, and we're not getting these same results when we work on computers too. Many people would love to get into this area and gain some skill on it, but it could also have a big impact on one person's ability to use their other brain and brain resources. And so, we can talk about it from a neurobiological and cognitive point of view, and really build up how this works if we don't think about those things before we're trying to make a smart computer.

And the issue with cognitive enhancement programs isn't to be able to get that specific kind of power. People with a lower level will be able to use less of that power, it's just that your brain has more energy, and it can take a lot of effort to make something up. Or it may even run and make mistakes. So we may have to take some action in order to fix that, if we don't.

How much does your research go into making smart computers?

The money spent on computer science is primarily directed into research related to smart systems, which is very important, but also in science as you know it, for a wide range of projects, many of which are very big. So at various points in time,
