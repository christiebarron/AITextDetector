The Empire State Building is one of the most iconic landmarks in the world and has been associated with dirigibles since its inception. The challenge of allowing dirigibles to dock at the summit of the Empire State Building was immense, and the obstacles the builders faced demonstrates the engineering and architectural ingenuity of the project. 

When the engineers and architects began to design the Empire State Building, they knew that they would need to make it compatible with docking dirigibles. This task was no small feat - dirigibles were large and cumbersome vessels, and the wind and other environmental conditions surrounding the lofty structure posed unique challenges. Fortunately, these architects and engineers were up to the challenge. 

In order to ensure that the Empire State Building would be suitable for dirigibles, the engineers designed a “mooring mast” - a tall, open topped tower extending approximately 200 feet above the main building. This mast allowed the dirigibles to dock and be secured safely to the Empire State Building. To protect the structure from buffeting winds while the dirigibles docked, the engineers made sure the mooring mast was aerodynamically designed and connected to the rest of the building. 

The Empire State Building was the first structure of its kind to accommodate docked dirigibles, so the engineers needed to come up with innovative solutions. First, they devised a system of cables, called the mooring lines, connecting the mast to the Dir
