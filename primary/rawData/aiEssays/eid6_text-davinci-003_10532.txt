The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when allowing dirigibles, popularly known as airships, to dock at the building’s rooftop. The mooring mast, a 200-foot special steel tower installed in 1930 to anchor the dirigibles, was the only feature of the building specifically designed for use of the dirigibles. In his book, The Mooring Mast, Marcia Amidon Lüsted explains the immense challenge the project presented.

The most immediate problem the builders faced were the height and weight demands needed for the project. The mooring mast had to be tall enough for the dirigibles to dock safely; at the time, the tallest mooring mast in the world was only 139 feet tall. This meant that the new mast had to exceed that size and still be able to withstand strong winds and strong loads. The mast also had to have the ability to move side-to-side in order to prevent the dirigible from making contact with the sides of the building, yet still remain rigidly in place due to the massive weight of the airships.

Another major issue the builders had to confront was the weight of the mast. Due to the materials necessary for a robust structure, the mast weighed nearly forty tons in total. This was a daunting issue, as a mount able to support such a heavy structure would have to face the strongest of winds as well. The engineers had to take into account
