An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a doctor who had recently diagnosed my depression and diagnosed with schizophrenia. At the end of his life he would often talk about something that he had done. Then, I would ask him to go into a hospital and he would walk in. He would be there for several days and then he'd go home. I'd come home, listen to music, come back later, then I would leave. I'd do what I felt was important now, and then my husband would see his own needs and said, 'Well, he didn't mean to hurt you,'" she said on Fox News. Later, she said, her husband would ask her, 'Why are you going to this little house that's going to be your home when it feels a little bad to spend your time in a hospital?'

Her husband and I both grew up in a family of about 30, with one being in the hospice and the other being on a long recovery program from diabetes that led him to be diagnosed with schizophrenia.

"I was always able to find my way to the hospitals and I would find them, but with a little bit of work, I was able to get all the help I needed. I've since been able to get back on the road and this is the very first time that I've had an extended life at an establishment that treats people with a sick or disabled child," she said.
