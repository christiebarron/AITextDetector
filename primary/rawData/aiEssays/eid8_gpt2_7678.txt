One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I stumbled on another joke online. The person started off by telling me exactly how drunk they thought it was going to be and then asked how much alcohol I drank. With some good humor, I immediately realized how much he thought I was a drunk, after which he went and changed his mind, apologizing for having made the comment and saying I never meant for it to actually go this way.
