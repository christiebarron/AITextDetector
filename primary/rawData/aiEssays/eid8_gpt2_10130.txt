The waitress said what she really said that annoyed me. I didn't feel like I was at my best. It's sad that they didn't put me in this position because I'm no longer a girl. I think I should have put her in that position and have paid attention instead. I feel bad for thinking about being bullied, but I don't feel like, "What?! It was my turn!" I said something along the lines of, "I'm a woman and as long as pathological bullying is going on, I have no idea who my boyfriend is." She doesn't want to call me a woman and then she tries to talk to me about it like I'm trying to bully her and I'm confused because her voice, which is an inch taller than mine, is so big on my voice that it actually hurts. My voice isn't getting better because I'm a little bit shorter." There was a pause. "Well there we went." The woman said that in a very similar voice to me.
