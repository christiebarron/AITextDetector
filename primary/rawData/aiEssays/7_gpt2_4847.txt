An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I would take a cold bite of some lemon and add her two servings of a creamy cream cheese. The cream cheese is really great, and I was very pleased with the product. My first bite of it was a creamy cream cheese bite and, after my last bite, there was a creamy cream cheese bite and my butter melted at the bottom of the bowl. The sauce was very creamy, and the butter melted slightly. At last, it was my turn. I tried adding a splash of lemon to my cold chocolate and it melted immediately and my butter melted without incident. My sauce was even more delicious with a little help of lemon ice cream.


Rated 4 out of 5 by SteeGee from Best Cream Cheese The flavor I was experiencing has been consistent. I am used to getting a mix once a month and the flavors came through, but now with your Cream Cheese, this one's way more flavorful and well-balanced so go ahead and go try. I recommend it to people that enjoy different cheeses...but the cream cheese has been fantastic!
