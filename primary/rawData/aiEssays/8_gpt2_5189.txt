One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was trying to go off and get a job when I was a teen. I'd done three separate jobs, one by my college roommate and one by my high school sweetheart. It felt amazing. I felt like I finally let go and I was happy to be alive. So one day when I was trying to go off, I decided to give it a try. I did it not so much to get me away from my friend, but to get her to go home. I did it because after we went to her house over at her house, I didn't want to be her friend anymore. So I got her to come over, and I gave her a hug. I did it with the grace of my heart. That's how I felt that night. I was going crazy. I couldn't think about anything else and it seemed like this was all my life. So when I remembered, the words that I had spoken in my head, and the pain that was in your back, I knew that to put up a fight, it would require something. One thing stood out to me that day, and I couldn't help thinking that if that was my friend then who is this one person to hit?

I can't tell you how much I love doing these things. I love making sure that when I get my first shot, that this is what I look for. There is nothing better than creating a fight. The
