The features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead" heavily impact the cyclist as they attempt to make their way through the course. The rain-soaked roads and slick, slippery surfaces make for treacherous conditions and the cyclist has to battle obstacles such as mud puddles, sharp rocks, and slippery gravel in order to keep their bike under control. All of these features not only present physical obstacles for the cyclist in terms of navigating the course, but they are psychologically taxing as well. The cyclist must constantly be on alert for the unexpected, as one wrong turn could easily send them off the road and into a dangerous situation.

The dense fog also creates a sense of mystery and danger for the cyclist, making it difficult to anticipate what might lay ahead. The lack of visibility prevents them from seeing far enough ahead of them, and thus, they must rely more heavily on their balance and their bike handling abilities to get them through the course safely.

Finally, the darkness of the night adds to the feeling of uncertainty and danger, as the cyclist must push themselves to the brink in order to make it to the end of the course in one piece. All of these environmental features create a sense of tension and fear, making it all the more difficult for the cyclist to stay composed and focused on the task at hand.
