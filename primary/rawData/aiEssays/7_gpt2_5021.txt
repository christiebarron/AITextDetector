An example of a time someone in my life was patient was in the Navy where they had 1,500 units of ammunition at one time. They'd never been trained to use it, only reload it. So a lot of the time we were firing and recharging at one location and on the other. Now they used it everywhere at one time. So we had to go in another direction, but we would find other solutions out of the box. We built our own gun.

The real genius of the military in terms of getting around the regulations and how to handle this is that I had to really come up with this system that it all worked, from the operational, from the training to making sure that, when it's all right, you can shoot the target and all that.

That's the other part of my job, to be completely honest with you, because people still ask me if they ever heard me say that I was a great teacher? No, the ones that say they never heard me say that I had a great teacher. The ones that do say that I taught them the things they didn't think I would teach them.

So you want people to know that I'm not even a super communicator, I'm just really a little guy who helps people through. But there are things that will be very important to any person to do. But all I got to do was be able to help this guy.
