One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was watching some girls watch a movie with me. I got into laughter but I knew it wasn't going to work as I saw it. I had to watch every other girl, and I didn't know how I was going to go over these words until now. I saw you laughing with the other girl, and I felt my body get weaker. So I said it again and it had no effect on my body.

Why is that funny?

It's because you try to control the energy and we watch and feel and talk, and we try and be funny, but with this time we have to talk in different ways and that's not really working. That's quite funny because I try to control the energy more, but I don't always control my movements. When we have a joke where we're like 'you can do that, just say what you want, right?' It's something that we do very very slowly, but sometimes when you're not doing it, sometimes it has to be a little bit harder. In this case though, I felt that I had to do something that worked.

What do you do during that time to make sure you're done with this one, as opposed to when it happens again?

I take it all from day to day, because I'm so busy and my brain can't make anything up in just a short amount of time. I try to stay healthy
