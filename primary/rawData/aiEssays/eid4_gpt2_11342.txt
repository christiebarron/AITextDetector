The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because the only things it tells you that make your head hurt in the first place are simple tales that can't be explained. You'll see this when you step outside, or if you've even heard enough of those old, old-fashioned tales. It's hard not to appreciate how thoroughly the stories are told. And no wonder it's so popular even in the world's most beloved children's book series.
