Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion about the effects computers have on people.

As technology continues to evolve, computers play an increasingly important role in our everyday lives. They facilitate tasks like communication, shopping, and learning -- tasks that we can accomplish from the comfort of our own homes. But, while computers can certainly be useful tools, it’s important to recognize the potentially harmful effects they can have on people.

One of the biggest problems is the amount of time people are spending in front of their computers. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that adults spend an average of 5 hours per day on a computer. We’re thus missing out on real-world experiences, as well as human contact and interaction. Too much time on the computer can also lead to physical and mental health issues, including insomnia, poor eyesight, and stress.

We must be mindful of these potential dangers and work to circumvent them. A good start might be decreasing our screen time, setting strict limits for ourselves, and spending more time engaging in activities that don't involve screens. 

I urge readers to join me in becoming aware of the risks posed by computer overuse and to support initiatives that promote healthy computer activities. 

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
