The setting in Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead” plays a major part in the cyclist’s experience and journey. The cyclist is on a winding, rough road with a steep incline, forcing them to anticipate upcoming obstacles and plan accordingly. The road is covered in pot holes filled with rain and mud, making it difficult to keep traction and an even riding pattern. The setting also includes thick forests with dense tree branches and tall cliffs which block the sun and limit the amount of light available.

The wind is also an ever-present factor, making the effort of riding up the hill even more difficult. The rider is constantly swept up into a headwind, pushing against and tiring them out. The congestion of the trees prevents the cyclist from avoiding the gusts. The opposition of the wind also forces the cyclist to lean forward in order to keep a steady pace, making the journey all the more tiresome and unpleasant.

The cyclist in Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead” should also be aware of the fact that, as night falls, the setting drastically changes. The thick darkness of the trees swallows up any hint of light from the stars or moon. The wind also becomes gentler and less abrasive, allowing the cyclist to get a second wind, but also making it easier to become lost and disoriented, which can be a major setback.
