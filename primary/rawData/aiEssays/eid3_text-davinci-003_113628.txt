The setting of the story is described as a twisted, "forgotten road" that snakes through the countryside and is described initially as "desolate, deserted, and foreboding". This reinforces the sense of danger and isolation felt by the cyclist throughout the story.

The cyclist is a long-distance rider, so the conditions of the road make the journey more difficult and dangerous. The road is described as having "ruined asphalt, pot-holes deep enough to swallow bicycle wheels, and a broken surface". Even if the cyclist makes it around the potholes carefully, they might hit a bump and get thrown off the bike.
