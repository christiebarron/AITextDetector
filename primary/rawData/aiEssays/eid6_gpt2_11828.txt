The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

Other cities were simply forced to abandon these types of building techniques. (They now mostly are only available in the U.S. and Canada, with limited public access to them for visitors outside of developing nations to choose from.)

To show that the city of San Francisco and its residents would embrace and celebrate the idea of a universal and free public transportation system, even though their transportation systems are not free. (While this plan does not specify how much traffic would reduce the number of dirigibles, it does outline some practical improvements, making the idea of a private system more plausible. In a statement, the Planning Department emphasized the importance of the public transportation system.)

The following is a summary of some of the many ideas in the report.

New Transit: New cars and buses would be required to replace cars and buses with more efficient cars, vehicles as efficient as the subway. Also, cars would start to travel faster while drivers are distracted, allowing more efficient cars to travel at a
