The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it is full of mysteries, but its main problem is that you don't know how the game is going to end. The one real plot point here is that the story, or at least the main plot point that will occur is not really going to be resolved at this point as the game is being finished as usual. With that said, if you want to know the final scene from the story, you can read the whole book right here, and get some clues about what will happen next. Just read the book in question for what seems like five hours and read at your leisure.

The game is also really boringly well done for me since I am almost entirely focused on the story and not the story itself either.

Conclusion

If you like the game and want a full, deep and dark fantasy then then this game was a bit of a treat and you could get all the enjoyment from it.

I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is into fantasy and want to delve into mysteries or even delve into its backstory. (And the book is mostly about the lore, even though the lore is rather boring.) There are a lot of great content that is given by fans because of this game.

Overall, this is a very well made and polished game and as much as I feel like it's a very long to read series to me, I would recommend it just to those looking for a better
