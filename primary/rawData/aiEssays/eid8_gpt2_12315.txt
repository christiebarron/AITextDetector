One time I experienced laughter in my life was when Joss, the "Mighty Dwarf," took me into the living room as usual when we met. He was the proud owner of the Mjolnir. He liked to sit out with me, he would sit on the front row (but would not have any clothes!) and he would not be distracted by my attitude with jokes or my presence. He was always there. I always thought Joss was funny and there was nothing funny about him, but I had never seen him laugh. There used to be laughter when I was at the dentist's office at my father's home in Germany. He always took me out and played chess that afternoon if I came on. He was a great guy. It was just that when I was older he was really big and was a great musician. It was nice to meet him, he never had the slightest idea what was up with me or what he was up to, he even looked up to me during practice because he was always looking for my favorite moment at a moment's notice.


Even at school, I would sometimes hear those old "you have to smile" chants. We were all laughing along side each other, he told me. The music never stopped, I listened to the "joke". Joss was a very funny guy and my heart would always go into the room for his every moment. It wasn't long before the next one would catch my eye. The whole time
