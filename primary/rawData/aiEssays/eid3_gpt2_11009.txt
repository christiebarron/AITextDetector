Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

The setting is defined like this:

# set ROUTER_BRIEFING

# set TARGET_ROADING

Rough Road Ahead

The "road ahead" is how you go from zero to 100 km per hour if you take care of roads. The setting is defined as having a maximum speed of 100 km/h between 0 s and 0 h. This is the maximum speed of the road, the level at which it should not break. It is also the minimum speed if the cyclist moves further into a corner than expected â€“ meaning if the cyclist moves too fast from the left to the right, this means that he or she could end up breaking.

It is best to choose the setting that will best suit your cycling style. For example, in this case, say:
