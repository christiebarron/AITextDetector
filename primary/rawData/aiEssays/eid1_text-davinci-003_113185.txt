Dear Editor,

As technology advances, so do the effects of computer use on individuals. Computers, although useful, can be both beneficial and detrimental in the lives of people. I firmly believe that computers have had a positive effect on people, and wish to elucidate some of the ways in which computers have been beneficial.

For one, computers have changed the way we communicate. We no longer need to wait for snail mail to get where it needs to go, because now we simply email it or even instant message. This has made communication faster and easier than ever before. Additionally, computers have improved access to quality education. Most schools are now equipped with computers, which give students access to online resources and provide learning tools that would not otherwise be available.

In addition, computers have made work easier and more efficient. Many jobs can be done from the comfort of one’s home, making commuting a thing of the past. Furthermore, programs such as Excel allow us to store and organize data quickly and accurately. This is especially helpful for small businesses that need to keep track of their finances.

Overall, it is my belief that computers have a lot of potential to help people. They make life simpler, faster, and efficient. I hope that this letter has been able to persuade readers to agree with me and grasp how invaluable computers are in today’s society.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
