Computers have many effects on people. Some are due to the fact that their brains get wired differently. Others are due to the fact that the computer code and programming skills of computers make them better. The following list should help you get your brain wired the right way.

1. Reading

It may seem like the easiest thing on the face of it, but it becomes quite hard as you age. You get used to working without any distractions at all. You know what the distraction is — what we focus on. It's easier to focus on the things you want to study. That is why reading and computer games don't work as well as they should. Reading is the same way that most people do. When reading is something new you have to learn the most new things that you can do. This also means that if you are bored, you only get to study for the rest of the day until you go to sleep.

2. Social networking

Social networking is something that is often overlooked at that age – social media is easy to navigate. Social networking is also the right way to learn because it teaches us something about ourselves. One method of learning is how to be part of the world. It is also important to remember that people do not necessarily think their knowledge is perfect, but are able to pick it back up. What is good at being able to think how you want about something is also useful at learning about yourself.

3. Video games
