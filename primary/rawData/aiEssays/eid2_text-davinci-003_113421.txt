When it comes to censorship in libraries, it is important to remember that libraries are our nation’s public resource, and as such, should be open and accessible to everyone regardless of their political, religious, or personal beliefs. Unfortunately, in recent years, we have observed a trend of censorship in libraries across the United States. This growing tendency towards censorship is both concerning and concerningly misplaced. 

The American Library Association has long held that censorship in libraries goes against the Constitutional right of every citizen to access information—especially as libraries are traditionally viewed as public domain entities and not mere “bookstores,” where certain materials may be restricted. As such, it is important to keep in mind that censorship in libraries should be limited, and that in its absence, libraries should provide a vision of knowledge and understanding that is broad and ever-expanding. 

That being said, I believe that while libraries should offer an open-door policy with regards to most materials, there should be an exception to censorship in cases involving certain materials which are deemed offensive. This exception should be applied to any materials exhibiting hate speech, or graphic features of violence that are not appropriate for everyone. While they should be made available, steps should be taken to keep such materials away from children and provide clear warnings to adults if the content is in any way controversial. 

In conclusion, censorship in libraries should only be applied in the case where the material may be deemed offensive or damaging
