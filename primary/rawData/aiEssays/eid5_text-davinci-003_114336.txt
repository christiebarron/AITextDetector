In his memoir From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso Rodriguez creates a mood of poignancy and nostalgia. Through a series of vignettes, Rodriguez paints a vivid and captivating portrait of his Cuban heritage and childhood. His vivid descriptions of the vibrant countryside and street life of his hometown – of meandering cobblestone streets, of stucco buildings adorned in bright colors, of backyard barbeques and salsa classes – paint a vivid portrait of his life.

At the same time, Rodriguez’s memoir also conveys a sense of longing and pain. He writes intimately of the love of his grandmothers, his cousins, and his hometown Cuban friends, speaking to the deep connection he felt to those he left behind with his family’s emigration. This emotion of longing for the past is palpable, as Rodriguez also acknowledges sorrowful realizations of the rearranged connections that result from changing circumstances. 

The combination of warmth and yearning creates a powerful emotional journey that readers can’t help but be drawn in to. Rodriguez speaks lovingly of his homeland and culture, while also conveying an awareness of the profound losses that come from separation. In the end, Rodriguez’s words lay out a roadmap of the experiences, both joyous and painful, that have shaped his personal identity, creating a deep mood of vulnerable self-reflection.
