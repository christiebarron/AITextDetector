It provides a real insight into the strength of our relationship when I think of the time we shared a big laugh. It was during a particularly stressful moment—I was having to move back home to my parents’ house due to a change of job, and we had been struggling for the last few days to break down my furniture and lift some heavy boxes out of the flat. We had already been at it for far too long when my partner stepped in to give me a hand.

Just when we were about to give up the ghost due to exhaustion, my partner decided to make the moment lighter and he got out a big pile of makeshift bubble wrap. With my help, he wrapped my sofa in the bubble wrap – not your classical packing technique, I’ll be the first to admit – and the bubble wrap popping noises and the chaos of the situation had us both in hysterics. That moment was the icebreaker we needed and it was surprisingly liberating. Fingers crossed, it let the rest of the job go a bit smoother as well.

Moving back home to my parents’ was stressful, but I wouldn’t trade my time spent with my partner, laughing, for anything in the world. Laughter truly can be the best medicine for any situation.
