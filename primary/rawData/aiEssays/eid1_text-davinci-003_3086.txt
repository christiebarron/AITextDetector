It's no secret that the influence of computers has drastically changed our society. With their convenience and power, it's easy to see why computers are so popular. But what about their effects on people? 

On one hand, computers have reduced the amount of time and effort we spend on certain tasks. With a few clicks, we can now buy groceries and pay bills online without leaving our home. We can work from home and even get a college degree online. On the other hand, too much time spent on these devices can have a negative impact on our physical and social wellbeing. 

A recent survey has shown that spending too much time using technology can lead to health problems such as poor eyesight, neck pains, and headaches. Additionally, people who spend too much time on their computers can feel isolated and experience mental health problems. The American Psychological Association found that adults who spend more than two hours a day on social media are more likely to feel isolated than those who donâ€™t.

In conclusion, while computers can be beneficial, it is also important to take breaks and balance our time in front of a computer with other activities. This will help us stay healthy, both
