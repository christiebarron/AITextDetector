I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a legitimate need of our time. However, as it stands it is absolutely wrong in my view to block or deny content due to a critical opinion of public figures."

Libraries are required by law to make a "fair share" of their materials as defined by the Constitution. As The Guardian understands, libraries can't be liable – even if their materials represent sensitive information – for certain things.

It's fair to say the vast majority of books are free, regardless of whom they originate from. Yet, at all times, the publishers would rather not be bound by the books than be in for legal liability in a case over freebies – a practice that has become increasingly common in the name of "prudent journalism."

This sort of "free speech," which critics are often calling censorship, violates no one's First and Fourth Amendments right to "speech."

For instance, not only is the U.S. government able to "decimate grandfather clauses" as part of a legal system that was designed to safeguard free speech, but as Judge Sasse argued at the time, "government can't simply take away all information that is not subject to judicial review. Because the government can't take everything [it needs] out of a library before it can decide whether it's a fair use."
