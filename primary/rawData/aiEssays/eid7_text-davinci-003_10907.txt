 

I remember the time I was at the grocery store. The line was incredibly long, with people everywhere. Everyone seemed to be in a rush and getting frustrated with the wait. I noticed one woman in particular who had a look of stress on her face. As she got closer to the front of the line, I could hear her muttering under her breath about how long the wait was taking. Then, she noticed the cashier was scanning each item far too slowly. 

But instead of snapping at the cashier, she remained patient and kind. She reassured the cashier and encouraged them not to rush, because she knew it was important to do their job right. After checking out, she thanked the cashier for all their hard work. Seeing how patient and understanding she was, I realized how far patience can really go.
