The author ends the poem with this line to emphasize the idea of resilience and renewal. In the poem, the narrator is reflecting on the hibiscus bush and comparing its ability to endure and survive the harsh winter to his own persistence in facing challenges. The hopeful ending of the poem implies that, just as the hibiscus bush will return in the spring, the narrator will be able to overcome any obstacles in his path and eventually succeed. Thus, the poem serves as an inspiring reminder of the strength we can find in nature â€” and ourselves.
