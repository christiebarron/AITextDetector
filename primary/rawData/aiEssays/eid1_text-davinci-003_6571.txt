Dear Editor,

My name is [Name], and I am writing this letter to express my opinion about the effects of computers on people and to persuade your readers to come to the same conclusion. 

As technology has advanced, computers have become increasingly commonplace in our everyday lives. While they have a wide range of positive impacts, such as providing people with access to vital information and making everyday tasks easier, I believe that computers can have a detrimental effect on people, especially if they are overused. 

Prolonged exposure to computers can have a negative impact on physical health, as sitting in the same position for extended periods of time can lead to neck and back pain, or even carpal tunnel syndrome. Itâ€™s also important to consider the psychological effects of spending too much time in front of a computer, such as depression, anxiety, insomnia, or even addiction.

Although computers have many advantages, we must recognize that they can be detrimental to our well-being. As such, I would urge your readers to take a step back and consider the implications of spending extended periods of time in front of a computer to ensure that they remain healthy and happy. 

Thank you for taking the time to read my letter and I look forward to seeing the reactions of your readers. 

Sincerely, 

[Name]
