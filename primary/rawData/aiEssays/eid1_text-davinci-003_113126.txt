Dear Editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. In my opinion, computers have had a positive effect on our lives. 

Nowadays, computers are used for almost everything. We use computers to pay bills, book flights, shop for groceries, and do our banking. Computers also provide a large library of education material. Computers can be an invaluable tool for students studying for exams or completing research papers. They allow us to access information quicker and easier and save a lot of time and effort.

Moreover, computers have also made communication much easier. We use computers to stay in touch with friends and family members who are far away. Social media and videochats allow us to stay connected instantly and easily. We now have the ability to connect with people from all over the world.

Finally, computers have created an incredibly expansive network of entertainment. We can play computer and video games, watch movies, listen to music, and post images. There seems to be something that everyone can find enjoyable.

In conclusion, computers have improved our lives immensely. They have made it easier for us to get information, communicate with others, and find entertainment. So, I urge readers to embrace computers and their benefits. 

Sincerely,
