It’s the debate that’s been going on since books were first invented - should libraries allow materials considered offensive on their shelves? Whether it’s books, music, movies, or magazines, remove them from the library or not? I believe libraries should not enact censorship on their shelves, for a variety of reasons. 

First and foremost, libraries should be a place for free thoughts and ideas. Their primary purpose should be to provide space for people to explore knowledge and form their own opinions on various topics. When a library imposes censorship, it sets a precedent that some topics and ideas are off-limits and unimportant, which limits how much people can learn from reading. 

Furthermore, censorship in libraries denies individuals the right to choose what content they are exposed to and restricts the diversity of opinions. For example, censoring a book or magazine with a controversial opinion prevents certain individuals from accessing that material and forming their own thoughts and opinions. Everyone should be allowed their own, unique, opinion free of censorship. 

Additionally, implementing censorship policy in libraries sends a damaging message to younger generations. It gives the impression that certain topics are against the societal norms and should be hidden from readers. This
