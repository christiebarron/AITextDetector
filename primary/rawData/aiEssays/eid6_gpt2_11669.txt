The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The building's first owners, the Dutch and the British, tried for a single dirigibles system. To help their builders, their architects created an elegant system.

A Dirigible Is a Very Good Idea

In 1615 Thomas Cromwell (or George III), having established his capital in the South, installed his new Tower of London (later the Palace of Westminster) in the south. His grand plan for London was for the capital to be built in the manner of the Empire State Building, which was then a complex of 12 large towers facing the north-south in two directions.

From the time the Tower of London was built until about 1708, the Empire State Building has been a popular destination for the masses. Its unique features will have plenty of people going out on Hecksroad in summer, while its exterior has been altered to make things more accessible and safe for visitors.
