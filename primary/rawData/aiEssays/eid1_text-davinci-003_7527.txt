The final line of the poem serves to communicate the idea that, while failure is a part of life, as long as one perseveres and never gives up, eventual success is possible. Much like the hibiscus that will bloom in the spring after the snows have melted away, the poem's speaker will take the test again and succeed. The imagery of the hibiscus blooming in the spring serves as a metaphor for hope and renewal, suggesting that the speaker must trust in their strength and determination to ultimately achieve success.
