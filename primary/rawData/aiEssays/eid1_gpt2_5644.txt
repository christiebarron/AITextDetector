Computers have many effects on people. You can make them less capable as your children are going into the next generation. It is all about how your environment affects your child's brainpower. Your children will improve. They may get better at math, play more sports, learn more languages. Your child may develop better understanding of language. It is the same with parents. If your child gets tired of having a few children who can talk and write well with you, you better let them play with you. Do not let your child become bored with you. Your child may even be more capable at a certain occupation and in general, it will be a positive experience, which you will not enjoy. The same applies to a certain environment. You may not enjoy that environment and you may feel that you cannot, in fact, share it. So, keep your kids comfortable. Make fun or funny of people. Get creative with your children to make them like you. They may get tired of seeing you as a clown or a kid who makes you look like a clown. You are making fun of them and they may be tired of your jokes either way, especially the children you are teasing them about. Give them the opportunity to explore other things in their lives, such as hobbies or hobbies. Have fun, love and let them grow up to be good people again. Just want to think about your children, and it is your job to do nothing but help them grow up and get better at something.
