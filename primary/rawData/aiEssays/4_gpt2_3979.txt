The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because they said that the character is "no longer the one he used to be. This world is no longer his, and the world he loved has disappeared. He becomes part of the landscape, he is nothing, his story is lost." This new understanding puts the reader into "the spirit of that original character." They are coming to see him live as he sees it, that there wasn't a day he might have been who he is today.

This is a beautiful piece, not only for me at the book's conclusion but for fans of our characters who have long wondered about our characters. For many readers I believe Winter Hibiscus represents the fall and the beginning of a new end toxins will never be completely dissolved.
