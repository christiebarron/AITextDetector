The author, Minfong Ho, uses the idea of new beginnings to end the story. Winter Hibiscus is a story about a young girl in Thailand who struggles to pass her final school exam and is not allowed to take it again until the following school year. The author uses the image of the hibiscus blooming in the spring to represent the idea that a new year full of opportunity is beginning. The end line is an expression of hope that the young girl will have another chance to take the test when the hibiscus blooms again in the spring. It is a reminder that new opportunities will always come with time and that even when we fail, we have to keep trying.
