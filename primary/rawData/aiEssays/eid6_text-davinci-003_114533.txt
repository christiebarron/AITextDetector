The realization of the Empire State Building in Manhattan, New York City in 1931 was an impressive feat of engineering and architecture. The building, standing today at 1,250 feet, was the tallest in the world for nearly four decades. One of its most impressive features was the docking mast located 200 feet above the street level. This mooring mast was intended to allow dirigibles, or large airships, to dock and refuel at the building. It seemed like a great idea at the time, however the builders of the Empire State Building would soon realize the significant obstacles they would have to overcome in order to make this dream feature a reality.

First, constructing such a tall feature was an engineering challenge. In order to support the added weight of a large dirigible, the height of the mast had to be just right. The buildingâ€™s original plan was to add steel beams in order to extend the mast to its proper length, however they soon realized the strength and resistance of a dirigible would require something much stronger. After some consideration, they decided to use an iron mast instead, making it the first ever structure of its kind.

Another problem they faced when attempting to dock dirigibles was the wind. The wind at normal airship altitudes could be incredibly strong, and in order to safely dock a dirigible, the wind would need to be tamed. The designers of the Empire State Building came up with a clever solution: they would position large
