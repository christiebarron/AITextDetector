I still remember it like it was yesterday. My best friend and I were hanging out in my room, talking about the usual things: school, family, and the future. 

We were talking like we always do, but then my friend said something that made me crack up. I couldn't stop laughing, and then my friend started laughing, too.

It felt like we were both connected by our laughter. Even though we had talked about serious things, we were able to take a moment to share in some much-needed laughter and lighten the mood.

We went on laughing for at least five or ten minutes, and when we finally stopped, we had this moment of understanding. I realized in that moment how important laughter is for a relationship. It brings us together and helps us to feel close to each other, even when things get serious.

I'm so grateful for that shared moment of laughter with my best friend. It's a moment I'll never forget.
