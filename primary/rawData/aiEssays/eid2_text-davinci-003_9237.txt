Dear Editor, 

I am writing to share my thoughts on censorship of certain books, music, movies, and magazines in libraries. As a frequent patron of my local library, I believe strongly that these materials should not be withheld from library shelves solely because they may be deemed “offensive.” 

Censoring certain materials in libraries has the potential to create a dangerous precedent that restricts access to information and silences important narratives and perspectives. Libraries should be a safe and inclusive space where everyone has access to a broad range and variety of materials, without fear of being judged or censored. 

In the age of technology and instant information, libraries remain one of the few bastions for access to countless unique and interesting resources. It is a disservice to our entire community to deny our access to certain books, music, movies, and magazines simply because they may contain content that is deemed “offensive”.

Beyond this, it is difficult to determine what materials should be censored. What qualifies as offensive is often subjective, and censoring any material could lead to a slippery slope of attempting to control what information should and should not be available to the public.

Rather than censorship, I believe that libraries should have policies in place to ensure that patrons have access to resources without being judged or restricted by their choice to read them. This could include reserving certain materials for adults or implementing educational programs that foster an appreciation of diverse perspectives and topics covered
