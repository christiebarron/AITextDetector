The ambition of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was a feat of engineering that came with several obstacles that seemed to have only one optimal solution. Constructed during the early twentieth century, the building hit its heights in 1931. However, the fact that it had become the world’s tallest freestanding building meant it would need to handle the traffic of lighter-than-air aircraft. 

The most immediate obstacle of allowing dirigibles to dock was the fact that the building was far higher than these vessels could comfortably take on passengers. The mooring mast, which was proposed to be added to the same level as the uppermost observation deck, would elevate the entire project to even greater heights. In order to safely moor the airships, designers and engineers would have to navigate structural concerns and extreme weather conditions. 

While the extreme height created an obvious problem that the designers had to account for, other obstacles emerged in the form of materials for construction. Since the top of the mast would be exposed to extreme winds and the friction of multiple moorings, constructing it from sturdy and lightweight materials was critical. Steel was the only option, as it could withstand the weather and the enormous weight of airships—but steel was scarce as it was the height of the Great Depression and steel was in high demand. For the designers, they had the task of finding enough steel in the limited time they had or to abandon the project altogether.
