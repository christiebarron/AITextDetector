The construction of the Empire State Building brought with it many challenges, not least of which was allowing the docking of dirigibles. Building a mooring mast tall enough to house the 10-story zeppelin was a complex endeavor, fraught with financial and technological obstacles. 

The first challenge was the question of cost. Building a mooring mast would require a significant financial investment, something which the developers of the Empire State Building may not have been willing to undertake. To manage costs, engineers had to come up with a design that made use of existing materials as much as possible. This was the reasoning behind the decision to make the mast out of steel from the discarded Hindenburg disaster wreckage. The mast also had to be steel in order to withstand the strong winds experienced at the buildingâ€™s height, which stood at 1,250 feet.


The next issue concerned the aloft docking procedure. Due to the immense height of the mooring mast, engineers had to come up with an efficient way for dirigibles to dock without a significant loss of time or fuel. The solution lay in the design of the mooringmast itself; engineers came up with a system that allowed the zeppelin airship to dock by simply maneuvering into a downward tunnel in the mast. The tunnel opened up into a large pipe, lined with steel plates, which allowed for a smoother interior surface that would help reduce air resistance and speed up the docking process.
