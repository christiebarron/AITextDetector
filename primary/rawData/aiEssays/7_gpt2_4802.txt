An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a person who spent too much energy chasing an imaginary dream to notice that they didn't get anything done. All of my friends started their workdays in earnest as early as 12 years old, but the reality was almost the opposite. They were exhausted; they felt bored. The task at hand was to find and complete a job that would increase their earnings or at least give them an idea of what they were thinking.

This was when I started to think about the way to increase my earnings and productivity.

The first two-thirds of my twenties and thirties were spent doing little to no work or running errands. Most of my friends in this period were working one hour per day while the rest were playing board games or reading or watching movies or at night. The time they spent doing nothing was almost all spent just grinding a pencil between their fingertips. It was like grinding a grain of sand to get a straight answer on the point of an upcoming game in which I didn't believe the answer would be the same. What was there to do?

The final one-third was spent on my own. I had no one I could trust with my life.

That last three-to-four-years time when I went to work was the age of what happens for every job in this world. I was so hopeless, my mind was filled with the fear that I was going to lose my job
