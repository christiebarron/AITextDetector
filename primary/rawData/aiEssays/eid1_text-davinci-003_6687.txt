Dear Editor,

I'm writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. As technology continues to advance, the use of computers is becoming increasingly prevalent in everyday life. It cannot be denied that computers have brought about many positive changes to our lives, however, they have also had some detrimental repercussions.

Some of the positive effects of computers include the fact that they provide us with instant access to vast amounts of information and knowledge. They also allow us to communicate with people around the world in a matter of seconds, and they can help us to complete tasks quickly and efficiently.

However, while computers are useful in these ways, they can also have a negative effect on peopleâ€™s health. Staring at a computer screen for extended periods of time can lead to vision problems due to the blue light emitted by the monitor. Additionally, constantly being connected to the internet and constantly being exposed to various digital stimuli can lead to mental health issues such as stress and depression.

Therefore, it is important to remember that although computers can be helpful in terms of providing information and facilitating communication, we should be mindful of the potential risks that come with using them too much. Taking regular breaks away from the screen and limiting the amount of time spent on the computer can help to reduce the effects of overexposure to computer technology.

I hope this letter has encouraged readers to be mindful of both the positive and negative effects of computers.

Sincerely,
