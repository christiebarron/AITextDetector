Computers have many effects on people. They add up over time so that at some point, they're able to make the correct decisions or you see some of the effects. When you look at what happens with the human brain, and you look at things like that, it's pretty clear that people suffer from depression, anxiety and some of these are associated with these behavioral changesalling behavior that's not related to this specific issue. But it could be that depression itself, which may make people more likely to do something they otherwise avoid doing so.

What's the evidence for the idea that a human body that works so hard to prevent depression makes the same behavioral changes in people that we do to those around us?

This is very interesting and I think it should be looked at further, because it is consistent from work with other species. I hope that even further research will come along that goes further to show this.

What does the study show about the immune system and how it responds in general? Or does it point this out that it's not as straightforward as people think? Or does one worry about it, because most of those in the study have no understanding of that?

Well, one of the challenges is that when the immune system begins acting more in response to certain types of stimuli in individuals, those types of information are actually less effective because the immune system has started putting more effort into helping them. Whereas before we thought that it was just some kind of physiological
