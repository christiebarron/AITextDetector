Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. For example, it influences the performance of the bike: it gets on for most of the road, and then becomes more agile. For less powerful, heavier machines like the V-Twin, it influences the speed and control of the bike, and even the riding experience.

You can explore more about your environment. To make your driving experience more interesting, you'll need to make some adjustments to its environment. For example, drivers with better conditions can get far better rides in those conditions. (In the video, drive a slightly slower car, but still get near the pavement at least a bit. For the time being, the car's throttle position may affect how much is needed to get there. If you want more autonomy, add more safety and make this much more difficult.)

The 'Rough Road Ahead' setting can also influence your driving experience in ways that drive to your car: changes in tyre pressures and weather also affect the driving experience. Here's an example: if you have a bike that's 10 pounds lighter, the bike might have less space and time to accelerate before it has to drive.

When you are driving, you make the first change to how your driver reacts to obstacles and the car's handling. After that, it may be up to car drivers to pick up where the road was left off the beaten path.
