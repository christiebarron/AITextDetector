The author Minfong Ho is conveying the idea that in order to achieve success, one must have patience, trust in fate, and keep trying. The winter hibiscus in the story is a symbol of resilience and hope - it is planted in the winter and will not bloom until the following spring. The speaker is saying that like the winter hibiscus, they will have to wait for the right time to take the test again, and when that time arrives, they will be ready. This serves as an inspirational and uplifting message about perseverance and hope.
