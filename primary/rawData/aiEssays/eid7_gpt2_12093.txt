An example of a time someone in my life was patient was with the woman, who was dying immediately after a sexual encounter. These circumstances were completely inexplicable to me, I was able to explain through her stories. This time, even though we did not know each other very well, she also seemed to know what I was up to.

There's also another kind of patient that is a special case in this. This kind of person, as we all know, is a little bit like a cat with a tail. They have a tail as well. There are stories of them having different personalities in different situations. They may need and want different food, when they have a problem with their dog, because they can't always use that specific method of handling pet. This kind of patient, while at ease, is too timid and can't do the right things.

So we had to work together to achieve this, but we still tried to keep our head very level.

The fact that he is so normal may lead to a few changes. However, there are definitely still some things that we can use to change him. So, as we go through this process, it's up to us if there's something we can do in order to help him get used to him.
