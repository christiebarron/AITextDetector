I believe that censorship of materials in libraries and government offices is a dangerous and shameful phenomenon, especially given the many attempts to suppress critical thought of history over the past 20 or so years," she said.

I agree with you.

What we need from a government or school is a strong legal system -- not the current way. It's time for the courts to be trained in respectability - and do right â€” and not allow themselves to be manipulated by the so-called "left-wing" Left.

It's time for people to speak up when school officials (and I) need our input, not the partisan left/right narrative or the narrow focus on the past.

If our governments are actually listening to the public, they should open up our classrooms to an open dialogue on historical and cultural appropriation, including the history of American slavery and other forms of oppression.

And let others of us who disagree with our school system get in touch and let us know how we should improve this system even if we disagree with the current ones.

I see every possible way to do this.
