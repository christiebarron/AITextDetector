To The Editor:

As a digital native of the 21st century, I've had access to computers and technology in my everyday life for my entire life. I'm sure most of your readers can relate to this as well. After taking a step back and really analyzing the effects technology has had on my life and on others, I am of the strong opinion that computers are providing people with invaluable opportunities for growth and creativity. 

The computing age has inspired and enabled people to collaborate globally, start up businesses that have had amazing success, and has made tremendous advances in medicine and science. It has also opened up educational opportunities to anyone with a will to learn. 

Computers are also beneficial for day-to-day operations within households. Countless tasks have been modernized and made more convenient, from online banking, to vacation planning, and job searching. 

On top of the everyday convenience computers offer, they have proven to have a positive impact on mental health. Whether it be playing an on-line game, working on a massive 3-D modeled project, or just creating a photo album for a special event; computers provide people with a creative outlet.

I would urge your readers to consider the potential networking and educational opportunities that computers enable. Through the use of computers, we can achieve amazing things and they are quickly becoming an indispensable part of our world.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
