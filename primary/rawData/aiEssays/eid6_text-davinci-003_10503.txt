The plans to build the Empire State Building with a docking facility for dirigibles (airships) ended up being more challenging than expected due to a myriad of obstacles. According to Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s ‘The Mooring Mast’, one of the major obstacles that the architects and engineers faced in designing the mast was the rotating winds of New York City. Since the winds around the skyscraper were different from those at ground level, the builders had to take into account the wind currents which could potentially change the direction of the airship as it was coming in for a landing.

In addition, the designers had to ensure that the mast and platform were strong enough to safely secure the dirigibles to the building. They knew that the airships had to dock in winds up to 32 miles per hour, and even take on passengers while secured. Painting additional stripes around the top of the platform to provide further guidance to the pilots was also necessary. These brightly colored handrails were already common for mooring dirigibles in other cities, so it was only natural for builders of the Empire State Building to add them as well.

Finally, the builders needed a special section of rail track installed, as the ground was not flat at the edge of the building. This rail would be used to guide the airships in for their landings and transitions, helping to ensure that they would always hit their mark. Additionally, the track was
