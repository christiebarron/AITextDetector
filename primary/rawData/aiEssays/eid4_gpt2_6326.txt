The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it is so well presented. It can be found here. (http://www.guitarofsnowlin.com/winter-hibiscus)   This year's Winter Hibiscus has been called "one of American music's most interesting "songs" for years.  Its music was performed on the first and only acoustic tour of this decade to bring the band's record collection in line with the likes of David Bowie, Bill Clinton, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. The music has a catchy pop theme, and the band's lead guitarist, Paul Thomas Anderson, has even mentioned it as one of his favorites. That's interesting because the song "I Want To Have Fun With You" is actually "One Of Us's Greatest Hits," and in the lyrics it actually declares "I don't want any girl messing with my boobs." But no one ever mentions anything about female sexuality in this song (or any other kind of music).

One of the best examples
