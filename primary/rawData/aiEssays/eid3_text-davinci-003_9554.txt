The setting of 'Rough Road Ahead' by Joe Kurmaski has a significant effect on the cyclist and his journey. The road is described as “rough” and full of “bumps and potholes," making it an arduous and potentially dangerous journey for the cyclist. The poor condition of the road increases the difficulty for the rider, especially with no knowledge of what is ahead. The cyclist must use his skills to move through the bumps, dips, and pot holes, all while maintaining his balance and controlling the bike. The environment further compounds the difficulty with trees, branches, and bushes providing obstacles for the cyclist to navigate around or over. The darkness of night represents a mental challenge for the cyclist, with limited visibility causing fear and uncertainty. The cyclist imagines what kind of creatures inhabit the unknown terrain, furthering his anxieties. Even the silent night sounds, like the rustling of leaves and the snapping of twigs, can unnerve the cyclist. In addition to all of the physical and mental challenges he faces, the cyclist has to consider the potential consequences of the risk he is taking. One wrong move could lead to a devastating result, making the cyclist further doubt his decision to attempt such a dangerous road. The features of the setting, from the road itself to the dark and quiet nature of the night, affect every aspect of the cyclist's journey. The cyclist must be diligent and aware of everything around him in order to successfully reach his destination
