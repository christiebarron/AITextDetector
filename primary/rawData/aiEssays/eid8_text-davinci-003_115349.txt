I felt like I was in a deep hole with no way out. It had been weeks since I had experienced a moment of joy or even a hint of a smile. I was struggling with a lot of life changes around me and I just felt lost and alone. 

Then, I received a surprise visit from an old friend who cheered me up with some stories from the past. Soon, we were both laughing uncontrollably. We were laughing so hard that tears began to fill our eyes. Before I knew it, minutes had passed and a weight had been lifted from my chest. 

I hadn't expected it, but laughter had been the bridge between us, helping us to reconnect and making me feel closer to my friend. That single moment of authentic, contagious laughter made me aware of how relieving it can be. From then on, I realized how important laughter really is.
