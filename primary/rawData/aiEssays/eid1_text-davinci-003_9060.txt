Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion about the effects computers have on people. It can be argued that computers have improved the way we learn, communicate, and work. But what about the potentially negative effects on us as individuals and society as a whole?

The negative effects of computer use range from physical health issues, such as eye strain and poor posture, to mental health concerns, such as addiction and depression. Additionally, computers can lead to a decrease in our social skills. Since computers have made it easier than ever to communicate, it has become less necessary to develop skills such as interpersonal communication, active listening, and problem-solving. This can result in individuals being isolated from physical social interactions, leading to further mental health issues.

Though computers have made life easier, they have their drawbacks. We should be aware of these drawbacks and take action to mitigate them. We can do this by limiting computer use, encouraging face-to-face interpersonal interactions, and setting rules to ensure safe use of computers.

I believe this issue deserves attention and ask that you publish this letter in your newspaper to spread awareness of the potentially negative effects of computer use. I hope this letter will persuade your readers to recognize and consider the effects computers have on people.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
