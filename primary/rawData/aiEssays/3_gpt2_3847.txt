Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. The first is the effect of certain road conditions taking place. The second relates to the fact that the driver is being too close. It is very difficult to maintain your position in the road, especially on the first day.

However, a clear difference between an RWD 'good speed' and a road RWD 'low road' situation is quite clear. Generally I've driven for an RWD 'high road' and also a RWD 'normal', and usually only a passing day turns into an RWD'standard' period. I'm not sure if the difference is significant to the 'good speed' situation, but if it are.

Low road conditions can lead to a RWD USDR for a period of time because of the high accident risk. Standard. That's the same level of competition that a good friend gives you if at some point you hit a tree, or you catch a rock. Road RWD is a good choice because there may be a higher risk of fatal failure. Regular RWD (lowest number of vehicles) makes for more relaxed driving.
