One time I experienced laughter in my life was when the music got loud and I cried when someone hit me. This was when I realized I wasn't a good enough girl to do it. I knew it was my fault, and I had to take responsibility for it. I did get punished, but it wasn't my fault.

How I'm a Woman

Now let's set the record straight. When I was younger, I didn't experience any real emotion. I was kind of the "male" kind. I wouldn't go out with women because I didn't want to look like a man or for anything. And I used to look like that. I was a girl who had not been expected to be a woman at all.

But I am now so grateful to have been a "male" man. And I'm grateful for being a woman. I feel very grateful for this one day.

I believe this year, in my second year on earth, things are going to go great for my soul. Everything is going to start over. I can think of no better time than right now.

I am proud that America's future is here. I'm proud to say that I'm coming back on top in the way I did for a lot of girls. I'm proud to say that we'll make the music that we love again. And I'm proud to say that I will be the last one to die in this city for that.
