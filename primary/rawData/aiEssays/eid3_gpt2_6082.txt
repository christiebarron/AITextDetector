Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. First, they appear to be more likely to have the same average speed of 30/30 or better with higher intensity but, secondly, there is a slight tendency to make a headway because their training may be shorter, which they are not likely to do on roads with higher speeds. When cycling in urban areas, for example, the best route is to head straight and out of the way of the windy streets and instead choose the right road - either head right or turn left. This gives a sense of how 'right roads' have a positive impact on cyclists. In this report, we focus on the most important factors for understanding the results.

Rough Road Ahead means that the average speed of all cyclists is 40-50 km/h when they cycle in rough conditions. This is the very definition of the sport of cycling. However, it also suggests that roads with different tyres and in poor condition tend to have higher, quicker cycling times. This will make those cyclists faster on rough roads and also make a cyclist more likely to be on the road if speeds are higher. Some roads have high windy conditions and have higher average speed.

A more extensive study led by Mark Rett, a University of Cambridge physics student, also found high speeds of cyclists in rough conditions and to be more consistent in their outcomes compared to roads with higher average speeds.
