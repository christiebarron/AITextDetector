The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because he's a total moron, his ideas are totally out of balance, and the book isn't even coherent enough for my taste in books. It might be nice to read another book, that book is too much to bear. He doesn't try anything new. That might convince others that he's right. He's just a bad example of the kind of writer, one who just couldn't possibly know what's best and more in tune with the human experience.

The book will probably get as close as it gets to it's originality. It's a good read. But if you didn't care about reading it, I highly recommend this book, because it's a fantastic read and a great story in its own right.
