When the Empire State Building was constructed in the 1930s, it was not originally designed to have dirigibles docking on its mast, but the idea soon became reality due to the pioneering work of a few inventors. These innovators faced daunting challenges to make the docking of the airships possible, of which the most immediate was the physical obstruction of theNew York skyline.

Initially, the builders of the Empire State Building had to figure out how to design the mooring mast, for which there was no blueprint. Arrangements had to be made to modify the airship's hull and elevator system so that the mast could fit within the confines of the skyline. Inventor G.W. Haugland constructed a counterbalanced carriage which was lowered from the Empire State Building roof, allowing the aircraft to dock safely.

Once this hurdle was overcome, the next challenge was maintaining the necessary weather conditions for the airships. Due to the size of dirigibles, even minor winds could cause the airships disruption, so the builders had to craft the mooring mast in a way that was resistant to wind and turbulence. Fortunately, they succeeded, thus making the airship's docking experience relatively safe and comfortable.
