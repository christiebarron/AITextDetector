The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it is clearly based on the original novels by Stephen King and John Williams, and not a novel from that era. This takes the idea of the first book and adds more to its complexity. The author is doing an amazing job of incorporating its history into the book, and is also bringing in the various stories of the '90s and '00s, as well as the more recent period pieces into a more coherent chronological story. The book also takes place in the context of the Cold War as well, as a fascinating reminder against the harsh reality of modern society that the US still is at war, and that US interventions against other countries are not only unethical but actually counterproductive. The book's main thrust is its historical background on the early '60s and early 1990s, in part due to its focus on the history of American foreign policy, and from it the second part in the 1960s and '70s that was mostly about the American role in the war on drugs and its consequences for the United States.

Overall, Winter Hibiscus is a fantastic book. It is well written, a joy to read and a wonderful addition to any literary library.
