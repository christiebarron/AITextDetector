When I think back to my favorite memories with my best friend, Steve, laughter is usually at the center. We've been friends since high school and have been through some pretty tough times.

One time, we were out at the movies and had just settled into our seats with a huge tub of popcorn. We were about to get comfortable when Steve started to complain about how there was no butter and how it ruined the whole experience. He started making up a song about the injustice of it all.

Before long, both of us were doubled over in laughter, so much so that people in the theater started to notice. Even a few of them started to laugh, too! We were so relieved to have a moment of joy in the middle of a difficult week.

The whole thing might have been silly, but to me, it was a reminder of the power of laughter as a way to come together and lighten the mood. It's something that Steve and I continually rely on to get us through and it's something I will always cherish.
