To the Editor:

In recent years, the future of computing has begun to play an increasingly important role in our everyday lives. From controlling the climate of our homes to allowing us to instantaneously connect with friends all around the world, the advancements of computer technology have allowed us to work more efficiently and enjoy our leisure time in more convenient ways.

However, the omnipresence of computers has also had some drawbacks, particularly when it comes to the effects these advances have on people. Research has proposed that the frequent use of computers has been linked to a decrease in cognitive functioning, a reduction in physical activity, and even depression. Therefore, it is important to recognize the potential implications associated with our reliance on computers before we become too dependent.

Personally, I strongly feel that people should take reasonable steps to ensure that computer technology is used in a mindful manner. Monitoring computer use, introducing physical exercise into daily routines, and taking time away from the computer to engage in social activities are just a few simple steps that can help to increase the balance between the use of technology and health.

As we embrace all that computers have to offer, it is important to also be aware of the potential risks these advances may bring. I believe that if we all strive to use computers responsibly, not only can we benefit from the positives, but can also mitigate the potential ill effects from overuse.

Sincerely,
