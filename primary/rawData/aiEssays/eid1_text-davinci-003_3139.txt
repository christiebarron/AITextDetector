Dear Editor,

As technology has become more and more advanced, computers have become essential to modern life. While computers have many benefits, I believe there are some negative effects on people as well. 

Firstly, computers have caused us to become less reliant on human interaction. With the increasing reliance on the internet for communication, it is too easy to forget how important it is to interact face to face with other people. Many of us are happy to interact with computers more often than with real human beings. 

Secondly, computer technology has made us lazier. With automated tasks taking over from manual jobs, many people are reluctant to put in the effort required to get a job done. We are no longer as active as we were before the computer age. 

Thirdly, computers have caused us to become more sedentary in our lifestyles. With the ability to access entertainment and work on the internet, it is too easy to stay in one spot too long and not get enough exercise.

Finally, computers have enabled us to access unlimited amounts of information and this can lead to overload. We can easily become over-stimulated by the constant influx of data, which can be distracting and counterproductive.
