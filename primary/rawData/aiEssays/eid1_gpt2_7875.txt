Computers have many effects on people. And it's easy to read what happens to these computers when they get a change in their software.

So what do we do when this happens and is our goal for this year's games in the world? Will we make the most interesting games today based upon our own data set?

This is not to say there aren't other games that are well planned. There may even be very interesting games that are planned ahead of time. We know a lot about them and there are plenty of fascinating game projects currently planned for our future, not Elves of the Wind's "The Twilight's End" campaign or the other major fantasy RPG projects in existence. But let's be clear that all these projects can't change the way we play because it takes a certain set of people to create new games and different people in different countries to take the creative liberties that allow them.

What is an open beta?

Open beta can be seen here. It is an open beta for developers to take any feedback from the users who are creating new games. People who find a game they love not the quality of the game, as we already saw with the Kickstarter campaign, could not create a game they did and their funding would not be used for the projects. The project manager will decide what happens if we change anything but you have until August 1, 2016 to send us your feedback.

There will be no changes to the "Game Options" on
