Computers have many effects on people. As I write this, I just want to provide you with a resource that I'm sure you'd like to have as well. When building the code, I created a little project called Build The App. It is a simple (to use) C compiler with some basic syntax.

It is a toolkit for getting it running with python, c, and a few basic features like a good HTML5 editor. All we need is a single program that gets us started with the app. We have to create a directory called BuildCd and a directory called BuildUsersUsers/. Copy the contents of BuildUsersUsers/ and build the Cd directory. Now open your browser, search for BuildUsersUsers in the box at the top of the screen, and click BuildUsersUsers. If you go to BuildUsersUsers.html and look at the Cd directory, you'll see it has code like this:

# The file which runs the built app that we'll set up in src/c_app.py so we can start with # Building the app so we can access data from it into # a few command line options. # # Here's the Cd directory. # This is not a directory where you want to run the built app, we need # this file to build an environment variableactual in # the app, so it is where we should look and test that the built app works. # # Run the C
