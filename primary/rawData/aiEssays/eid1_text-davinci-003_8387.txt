Once, when I was a student, I had a challenging math assignment that I was having difficulty understanding. I asked my teacher for help and she offered to stay after school to help me. I knew she had a lot to do at the end of the day, but she was adamant about staying with me until I was able to complete the assignment. 

She started by breaking down the problems into smaller chunks for me, and then went though each step of the assignment. I still had difficulty understanding some of it, so she was very patient with me as I struggled through it. She gave me time to take breaks and think through each piece of the lesson until it began to click. Finally, after an hour of extra help, I was able to complete the assignment with her guidance. 

Not only did she help me better understand and complete the assignment, but she also taught me a valuable lesson about patience. If it had not been for her dedication to helping me—and her patience—I wouldn’t have had the same level of understanding that I have today.
