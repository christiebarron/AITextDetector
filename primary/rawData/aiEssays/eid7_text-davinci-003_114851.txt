I spent most of my days working as a server in a local restaurant. It was a job I loved, but it sure did come with its own set of challenges. One evening, I was serving a particularly difficult couple. They seemed to be arguing about the menu and everything I said and did seemed to just fan the flames. They were rude and unappreciative, but I decided to stay patient despite their attitude.

I took a deep breath and smiled through my frustration. When they'd finally picked a dish, I made sure to double check their order and triple check the order before sending it in. When their meal came, I saw that it was incorrect. When I told them, they started to argue again and immediately blamed me.

I was determined not to let their attitude get to me, so instead of letting the situation escalate, I apologized for the inconvenience and told them that I would immediately have a new dish made for them. I quickly made my way to the kitchen and explained the situation calmly. We worked quickly to get their meal right and I even decided to throw in some complementary desserts for them.

Thankfully, they appreciated the gesture and thanked me for my patience. It was a challenging situation, but by staying patient, I was able to de-escalate the situation and even turn it into a positive experience.
