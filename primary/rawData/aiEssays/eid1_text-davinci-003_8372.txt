I was travelling in a train to visit a friend. All the booths were full and I was left to sit in the aisle between two families. The difference between their ages and cultures were quite stark.

On one side, there was an elderly couple, who were polite and quietly reading their newspaper. On the other side, a young family of four. A couple of young children were running around, tugging at their parents and screaming. I was a bit annoyed at first but then I remembered to stay patient. 

I started to take deep breaths and reminded myself of the ultimate goal of my trip: to have a pleasant time with my friend. I also thought about the fact that the young family were simply being normal and would soon tire out. 

So I started to focus on the scenery outside the window and tune out the chaos. After a while, the noise had died out and I realized the family had actually put their children on either side of me to act as buffers. It was a sweet gesture and I was touched by their gratitude.

I'm glad I had been patient. It made the journey that much more enjoyable and showed me that patience truly pays off.
