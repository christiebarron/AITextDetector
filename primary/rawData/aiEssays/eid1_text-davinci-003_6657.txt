Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. With our ever-evolving technological landscape, computers have infiltrated all parts of our society -- from our homes to our workplaces. It is no doubt that their presence has revolutionized our lives, making everyday tasks more efficient, thus giving us more time to do the things we enjoy.

However, there are some negative impacts of our reliance on computers. They can be quite isolating, as individuals often prefer online interactions over face-to-face conversations. Computers can also be distracting, as people are easily tempted to check their social media or play video games instead of focusing on the task at hand.

Moreover, too much time spent in front of the computer can take a serious physical toll on our bodies, including vision issues, neck and back pain, and a sedentary lifestyle. Therefore, people should stay aware of their use of computers and practice good habits to battle the effects of incorrect usage.

I urge readers to consider the potential drawbacks of using computers and take measures to ensure their use has a positive effect on our lives.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
