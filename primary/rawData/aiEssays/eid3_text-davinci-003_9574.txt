The setting of Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead" is essential to the story's plot and the cyclist's experience. The story takes place in a seemingly post-apocalyptic world, where the cyclist finds himself alone, searching for safety on a deserted road. The terrain and atmosphere in the setting are meant to evoke feelings of dread and loneliness that add to the cyclist's vulnerability and fear; the dark forest, the winding roads, and the distant gunshots all contribute to this feeling.

The weather conditions in the poem further the cyclist's vulnerability; the oppressive heat and lack of water speak to the severity of his situation and the fragility of life. The fact that day and night are indistinguishable also adds to the poet's predicament. The darkness can be a metaphor for the danger he faces, and the heat of the sun can be used to highlight the oppressive environment he is in.

The combination of features in this setting create a foreboding atmosphere that is essential to the story's focus. The cyclist is in a dangerous and oppressive situation; his thoughts of fear and desperation combined with the loneliness of the setting bring to life emotions of desperation that make this poem meaningful. The setting, in this case, is essential for giving life to story and the emotion of the cyclist.
