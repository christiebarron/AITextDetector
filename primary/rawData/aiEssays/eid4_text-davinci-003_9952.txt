Minfong Ho ends Winter Hibiscus with this question to signify a cycle of resilience, of rebirth and re-emergence, of courage and determination. It is a symbol of hope and perseverance, that Chiao will not give up and will attempt the test again when the snow melts and the warmth of spring returns. The motif of a new season is meant to represent Chiao's own journey of self-growth and courage, and of being reborn with a stronger force each time.
