An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was just starting out and I heard what my dad said. He was really good at what he was saying and he was there for my dad for 15-20 minutes when he didn't feel like there was any room for it. We ended up in that room at home for about two hours. I remember our first scene on the set and I remember everyone just saying, "How are you?" I just looked at myself in the mirror and said, "I was just taking things off the screen. What are you doing?" Because I was sick and I remember there was nothing like me and they would say, "Oh, wow, this is pretty amazing of you." That was the best scene." I had to move on to one last show but the show always ended. I think it was there when I really felt my heart starting to come out in the way it did when we came back [when The Vampire Diaries was in production].
