The author ends the poem with this line to reinforce the idea of the passing of time and the cyclical nature of life. The poem speaks of a year full of hardship for the speaker and ends as it began - with a sense of hope and expectation for the upcoming spring. The line also serves as an invitation to the reader to take a break and reflect on the passage of time in their own lives, and to view moments of difficulty as opportunities for growth.
