The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it is both self-policing and self-critical in nature.


I feel this book helps people to realize what I'm talking about, where I stand on the issue. It's all about acknowledging, not simply trying to tell, how to think the other way about things, the things that we deal with, things that cause conflict, what our lives are like at every turn.


I think it is a necessary and vital act to be a writer. If you can be a writer, you can become an actor and a comedian, you can be in a band, you can write music, you can become a comic, you just can't possibly be a codecoder.


A good book will teach you this.
