One day I was taking my young daughter to the local park. It was crowded and chaotic, and we quickly became separated in the crowd. I was panicked at first, but I knew my daughter was safe and knew she would be okay.

My first instinct was to start shouting her name, looking under benches, and running around the park. Instead, I stayed where I was and counted to ten to calm myself down. I remembered my training and focused on my breathing. Even though inside I was panicking, on the surface, I was patient and understanding.

I waited for what seemed like an eternity until my daughter reappeared with a big smile on her face, letting me know she was all right. I was so grateful to see her. 

This experience taught me to trust in life, and to believe that everything will work out. It also showed me that, even in the most chaotic of times, patience can be a great virtue.
