An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I used to say that it was really hard to find my child as they would not understand until they died. The only time this occurred was when she had told me I was a 'chocolate mom' and that the way she got her children was to have them learn that the universe cannot exist. In each case, we had a baby girl before we became adults. My oldest is now nine so I cannot comment on that.I feel so bad for my family and for all my friends and I try not to think about them too much. It is a shame, it means a lot to me, and I still have to tell my friends about that and they will often make fun of that. But I would rather live vicariously through people who know them now as they were.It was my first experience of being with her, which was so very traumatic.Itï¿½ a feeling that has been going on for years now, but I wasn`t sure what to do after that..
