The author Minfong Ho ends Winter Hibiscus with an interpretation of the resilience of nature, which in turn reflects the resilience of the protagonist. The ending line serves as a symbol of hope and renewal for the protagonist, who is facing a difficult decision. By ending with the possibility of the hibiscus coming back in the spring, Ho is suggesting that no matter what struggles we may face in life, our stories have the potential to continue and bloom. The protagonist in the story has the hope that his story will similarly be able to continue through the end of winter and bloom into springtime. There is also the suggestion of a metaphorical test, which represents the difficult decisions we all have to make in life and the courage it takes to face them. The ending of the story reinforces the message of hope that was present throughout it.
