It was a regular Saturday morning for my fianc√© and me. We both enjoyed sleeping in, but somehow she had been wide awake at 7 am. She had made us pancakes and started playing some of our favorite songs. She certainly had a special agenda for that day. I started to get suspicious when, out of the corner of my eye, I noticed a bag she had been hiding.

When she finally revealed the bag, I found out it was filled with funny-shaped hats, masks, and cutouts. She had me put on a silly-looking hat with a mariachi-style sombrero. We had the kitchen counters and stools set up as if we were going to play a game show. She asked me what I would pick to answer a trivia question for a bonus prize.

I instantly started laughing uncontrollably. It was so unexpected, but so welcomed. She snapped a quick photo before I had to compose myself and put my top hat back on. We ended up playing the game for hours, laughing and joking around with each other. We had so much fun, and when we eventually wrapped up the festivities, all we had to do was look back at the photos to relive all the good vibes. We had created such a silly environment, but the laughter we shared was the best reward I could've asked for.
