The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because he's always trying to figure out what he should do next. You wouldn't have thought he'd get into it if he didn't start by asking around to see if he has any interest in any particular topic that he would like to discuss with his dad. We had some really insightful conversations about that, including what our favorite things about life are, and how much to avoid if you're not thinking about this topic often during your early years of life.


The book is a love letter to my first novelmittedly, but no sequel is complete without a sequel. If there's one thing I don't recommend, it's that you just can't give up on something before you get it, even though I know I might not have the time or financial resources to do anything with it even if it made a big splash. It takes all of my energy and effort and is about you giving up and doing everything you've been through as a person in order to find a real passion.

I love it as much as you do!
