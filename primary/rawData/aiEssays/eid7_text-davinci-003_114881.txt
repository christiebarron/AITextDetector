I recently had a chance to experience patience first hand. I was out shopping for a new laptop and it turned out to be a lot harder than I had originally thought. I had done some research beforehand, but still found it difficult to pick through the options and figure out which one would be best for me. After a few hours of looking, I still couldn't find anything that I liked. 

However, what happened next really stood out and showed me the power of patience. I asked a sales associate for help and she immediately took the time to explain all of my options to me. Despite the fact that we were both getting tired and it was already getting late, she was patient and understanding. She didn't rush me, but instead made sure that I had all the information I needed to make the right decision. Eventually, I found the laptop that perfectly fit my needs and I walked away feeling incredibly grateful for the associate's patience.
