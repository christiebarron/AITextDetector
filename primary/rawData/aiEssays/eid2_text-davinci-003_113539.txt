The issue of censorship in libraries is a controversial one, and many libraries have faced immense public pressure to remove materials from their shelves deemed to be offensive or inappropriate. While those advocating for censorship might believe it is necessary to protect society from offensive material, it is important to consider all the implications of censorship before taking action. 

The removal of certain materials from libraries is not an effective solution because it does not address the underlying causes of inappropriate content. Instead, it simply hides what could be seen as "inappropriate" material from anyone who visits the library. It is much more effective to focus on education and open dialogue to tackle the issue of inappropriate content rather than trying to completely ban it.

Furthermore, it's essential to consider the intellectual and educational freedoms that are so important to society's functioning. Libraries serve a vital cultural and educational role, either providing free access to important material to those who aren't able to afford it, or allowing people to explore different points of view to form their own opinions. Censorship in this context could end up undermining that role, and would lead to a decrease in the public's access to knowledge. 

Therefore, it is important to preserve the offering of free and open access to literature and media in libraries. Rather than censorship, the focus should be on providing an educational atmosphere and experience in libraries. Libraries should be a safe place to discover new books, explore different ideas, and learn about the world.
