The author is suggesting that the protagonist can find beauty and hope in the return of the spring after a long and difficult winter. By comparing the situation of taking the test to the rebirth of winter hibiscus in the springtime, the author is connecting the idea of difficult journeys to the hopeful moments of renewal. This allows the protagonist to look beyond what they are facing in the moment and instead gives them a goal to strive for and a point of perspective for the difficult times ahead.
