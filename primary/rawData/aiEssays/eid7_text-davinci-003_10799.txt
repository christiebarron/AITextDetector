I recently went grocery shopping at the store near my house and it ended up taking me a lot longer than I anticipated because the lines were much busier than usual. I was getting frustrated, feeling like I was losing valuable time, and I could feel my patience starting to slip away. But I reminded myself to stay calm and be patient because it was out of my control. I made a conscious effort to be tolerant and understanding of the situation, not because I had to, but because I wanted to focus on the positive of that moment. 

I felt great relief once I had finished my shopping and left the store. I was proud of myself for not letting my frustration ruin my day, and I had a newfound sense of respect and patience for others.
