Computers have many effects on people. When you get bored of getting bored; when you get depressed or anxious; when you go crazy; when you play with friends; when you're at the gym or in a party. For example, I get depressed every day. And I go crazy. But I'm also depressed when I get home from work. I'm just depressed, I get depressed at work, if I haven't done something that I wanted to perform, that I should have been. And so this is why I get depressed all the time.

I feel like I'm depressed when I'm really motivated by work, I just do less than usual. People don't think that because they put in work. They can feel bad about it because it's more fun, even though I do less stuff. That would be the greatest thing that you could achieve with yourself.

So it could be that you haven't set out to become a good computer engineer, but there's plenty of people in the computer industry. I might not be the most clever person, but I'm not as good as people think I am. People just seem to think I'm going to blow up. It's hard for me not to be a computer programmer because computers are very difficult. And it's difficult for me to develop my own software that can be used for all sorts of different purposes and even to be able to communicate with the world. So that's the reason I get into computer engineering
