Dear Editor, 

I am writing to share my opinion on the effects computers have on people. It is clear that computers are having a major impact on modern life and countless everyday activities.

The continuous use of computers has been linked to physical problems such as eye strain, headaches, blurred vision and bad posture due to long hours of sitting. Furthermore, some research suggests that too much use of computers has a negative effect on communication with friends and family, as interactions happen more through digital media and less face to face. Some studies have linked this to people feeling less connected to their community, less empathy and even depression.

On the other hand, computers have enabled people to become more productive, with access to more information, the ability to communicate with more people and the chance to use countless tools and services. To put it simply this progression can be viewed as both positive and negative, yet what matters most is how people choose to use computers.

Responsibility over use is essential to ensure that its effects are positive and not a detriment to peopleâ€™s lives. Learning how to use computers in moderation and focusing on engaging in meaningful activities such as healthy conversations, physical activities, and outdoor activities are some of the few events that can be done to combat such negative effects.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. 

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
