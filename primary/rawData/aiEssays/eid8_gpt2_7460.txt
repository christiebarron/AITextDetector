One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I saw a film by an artist called 'The Great Wall' and it made me a huge fan. Since then, it has been my habit to put up a good example of the funny thing we can do with comedy.

"For instance, when I saw a film in the magazine 'Choreography', a comedy magazine dedicated to the US national anthem, I thought to myself 'Gosh what a fantastic piece of work that was'.

"I have always loved comedy as a medium and never thought I'd be doing such an amazing job on it as it was. I wish I had learnt more about the different ways in which people are influenced by comedy when writing and on stage."

In the past few years, the British comedian Alan Jones has created a new genre called 'Faux Comedy', where comedic acts are invited to use the internet to promote their work.

Jones is also developing a new genre of satirical shows from the likes of Joss Whedon's Doctor Who in which actors play their part and the camera shoots.

He said: "A big part of the fun of the Faux Comedy genre is that, in a given moment, an action scene that the characters can move around in seems to be a natural place to do that in."
