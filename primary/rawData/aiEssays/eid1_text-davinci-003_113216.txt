Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion about the effects computers have on people. As we move into an increasingly digital era, people rely more and more on computers to complete their daily tasks. In response, it is becoming more difficult to avoid computers and the effects they can have on us.

I believe that computers are a positive influence on people. They provide us with an efficient way to research information and to complete tasks quickly. Computers have also allowed us to stay connected with friends and family regardless of location. Additionally, computers improve the overall productivity of people in their daily lives.

However, while computers can be beneficial, they also have the potential to be harmful. The overconsumption of screens can lead to vision problems, physical problems such as carpal tunnel syndrome, and can lead to mental-health issues, such as depression, anxiety, and insomnia.

Therefore, I believe it is important to be mindful of the effects computers can have on people. While they can certainly provide us with convenience, they should be used in moderation, and if people start to experience ill-effects, they should take a break from the computing world.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
