The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of obstacles when it came to allowing dirigibles to dock. The most obvious of these was the sheer size of the building. At 1,250 feet high and over 102 stories, it was considerably taller than any other man-made structure at the time and its sheer enormity presented a unique challenge.

In order to accommodate the dirigibles, the building had to be fitted with a “mooring mast” – a tall steel structure designed to securely hold the mooring lines as the large airships floated by. The mast was also equipped with a rotating gangplank which would extend out for passengers to disembark. It was designed by a team led by Professor J.W. Trigg and was one of the most complex projects ever undertaken at the time.

The mooring mast had to be structurally sound enough to withstand the strong winds that often buffeted the Empire State Building, tall enough to stay above the level of the airships, and heavy enough to keep its footing even when punctured or damaged by a passing dirigible. The mast’s construction also had to take into account the heated political climate of the time as the airships were often linked to military fleets.

The team of engineers was stymied by challenges beyond their imagination, yet they persevered and the mooring mast eventually became a part of the icon that is the Empire State Building
