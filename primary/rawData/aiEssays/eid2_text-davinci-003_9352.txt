Censorship in libraries is a highly contentious issue. It has been argued that library materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves if they are deemed offensive, and this should not be a question for debate. Censorship in libraries ultimately violates our right to access information and opinion freely.

First of all, censorship of library materials undermines an individualâ€™s right to access information and opinion freely. When library materials are censored, it prevents those with legitimate interests from finding what they need. It can also prevent people from being exposed to a variety of opinions and ideas, even if they may not agree with them. This results in a narrowing of perspectives and a decrease in the overall quality of intellectual discourse.

Furthermore, the removal of certain materials from libraries can act as a form of censorship itself. When certain materials are judged to be inappropriate, it sends a message that this material is wrong, and that it should not be read or viewed. While it may be argued that the removal of certain materials is necessary to preserve the reputation of the library, this actually silences various points of view and undermines our right to make up our own minds about what we choose to read or watch.

Finally, censorship in libraries often perpetuates certain biases. If certain materials are removed due to their content, this can often be an indicator of a particular bias or prejudice, such as racism, sexism, or homophobia. This perpetuates norms of exclusion
