The famous Empire State Building, built in 1931, was designed with a unique feature – an 800-foot-tall mooring mast designed to allow dirigibles (also known as airships) to dock on the rooftop. This mooring mast was intended to provide a safe and convenient station for airship passengers and cargo, helping to popularize airships as an alternate form of transportation.
 
However, in reality, the task of allowing dirigibles to dock was far from easy. In fact, it presented a number of obstacles to the Empire State Building’s builders. First, the mast had to be constructed with high-strength steel to support the large mass of the dirigibles. Additionally, a difficult process of rigging was required to make mooring the vessels possible. This involved detailed calculations and precise engineering to ensure that the mooring arms were able to safely and securely carry the dirigible as it made its landing.

Another challenge arose when it came to the actual operation of docking. This required experienced pilots who would be able to precisely calculate the aircraft’s speed and maneuverability. It also required specialized personnel on the ground to guide the dirigible to land. Finally, all of these operations had to take place in stormy weather and not in the best conditions.

The mooring mast also presented some legal issues. The Empire State Building was located in an area of highly restricted airspace and several local and federal
