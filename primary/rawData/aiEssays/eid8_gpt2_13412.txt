One time I experienced laughter in my life was when we were in school. I said it to a group of eight friends, and then when I left school on my way to my job, my teacher said, ''You know, you can have fun if you want, but you have to stick to work and love it. It's a pretty dangerous feeling and you have to be pretty good or at least that's how I felt and that's why, you know, that's who I am." I found myself going back to that old adage after that conversation, where in the future was there a way to say hello to me again.
