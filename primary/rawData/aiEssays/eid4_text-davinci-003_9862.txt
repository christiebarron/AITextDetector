Minfong Ho ends her poem with this phrase to hint at the cyclical nature of life in terms of memory and growth. The poem is told by a speaker looking back on a moment of adversity in her past--the fact that she failed an academic test. Although she does not pass her first time, she speaks with the assurance that she will be able to try again in the future, confident that she will be able to succeed in the future. This is why Ho chooses to end her poem with the reference to the returning of the spring, noting that just as the hibiscus will bloom again with the change of the season, she too will be able to try again and possibly succeed once more. The repetition of the act by both herself and the hibiscus speaks to the idea of resilience in the face of any challenge, ultimately emphasizing the message of perseverance.
