I was volunteering in a local soup kitchen when I encountered an expressionless and withdrawn man. Upon further interaction, he opened up to me and told me about his experiences of homelessness due to substance abuse.

He told me that life was difficult and he was trying to get back on his feet, but had not been able to find success. I listened patiently, without judging or being dismissive, and reminded him that there are many resources available to him. I explained to him that he should never give up and that it just takes time and patience.

He thanked me for the advice and I could see a newfound glint of hope in his eyes. I made sure to take the time to talk and listen to him, without making him feel embarrassed or ashamed.

I was glad to see that I was able to help this kind and unfortunate man and it felt great to show patience and compassion.
