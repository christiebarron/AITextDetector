Dear Editor,

I am writing to raise awareness about the potential harms of computer use as it pertains to our mental and physical health. The proliferation of computer technology has enhanced peopleâ€™s lives in many ways, but we must be aware of the dangers of overexposure.

Spending excessive amounts of time in front of a computer leads to strain on our eyes, backs, and necks. In addition, overuse can also lead to psychological deterioration from lack of outdoor activity, insufficient tending to interpersonal relationships, and even addiction. These mental and physical conditions can wreak havoc on our health, and interfere with our daily tasks. 

It is essential that everyone be mindful of the potential harms of computer use while still enjoying the benefits it can provide. Engage in physical activities, maintain healthy interpersonal relationships, and limit the amount of time spent in front of the computer. Taking these steps can beneficial to everyone's health.

I urge readers to be aware of the potential harms of computers and to limit the amount of time spent in front of them. As a society, we should take every measure possible to ensure that all are healthy, both physically and mentally. 

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
