In his latest book, 'From Home is, like many of us in the creative business today, an important book but also an exciting one'. He explained to a host of news and media personalities the role he played in the film and television project "The Girl Who Was Never Really A Girl."

In the book, he talks on and on about his time at a film studio in Paris, and the many jobs he took that went on with the project. Among them were his job working with director Jacques Beaumont and director Jean-Michel Diermour on 'The Wolf of Wall Street,' a long-running drama.

He also describes how in the late 1970s, after he won the Paris award for best director, he became an acting coach by training.

In the book, he also reveals the inspiration behind his own stage career, in which he played a small band manager and a director with the name Tchaikovsky.
