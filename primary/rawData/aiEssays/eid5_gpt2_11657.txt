The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' has given it a new twist and added a new element to a story with different elements to the film. It's a much more moving journey to a younger age in such a challenging time.

All in all, The Last Airbender is a brilliant, entertaining and thrilling portrait of a life not to be lost, and with it a renewed sense of what is possible in life.

We are so happy to be able to be in this story. And we're so happy to get something out of it.
