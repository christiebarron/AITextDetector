The building of the Empire State Building was a monumental undertaking, and one of the most inspiring feats of engineering of its time. One particularly ambitious idea had to do with the possibility of allowing dirigibles to dock on the top floors of the tower, which had been conceived by the builders even before the building had reached its full height. What was remarkable was that the Empire State Building was designed with this possibility in mind.

However, even though the plan was ingenious, the road to success was filled with obstacles. One of the major impediments was the unsuitable weather conditions for docking. By nature, the docking of a dirigible requires clear and calm weather conditions. Even with these conditions present, the building’s high altitude in downtown Manhattan, located in direct vicinity of nearby buildings, made docking from the Empire State Building’s mooring mast impractical.

The mooring mast itself proved to be another challenge in the building of the Empire State Building, requiring complex engineering and design refinement. It was created from steel and 16-gauge sheet metal, and had to be located on the roof of the building in order to support the weight of a docked dirigible. These design specifications also meant that the mooring mast had to be modified in order to provide adequate stability and structural support, making it suitable for docking.

Finally, the mooring mast needed to have its own infrastructure in order to sustain its operations - most notably
