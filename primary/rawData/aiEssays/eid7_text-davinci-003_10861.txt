I remember a time when I had to be very patient. I was in college, playing my first season of football. I had always loved the sport and was eager to hit the field, but I had to wait my turn. There were several more experienced players with starting positions and I was assigned to the bench. Despite this disappointment, I decided to remain patient and use it as an opportunity to learn and observe. 

During practice, I spent time studying the plays and watching the starters. I asked lots of questions and kept up my enthusiasm for the sport, even though I wasn’t playing as much as I had hoped. I worked hard, stayed focused, and trained whenever I was given the chance.

Eventually, one of the starters got injured and I was given the opportunity to play in a game. I was grateful for the chance to show the coaches what I was capable of and, in the process, I ended up leading my team to victory. That experience really taught me how valuable patience can be and how important it is to stick with something, even when it’s difficult.
