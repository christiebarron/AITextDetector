This is a rhetorical question in which the narrator hopes will give her strength to keep going, though she anxiety-ridden about taking the same test again. In the question, a metaphor is created. Winter is a difficult time, but spring and the return of life symbolize hope and a new beginning. By ending on this hopeful note, it reminds the narrator that even though she may not feel prepared to take the test again, she will be able to face the challenge when the time comes.
