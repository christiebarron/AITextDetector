Dear Editor, 

I am writing to share my views on the effects of computers and technology on people in society today. I believe computers can be a great asset to people who use them to their advantage, but I also think they can have a negative effect when they are not used responsibly.

On one hand, computers can be a powerful tool, helping people to learn, communicate, and stay connected. From students researching using online databases to working adults writing reports or managing their finances, computers can give us access to time-saving resources that make tasks easier. Many jobs now require the use of computers and they also serve as an essential link to global markets, helping businesses to expand and succeed. 

On the other hand, too much reliance on computers and technology can have an effect on peopleâ€™s social relationships, mental health, and overall wellbeing. It has been documented that too much time on social media can lead to feelings of comparison and isolation particularly among children and teens. In addition, those who become overly absorbed in video games, online content, or texting can put their real life relationships, their physical health, and their school or work performance in jeopardy. 

Overall, using computers to access information and stay connected can be beneficial, but it should be done in moderation. Used responsibly, computers can be a useful tool that opens opportunities and creates success.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
