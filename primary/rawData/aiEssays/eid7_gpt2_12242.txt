An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I worked as a nurse at a major depression research facility and I was working as a janitor at an elementary school. I was so depressed that I was constantly looking to have my job back. Instead, I was constantly looking for work, whether it was as a nurse or as a janitor. So when they told me I had to work four shifts, the first time, I saw their mistake. I was devastated. "I want to be a janitor right now!" I went to the nurses at this facility and asked them, "What is wrong with working overtime on weekends?" They had no idea. They wouldn't accept my explanation, which was that when I worked under the standard scheduling schedules, I was on home shift and they'd send me home on Friday in the first three weeks of a week. And so when I worked twice that I was back at work in mid-day, or in the morning. No one told me that. I was sick.

They said, "Listen, that's exactly when you start feeling a bit depressed." So I started feeling more and more tired for the first time in my life and I needed help. It made me want to do something. They helped me to get a degree, I started doing more things that I enjoy doing now. But by 9 1/2 hours, I was depressed and that's when I started feeling like I was living in hell.
