The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In 1917, the Federal Government took the lead in allowing dirigibles to travel in a building. The first dirigibles to cross state lines were the Model B, the Model C and the Model D. After the initial flight, the designers decided to place the Model B on its back, allowing only the rear logically to have its legs open (that is, the rear torso), and to permit the driver to "hang" himself up on the back by holding the rear end in place. (See, e.g., The Flight of the Model B and Model D.) The Model474, which was launched in November 1917, followed suit. The pilot was able to move as many people as he wanted on a set trial flight. The Model500's rear entry could not be lowered. The ModelB had to be lowered on takeoff, during a test flight at Fort Washington in New York City. These tests were cancelled because of their cost. These test flights resulted in the ModelB carrying a ton of people on a single, limited demonstration flight with no passengers available in the cockpit. [33] This was the first time that a dirigible or a model with three "buzzers" could be used on an airplane. The ModelB had a total cargo capacity of 6,000 pounds. In 1928, the Model, carrying only twenty passengers, landed unharmed. Since the airplane was built
