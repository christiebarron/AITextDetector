An example of a time someone in my life was patient was me, just coming out for my 13th Anniversary with my sister on a show together. I was there. I am a professional wrestler and a mother. She is the only mom, grandmother, grandmother. Her daughter went to college and my sister took her. (I was there too.) On my second day of my college freshman year (I started at 6.15 then went to the 2nd class to work after my first class in school) my sister passed away. She was the daughter of a former basketball player and also one of my best friends. ( I also did work from home in school as a janitor to keep my family in line.)

My dad taught us to read by heart, to take notes at the right time, to go to sleep at the right time to pick up things during the night while I was doing my routine, to be happy and to be happy. To me, the greatest joy, the greatest love, and the greatest strength of life is love being loved by someone else.

So, I'm an open-minded person who loves my mother and family. I'm a good and smart person. I have an important job ahead of me. I hope that I have the courage to do some good.

But, I'm not done with my job yet and I still have a huge dream of being a writer and to be an advocate for the good of society.
