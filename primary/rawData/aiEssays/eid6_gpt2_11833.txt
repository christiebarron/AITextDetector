The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. There was also the issue of design: did it contain anything of value beyond an airframe?

It's been an open question for some time. A few architects like Mr. Zuckerman of Wittenberg were hesitant to release an airplane, as they would lose that very kind of confidence in a concept. But, according to Mr. Zuckerman, his initial thinking was one of using a real-world plane.

Mr. Zuckerman has been taking the unusual step of bringing another futuristic concept, a commercial airplane, to fruition: flying by aircraft over China. That's because he sees this development as an ideal, but a more difficult one, given China's history of commercial flying.

"The Chinese will fly in commercial aircraft over the mainland, but they'll also also fly commercial airplanes in the countryside," he said. A commercial jet might cost millions of dollars, but that's just how China has for decades, with no regulations or restrictions on how the technology can be used in the air. Even the air travel laws have gotten into effect.

With a commercial airplane or jet, a person can fly in the skies of a city. There could be no restrictions. But there has been one major impediment to commercial flight in the Chinese past: there is too much fuel in the air. In the past several years, an increasing number of commercial airline routes
