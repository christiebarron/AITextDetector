I remember the time when I was having lunch with a couple of friends at a local café. We were in the middle of our conversation when suddenly, another group of friends barged in and started to be quite noisy and loud. It was really irritating and I began to get frustrated. 

However, one of my friends was very patient with them. He stayed cool and kept focusing on his food. He didn’t say a word, he just stayed focused and acted as if the other group wasn’t making a lot of noise. After a few minutes, the other group quietened down and we were able to continue our conversation. I was so impressed by his patience and it taught me a valuable life lesson. I learned that sometimes the best way to respond to situations that are out of your control is to stay calm and be patient.
