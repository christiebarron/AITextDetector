I recently visited my mom in the hospital after she had a minor surgery. As soon as I arrived, I could tell she was in pain. Despite my inquiring, she kept reassuring me that everything was okay.

We joked and laughed, but every once in a while, sheâ€™d groan in pain. She knew that I was concerned for her wellbeing, but also that there was nothing that I could do to make her feel better.

My mom, being the incredibly strong and patient woman that she is, simply smiled and tried to make the best of it. She asked me to bring her books and magazines and brushed her hair, despite feeling in pain. When I saw her being so patient with the pain, it really made me love and admire her. Even though she was struggling to stay positive in the face of her physical discomfort, she managed it gracefully and without complaint.

As we talked, I found myself being incredibly patient, understanding, and tolerant with my mom. Even though I wanted to do everything in my power to make her physical discomfort go away, I knew that I could only do so much; however, by simply being present for her and listening to her needs, I still felt like I was able to help.

At the end of my visit, I was so proud of my mom for being so patient and strong, and so glad that I was able to be there for her. I left her room feeling inspired
