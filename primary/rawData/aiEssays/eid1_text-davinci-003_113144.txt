Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people today. Computers play an invaluable role in our lives, both professionally and personally; however, they have a more profound effect on us than many may realize.

The effects of computers on people's lives are often underestimated. For some, they act as a form of entertainment, but for others, they provide an invaluable source of information on virtually any topic imaginable, leading to increased knowledge and understanding of our world. For those in the workforce, computers are a powerful tool to complete research, analyze data, and automate processes, all of which lead to greater efficiency and capabilities. This is particularly useful for those within the STEM and business professions, where access to latest technology is often essential.

In addition, computers have a direct effect on our mental health. They can be used to reduce stress and anxiety, and promote productivity. Computers are also a great way to maintain connections, with online communities and social media platforms allowing users to interact and connect with others from around the world. 

Thus, the effects of computers on people are varied and often beneficial. Whether it be for entertainment, productivity, knowledge or maintaining connections, computers are an invaluable tool that has influenced many aspects of our lives.

Sincerely,

[Name]
