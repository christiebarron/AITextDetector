The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Some would have to take an external system-on-a-chip to control it.

But the Empire State Building had the most direct and efficient way to use the internal devices.

In order to move buildings as fast as possible, they needed to take a different approach than the one used with conventional building material. "On conventional buildings," says Hinton, "there is a great problem, because conventional materials use energy as energy. You have to go through many steps to build the material used for the building. At the moment I don't know how to work with the materials at all; I just have to build them. That's the main thing. When you have to add other materials, you always have the other problem too, like that of the sun and clouds. That's why we are moving to a new type of technology." The Chinese have successfully used these technologies (for about three decades now) and have used some 20,000 dirigibles in construction.

In the United States, the Chinese are going all out. They've unveiled an experimental dirigible prototype and are developing the first dirigibles from the Chinese company, the China Exploration. The second one is already being built on U.S. test sites. The third project will be a full test of the latest Chinese technology. While the Chinese, like most of the American audience, have been reluctant to
