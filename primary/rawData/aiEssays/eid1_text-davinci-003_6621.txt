Dear [Editor],

I am writing to address the impact that computers have on us as individuals. As technology continues to advance, we must evaluate the potential long-term effects these devices may have on us.

In my opinion, computers are a practical tool that provide convenience and access to a wide variety of information. They offer greater inclusion and collaboration within educational, professional, and social networks. However, they are also becoming more intrusive and addictive in our lives. From the constant demand for immediate gratification to physical health issues due to lack of movement, computers can negatively affect physical and emotional well-being.

I urge you to recognize the potential risks of overusing computers. Witnessing the long-term effects first-hand has convinced me that we must pay attention to this issue. We must be mindful of the possible physical and mental impacts of staring at screens for hours, and be proactive in developing moderation strategies.

In sum, computers provide important advantages, but individuals must remain vigilant of their impact. Thus, I encourage readers to embrace the convenience of these devices with mindful use, so that we can maintain and improve our overall well-being.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
