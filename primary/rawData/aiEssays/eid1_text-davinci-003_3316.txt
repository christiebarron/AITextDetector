Dear Editor, 

As technology advances and becomes more common in daily life, computers and computer software are increasingly becoming integral parts of our lives. The effects that computers have on people today are multifaceted, and can be both positive and negative.

On the positive side, computers have made our lives much easier. We can now search and find information faster than ever before as well as communicate with people around the world in a meaningful and efficient way. Additionally, computers have opened up countless opportunities for entrepreneurs, who now have access to entire networks of people and resources.

On the flip side, computers can also be very detrimental to people’s lives. Too much time spent staring at a screen has been linked to eye strain, obesity, and even depression. People can also become isolated by depending too much on computers to interact with others.

On balance, we should recognize that computers can be a positive and powerful tool. However, it is important to be mindful of the potential downsides and ensure that we don’t get lost in technology and lose ourselves in the process.

Sincerely, 

[Your name]
