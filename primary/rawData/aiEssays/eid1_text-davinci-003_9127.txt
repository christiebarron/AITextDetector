Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have had on people in our local community. As technology advances, the world is rapidly changing and computers have become an integral part of our daily lives. While computers are commonly thought of as a tool for communication and productivity, I feel that they can also have a negative impact on people.

The more we rely on computers, the more likely we are to disengage with our immediate environment and the people we interact with. Computers can be isolating and, in some cases, lead to depression. There is no substitute for being with family or friends, talking and laughing together. We are missing out on meaningful conversations in favour of immediacy.

Moreover, computers have a huge impact on physical health. Prolonged time sitting and staring at a screen is bad for your posture, eyesight, and can also lead to weight gain. Computers can also be a major cause of stress in our lives, especially if we are not managing our usage wisely.

It is my strong belief that computer use should be limited and balanced with other activities, such as being outdoors and socializing with other people. Furthermore, we should use our time online to connect with people, learn new skills, and expand our horizons. We need to remind ourselves that spending too much time on computers comes at a cost and that our physical and mental health should come first.

I urge everyone in the community
