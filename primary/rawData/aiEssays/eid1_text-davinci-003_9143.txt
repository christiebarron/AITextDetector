Dear Editor,

It seems just about every day we come across news of the new advances in technology and the impact it is having on our daily lives. There is no doubt that computers have made our lives easier and more efficient, but it is important to consider the potential effects that they have on our physical and mental health.

Recent studies have shown that the increased use of computers has been linked to a decrease in social interaction amongst people, as well as leading to an increase in physical inactivity. This physical inactivity has been largely attributed to a decrease in physical exercise, as well as a decrease in sleep and an increase in stress levels. When these lifestyle and environmental factors are taken together, it is clear that computers have the potential to lead to a decrease in mental wellbeing.

Furthermore, people often forget to take breaks from using their computers. This ongoing overstimulation and lack of rest can lead to both physical and mental exhaustion. Therefore, it is important to have regular breaks away from the computer to give our mind and body time to recuperate from the intense use of computers.

To conclude, the usage of computers has both advantages and disadvantages. Therefore it is necessary for us to be aware of the effects computers can have on our physical and mental health and to use them appropriately to prevent any potential harm.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
