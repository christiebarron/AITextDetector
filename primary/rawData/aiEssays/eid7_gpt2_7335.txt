Then someone with our job asked me to go out and give the job to someone else so my wife said "no" and this was the "last step". The only reason she took me out was so that I could get her to return my husband. I thought it was so nice of her to accept my offer instead of go take the wife in the process. I also thought it would be nice if she accepted more and would have an easier life.
