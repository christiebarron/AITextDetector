I was at the grocery store and it was busy - there were long lines and not enough cash registers. I could feel my patience wearing thin, as I had been standing in line for 25 minutes already. I watched the people around me, increasingly frustrated and complaining about the wait time. 

I told myself to stay calm and be patient. I reminded myself that the cashiers were doing their best with what they had in front of them. I took slow, deep breaths to keep myself from getting anxious.

Eventually my turn came and I breathed a sigh of relief when I made it to the cashier. Even though I had waited so long, I still spoke to the cashier kindly and thanked them for doing their best under the circumstances. I felt proud of myself for being patient when I wanted to do the opposite.
