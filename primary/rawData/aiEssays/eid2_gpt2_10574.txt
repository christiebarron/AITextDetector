I believe that censorship of materials in libraries should be allowed, as well.

When the author of "The Little House on the Prairie" wrote to the American Library Association's president about her concerns about the library board's decisions on her book, he noted the library's library staff had been asking the paper to get a copy of the decision before publication, and that's when the library staff "doxxed" the review. The decision to withhold the manuscript has caused some furor in recent years. On October 8, 2015, The New York Times' Paul Allen wrote at the time that the library board's decision to ban an unpublished book had been "unofficial and unreasonable, but it was a 'wake-up call,'" and that was his explanation for what she said was a lack of interest in making the decision in the first place. Since that time, many of her Twitter followers have tweeted at her for posting pictures of photos or "a lot of text" â€” such were her earlier comments. The library board's decision to not release the unpublished book was announced by Robert "Ricky" Young, the author of The Little House on the Prairie, which is published by Penguin this week and is scheduled to be released in the Fall. A release date hasn't been determined for the books, where they'll be available in all countries. The book is available for $3.99 online at Amazon, HarperCollins, and Barnes & Noble.
