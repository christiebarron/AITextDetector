I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is already being done, and is already legal to do. I think that anyone who feels that libraries should censor their content will be in good company."

Citing a 2010 ruling by the National Library Federation that "censorship of a book and its accompanying text, or "text control" means that libraries must remove material that "causes serious threat or threat to the public," "or for public health", or "impedes an individual's use of or enjoyment of a literary or artistic work. In other words, content control means the means of preventing people from viewing books or their works through other means. Such censorship would not have occurred if there hadn't been other means to protect intellectual and artistic rights and freedoms," the ACLU wrote.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation, the nonprofit group that has been spearheading the fight against copyright infringement rights, also noted that it is concerned about censorship. "While censorship efforts like those by the state or the Federal Government are always useful, they are not the tools that will ensure accurate and equitable access or quality to a creative work. If I see a film or book of my own making and I believe it harms the lives of my fellow citizens, I cannot allow this film to go out of print at home. This will have an effect both in my neighborhood in Virginia and in places like Chicago where our book collection is shrinking," Eric Rassimov wrote on his blog.
