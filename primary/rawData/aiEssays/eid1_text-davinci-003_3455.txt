With the continuing advancement in computer technology and its increasing presence in our lives, I'm writing to discuss the effects computers have on people. While I can appreciate the way in which computers have made tasks and communication easier, I also believe there are a number of negative effects they have on individuals.

Firstly, I believe computers have the potential to reduce our social interaction. People are now becoming ever more reliant on computers, particularly for their communication needs. Sitting in front of a computer for hours a day can lead to people being less likely to interact face-to-face, which can have a damaging effect on their interpersonal skills and relationships.

Furthermore, I feel that computers often make us less productive. When using a computer to work, it is far too easy to become distracted by other things, such as social media sites or games. This can lead to reduced focus and a decrease in overall productivity levels, which can damage individualsâ€™ concentration and cognitive abilities in the long term.

Finally, in a world where computers play a large role in many areas, there is also the potential for people to become overly reliant on them. Many people rely heavily on computers for everyday uses, such as work tasks
