I recently attended a highly crowded wedding and there was a great lack of available space. Everyone was dancing and mingling, and I was expecting to have a great time. Despite the close quarters, I was determined to remain patient.

I soon realized that it was impossible to find a spot to sit and relax. Even when I managed to find a spot, someone else inevitably appeared to take it away from me. Knowing that I couldnâ€™t do anything about the situation, I remained patient and tried to smile whenever I could.

Rather than fight for a spot to sit, I decided to embrace the situation and join the party. I smiled, engaged in conversation, and made friends throughout the night as I moved around the room.

At the end of the evening, I was glad that I had chosen to remain patient. By being understanding and tolerant of the overcrowded venue, I was able to make the best of the situation and have a wonderful time!
