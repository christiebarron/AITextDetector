The ending of the poem suggests that the test alluded to earlier in the poem serves as a metaphor for the main character's personal journey. The narrator looks to the winter hibiscus, with its fragility and resistance to the cold season, as a source of strength and inspiration. In this way, tasting fate comes to represent accepting whatever challenges may come and staying dedicated to their goals. The narrator expresses that, just like the winter hibiscus that will return again in the spring, they too will take the test again with renewed determination.
