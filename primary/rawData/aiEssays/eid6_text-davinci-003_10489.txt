The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of obstacles in accommodating the docking of dirigibles. To understand the scope of the challenge, it is important to appreciate the technology available at the time of the building’s construction. The most common type of airship during the period of the early 1930s was the Zeppelin, a large, blimp-like vessel that was designed to lift off the ground and fly.

Zeppelins were powered by gasoline engines, and were difficult to control. As Marcia Amidon Lüsted highlights in her work “The Mooring Mast”, “heavy breezes [which] were common for the New York area” posed a major challenge to the Empire State Building’s team. The additional weight of the large vessel, when combined with the turbulent winds, made the positioning of mooring mast the most difficult part of the project. Zeppelins were simply too large and too powerful for standard mooring systems.

When attempting to dock the airships, the structure of the Empire State building had to be considered. In order to accommodate the dirigible, a hook had to be attached to the mast and this required the use of an innovative new technique called”eyeing”. This was an extraordinary feat of engineering which involved attaching cables that were several stories long to the steel of the Empire State Building’s eighty-eighth floor. As Lüsted
