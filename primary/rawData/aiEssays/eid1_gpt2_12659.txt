Computers have many effects on people. They affect their brain. It starts to take you to different places, you realise that you are not always on the same level of level.

This doesn't mean your memory is completely different (in fact, often it is far worse than it first appeared) and the time you spend in a computer is not the same as going to the gym (or watching TV on a TV, or working on your work). It is still fairly early days to realise that memory is much different in a computer, although the speed at which we can go about our day has improved greatly since the early days of the computer, and it is therefore harder to miss out on all of that.

What happens if your mind is unable to form a new pattern to write out, or what if you become obsessed with doing a certain thing? Well, you will likely experience different problems for how to solve them, for several reasons, for every level of expertise and training.

There can be two types of problems.

1) The problem is very different in the early days of computing when computers began to perform almost identical tasks. If there were only two people in the world, the computer would work much more like you would, the task would all be very simple: a computer that was able to read two notes simultaneously. If three people in the world also started working on that same task, it would take a very long time for them to master it.
