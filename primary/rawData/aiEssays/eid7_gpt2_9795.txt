An example of a time someone in my life was patient was after the surgery. After her head had just stopped growing we started getting her hair. My wife used to tell me about the time when she worked on the stage and what to do when no one was around.

Eventually we had a hair transplant, although one of the surgeons refused because he couldn't have known what the surgery was about, and would never have used it. He gave her the scissors, which were a little long and he had to give her a few years later. And then he told her she just had to clean after and let go of every hair.

So after getting so many of these beautiful blonde hair transplants, the surgeon asked her to take the scissors and she just took them out of the cabinet and ran a little bit of plastic tubing over her head over at her house. And after about three months she was still doing it. Because she never had to clean after.
