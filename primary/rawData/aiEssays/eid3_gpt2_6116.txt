Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

1.

For the purposes of this guide, the number of wheels to allow maximum support is divided by the maximum distance between the two vehicles in the same direction and is then divided by the vehicle length (the cyclist's centre of gravity) divided by the vehicle length (the cyclist's centre of mass). This provides a guide to the length of a vehicle (the vehicle will be the driver who is likely to be involved in the handling of the manoeuvre):

The same can be done for the tyre. If you have a car like the BMW M4/M4 GS4, or a hybrid vehicle (or as a rear tyre with a brake) which will not have two tyres in the same direction, as opposed to having only one (the rear), and use these tyres for all the time, the same procedure with the rear tyre won't work.

The following tables give a general idea on the minimum amount of tyre capacity:
