I remember when my best friend and I first met. She was standing there, looking so lost and uncertain. I could tell she was awkward around strangers, so I walked up to her and tried to make a joke. I'm honestly not sure what I said, but whatever it was, it must have been pretty bad. We both burst into hysterics, and after that, we were best friends.

It was great to have someone who could always make me laugh. If I was feeling down, she'd always know the right thing to say or do, and it always made me crack up. We'd watch goofy movies together and do silly things just to make each other smile.

Sometimes our laughter was spontaneous and silly, like when we tried to learn a new dance and almost fell over. Other times it could take hours. We would constantly tell jokes to each other and it kept us in stitches. I miss those long afternoons of talking, joking, laughing and giggling until our stomachs hurt. 

Laughter was a major part of our friendship, and even though we're no longer as close as we were back then, I still think fondly of the silly memories we shared. And I know that no matter what happens, we'll always have that bond.
