The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is more dramatic in a different direction, as it reveals that when he felt his life was at risk he went in search of hope and it was this hope that made him want to break away from the comfort that came with being in America. When his life was destroyed by alcohol, his family was devastated. His mother was determined to help him get back on his feet, the only way his family could stand on his own shoulders was to open the house to try again.

The book depicts his family as hopelessly trapped in an increasingly desperate job. As a teen, he was driven by his brother to seek help in an attempt to escape to America, but as he went from his mother's home to the streets of London, he became obsessed with his future while struggling to find a job.

'From Home is written with no doubt in mind to tell the story of the story. It is a deeply researched work.'

'From Home: A Life Through Time' is out on 17 May by RIT.
