I once had a friend who I hadn't seen for nearly three months. We had experienced a bit of a falling out and so I was apprehensive when I finally told her I wanted to meet up with her at a coffee shop. She was late and when she arrived I could tell that she was anxious. She told me she had just gone through a really tough week and was still in a bit of shock. 

I took some deep breaths and stayed patient, understanding that she was still going through a difficult time. I told her that it was totally okay to feel how she was feeling and that I wasn't there to pry or push her into anything. I just wanted to switch back into a comfortable dialogue like we used to have before the falling out. 

My patience paid off - after about 15 minutes of talking she finally opened up and we were able to reconnect and find common ground. I'm really glad I stayed patient and didn't pressure her into sharing more than she was comfortable with. In the end, our friendship was saved because I stayed calm, waited, and was understanding of her needs.
