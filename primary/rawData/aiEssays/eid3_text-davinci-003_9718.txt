In Joe Kurmaski's short story, 'Rough Road Ahead', the setting of the story is a large mountain range that is difficult to traverse. This setting plays a major role in the story as it affects the cyclistâ€™s journey in several different ways.

First, the terrain itself has a big impact on the cyclist. The rough terrain of mountain trails can be difficult to climb, especially when the cyclist is tired and fatigued. The story even mentions that every few inches of progress up the mountain are paid for with sweat and hard work. As the cyclist struggles to climb the mountain peak, they must rely on sheer determination and willpower in order to progress.

Second, the story mentions the weather conditions are cold and windy, which can be another challenge for the cyclist. Though the cyclist is adequately prepared for the climb, with multiple layers of clothing, the cold wind can still make it very difficult to keep pedaling. The cold air can also cause the cyclist to become short of breath, making it harder to keep their energy up.

Third, the setting of the story also affects the cyclist's mental state. As the cyclist struggles to make it through the rough terrain and bad weather, they become more and more discouraged and exhausted. The more the cyclist struggles, the more difficult it becomes to stay motivated and keep pushing.

Overall, the setting of 'Rough Road Ahead' plays an integral role in affecting the cyclist's journey. The
