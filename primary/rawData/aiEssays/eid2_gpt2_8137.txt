I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is necessary because there is too large a number of people who are completely open to information about our past so that they can easily get informed of current events. I feel that censorship of media is necessary because the public information can be shared without being biased against certain groups in society."

"We think that censorship of materials in libraries is necessary by a very strong and powerful government under the control of the government," he added.

Iyengar also asked in the e-mails: "If the government can decide to censure all media in the country, why not only state news media? The only problem is that that is a pretty bad policy given the existing circumstances, the existing restrictions, the situation in the past and the lack of access to information."

The government in Sri Lanka is not the only government concerned about censorship in recent years. According to a government official, "at least one government-funded broadcaster called the anti-censorship hotline. I can state that the hotline is set up for each of our government departments. For this reason I am asking that in any time a government-funded broadcaster is called, we encourage the people of the country to call the hotline in order to obtain access to relevant information."
