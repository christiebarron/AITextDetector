One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was in a pub while watching a movie. I am now saying that to myself, it is the laughter of the audience, at that moment. And it is just such great how they show emotion; how they can relate with you.

And that was like the first time those two things really crossed over. That was a great moment that changed my life.

In a moment the same voice would go out with people, but in the first few seconds a very different voice would say the same thing. You had that incredible feeling, that you were watching someone you knew, with all those qualities and it was amazing what you achieved.

The person coming up behind me saying, "Thank you, sir." And then the friend next to me could go, "And thank them, sir," and they would say, "Great, thank you, and they really helped me too. I couldn't have done that without you." In some ways we all want these same things. I think you can have one's best life. Thank you and I hope you have, but I think it is a very different experience.
