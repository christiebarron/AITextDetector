Computers have many effects on people. The most damaging is that they're a product, and you have two ways to use it. Your computer is your engine that drives the power, and you need to adjust power levels. But because you do have to make those adjustments, people have very deep feelings of disappointment about it, and they try to feel a connection between it (the power) and this (it).

And that leads the person out preoccupied with that process. They have to actually make that decision whether they want to or not.

The other thing I can give you is that to me you have to make an effort to understand in a certain context. And in both this and that context I've noticed there's an increased likelihood of people actually being able to understand what is happening. That's exactly what psychologists really think of.

It's an open question, however, whether people can understand what would be happening if they were a non-psychopath or, you know, someone who had a violent temperament in a certain kind of environment (as opposed to just one personality) in which people could think that they were rational.

The question is this: Are you seeing a reduction in the way people deal with emotions like anger and frustration and even a reduction in that sense of calm or an increase in that sense of emotion? As I say, I don't know exactly.

A better answer could be to just be more direct in understanding emotions
