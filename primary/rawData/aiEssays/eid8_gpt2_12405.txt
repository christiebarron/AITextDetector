One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was doing a workout. It felt good to do it (laughs). But when you're not doing that, then you just start laughing back. When I start to laugh, I say 'What is he doing in the kitchen?' It gives away the feeling of being like, 'I'm not doing that.' But in truth, it gave me an orgasm. I know about the feeling of laughter coming from my mouth, but you can't be that kind of a jerk. It's too much.

What was different about creating this experience with your friends?

I used to be with friends who were trying to learn how to work a lot of different things, and also have an interesting connection to everyone. People were really impressed with the way I worked, sometimes as a programmer. But in practice, it became an afterthought. And it would be nice if you were a good match. It doesn't mean I don't know people. When you come from a background where everyone gets something or something is important to you, you don't want to see it like that. My experience with those two people was that, as far as I'm concerned, they were great people who helped me make changes and I was very proud. The other main difference between your life and my life is with all your friends. Everybody is doing the same thing.

What was the first thing you did that you could not do in life?
