Dear Editor, 

As technology evolves, the effects computers have on people become more and more apparent. Although these effects can be positive and negative, itâ€™s clear that overall they have a huge impact on our daily lives. 

On the one hand, computers can enhance the quality of life for many people, allowing them to stay connected with the world around them and access vast amounts of information. They also give people the opportunity to access entertaining activities, such as online gaming, which increases social interaction. 

On the other hand, computers can have negative impacts on people as well. For example, people can become overly dependent on computers, leading to health issues. Furthermore, spending too much time on the computer can lead to loss of sleep and social isolation.

It is essential that we understand the potential consequences of our actions so we can use computers responsibly. We must realize that, while computers can be beneficial to us, they need to be used in moderation in order to avoid health problems. I urge each of your readers to be aware of the effects computers can have on people and to use them in moderation.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
