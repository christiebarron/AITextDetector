I remember a time when patience was extremely important. I had volunteered to help out in an animal shelter, working with puppies and dogs that needed a lot of special attention and care. From the very beginning, it was clear that it was going to take patience, perseverance and a lot of hard work to get them to trust me. 

I spent days working with some of the harder dogs, holding back my frustration and trying to understand what they were feeling at every moment. I used soothing tones and gestures to show them that I only wanted to help. Despite some of the harder cases seeming lost to me, I decided to take all the time I needed to show them that I meant them no harm. 

After weeks of working with the scared and neglected dogs, I saw progress. Slowly but surely, something would change in them. A few of them began to recognize me, which was a huge success. I still remember the sense of joy and relief I felt when one of the dogs finally let me pet him for the first time. That moment was the reward for all the patience and effort I had put in. I am proud to have been patient and understanding, and I am thrilled that it helped them to find trust again.
