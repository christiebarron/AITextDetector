For each level we can compare the two types of road tyre choice. The road test (rutted and fitted) will provide an index of performance, and is best used as a basis for comparison purposes - it is best to be able to predict the amount that a specific tyre will run if it is used. The training results will help riders compare the performance at their next meet. There will still be significant tradeoffs between the testing performance and the testing endurance, especially if you choose to run slower and have less endurance. This is a useful starting point to determine the conditions available, as it allows the teams to adjust the bikes. This is the most challenging aspect of this test, because this test is usually only used once. When one team is using the same tyre for a length of
