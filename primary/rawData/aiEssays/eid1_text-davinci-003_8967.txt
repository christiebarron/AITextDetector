Dear Editor,

The dawn of computers has created both positive and negative effects on society, but I believe that, overall, they have brought more positive benefits.

In this day and age, we use computers in most of our work, and we don't know how long our civilization would have yet to evolve without them. We can keep detailed records, communicate with people on the other side of the globe with just a few clicks, and use modern technology to streamline many of our everyday processes. All this, without a doubt, increases our productivity and makes life easier and more efficient.

Furthermore, computers are instrumental in the fields of medicine, engineering, technology and education. Nowadays, medical diagnoses can be accomplished with the help of sophisticated software, research in technology and engineering are more accessible than ever, and accessing information that used to take hours or days is instant.

However, the overuse of computers can have a negative effect. We are increasingly spending more and more of our time on screens, which can negatively impact our physical and mental health. We must strive to make conscious decisions about when to turn off our devices and take a break.

In conclusion, all in all, I believe computers have improved our society in a great number of ways. I urge readers to think of the benefits that computers bring us first, before deeming them entirely negative.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
