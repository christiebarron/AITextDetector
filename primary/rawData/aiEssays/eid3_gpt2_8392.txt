Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. Most important is their ability to follow the highway properly. This is a common misconception among many cyclists.

This new setting reduces the risk of being caught in the correct lane through congestions with no warning and many crashes.

Many cities and municipalities have adopted the new 'Safe Routes' where users can opt to use a designated space and cycle in the designated lane (right of way).

What is the difference between the 'Safe Routes', 'New Route' and 'New Route'?

There are two main differences:

The 'Safe Routes' feature in New Route mode allows the rider to cycle to and from each designated cycle lane and the 'New Route' mode allows the rider to cycle directly from one to another designated cycle lane.

What are the changes and what are the benefitsSLI has learned?

What it does is allow cyclists who have limited mobility to move from the designated lane or from the designated location, and also allow them to switch to the new vehicle in the vehicle.

WHAT CAN I KNOW ABOUT THE SAFE ROUTES?

The new safe routes are being implemented in seven new cities starting from Chennai, Mumbai, Bangalore, Delhi, Hyderabad, Lucknow, Jodhpur, Surat, Meghalaya and Pune.
