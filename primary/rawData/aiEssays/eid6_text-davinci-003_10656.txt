The construction of the Empire State Building in 1931 was a momentous feat of engineering, but it faced an unexpected challenge just two years after completion: allowing dirigibles to dock in the mast atop the building. This challenge was met with several obstacles, some of which were patently technological.

One major obstacle was the powerful updrafts that occurred at a height of 1,250 feet. It was simply too dangerous for a large and light airship to navigate a dock in such conditions. Dr. Alven Bleichert, who served as the engineering consultant for the Empire State Building, tried to mitigate the updraft as much as possible by lining the mast with airfoils. He also implemented a new mooring system to stabilize the airship and provide enough traction to hook itself onto the buildingâ€™s empire-level mast.

Other challenges included the limited space atop the building and the requirement to keep the area free of debris, in order to ensure the dirigibles a safe landing area. Bleichert initially planned to outfit the dirigibles with short-legged anchors that would hold them in place but this idea proved too impractical as the anchor poles could prove hazardous for pedestrian traffic below. Eventually, the airship engineers and the architects of the building came up with a more practical solution: a set of strong aluminium lattices covered with hardwood panels that the dirigible could nestle into for mooring.
