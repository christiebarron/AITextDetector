The construction of the Empire State Building, located in the center of Manhattan, was a monumental task in itself. However, the challenge of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was an even more substantial undertaking. This task required the building of a mooring mast, which would be necessary for the dirigibles to safety dock.

The first challenge was in designing a suitable mooring structure. The technical specifications of such a structure were unprecedented. The mast needed to be able to supply power to the dirigible, and it had to be 372 feet tall, due to the height of the Empire State Building. Additionally, it required a minimum headroom of 176 feet, as the dirigibles flying at the time had a maximum height of 200 feet.

The second challenge was constructing such a tall and complex structure. Although the mast was made out of steel, it still weighed enough to create stress on the existing building. To prevent any structural damage to the Empire State Building, a more complex bracing system was needed. This included four 12-inch base beams connected to four columns extending from the reinforced roof to the ground. This structure would reduce the load and stress put on the building.

The last challenge was the cost of the project. Although the mooring mast only cost $3.5 million at the time, this was considered a large sum of money, and it presented a burden on the engineers of the time. With money
