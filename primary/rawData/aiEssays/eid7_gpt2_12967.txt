An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my friend and a professor, and I started reading this. Some of the books on a certain book I read was an excerpt from Richard Gere. He put the entire thing in the "The Book of God," and I thought that was all right! The question is: "How should I read This book when only one or two of the books I read is in a different form?" I read the following books and I didn't find this book to be very important. The question in my mind is where should one begin, and how do you think?

Question 8: When studying, have you ever observed the way we learn something of value from other people's behavior? And did this value develop under scrutiny after the study had stopped?

Gere: Yes.

Question 10: How did you learn to read?

Gere: I got pretty good at that. I was very good at reading. I could sit down and sort of say, "Well, I read," and then it would take me a few minutes. I was very good at that.

Question 11: Were you able to read it by hand?

Gere: Sure.

Question 12: Now I have an idea whether they are of that sort, my friend was a writer and I was a professor at Cambridge. So I have no idea. It is possible that those books are books I read.
