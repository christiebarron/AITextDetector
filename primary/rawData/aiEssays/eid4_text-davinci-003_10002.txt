The narrator of the poem, a student, is reflecting on the winter hibiscus and says that when the snow melts and geese return, the hibiscus will also start to bloom again. The narrator then associates this with taking a test again. This imagery of a new beginning is a metaphor for academic testing and growth. It can also be interpreted as a representation of the narrator's sense of renewal and fresh start, even in the face of academic failure. By ending the poem with this imagery of a blooming hibiscus, the narrator's optimism in the face of adversity is highlighted.
