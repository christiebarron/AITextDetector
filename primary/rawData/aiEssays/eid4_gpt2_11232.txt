The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it tells every single lesson, even the ones we all don't like. Each one serves as a personal chapter for me. This doesn't be a book for those of you who miss out on great writing by the same author â€“ not for anyone but you. I always wanted to write something a little more original, so it's just nice to be able to finally share my life while having what is a great thing to say about it. Thanks!
