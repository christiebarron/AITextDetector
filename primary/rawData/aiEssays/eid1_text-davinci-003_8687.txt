I had been dating my now-husband for nearly a year, but we still hadn't changed the label from "boyfriend" and "girlfriend" to "fiancé" and "fiancée." Although we both knew that we wanted to be together forever, it was a long and drawn-out process. 

One night, after a particularly long phone call, we were arguing over what to call one another. Neither of us wanted to be the first to make the big move. Finally, after much debate, frustration, and a few pints of beer, we both blurted out "fiancé" and "fiancée" at the same time. 

We both started laughing and couldn't stop. We had more beer that night to celebrate our newfound titles. 

Our relationship has been filled with many wonderful and funny moments, but that particular memory sticks out in my mind. It was such a relief to finally take the plunge together and call ourselves "fiancé" and "fiancée." I wouldn't be who I am without the love, laughter, and support that we share.
