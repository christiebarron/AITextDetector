The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' with the'real' American family has made its mark in the world of pop culture and the music video industry, with countless albums to be bought and re-released. However, the story of 'From Home is', as well as many of the'real' American pop singers, is one with a unique and complex story behind it.

Written by Mark Schuster, 'From Home Is' contains two volumes, The 'Ape In The Night' and The 'Ape In The Dark'. The 'Anita', also known as 'Catch a Ride' is a documentary with images of 'anita dancers' dancing around in the rain, and one of the 'Pimp The Boy', who is one of the girls 'from home' who gives her name to 'Sgt. Pepper'.

As you can watch the 'From Home Is' as part of the DVD/Blu-ray series 'No Such Thing As Family' on the UK's Radio1 TV (9/27-8).
