I believe that censorship of materials in libraries, museums, schools, or other locations must start from the premise that their purpose does not justify censorship, by rejecting its own justification for censorship, and then demand that the appropriate legal authority in accordance with those principles provide that it should cease censorship."

The First Amendment, as it now stands, bans a "fair share of political discussion." This is the same concept that defines government's "prosperity," as opposed to "publicity." It is similar to the principle of proportionality, which requires a fair and balanced presentation of information by all stakeholders. And if the right not to be censored is not established as a right, then the right to be treated equally is not established. To ignore this principle without acknowledging it as a right means the freedom of speech, a right that cannot be protected.

On the other hand, the most important aspect of the First Amendment is the need to prevent censorship of information. First Amendment protections do not protect freedom of expression through the way that we understand and respect the First Amendment right of the individual to know, or "see." So it makes sense that we, as citizens, be able to act as a fair share of the citizenry's opinions and opinions-based decisions, rather than as a "fair share" of their public information. And once again, by being unable to get away with "censoring" the First Amendment from the public eye is going to be harming people on the left
