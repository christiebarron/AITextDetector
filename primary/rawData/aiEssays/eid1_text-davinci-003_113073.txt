Dear Editor,

It is important to consider the effects that computers are having on people. Though many individuals use computers for work, leisure, and entertainment purposes, it is also evident that computers can have a substantial, adverse impact on people’s lives.

It’s no secret that technology has the potential to increase efficiency and productivity. However, too much screen time can lead to both physical and mental anguish. Too much exposure to blue light from screens can cause eye strain, fatigue, and headaches. Additionally, spending long periods of time looking at computers may also lead to disrupted sleep cycles and, ultimately, a general feeling of lethargy.

Mental health is a serious issue when it comes to computers. Overuse of technology can lead to an increase in social anxiety and a lack of communication and social skills. It has even been linked to addiction disorders in extreme cases, making it increasingly essential to have real-life interactions with people.

In conclusion, I urge readers to understand the impact that computers have on people’s lives and to keep such effects in balance. Too much time on computers can be detrimental to our physical and mental health.

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
