I was recently shopping at Walmart for some groceries and the line at the checkout was incredibly long. I waited patiently for my turn to come, but it seemed like it was taking forever. I looked around me and noticed some of the other people getting frustrated and impatient. I decided to remain patient and keep my cool.

Finally, after what seemed like forever, I arrived at the register. When I paid, I noticed that the cashier was a bit slow in scanning items. Some of the people behind me started grumbling and sighing loudly. Instead of joining in, I focused on being calm and allowed the cashier to work at her own pace.

After a minute or two, the cashier said thank you and handed me my receipt. I was relieved to be done with the transaction and thanked the cashier for his patience. By the time I left, the people behind me were still waiting in line, which made me even more glad that Iâ€™d been patient.
