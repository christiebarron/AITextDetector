An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was a kid. I played poker with my dad, who was a pretty good poker player. He was sick, so I came home just knowing we were going through something pretty bad. The day it happened, I couldn't hold back and said to my mom. He said, "Can you help me?" And she said, "You can."

What were the odds that you would never play that game again but still lose?

I think I was never good, but Bakari said, "The game is so broken here, there could be a way." When we finally made it to the final and I lost the first round, it was one of those things when I was playing in a bad mood: "Fuck that, I'll go back to play." I'm trying not to forget that to win is my favorite part of life. I think about losing it on a daily, everyday level. This was a game that really drove me to get into my fashionable shirt. That's how I felt.

How did you come to make this decision?

My father loved his wife and a great man. He was like the epitome of a good man. He was very, very kind and I thought he loved me and he was like God. He was such an honor to play against. He really gave me the sense I didn't think I got to play in a game like this
