I remember it like it was yesterday. My best friend and I had been planning for the school field trip to the city museum for months and we were both ridiculously excited. We had planned all of the activities we would do and it was finally the day of the trip. It was a long but enjoyable bus ride there and once we got to the museum, we were both exploring like little kids, taking everything in. 

At one point, we noticed an old film playing on a projector in one of the displays. We both leaned in to get a better look and before we knew it, we were both in fits of laughter. We couldn't tell why exactly, but it was just so funny. We were laughing so hard that the other museum visitors were staring at us. I don't think either of us had had that much fun in a long time. 

Even now, whenever we look back at that moment we can't help but crack up. Even thinking about it today still brings a smile to my face. Laughing together that day only made our friendship stronger. Laughter really is the best medicine! It was the moment that started it all and is now one of my fondest memories of us together.
