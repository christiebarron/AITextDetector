The author is using the imagery of the winter hibiscus to suggest that, just as the hibiscus will return to bloom once again when the weather gets warmer, she will return to her test and do better. This line of thought is also used to suggest that she will keep trying and not give up, even if she fails or does not have success right away. The line is also a reminder that, even in the dark winter of our lives, we can always look for the warmer months and times ahead, where the success and success we have been striving for will finally bloom.
