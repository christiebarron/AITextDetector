The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. "We needed to convince the public that the building was a modern design," said the architect of the Empire State Building. "But then some people raised that, and it sorta went away."

The next steps involved a different method of building. By using wind tunnels and towers and a hydraulic system called a pressure gradient, builders could build the building in space, away from the massive steel slabs that encircle the building.

"If you're thinking about the building from the ground up, then you're actually going to build it to the ceiling, but I was trying to move from top to bottom to make it stand out," said John Knebel, an engineer with Carnegie's Carnegie Institute of Technology in San Francisco. Knebel, who is a regular speaker at the event, said he knew from training that building heights were impossible for the public. A more modern approach would have involved people trying to place trees in their path, as Knebel explained to me.

"We were in the middle of building at a top speed of 100 mph. We had to do all that, but it took a bit of time before something really could move. It's like it's stuck in time," he said.

The result was an open window into the building's architectural heritage. The Empire State Building has stood untouched for three generations. Its original exterior has been
