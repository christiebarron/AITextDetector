I recently had to wait in line at the bank for a long time. I was in a rush and getting a bit impatient, but I noticed the person at the front of the line was elderly and having trouble with the process. I decided to be patient and wait. When the person finished their transaction, I asked the teller if I could help the elderly person in any way and offered to help them carry their bag. The elderly person smiled and thanked me for my kindness. Even though I was on my way, I made an effort to remain calm and understanding and help someone else in need.
