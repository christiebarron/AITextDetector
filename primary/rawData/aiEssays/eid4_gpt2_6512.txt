The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it has the characters. The book covers it for you and gives back to the fans. There was a lot of writing. It just felt like a lot of work. It was all part of making The Winter Hibiscus.

As part of that preparation, I knew that there would be a lot of work done on this book. So I really didn't want to do any of those projects.

What is it that was great about writing The Winter Hibiscus?

We had written a book called The Winter Hibiscus for three years at that point. That was really important. We knew that one of the challenges in writing this book is that we want all three seasons to be a three ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. [Laughs] As far as story and characterization goes, we knew we could try to do as many different things with Summer Hibiscus as we would go in between books and there have been none to be done beyond that.

So this book was a good fit for that.

I will tell you about Summer Hibiscus.

This book is set in the early 2000s that we know is beginning to turn into a major part of the show and to do a lot of the characters so we're trying to figure out what is in a character's story arc in the middle of their world in terms of events and things that happen in the story
