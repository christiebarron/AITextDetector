Computers have many effects on people. It's why we build them. We do lots of tests and see how it plays out.

Q: How do these things come about?

A: We try to use it on a large scale and figure out ways to do it in the near future.

Q: How are you doing, in the meantime? Did you ever think about it?

A: Oh, I just wanted to say that it's really cool to be connected to one another. The last thing I want my life to be like is someone else's life. I mean, it's just something that can happen and it's pretty fun.

Q: I heard there's a sequel coming out soon. What is the next one like?

A: We always see there's going to be a second game and they're starting with the core of the game. We've been working with different studios and we're starting with the same idea. It's a little weird because you kind of always know the exact kind of game we're going to be doing. Right now we're just in a really good spot and that's what we're working on now, and that's very exciting.

I hear you.
