The building of the Empire State Building was a monumental task that not only presented a great technological challenge for the builders, but also raised the interesting question of how to allow dirigibles to safely dock at the top. The idea of an airship docking at the Empire State Building was widely discussed when it was being built and, as Marcia Amidon Lüsted outlines in 'The Mooring Mast', was considered to be an ambitious but achievable aim. Despite the enthusiasm surrounding the project, there were numerous obstacles to overcome to make it a reality.

The main issue the builders faced was that the building was simply not designed with a docking system for dirigibles in mind. At the time of the Empire State Building’s construction, there was no practical experience in designing and building mooring masts, so the builders had to engineer different solutions. To make sure the mast was as sturdy as possible, it was made from steel and had no height restrictions, with only the magnetic force of the mast holding the airship in place. The mooring mast also had to be designed to take into account weather conditions, as strong winds could cause the airship to drift off course and impact the mast’s stability. 

Furthermore, the builders also had to find a way to make it easier for crew members to get on and off the airship without endangering their lives. To solve this, they designed the mast with a platform where passengers could disembark
