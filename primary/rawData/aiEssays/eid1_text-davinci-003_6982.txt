The concept of censorship in the library is a contentious issue. Some argue that libraries should be able to curate and decide what materials should and should not be available on the shelves; others strongly disagree and argue that library censorship is a form of suppressing freedom of speech.

As we all know, knowledge is power, and libraries enable us to access valuable information and resources. Library censorship creates a serious barrier to this access. It denies readers of the opportunity to reach their own educated conclusion on the material in question, ultimately controlling how they think and interpret it.

This form of censorship also disadvantages those living in communities with fewer resources. It could be argued these are the individuals who need access to educational materials the most. Depriving them of access to the material they need to inform themselves is simply morally wrong.

Censorship of material in libraries further restricts freedom of speech. By deciding which content should be removed, library staff are essentially deciding what people can and cannot think. This is an undesirable consequence, as it undermines individual freedom and effectively limits our ability to express ourselves.

At the end of the day, a libraryâ€™s job is to provide access to all kinds of material, both popular and controversial. It is not a platform for government to limit expression and access to disruptive ideas. Therefore, library censorship should not be tolerated. Readers should be free to explore and discover new material without fear of censorship.
