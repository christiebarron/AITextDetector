Dear Editor,

In today’s society, computers play a major role in people’s lives. But the question remains: are these effects helpful, or harmful? My opinion is that computers have had a profoundly positive impact on people and society as a whole.

Modern computers provide us with a great wealth of information and knowledge. Rather than having to travel to the library, you can now access information from the comfort of your home. Not only has this allowed us to be more efficient in our work and studies, but also opened up a world of possibilities for anyone remotely interested in learning, or even just fun ways to occupy time.

Computers are also capable of connecting us with people from anywhere around the globe. Without the capabilities of computers, communication with distant friends, family, or colleagues would be exceedingly difficult. Through sites like Skype, Discord, and others, people can now have face-to-face conversations with anyone across the global, and share ideas, thoughts, and experiences that weren’t possible before.

It’s clear to see that computers have changed the world for the better, and I’m sure that if the readers of this newspaper pause and think about it, they’ll agree with me.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
