I was visiting my grandmother for her 90th birthday, which was a really big deal for our family. Unfortunately, she was not feeling well that day so she wasn't able to do much of anything. She was angry with herself for being so ill, and kept apologizing that she couldn't be part of the festivities. I could sense the worry and disappointment in the air, but I decided to stay calm and patient. 

I sat with my grandmother and took the time to really listen to her. I found out about her childhood, her experience during the war, and all the lessons she learned. We talked for hours and before I knew it, the day had flown by. I could tell that after talking to me, she felt more at peace and content. 

At the end of the day, my patience had paid off; I'd made my grandmother feel loved and we'd had an unexpectedly wonderful birthday.
