 

I remember it so clearly. It was just a regular day, nothing spectacular about it, but something about my friend's joke made me laugh so hard. We were both sitting in the bleachers watching the football game, both of us wearing the same colored team shirts. 

My friend, who could always make me laugh with his wit, cracked a joke. I began to laugh and soon he was joining in with me. We were both laughing so hard that tears were streaming down our faces. Our laughter was so intense it was almost contagious, and soon people around us began to laugh with us, adding to our joy. 

Soon enough the team we had been watching scored a touchdown and the crowd roared with acclaim. We briefly stopped laughing in excitement then started back up again, both of us with even bigger smiles this time. 

We went back and forth telling jokes and laughing for the rest of the night. That moment was the start of what became a beautiful, vibrant, and c humour-filled friendship that lasted many years. 

Even now, when I think about it, I can't help but laugh. That moment, in which two people can share a moment of laughter and bond, is something that will always make me cherish friendships more and celebrate the simple beauty of life.
