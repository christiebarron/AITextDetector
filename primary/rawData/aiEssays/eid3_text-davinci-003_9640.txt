The setting of Joe Kurmaski’s story ‘Rough Road Ahead’ greatly influences the cyclist’s experience throughout it. The most powerful feature is the sense of immediacy and danger created by the setting. The protagonist is living on the edge – no time for daydreaming – as he races against the wind and the rain. It is a hostile environment; lightning, floods, icy winds all come together like a white-knuckle roller-coaster ride filled with danger and adrenaline.

The cyclist must channel this fear into motivation to push beyond what he thought possible. He must be fully alert and observant, looking out for any roads, rivers or streams, that could jeopardize his safety or abandon his route. The rough terrain forces the cyclist to concentrate on the path ahead, with each moment passing by as a blur, until the inevitable end is reached.

This is contrasted by the views of the sweeping landscape that come in rare moments of serenity. This highlights the beauty of the natural world and encourages the cyclist to appreciate the hardships of the journey, as well as the rewards. As he goes along the course, the cyclist discovers hidden depths in both himself and his surrounding environment.

The rising and falling of the landscape, the ever-changing pattern of the weather, the omnipresence of danger and the occasional reward of a truly breathtaking vista – all of these are features of the setting which influence the cyclist
