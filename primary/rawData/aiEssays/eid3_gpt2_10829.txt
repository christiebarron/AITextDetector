This is the reason that if you take a road bike in a 20Â° turn over, you could end up getting hit once you start to pass another bicycle too fast.

To give you an idea just about every new setting will make it too tempting. First, there will be lots of variables such as road speed - the amount of time you can be walking away from the bike and the distance to the other bike, and it's not uncommon that you may get hit - a few of the settings that can make matters worse are:
