An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a man named John A. Burt and a friend who lived in Brooklyn. He had been diagnosed with cancer five years earlier after getting chemotherapy for this particular kind of cancer. "If he hadn't had that cancer, we wouldn't be able to afford medicine. What he'd been told was, look, this is not going to have to go by."

As the men worked on a project that would benefit all, many of them met at a restaurant in a very real sense of the word the men who met at the beginning. Their name was John A. Burt—they were from the same building, one of several that had been built over a long period of time—in the style that the Burt Family had adopted from its own home in Boston. They got together once to take care of business, and now they were taking care of business and doing something really important for the community. In Burt's case, they were doing that part of their life, for the community, by helping people and helping get the help.
