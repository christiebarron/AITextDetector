Computers have many effects on people. Not just genetics or cognitive ability; but their cognitive processes. They seem to be related to their brains and brainsets. We understand that the ability to do things is not always necessary and must be improved over time. It might be for many reasons why people become better and go on to accomplish them. These are possible outcomes for many different reasons.

There are several possible explanations for this:

The ability to be good is a major factor in one's mental health – the capacity for being good at one task, when necessary. While for example if we have multiple cognitive tasks they might all involve the same task at different times, we might not have time to do all of our work. The ability to control our behaviors, because we can control everything the way we need to be, might also be a major contributor to a health problem. But there could also be a second explanation – our need for a good career as adults. It is in our personal life that we are expected to act, whether it is in the company of others in a family or in a business or a government office. It may be that this does not occur for some of us or that it is a condition that causes us to act lazily.

The ability to be bad at things is a major factor in one's mental health – the ability to be bad at tasks when it should be possible. It might be that we have a bad relationship with family and friends
