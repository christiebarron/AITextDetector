Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. It is my opinion that computers have had both beneficial and harmful effects on our lives.

On one hand, computers have provided us with an immense amount of convenience and efficiency. We are able to compare prices online, communicate with friends, and manage our financial resources with ease. They have facilitated our access to education and information, and given us almost limitless opportunities to grow and develop. 

On the other hand, computers can have a profound negative impact on our lives if used excessively or irresponsibly. More and more people are spending too much time in front of screens, unable to disengage from their virtual lives. Distractions from online technology are an obstacle to clarity and productivity, and can have a damaging effect on our cognitive abilities and mental health.

It is clear that computers have positively expanded and facilitated our lives, but it is also important to recognize their potentially detrimental effects. We should make sure to limit screen time and use technology responsibly—in balance—to get the best of its benefits and avoid the worst pitfalls.

I urge your readers to keep this in mind and use technology responsibly to enhance their lives
