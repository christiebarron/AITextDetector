Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my concern and opinion on the effect computers have on people. In todayâ€™s world, computers are everywhere and used for almost any type of job. While computers are incredibly beneficial for getting work done quickly and effortlessly, they can be damaging when it comes to the human aspect of interaction.

By relying so heavily on computers, people have become isolated, less active, and unable to effectively communicate in real-life situations. The conditions that computers have created have decreased the amount of meaningful social interactions that are necessary for a healthy lifestyle. Not only that, but computers have created an unhealthy sedentary lifestyle where people are just sitting in front of a desk all day.

On the other hand, there are many positives effects that computers have on people, such as increased efficiency in work, and amazing technological advancements. However, these positives must be balanced with the negatives.

In conclusion, computers can be incredibly helpful in many areas, but we need to remember the human aspect of interaction and be aware of the dangers of excessive computer use. Without proper balance of computer use and real-life interaction, people can quickly become isolated, unhappy, and unproductive.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
