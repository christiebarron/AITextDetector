Censorship in libraries is a contentious issue because it involves decisions about free speech, access to literature, and the right of citizens to choose what they consume. Libraries should not remove materials from their shelves simply because they are deemed to be offensive. Doing so would impair the right of individuals to choose for themselves what materials they consume and would limit the breadth of material available in libraries. 

Censorship should only be used when materials are actively harmful. Libraries should focus on removing materials that encourage people to act in a dangerous or destructive manner, or unless such materials violate the local laws in some way. Libraries should not attempt to police what people find offensive. Not everyone has the same sensibilities and what one group may find offensive, another could find to be educational or inspiring. 

Censorship of materials in libraries should be used with hesitation and used only when it is absolutely necessary. Libraries are repositories of knowledge, meant to provide everyone with access to information and materials, not to act as a moral arbiter of what people can or cannot consume. Removing materials merely because they are deemed to be offensive violates the fundamental principles of freedom of speech and access to literature and information. 

Ultimately, libraries should provide access to a wide variety of materials, not limit what people can access due to the sensibilities of some. Censorship should only be used in extreme cases in which a material actively encourages people to act dangerously or violates local laws in some way. This sort
