The prospect of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was a tantalizing one. With the building’s stunning and architecturally advanced design, it could have revolutionized air travel to and from New York. However, making this a reality was not without its challenges.

One difficulty was providing the dirigibles with enough room to maneuver, both on approach and to dock. The Empire State Building was 1,250 feet tall, and the masts that were needed to dock proposed dirigibles would need to be 400 feet above the roof. In addition, each would need to be substantially stronger than the mast on a common sailing ship, given the size and weight of the dirigibles. Its construction had to be supported by numerous weight-bearing beams to ensure it remained stable and secure.

Moreover, the Empire State Building’s location posed a problem. The building was near the flight path of boats departing from the Brooklyn Navy Yard. This meant that if dirigibles were allowed to dock here, there was a potential risk of a collision taking place between these vessels and the airplanes, as they could not navigate around each other.

Lastly, it was unclear if the Empire State Building could sustain the amount of rain and spray that would come off of the dirigibles when they landed. Rain, or anything coming off of the dirigibles, would cause the mooring to become increasingly unstable, leading to a potential risk of
