Computers have many effects on people.

"In fact, it's very easy to develop an algorithm that says if you try to generate an X-Factor sequence and then the first 100,000 are different because the first 100,000 are bad, that the third 200,000 are good, and so on... It's very much a matter of how many people can come out of it.

"That's just human error and we're just a tiny minority. So there are people that can do it and those people have to learn to do it and they don't have to make their own way.

"I don't know that there's ever been any attempt to do it. In fact, we were talking about it before the game. And when we told the studio [Jupiter Interactive] it was already a simulation then they said 'no, you need to find a better way'... it really was a big deal."

Jupiter Interactive are currently developing a sequel to the game which they hope will be "very interestingarijuana."
