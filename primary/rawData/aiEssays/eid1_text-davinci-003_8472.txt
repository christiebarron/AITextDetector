I was recently in a situation where I had to demonstrate patience. I was waiting in line to get a new driver's license and the line had been moving very slowly. After waiting for nearly an hour, I was finally close to the front counter. Then, the process got even slower because of a computer issue. I was getting very frustrated, but I knew I had to remain patient if I wanted to get my license. Instead of getting overly frustrated, I decided to take a few deep breaths and focus on something else. I looked around the office and noticed some beautiful artwork on the walls. I tried to pass the time by appreciating the artwork instead of getting angry. After another twenty minutes or so, the issues had been resolved, and I was finally able to get my license. 

Overall, I was really proud of myself for maintaining my patience in the situation. It could have been really easy to get impatient, but I knew that yelling and getting angry wouldn't solve anything. I am grateful that I was able to stay calm and patient during the process.
