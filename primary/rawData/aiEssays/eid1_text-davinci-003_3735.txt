Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have had on people. With technology continuing to grow at an exponential rate, computers have become a major part of modern life. They have provided new ways for people to access and store information, to stay connected with one another, and to be productive. 

However, there is a downside to relying so heavily on computers. They can sometimes discourage people from developing important skills like problem-solving and critical thinking. They can also lead to a sedentary lifestyle. Too much screen time can cause problems like physical fatigue, headaches, and possibly even sight issues.

Furthermore, using computers can have negative impacts on our social lives. People can become embarrassed or feel a lack of self-confidence when it seems as though others are using computers to attain success. Additionally, too much social media consumption can lead to feelings of depression or loneliness.

Despite this, I believe that computers remain an invaluable resource to our society when used mindfully and sparingly. With the right skills and knowledge, computers can be used to create innovative solutions to many of our toughest challenges. We should embrace technology, but be sure to keep it in perspective and enjoy the things in life that computers canâ€™t provide.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
