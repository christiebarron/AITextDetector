Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion about the effects computers have on people. Having witnessed the proliferation of technology in all facets of our lives, I can confidently say that computers have tremendous potential for improving our lives, but they can also have a harmful impact. 

On the one hand, computers are a great resource for achieving our daily objectives. From facilitating communication through social media platforms, to providing access to unlimited sources of information, computers have significantly improved our lives. Consequently, these advancements can boost knowledge, generate creativity, and produce efficiency.

On the other hand, the overuse of computers may harm our mental and physical health. Because of its addicting nature, computer use can become obsessive, robbing us of valuable time that would otherwise be spent engaging in physical activity or relationships. Additionally, there is evidence that computer use can lead to an increased risk of anxiety, depression, and even obesity.

Therefore, I strongly encourage my fellow readers to be mindful of the effects of computers and set rules on their use. Utilize computers as a resource to enhance productivity while being conscious of the need to maintain a balanced lifestyle. 

Sincerely, 

[Name]
