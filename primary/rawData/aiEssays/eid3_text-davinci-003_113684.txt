In Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead," the setting features of the rural mountain road heavily contribute to the cyclist's experience during the race. 

The twisty, mountainous road creates a sense of challenge and struggle due to the winding curves and dangerous drop-offs. The steep hill creates a steep gradient, which carries physical demands for the cyclist. Despite the taxing environment, the cyclist is able to push themselves and maintain an impressive speed between the trees. The lush greenery of the trees provide the cyclist with a pleasant and peaceful background for the journey, while also providing a natural challenge to the cyclist in the form of tree trunks and roots.

The side-slants and abnormally placed cracks provide the cyclist with further difficulty, as they need to find the proper balance between maintaining speed and avoiding obstacles. This also presents a hazard, as the cyclist must rely on their anticipation skills and balancing in order to get around each obstacle. 

Additionally, the road is only two lanes wide and traversing through it requires the cyclist to look for smaller, yet still treacherous gaps in order to make steady progress. The same applies for the presence of oncoming traffic, which presents a greater risk to the cyclist due to the narrow width of the road.

The features of the setting in "Rough Road Ahead" add further mental and physical challenge to the cyclist, and serves as an example of both the perils of cycling as well as the rush
