I remember when I was just a young teenager and I had recently started dating my first real boyfriend. One day, we were driving in the car together and we decided to take a scenic route in hopes of finding something new and exciting. We had been driving for about fifteen minutes and had seen nothing more than a few stray cows, but the sun was setting and it really felt like something special could be around the corner. 

We had just rounded a bend and were suddenly presented with the most stunning view of a lake surrounded by pine trees. We both fell silent in awe of the landscape, each of us overwhelmed with emotions. The silence was broken only by the sound of the crickets chirping and the trees swaying in the wind. 

Suddenly my boyfriend and I both started to laugh. We couldn't help it. We had been in the car for what felt like an eternity and had seen nothing but the same fields and cows. This moment of beautiful surprise just seemed to bring a wave of joy over us that couldn't be contained.

We both stayed there for a few minutes, just looking out at the lake and looking at each other, both of us still laughing. This moment was one of the most special memories that I have since then since it reminded me just how important it was to be able to share a laugh with someone I loved.
