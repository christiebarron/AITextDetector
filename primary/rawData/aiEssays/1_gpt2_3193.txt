Computers have many effects on people. In general, the more they learn about computers, the more likely they are to do well in school. So we started to see what was happening with IQ in the lab.

My background here is cognitive science. My students were all studying physics. I knew the mathematical equations at school. They were playing the role of the computer in their studies, so it really had a big role in what they were doing in school.

I worked as an electrical engineer at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and in 1994, my professor called me to discuss a theory that led to what we were doing today.

We were trying to develop a computer. It wasn't that I didn't like them—but the person in charge was more than the system. The computer was designed to control everything on your machine. In fact the computer came from the same source, the University of California at Irvine. So it should control both yours and mine.

And so that's what it did. It was a computer that taught me how to program and how to perform tests—how to make predictions, how to predict an event before it happens, everything else.

And I went to study psychology. In my course, I studied the effects of school on your life, on your psychology. The effects of school on being a good family, the effects of being a good father. So I followed through on my theory that this is a
