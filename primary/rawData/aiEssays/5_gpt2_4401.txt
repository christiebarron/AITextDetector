The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is a testament to the "big tent" approach to filmmaking in American cinema: when a director is already creating an aesthetic or aesthetic vision, he or she is almost always going to have to create one that feels really personal. Even a work based on a single person has a personal purpose.

It's no coincidence that an important part of H. Michael Haneke's 'From Home is' is the shot of Martin Luther King Jr. having a cigarette in his pocket. Though the film itself is about a family struggling with their relationship with their faith, it's also about the film itself: what we are as a people, as a country, as a people, as a place, as a place that exists within itself to create a feeling, and a spirit – as people – of living their lives by having that feeling.

When we go to see the film, we want to be really passionate. It's like coming up with a song: "There's no place or way left to leave," said Haneke. And as long as it feels true to the people in the film, it's going to be true to them – it's going to have significance to them all they have: the people who are going to care about its significance. The work of Haneke and his film makes you love the film's characters, the people who are going to remember it and the world that they have lived through
