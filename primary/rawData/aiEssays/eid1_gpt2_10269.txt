Computers have many effects on people. The main ones are as follows:

They have less potential for abuse

They need to grow up fast to get the most done in life

They have too much motivation and can be manipulated so they cannot learn

They need to become successful or they will be destroyed but they don't deserve to grow up

They often do not work to improve their habits but then lose motivation for good goals

They also have a need to be active and act out so they may get addicted to drugs rather than working. Don't believe the myth:

"Every now and again, young men will find that someone they've been at a social event with and have friends who will do anything for them, except what they'll do if they won't."

I do not believe you have to worry about the results of your hobbies when you are a teenager. If you have the chance, let your child study before you and learn about the impact of things on others. Be good at what you do, and get used to being challenged. Don't think you can do it alone:

"Just because something is going to catch up with you doesn't mean you've got to go away for it. Your life is just what life is made of. Don't wait for someone to take your place in it, stop acting as if you're the one that's in charge." â€“ John Piper (1911)
