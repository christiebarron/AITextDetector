Narciso Rodriguez’s memoir, From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, has a profound and evocative mood that encapsulates the feelings of complexity, identity, culture, and belonging inherent to Rodriguez’s experience and his readers’. Rodriguez crafts a melancholic yet hopeful atmosphere of reflection; of exploring life experiences at the intersections of conflicting emotions such as pride in a cultural legacy and the desire to break with tradition; or the recognition of one’s identity while straddling two seemingly contradictory worlds.

The memoir opens with Rodriguez recounting his artistic mentor’s story of being told to leave her home in Honduras as a child due to the civil war, a jarring and poignant memory that sets the tone for the entire memoir. As Rodriguez progresses with his story, the mood reflects his inner turmoil and search for understanding of his identity. The physical sensation of both exploring and existing within his home country of Honduras relates to the similarly conflicting themes of separation and unyielding connection that remain steadily present throughout the memoir.

The mood consequently creates a lingering feeling of yearning for identity and a diverse cultural legacy in the same vein of his mentor's circumstances. Rodriguez captures a sadness of an unknown home, yet a determined ambition to find it and nurture it. In the words of Rodriguez’s mentor, a “memory of how seven-year-old me watched the weight of my nation pinned on my back and carried it away.
