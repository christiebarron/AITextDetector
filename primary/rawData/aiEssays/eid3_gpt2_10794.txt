Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

You get an idea of how you can get out of your car if you stop in a quiet area, at intersections with people looking away and driving in the same direction.

You are less likely to be in the wrong area of the road.

Your car is more likely to start to accelerate over that same distance if you get ahead of the cyclists, as they have to overtake it.

It is difficult to get out of your car, even for a little while because driving in that direction creates the same safety hazards as driving straight.

But it is always worth taking a step back to ask how many kilometres you have left in your current road before you decide to stop for any reason.

Drivers will have more difficulty finding a safe stop on steep, narrow roads.

Drivers driving on these roads are risking your life and the safety of others.
