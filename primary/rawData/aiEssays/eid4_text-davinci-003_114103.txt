Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho ends with this line to convey the idea of hope and perseverance. The narrator is aware that she may not have done very well on a test. Yet, life around her provides her with the idea that if she keep trying and be resilient, she will eventually be successful. The return of the geese and the blooming of the hibiscus signify a new beginning. The imagery gives the narrator the resolve to take the test again.
