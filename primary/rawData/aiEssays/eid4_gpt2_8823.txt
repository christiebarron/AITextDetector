The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it takes the book of life into itself.

Chapter 2: The Song Heirs The Winter Song is a long story, but in my opinion it is the most important part. It has its roots in Wildcats psychology, which is why I never really get into it until The Book Heirs, or why it is so important to see some of the key people in the story. I think it is my personal favourite part of the story and my favorite Oxblood that gives the story a heart, not a brain.

We know that when you see your little brother sitting on his mother's lap, she does not like him, even though he has gone at school all week. She tells my book that every time you see a child and think that she is so great, think the same thing, because the little boy has the same problems and you will think, oh that's a pretty good boy, isn't she? The book really gives us this emotional response to the world in some way.

Now it goes on. We have a family with a son named Tubby and their daughter and their son, Tubby, is autistic. His only brother is a child, so that's where they end up. He is so upset, and just goes and falls asleep on his dad's lap watching him. He's just scared when he wakes up, because he hasn't seen him all day. Suddenly things change.
