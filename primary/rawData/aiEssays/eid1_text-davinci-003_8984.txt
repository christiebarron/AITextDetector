Dear Editor, 

The use of computers has been rapidly increasing in recent years and the effects it has had on people have been tremendous. While computers have been essential tools in our lives and undoubtedly bring with it great convenience, I believe that there are some potential detriments they pose to individuals and, as a result, society as a whole. 

One of the key effects computers have is that of distraction. The invention of smartphones and their integration in our lives have worsened this effect, creating constant access to time-wasting applications. Furthermore, surfing the internet no longer requires users to go to a separate device as almost all phones now come pre-installed with browsers. The fact that we can now access the internet anywhere and at any time leads to more distractions as we are always connected. 

I think these distractions from computers can lead to issues with concentration, in particular affecting work and study. Additionally, when our eyes are fixed on the screen for long periods of time, this can cause eye strain and worsen vision. While there are methods to prevent this - such as regular eye tests and taking regular breaks from using the computer - I think that as computer usage increases, these effects on people will become more prevalent. 

In conclusion, while computers are useful pieces of technology that bring great benefit, we must also be aware of their adverse effects and take steps to mitigate them.

Sincerely,
