Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

1. The bike rider will feel comfortable. This can be achieved if the distance between you and the ground is too low.

2. The cyclist will feel protected. The cyclist's posture will be that of a normal young person â€“ if you do not do anything, it will affect other points of view in traffic.

3. The cyclist will feel safe. The cyclist's riding behavior will stay the same through both braking and braking. (This could change from moment to moment depending on the speed of your vehicle, depending on the position of the bicycle over time.)

4. The cyclist will know when and where to turn. This is the key to the benefit of all of a cyclist's skills. When you get there and look into your surroundings, you will find nothing to be alarmed and you will be able to tell from the situation. (See the notes on this topic for more information and to keep up to date with our current position on the world's safest road for the cyclist).

5. The cyclist does not see the cyclist or the rider's body. This is what makes cycling safer. This also means the bike cyclist can control the speed of the car without the need of a brake. But this is an effect that the person who says that to the cyclist should be kept in control so that they are not in danger when there is a risk of injury
