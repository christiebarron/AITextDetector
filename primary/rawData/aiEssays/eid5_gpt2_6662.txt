The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' – the final album that ends 'The Day Before Christmas' in London – was so much fun that her mother couldn't even keep her own car running.

Katherine, 40 (played by a Britney Spears impersonator) tells The Sun, 'I was so used to the thought of myself being a celebrity I was so lost at my own personal life. I was so obsessed with fashion and writing music and being a celebrity. That was what really made the experience special.'

Katherine started writing when she was six, and her mother is now 27, and she hopes to continue writing about her early life as a musician and a writer.
