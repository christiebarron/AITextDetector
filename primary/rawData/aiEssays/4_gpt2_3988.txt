The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because in a world of literature that is so devoid of such diversity, there are still dozens and dozens of books that exist in one way or another, but none more important as to some of us than the one I was reading the book. I am not a racist man (anyone can be racist as many are to some in the United States), but at the same time, I do think I was treated unfairly. I know of no racist person who ever claimed to be an American and never claimed to believe that America was a nation of slaves (even if I had to admit that I was).

So what made you want to read it? I loved it â€“ and it's my favourite book. I loved the characters, they were all charming and complex. And I loved the story. And I loved the fact that we all have to watch it one more time.

Oh, and I love you, James Watson.
