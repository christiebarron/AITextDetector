I am writing to share my opinion on the effects that computers have had on people’s daily lives. In today’s digital age, it is impossible to get by without the use of computers in some form, whether it be for business, leisure, or communication.

But there is still a great debate about whether or not the advantages of computers outweigh the potentially harmful effects. On one hand, the use of computers drastically improves efficiency in day-to-day activities and has opened us up to a greater scope of knowledge and the capacity to collaborate with others on a global level. This has drastically changed the way our world functions, and I believe that it has been a net benefit for society.

On the other hand, it is important that we acknowledge the potentially negative effects of computers that have been well documented in recent years. The constant use of computers has been linked to a number of physical and mental health issues, such as neck and back pain, along with an increase in levels of stress, anxiety, and depression.

However, I believe that if the use of computers is properly monitored and regulated, the risks can be greatly lowered. It is important to establish healthy patterns of use to ensure that computers are used constructively, rather than detrimentally.

As a result, I believe that society should accept and embrace the positive features of computer technology, while simultaneously being aware and mindful of the potential risks and
