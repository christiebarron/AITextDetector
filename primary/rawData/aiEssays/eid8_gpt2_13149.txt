One time I experienced laughter in my life was when talking to my children. He's from a village that we grew up on and I didn't know much about a lot of things until I saw him with my grandchildren. He was friendly and I was quite excited of what was brewing and just wanted to have some fun with them."

He's always spoken of the "dreams of a great person" but he didn't want to dwell on those and instead wanted to keep them his.

"I believe the only way that I can achieve any kind of happiness, that happiness is to have fun and enjoy yourself," he told The Post. "And after that I believe to a certain degree the other thing that can be accomplished is spending time with love. I want to know that I make the things that people dream about possible and that they can achieve things within themselves, and I want to know that when I do this, that is an act of kindness, that that is happiness that you can have."

"Like a kid in school, I've always had issues with my family, my father and my son," he added. "After everything that happened in a short time and after living through a couple of things that I feel like it's just the wrong situation in our lives, I decided that I wanted to end every pain and worry we had by working on my own plan and I'm glad I did."
