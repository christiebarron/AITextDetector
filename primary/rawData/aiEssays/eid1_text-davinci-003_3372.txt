Dear Editor:

I am writing to voice my opinion on the effects computers have on our society. Over the past few decades, our world has become more and more dependent on computers to accomplish everyday tasks. In this era of technology, the influence computers have on our lives is undeniable, and cannot be overlooked.

I firmly believe that the effects of computers are both beneficial and detrimental. On one hand, using computers has made everyday tasks more efficient, saving us time and effort. Moreover, it has opened up a world of possibilities and has made communication easier. On the other hand, it has caused us to become more isolated as we spend the majority of our time online. We have become addicted to the ever-growing universe of the internet, losing touch with nature and traditional values.

It is essential that we are mindful of the effects computers have on our lives, and use them to our advantage. We should take full advantage of the convenience and power computers have to offer, while maintaining a healthy balance between the world of technology and our real lives.

I urge your readers to consider the positive and negative implications of computers in our society and use them in a way that brings us together, instead of dividing us.
