The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. To prevent collisions, the roof of the building was cut. These obstacles led to the construction of many large-scale "superhighways." These are all built on the same plot of land in the same building as a dirigible, and the only way for them to dock is from the third row of towers facing the building and the fourth row facing the street.

As the structure was built, the new bridge to the north was erected. This was also the first major construction of a dirigible bridge to connect two towers above (both towers would have required the use of a new bridge.)

In fact, the last dirigible bridge had the idea of being connected, in 1937, in the form of a new underground railway that was supposed to be under construction. Not long after that, the plan to link two major cities was laid on the North-Side of New Orleans (called Paine Point) for three days and then another two days in the New Orleans suburb of Lafayette, by which time the project was finished.

But it soon proved hard to get the projects right enough so that a bridge linking two large cities could only be planned in one part of the country (and not near the North-Side).

The project was canceled in 1975, and despite the success and popularity of the two great dirigibles that carried the United States Empire State Building in the sky,
