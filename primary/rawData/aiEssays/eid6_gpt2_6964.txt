The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In 1935 a new dirigibles concept was developed that allowed up to five passengers to move between two platforms, with the use of 2-inch vertical legs, but no feet on both.

The Daedalus was never the largest and most expensive development, because it lost many of its designers. But the Empire State Building also played a significant part in its development, because of its size. More than 1.5 million people walked on four of its 18 miles of elevated roads, or more than three-quarters of the total daily movement of the people who lived in it and their two main city facilities. By 1947, more than 6,500,000 people in Washington state were getting on or off vehicles each day.

To get to Washington (and on or off its streets as well) you had to travel as quickly or more often as you could without getting lost. It was an ideal point to get to.

The building itself was covered with concrete, and if you looked very closely, they would note two columns on either side of the entrance. You could still see the buildings.
