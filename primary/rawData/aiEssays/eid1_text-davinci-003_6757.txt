As someone who closely studies the ever-expanding use of computers, I would like to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. 

In the age of technology, many of us have had our lives drastically changed by computers. We now use them to take care of our finances, communicate with family and friends, and even do our jobs with greater convenience and speed. But while computers may be beneficial in some respects, their overall effects on people are often less than desirable. 

The increasingly hectic pace of life and the ease of acquiring information online has caused many of us to become less patient and more easily distracted. We can forget how to problem solve and think for ourselves when we are simply given an answer without putting much thought into a problem. We are more likely to take the easy way out, relying on computer technology as a crutch to get us through our daily lives. 

Moreover, computers have become a major source of procrastination as people are prone to prioritize leisure activities such as video games or browsing the web over more meaningful tasks. This can lead to a lack of motivation to pursue more intellectually stimulating activities. It can also result in less focus on human relationships, leading us to neglect our responsibilities to our family, friends, and the physical world around us. 

Ultimately, it is important to recognize that computers should be used to supplement, not replace, our creativity, human ingenuity
