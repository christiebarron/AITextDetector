The Empire State Building was an engineering feat of its time with construction beginning in March of 1930 and its completion in May 1931. Its eager proponents aimed to make the building "the world's tallest, most graceful skyscraper" and provide a base for the world's first fleet of dirigibles. In the book "The Mooring Mast" by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, we are provided an insight into the tremendous effort involved in allowing the dirigibles to dock.

The greatest obstacle faced by the Empire State Building’s construction team was the need for an incredibly durable mooring mast to support the landing apparatus for the dirigibles. A mooring mast constructed of metal strong enough to hold the airships posed a difficult engineering challenge and required a series of tests to ensure its strength and safety. After lengthy calculations and experimentation with various designs, engineers were able to construct a mast tower approximately 610 feet tall, built with a double truss of steel beams arranged in a crisscross pattern.

Additionally, the building’s height posed challenges for the engineers when designing the approach to the mooring mast. The mooring mast was designed to appear to extend the building when viewed from afar, appearing to stretch 750 feet into the sky. In addition, the mast had to be located near the center of the roof to enable the airships to approach it in a straight line. This configuration had to be carefully taken into account when negotiating
