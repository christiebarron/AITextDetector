Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

Carrying a heavy load while on the track tends to carry a greater weight (with a longer ride time as well as an emphasis on braking to prevent damage to the brake system). However, it also makes driving more prone, with many people falling off the road, who are also taking advantage of what the bike really represents.


In an analysis by the Society for Cycling Safety, some of the most important measures of RTP involve braking when you are on the road and taking a little longer than normal when in the field of work or in the office - with a greater risk of falling off the road. The first of which is the way in which you brake, as well as 'tanking'. When this happens the rider will try to hit your brakes or brakes will stop, if they feel it will damage their brakes that can further damage the brakes. These effects sometimes can also happen during a bike race where you have to stop your bike in short order in order to avoid falling off the track once you see them on the road.

In the other group of measures - for instance, when you stop your bike at a stop sign - your brakes will begin to drop significantly, while your head will pick up bumps as they fall as you drive by them - and then, when you turn away from the stop line, you will almost always fall into a bump.
