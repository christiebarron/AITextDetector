I recently flew overseas to visit my family. During the long journey, I found myself seated beside an older gentleman. He was traveling to the same destination, so we began to chat.

He told me stories about his past travels, and I shared jokes about my own experiences. Before I knew it, we had both erupted into a fit of laughter.

The flight attendant looked over as we kept laughing. Soon, she was smiling along with us.

It had been a long flight, and the laughter made it easier. Even when the plane touched down, we were still nodding at each other and holding back laughter. I said goodbye to the new friend I had made on that long journey, feeling thankful for that funny experience.

The laughter between us had made the trip bearable, and left me with a warm feeling in my heart.
