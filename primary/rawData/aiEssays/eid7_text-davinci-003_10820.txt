I was at the airport the other day, waiting for my flight to depart. It had been delayed multiple times, each time pushing back the departure time by an hour. As the clock ticked slower and slower, people around me started to get more and more frustrated. Many of them were yelling at the airport staff and heavily expressing their anger.

This was definitely a trying time for me, but I stayed patient. I took a few deep breaths to calm myself and reminded myself that this wasn’t anyone’s fault. It wasn’t the fault of the airport staff or the passengers. It was just one of those things that happens and that we all need to bear with. 

So, rather than lash out and get angrier, I decided to take a walk. I took some responsibility for my own wellbeing and just focused on turning this experience into something positive. I smiled at the airport staff as I passed by, and I greeted other passengers in a friendly tone.

My patience paid off. Eventually, the flight got off the ground and we were able to arrive at our destination on schedule. Even though I had to wait out the unexpected delay, I regained my composure and was able to remain calm and positive. After this experience, I’ve learnt that in order to keep our mental wellbeing intact during difficult moments, sometimes all we need is a little patience.
