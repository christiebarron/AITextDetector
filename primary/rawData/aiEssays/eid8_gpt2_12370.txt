One time I experienced laughter in my life was when a beautiful white girl in the city, I was having a night out, and her friend wanted to help get me one drink. We both were laughing hysterically but she said "You wouldn't know that a black man was so much more than a white guy!" I told her no, and my friend looked at her to calm down.

Some days I think about the time a white guy was killed and he threw his gun in his girlfriend's face. It sounded so awesome to me, so I got him to call local police for help and they were there for 2 hours. They then said: "Can I ask you a quick question," which led me to my next question: Should a woman have a job as a nurse because her white boyfriend shot her in the head.

To this day I'm not sure if I should have called police, or have taken her to a doctor and waited until at some point the cop took her out for a blood test to see if she was sick and he was going to keep treating her. So I went and went to the nurses, because they were so very polite and didn't give me the type of information this would lead to and they kept saying "you know why do you not give me that kind of information?" I was so scared, and had such a bad response that in my mind I didn't know how I got it. Luckily, after taking her out on my birthday
