Dear Editor, 

As technology continues to improve, people are increasingly reliant on computers and other digital devices. While technology can be a great tool to assist in everyday life, it can also have many negative impacts on people.

For starters, using computers has a detrimental effect on physical health. Studies have shown that using a computer for extended periods of time can lead to issues such as repetitive strain injuries, poor posture, headaches, and eye strain. In addition, people who use computers for long periods often neglect their physical exercise routine which can lead to obesity and other health problems. 

Computers can also have a negative influence on peopleâ€™s mental health. The overuse of computers can lead to feelings of isolation, anxiety, depression, and fatigue. People may also start to rely too much on the technology and lose the ability to think for themselves and make decisions independently. 

Socially, computer use can lead to loneliness and alienation. Spending hours in front of the screen can leave little time for interpersonal relationships. Furthermore, using computers can have an effect on language and communication skills, as many people seem to be writing and speaking less. 

In conclusion, the benefits of using computers must be weighed against the potential risks. People should use computers in moderation and not let the technology take over their lives. 

Sincerely, 

[Your name]
