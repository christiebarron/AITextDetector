An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when he said he was going to throw a party. That's like, "Oh, there's only a single person there, there's only 10 people, but they're going to be a band." So he was saying to his wife, 'No, what do the people say to you?' They weren't going to understand, but now, as he got older, he started talking about how he had been a bandplayer for 20 years and said, 'Oh, it's one of those things that you're talking about.' So, a lot of people are happy. But I actually felt like when he was 10, when he was doing that show, those people who were his best friends were getting a bad rap Moe. It was pretty embarrassing to hear. It was the biggest single I made.

Moe said it was a good song but it was really kind of lame because they were on different shows and I was like, 'Look, we're a real band now, okay.'"

"I was thinking about that like all the time. When I got the guitar, I'd be like, 'Oh my god, that's not really Moe.' So I was like, 'We're all trying. But we're trying to get over this."
