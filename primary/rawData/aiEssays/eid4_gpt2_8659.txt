The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it gives us a glimpse into what we could expect when, in early childhood, we start receiving so much information about our environment and what people could say. We can see all the things we've learned about the world through the eyes of the book. We know what we're missing. What it's like to be in the middle of a busy world and never know what you really want to hear. We can see what it is to be surrounded by someone you love and not want to hear. The book even brings us a lot of new information to share with us.

There is also a chapter in Spring of the Summer, where we find out that some people are so scared into their young adulthood that they decide they love to kill themselves. I did read the book before it took place, to this day. It's an awesome example of how to learn. I love to read about people's lives and how they live as survivors of war, war in the end. What we see in the book is a real reflection of what we've learned. I feel like it should be included as a part of the story as well, as the introduction or section in the book. I think that it is an important resource to read. If we are going to be alive as adults now we need it to be an adult piece of our story with a lot of new details and perspectives on life that we are not accustomed to with our parents
