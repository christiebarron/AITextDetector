Computers have many effects on people. If you're at the bottom of a list that lists everything out, they can create a huge mess of information based on that list and then turn that list against those people who did it. So, it's great to have more people to look out for and to talk to and to go through a complete list of everything and then give a good report on things."

Dwight Wootton, a top expert on cyber crime, agrees that as the technology improves, one can expect more and more cyber attacks to take place.

"There is still a time that cyber crime is becoming an issue because of increased security," he said. "There are other things you can do besides cyber crime. So that is something that can always be improved, but unfortunately we are just too big for all of these things."
