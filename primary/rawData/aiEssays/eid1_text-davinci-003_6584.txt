Dear [editor],

The widespread adoption of computers in recent decades has drastically changed our lives. As a result, many often debate about the effects that computers have on us. In my opinion, the impact is overwhelmingly beneficial.

Computers have changed our everyday lives in myriad ways, from shopping online to locating distant family members on social media. By storing and organizing large amounts of information, computers have enabled us to access and share data at the speed of thought. We can communicate quickly and easily with people all around the globe—something that would have been impossible even a few decades ago. Consequently, today’s generation is better-informed and more global-minded than ever before.

In addition, computers allow us to stay connected in ways that were previously unimaginable. We no longer need to travel for hours or days to keep in touch with loved ones—a few clicks of a mouse serve that purpose. Connecting with family and friends has become easier and more convenient, allowing us to maintain close relationships. And because more people are operating computers on a daily basis than ever before, a boost in productivity is not to be overlooked.

Computers undoubtedly come with certain drawbacks, such as cybersecurity concerns and the potential for addiction. Nonetheless, I firmly believe that the advantages of the technology far outweigh the risks. Computers have accelerated our lives and changed how we interact with the world—and this can only be viewed as an overwhelmingly positive trend.
