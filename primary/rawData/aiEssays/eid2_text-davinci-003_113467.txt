As we approach a new millennium, society is faced with a multitude of difficult decisions. One of the most pressing issues is that of censorship in libraries. Libraries are public institutions with the responsibility of providing broad access to materials – including books, music, movies, and magazines – as well as information sources. This tradition of library access to wide-ranging materials must be preserved. 

Censorship in the context of library materials is complex and controversial. Questions abound: Do publishers have the right to risk offending a certain demographic? Should materials be removed from library shelves if they are deemed offensive? 

I believe that censorship of library materials is not an acceptable practice. We must understand that censorship can lead to knowledge deprivation, and is an affront to democracy that promotes an environment of conformity and oppression of expression. Censorship is especially damaging when applied to materials that address controversial topics, as it may lead to the stifling of debate and critical thinking. 

Furthermore, any attempts at censorship should be consistent and balanced. Different groups may have different interpretations of what materials should be removed from the library. We cannot effectively police the standards of a certain demographic if we do not understand them. 

In a diverse, multicultural and interactive society, libraries should provide a safe and open forum for learning and discovery. Removing materials from library shelves based on perceived offensiveness flies in the face of diversity and expression. Playing literary censorship games is a disservice to library patrons
