Dear Editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people and to persuade readers to agree with me. 

Over the years, computers have become increasingly important in our lives. We depend on them for work, entertainment, communication, and more. However, there is a lot of discussion about how they affect us, both positively and negatively.

On the plus side, computers can be helpful in organizing our lives. We can keep track of our appointments, to-do lists, and contacts on them. We also have access to a huge selection of educational programs and resources that can be used to grow and learn new skills. Ultimately, computers have the potential to increase productivity and make life easier. 

At the same time, it's important to recognize that computers can be detrimental to our mental and physical health. Too much time spent on devices can lead to poor posture, eye strain, headaches, neck and back pain, and obesity. Spending excessive amounts of time online can also lead to mental health problems like depression and anxiety.

In conclusion, computers are powerful tools that can greatly improve our lives, but we must use them responsibly and be aware of potential negative outcomes. Instead of relying solely on devices for entertainment, communication, and education, it is important to balance our screen time with activities like going outside, exercising, and interacting with friends and family. 

Thank you for taking the time to consider my opinion
