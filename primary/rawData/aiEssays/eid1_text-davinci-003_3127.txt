Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on computers and the impact they have had on people’s lives. There is no denying that computers have drastically changed the way people communicate, learn, and do business. On the surface, they provide a seemingly endless wealth of information, allowing people to be more informed and efficiently complete tasks. Yet underneath these obvious benefits are considerable drawbacks that should not be overlooked.

Firstly, there is increasing evidence that excessive computer use can lead to physical health problems. Reports of poor posture, headaches, eye strain, backaches, and even carpal tunnel syndrome are all attributed to excessive typing or computer use. Furthermore, using computers too long can cause people to lose focus and become easily distracted. This led to problems like decreased productivity and impaired decision-making.

In addition, computers can also have an adverse effect on people’s mental health. Spending too much time online can lead to a decrease in face-to-face communication, disconnecting people from the real world and leading to feelings of isolation and depression. Furthermore, people may become addicted to computer games and online activities, and this could lead to the neglect of more important responsibilities like work, family, and school
