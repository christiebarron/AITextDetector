The ending of this poem speaks to hope. The speaker recognizes the struggles they are dealing with but looks towards the future, since when "the snows melt and the geese return" and the hibiscus buds again, they will try again. The ebbs and flows of nature are used as a metaphor for hope and resilience, and speaks to how they will renew themselves when the time comes. It is a reminder that when life throws us a challenge, there is still something to look forward to.
