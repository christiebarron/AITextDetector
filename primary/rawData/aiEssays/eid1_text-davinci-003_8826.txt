I could never forget the first time I met my now wife. It was on a blind date set up by mutual friends and while I was nervous, she was absolutely glowing. I wanted to make a good impression, but I guess my sense of humor scurried away in the face of such a beautiful woman!

We started out with the usual small talk and my nervously stumbling over my words, but then she said something that made me laugh. I couldn’t believe it, it was like a spark just lit up the room! We laughed and joked around for hours and I felt like I had known this woman my whole life. I knew I wanted to fall in love with her because she could make me laugh.

ever since that first date, she has been the one to make me laugh and put a smile on my face. During tough times, we can always go back to laughter and it brings us together like no other. Laughter can’t be faked or forced; it needs to be genuine.

It’s been many years since that day, but I still remember how our laughter connected us. It’s something worth cherishing no matter how old and jaded we become.
