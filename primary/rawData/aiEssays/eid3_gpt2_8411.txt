Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. For example: A clear blue light means there's more visibility - no red light, or blue, or blue; or a clear yellow light means the cyclist must make hard turns between yellow and red, or from yellow to blue. As to why it's better for cyclists to use it correctly, a short explanation here, as well as a bit of forechecking, indicates how it is implemented by the driver in a way that is reasonably safe for the cyclist (and avoids the risk of crashing too close to the light). The drivers' responsibility to ensure the road is clear is an important part of the driver's responsibility to create a safe area for cyclists, so that the cycling paths that do not reflect sunlight pass safely.

Drivers also play the role and responsibility to ensure the road is clear and in order for the cyclist to use the right level of visibility - which can be achieved by 'crossing the pavement' on the first (and only) 'tread line- of sight' before he arrives at the intersection. This also means there's more colour variation in different road types, and it can give cyclists the same chances as pedestrians and cyclists at certain points.

The 'Rough Road Ahead' setting also helps to help reduce traffic jams, which can occur when cyclists make slow turns (like turning left across a street to get to one of the stops) or if there's a
