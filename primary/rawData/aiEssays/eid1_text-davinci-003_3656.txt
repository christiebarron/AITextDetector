Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. As technology advances, computers are becoming more and more prevalent in our lives, and their influence on society is undeniable.

While computers are extremely helpful in terms of efficiency and productivity, they also come with many social drawbacks. They make it easier to stay indoors and avoid social interaction with other people, and can result in increased feelings of loneliness and isolation. In addition, some people experience symptoms of technology addiction, as they rely heavily on their devices to provide them with comfort and entertainment.

However, I donâ€™t think that computers should be entirely avoided. We should use computers responsibly, and recognize their potential benefits. Computers can help us work more efficiently, conserve natural resources, and research information quickly and accurately. They can also help enforce necessary social distancing policies during the COVID-19 pandemic, by providing alternative means of communication and working from home opportunities.

In conclusion, computers can be both beneficial and detrimental to our wellbeing. Therefore, it is important to be aware of how we use them, and to use them in a responsible and mindful way.

Sincerely,

[Your name]
