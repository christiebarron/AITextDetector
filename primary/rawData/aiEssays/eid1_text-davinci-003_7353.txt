The setting of Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead” plays a substantial role in the story of the cyclist. Not only does the setting add tangible features to the cyclist’s journey, but it also serves as a character in itself, as it provides the cyclist with challenges and opportunities.

First and foremost, the setting introduces a physical element into the story. For instance, the narrator begins his journey in the small town of St. Regis in Northern Idaho. This small town provides the narrator with a break from the wild open spaces that he normally encounters. As he moves into the hills, he encounters the steep grades, sharp curves, and rocky terrain typical of this mountainous region. This outdoor terrain puts physical requirements on the narrator, testing his skill as a cyclist. It is also very unforgiving, testing the limits of his endurance and strength.

Second, the setting provides the narrator with psychological and emotional challenges. By venturing into a wild and uninhabited area, the cyclist faces his fear of the unknown as he explores the unfamiliar landscape. This physical and mental challenge represents a growing awareness of his inner strengths and his need to overcome physical barriers. These moments, of physical exertion and emotional testing, are mirrored in the narrators own feelings of confidence and courage as he travels new places.
