One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was playing chess in the cafeteria. I was going around the chessboard playing my moves and it was like it never even happened. It was a nice distraction on my part. I felt happy and relaxed and like, I just kept smiling. It was a good day and I never felt a bit depressed or sad. I was just very excited. I love that one time that I went down to the bathroom, and nobody had noticed that. I had just gotten married, and I was getting ready to get out of bed when someone pointed my watch. After about 20 seconds of being like, hey, whatever. I was just glad I had a good day and could finally get the job.

I think about it a lot. I was just happy to get married, and I was really happy when I finished my job.

What were you feeling afterward?

I think it was happy. It was just normal. My kids were playing, and like, I didn't really think about them because their little things are only here to keep me happy. I thought maybe I was going to get divorced, but I was really sad.

You left the house. How did you cope?

I was going to have some friends, but then they gave me the phone. I just stopped and said OK, it has to be the same phone. We got over the first thing and went back. I left at 5
