The features of the setting in Joe Kurmasaki’s story “Rough Road Ahead” play a significant role in the protagonist’s journey. From the beginning, readers can feel the tension between the beauty of the environment and the difficulty of the ride. The bright colors of the sunflower meadows, the rolling hills, and the lush forests provide a beautiful backdrop for the cyclist, instilling a sense of awe and wonder in the cyclist and readers alike. However, these features quickly shift to a more foreboding tone. Natural features such as the rocky trails and steep drop-offs hint at the physical difficulty of the journey. In addition, the story’s references to the heat and the cyclist’s exhaustion further build tension and a sense of danger surrounding the protagonist’s adventure. 

The features of the setting indicate how the cyclist is challenged throughout the story. He is pushed to his limits both physically and mentally, as the environment becomes more difficult and less hospitable. With every challenge, the cyclist must dig deep to draw upon his inner reserves of strength and endurance. In this way, the features of the setting become more than just a backdrop – they become an integral part in the cyclist’s journey and thus a major component of the story.
