The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is one that doesn't include any hint at whether she ever saw any of these films or just simply sat back and watched in shock.


She recalls: 'I was just shocked to hear these films in front of me.


'It was just such a weird thought that I didn't even know at the time what a horrible feeling it really was, and when it came to seeing these big, beautiful children from Afghanistan and Afghanistan, what sort of an adventure they were trying; and what kind of a joy! It was just so funny.


'I think I saw all that horror in the film when I was there, but I wouldn't say it was some kind of weird feeling of being in such a dark place; it's just a very weird feeling to be in, you know.


'I certainly don't feel like I've ever been as emotionally challenged in my life as I was 10 years ago - it's just a very odd feeling.'
