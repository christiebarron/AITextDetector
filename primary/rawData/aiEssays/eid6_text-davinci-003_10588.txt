The builders of the Empire State Building faced incredible challenges when they attempted to enable dirigibles to dock with the building. This ambitious project demanded innovation and resourcefulness, and ultimately failed to be fully realized.

The concept of airships docking with the building was first proposed in 1924, and when the tower was completed in 1931 there were still plans to affix a mooring mast onto the spire. The mooring mast would have been the first of its kind that was externally mounted onto a large building, and it would have allowed for a dirigible to attach itself and remain in the air while passengers and crew disembarked.

The logistics of attaching the mooring mast were what stymied the project. The height of the spire was 1,250 feet, making for dangerous and complex construction work. The mast itself would also need to be incredibly strong and durable in order to support a large airship. Engineers had to contend with questions of the mastâ€™s weight bearing capacity, as well as how best to fasten it to the top of the building. Any added weight could cause an imbalance which could topple the mast.

The extreme height of the mooring mast presented an even greater challenge. Early attempts tested out methods for sending workers up to the spire. A large crane with a platform was used to lift crews and supplies to the top, which consumed a great deal of time and added expense. Additionally, the crews faced
