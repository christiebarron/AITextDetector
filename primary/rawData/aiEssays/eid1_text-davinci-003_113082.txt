Dear Editor, 

I'm writing this letter to express my opinion about computers and their effects on people. 

Today, computers permeate many aspects of our lives, from professional communication to leisure. In the world we live in, no one could deny how essential computers have become. However, there are certain negative effects that computers have on people. 

The use of computers and other digital media have been linked to an increased risk of obesity, mental health problems, and even eyesight deterioration. For example, children and young people using computers for extended periods of time can develop poorer physical and mental health due to lack of exercise and increased time in a sedentary posture. Furthermore, the blue light emitted from computers and other electronic devices can put extra strain on our eyes. 

In conclusion, I believe it is important to be aware of the potential risks of computer usage, and that steps should be taken to reduce these risks. We should all be mindful of the amount of time we spend interacting with digital devices and encourage physical activities. With this in mind, the negative effects of computers can be minimized. 

Sincerely, 
[Your name]
