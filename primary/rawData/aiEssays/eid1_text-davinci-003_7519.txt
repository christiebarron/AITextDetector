At the end of Winter Hibiscus, Minfong Ho wants to reinforce the idea of resilience and how sometimes we have to wait and try again in order to be successful. The author symbolically uses the hibiscus, which is blooming in the snow against the odds, to show how we can persevere and keep trying even when things are seemingly impossible. The narrator ultimately believes that when the hibiscus returns in the spring, it will signify that she will be able to retake the test with renewed strength and confidence.
