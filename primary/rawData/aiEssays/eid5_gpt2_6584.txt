The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' has been a dramatic one, with many fans and critics calling the book a disappointment because it doesn't take the genre into account enough.

A book not only doesn't meet all the expectations but it also suffers from some of the book's most negative elements. While an artist like James Franco is widely known for his masterful use of light novels and paintings, the book's writer – and film director Brian Fargo – was also an influential influence.

The book has now been translated from an English to French version.

'From Home' is published by R.O.P. and the same translator as 'Arrival' and 'The Terminator'.

'I'm very sad to say there was very little respect or concern at the time for J.K. Rowling,' Fargo said. 'I think it's interesting they're both not on the same page about their work. But I think they're both great directors and very funny.

'At the end of the day, if J.K.'s work was a success, she and I wouldn't do it again.'
