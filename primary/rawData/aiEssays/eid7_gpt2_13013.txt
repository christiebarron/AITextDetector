An example of a time someone in my life was patient was that I was an author I never wanted to be so badly. And it felt good knowing you were doing some work and I would never see you without it.


After graduating and I moved on to go into marketing I thought that when things actually went good it would be because I was great at it. And I thought, I don't get it. It's what I do.


I was very fortunate - I had three kids and had a wonderful time. One of the big differences between them was I had no interest in writing any of that stuff. The other was, if they gave you money to write their book, then nothing would happen. I was not going to give them money to write their book. If you gave me money to write my work, you always had to write it. As far as writing it goes, it's all about the material. I think if I had wanted to have that type of relationship with the readers then I wouldn't have tried. No one would have thought about it. It's just it.


I was really fortunate in that position to be able to live for a long time at home. I had an incredible life and a good time but at the same time at least my wife and I had a home. My wife grew up all over Europe. When you get married and you have your children a lot can change your life.
