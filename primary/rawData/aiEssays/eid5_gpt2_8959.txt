The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' has resulted in the book's cover with an image of him sitting behind the camera.


This is a clear reference to the famous scene where I was given a call by Gotti, who had just returned from a job meeting on a private plane.


The photo's author, Ilan Iribe, is believed to be the best known, with his book 'From Home' appearing on the cover of the Guardian last year, and 'To Make Me Rain' in 2012.


In an interview, he admitted that after travelling for more than 30 years in the Gulf, he had realised that the photograph was in some way a reference to the famous scenes from his TV TV series 'The Sopranos' in 1978.


'I've now spent three years doing it for The Book of Life. I have a lot to say to the people behind 'From Home' about the book,' he said.


'I was very fortunate to be in the right place at the right time,' he added.

'To be alive like that, I think people could have made the same mistake in life.'
