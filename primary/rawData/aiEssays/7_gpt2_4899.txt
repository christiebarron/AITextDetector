An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my doctor. He used to tell me sometimes this happens to you when you have been working out in a training session and then tell you how you need to stop using. I've had this happen with a lot of kids in training who have had tons of stuff done, they have had the weights ripped and were now in the gym. At a high intensity exercise, it's always going to happen again. I feel the doctor is trying to show that kid that the weight should stop and then turn back, but you know, I'll take what he's got and not take anything he said, but the kid will look out at me and he'll have to ask me for my training, and I'll go in there and it's like "We need to go!" My kid is really good about doing it, but he can't wait the next time you guys sit down for practice. People think I'm kind of like a baby killer or as cute as a big ass girl, but you know what, these are my kids. The way his training can develop and get them where they are is just amazing," said Johnson.
