This quote from the end of the book Winter Hibiscus serves to emphasize the strength and determination of the main character, Pam, and her appreciation of the natural world around her. The reference to the test foreshadows her eventual success, and the idea that when the snow melts and the birds return, Pam will once again be able to take her test with the new perspective and determination that she has gained. Additionally, the reference to the hibiscus symbolizes the transformation and growth that Pam has gone through, and reminds the reader that like the blooms of the hibiscus, Pam will also be able to overcome any obstacle she is faced with.
