I was at the store and there was a long line to check out. Everyone was getting frustrated because we had been waiting for quite a while. The line wasn't moving and people were starting to get impatient and angry. 

I decided to take a deep breath and remind myself that everyone was in the same situation and that we all needed to be patient. I took a look around and noticed that some people were starting to lash out due to their frustration. I kept my cool and stayed positive by focusing on the fact that we were all in this together and that it would be over soon. 

Finally, after what felt like forever, it was my turn to check out. The cashier apologized for the wait and I reassured her that it was alright and that we all needed to be patient. 

At the end of the day, even though it wasn't easy, I'm proud of myself for remaining patient in the face of this difficult situation.
