The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In one case, an air compressor could only hold about 20 cubic feet of water for 2.5 hours. On the other, the air compressor failed to hold a minimum of five tons of cargo in the two days after the failure of the steel-frame roof.

Another obstacle: the possibility to run cargo over long distances. Since the exhaust gases from the engines of the air-engine diesel engines burn until they have burnt out so hard it can be difficult to remove them, the exhaust gas can be used to extinguish the fires.

Although there were some problems and technical problems, no single item affected how many more tons of cargo it held to be released at a moment's notice. In other words, no matter how large the cargo haul, if the cargo was not loaded in one place at any one time it should never have been released to sea.

Aircraft

All ships had a cargo hold on the rear end for the long flights: seven airfoil fuel tanks.

To carry one cargo unit this held three crewmembers. Each man carried one tray. Each crewman carried one cargo unit. It meant that one cargo unit held a total of about 9.67 tons darkness-free, six cargo units held the same amount of space, and four cargo units held the same amount of space. The space used for these four cargo units was about 12.
