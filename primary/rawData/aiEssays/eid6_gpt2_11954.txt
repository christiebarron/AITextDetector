The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. As early as 1955, the Federal Building Association (and the Federal Building Agency, which had a duty to permit dirigibles) had recommended the use of a "high beam of roofed steel (the "carnium dome of the Federal building") as a means of allowing dirigibles to pass over existing buildings. The decision in 1957 to use the roofed roof of a building had been influenced heavily by an earlier decision to allow more dirigibles to dock. In 1956, for instance, a building-building commission from New Jersey, not the Federal Building Association, did away with the large beams and permitted a small horizontal dirigible to dock from the edge of the building. This was a decision in which the agency was more or less powerless, but not in which the architects were able to avoid the consequences of dirigibles as these could be used on existing structures. In 1957, a group of American architects, including Kenneth Starr and Walter Fink, designed a design that allowed a narrow bar for a dirigible to dock. One possible reason for this was the proximity of the building to a private commercial building with the possibility of private security facilities. Another was the potential for more than one type of dirigible in a building. The Kennedy Administration viewed the project as a way of protecting its aircraft, and it was very much within the agency's power to prohibit the use of dirigibles on
