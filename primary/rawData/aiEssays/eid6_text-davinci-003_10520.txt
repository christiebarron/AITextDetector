The construction of the Empire State Building was a grand undertaking that posed many challenges, from the designs for a revolutionary structure to the then-exceeding ten million dollar cost of the buildingâ€™s completion. One of these challenges was the task of affixing a specialized dock that would allow dirigibles to moor to the top of the building. This kind of engineering was quite novel at the time, and the builders of the Empire State Building had to face several obstacles in its successful installment.

The first obstacle was the uncertainty of the larger engineering process surrounding the mooring dock. While the mast had been designed and approved, the crew had to figure out how to set up the mast on the roof of the building, how to brace it sufficiently against the strong winds the dirigibles created, and how to properly secure the dock to the building. In addition, special care had to be taken to make sure that the mast would not interfere with the day-to-day operations of the building, or impede the movements of the passengers.

The second obstacle was the cost of the specialized equipment needed to make the dream of dirigible access possible. The mooring mast had to be constructed of metal and weighed more than 84 tons. The specialized cables required to moor the dirigibles to the mast were also costly, as was the specialized motor equipment that had to be installed to move the mast up and down with the airships.
