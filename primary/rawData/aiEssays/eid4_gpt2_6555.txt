The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it tells the story of the year in the way I wanted to go. And for years my mother has told me about the day I saw it, in the mid of October, when I fell asleep and got ready for bed. I couldn't remember. She said, "Oh, you see, you probably could have seen where I was laying at about this time when it happened." I said, "Oh, you know, I thought I saw that picture with the glasses." And for her, she said, "I'm just too close now. Oh, what the hell happened?"

Marlie Buhler is an honors graduate student at Florida State University. She grew up in the community where she says she first learned about Winter Hibiscus, and since then she has lived there.

I met Laura of the Winter Hibiscus Nursery around November 1995, at the corner of North 2nd Street and North 1st Avenue. Laura was an assistant in the kitchen when we first met. She is a lifelong friend of Mancini, and will be here when we finish it.

The book has three parts: A biography about one of the many legends, and an essay about some one-of-a-kind story the reader could tell.

Part 1: Winter Hibiscus in the Garden

Part 2: The Magic of Winter Hibiscus in the Garden
