I was sitting in the car with my dad, having just pulled away from a lunch date. And here we were, stuck in traffic. As usual, my dad found a way to lighten the mood.

He said something funny, as he always did, and I started to laugh. Then he laughed back, and we kept going back and forth like this for a few moments. 

It was the kind of laughter that was so infectious that it kept cascading back and forth between us, like waves from a skipping stone. 

We kept laughing until the end of the jam, it felt like forever! It was a moment that we both shared, and one I will never forget. 

The laughter was meaningful, and it was an important reminder of our relationship. It was something special that I know will stay with us forever.
