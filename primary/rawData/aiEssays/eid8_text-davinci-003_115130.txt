I will never forget the first time I met my friend John. We had started working at the same company around the same time, and I had always been a bit intimidated by him. He had a no-nonsense attitude, and always seemed to be a bit more serious than everyone else.

One day at work, I was really struggling with a certain problem, and John noticed. He came over and asked what was wrong, and I explained the issue. Instead of giving me a lecture or a lecture on the right way to do it, he simply burst out laughing. I couldn't help but laugh along with him, and soon enough even my issue seemed pretty hilarious.

From that day on, we had a relationship built on laughing and having fun together. We often poke fun at each other, and make jokes when things get too serious. Even though I still admire his no-nonsense attitude, I am so thankful to have a friendship with someone that is built on laughter.
