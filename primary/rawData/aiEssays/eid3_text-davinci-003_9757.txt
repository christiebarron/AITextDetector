The setting of “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski has a significant impact on the cyclist, illustrating the hardships the biker must face on her never-ending journey. The intimidating and foreboding environment challenges the cyclist’s courage and perseverance.

The setting of an arid wasteland can act as a symbol for the cyclist’s seemingly insurmountable task - keeping going no matter how difficult it is. The lack of greenery and the unforgiving terrain conveys the difficulty and loneliness of the cyclist’s journey. The wind is described as ‘stinging’ and the road ‘rutted’; conveying the harshness and ruggedness of the environment.

The setting also has the effect of motivating the cyclist to continue no matter how hard it is. The beauty of the desert blooming in contrast to the dry and desolate landscape can inspire and surprise the cyclist, projecting the idea that life and beauty can be found even in a difficult situation.

The cyclist’s positive attitude and determination are influenced by the setting and conditions. They wear a helmet ‘no matter how hot and dry it got’; showing their commitment to the task and dedication to safety. 

Overall, the setting of “Rough Road Ahead” acts as a mirror for the cyclist’s journey; full of hardship and danger, but in the end, is incredibly rewarding
