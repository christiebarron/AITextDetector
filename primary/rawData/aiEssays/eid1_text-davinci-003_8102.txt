The difficulties of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building in 1931 were significant. This was due to the mooring mast, a 200 foot tall concrete structure that was designed to jut out from the 72nd floor of the skyscraper in order to give dirigibles access to the structure. Even with the mast, engineers and builders had to overcome many obstacles in order to make docking possible.

One of the biggest challenges was coming up with ways to keep the mast steady in the face of heavy wind and turbulence. As the mast was one of the first of its kind, there was no existing data on how to best ensure mooring stability in such turbulent conditions. As such, engineers scoured Europe for the best wind engineering techniques available at the time, and in the end designed the mast with four reinforced concrete stanchions to ensure that it would stay upright and sturdy.

Other obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building included designing suitable landing platforms and mooring lines for the aircraft. Early designs of the mast included a traditional system of vertical and horizontal lines â€” reminiscent of the moorings used on ships. However, this system proved to be too bulky and too heavy for the dirigibles, so engineers proposed a more streamlined design. This design consisted of just a few strong, vertical mooring lines on the mast, and flexible platforms on both sides that were able to collapse into the structure when empty.
