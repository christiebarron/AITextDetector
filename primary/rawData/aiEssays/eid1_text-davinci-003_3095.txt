Dear Editor,

As technology has evolved and computers have become an increasingly integral part of daily life, I'd like to address the potential effects computers have on people. Rather than a source of distraction, I believe they can be used to improve people's lives in several meaningful ways.

For one, computers can enhance our unique skills and talents. From music composition software to graphic design, the opportunities for self-expression are endless when given access to a computer. It can also be used as a tool for communication and socialization with friends and family who may live far away. Plus, the cost of individual computers has dropped significantly, making them more accessible and affordable to everyday people.

Furthermore, computers can serve as an invaluable source of education and knowledge. Students now have access to an innumerable amount of information from the convenience of their own homes, allowing them to expand their interests, broaden their understanding and perfect their study skills.

In conclusion, computers are powerful tools for good that can positively shape our lives. I urge readers to think of them in less of a negative light and instead recognize the immense potential they offer us.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
