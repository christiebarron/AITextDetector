In contrast, in England, "Public interest groups such as Culture Of Adventure and SCCA do not like that an internet service provider might refuse to take action against the information they provide, if it is not free."

This is more than a fair complaint: the British government, from time to time, makes a point of imposing draconian restrictions on public spaces which it feels are not being respected by the community. This has led to large numbers of people taking legal action against ISPs which, if found guilty of infringing on people's right to keep and bear arms, can face fines of up to £13,000.

This sort of policy is designed to scare off anyone who, as noted, has a "reasonable fear" of the information, but not against those who merely want to use it.

I also know from experience, from both the UK media landscape and from public opinion polls, that people who do not take any action to protect their information have been prosecuted at a rate which should be seen as a serious threat to their public safety.
