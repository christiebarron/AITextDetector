The speaker in Winter Hibiscus is a student in school. At the end of the poem, the speaker is expressing hope for the end of winter, signified by the hibiscus budding and the return of the geese. In other words, the speaker is waiting for winter to come to an end so that they can attempt their test again. The speaker also implies that they were not able to do well on their test earlier and would like to try again when given the opportunity. Winter Hibiscus thus ends with the speaker hoping to take the test again when the winter ends.
