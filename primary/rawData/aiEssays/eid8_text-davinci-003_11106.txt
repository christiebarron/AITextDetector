I was meeting up with an old friend of mine named April. We hadn't seen each other in years, and I was excited to catch up. Upon seeing her for the first time in years, we hesitated and then quickly hugged. She felt like a long lost part of me that I had forgotten about.  

When we started up conversations, I quickly realized how silly we still were together, just as if no time had passed at all. We roamed around the mall, talking about our lives since we had last seen one another, and every time a funny story was shared, we both burst out in laughter. I had missed that part of our relationship, and I made a mental note that laughter truly was the greatest connector between two people. 

As we continued to talk, I noticed other shoppers looking at us from the corners of their eyes with slight smiles on their faces. Even though April and I were in a huge public space, it felt like we were the only two people for miles, just unaware of the world around us, engrossed in the bliss of laughter.  

When we finally hugged goodbye the final time, I wasn't ready to say goodbye yet. But I cherished the memories of laughter that we made that day, and I left the mall with a light heart.
