In recent times, libraries have been subject to debate over the issue of censorship. There are some who are for the complete censorship of certain materials such as books, music, movies and magazines. However, many other people are vehemently opposed to censorship in libraries. 

Censorship in libraries is a tricky issue and should not be taken lightly. Censoring books, music, movies, and magazines limits the information that is available to those who use the library, preventing them from having access to knowledge they may find beneficial. 

Books that tackle tough issues, such as racism, sexism, and poverty, should not be removed or blocked from the public’s access. There are certain materials that may be deemed offensive to some, such as books written about or depicting explicit or violent acts. However, such works can open readers’ eyes to a variety of important topics, and promote discussion and critical thought. Even works that contain explicit or pornographic content may serve a higher purpose, such as allowing readers to understand certain ideas or realities in an open way. 

Furthermore, censorship prohibits the expression of people’s true thoughts and feelings. It often goes against the principles of democracy, since it limits exploration, learning, and freedom of speech. Moreover, it is difficult to create an accurate and consistent system of censorship. Different people have different opinions on the same material, making it almost impossible to come to a broad consensus on whether or not to censor certain resources
