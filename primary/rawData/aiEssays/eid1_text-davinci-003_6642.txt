Dear Editor, 

As computers have become increasingly intertwined in our modern lives, I believe it is important to consider the effects they have on our society. After evaluating the most recent data and research I have come to the conclusion that computers are beneficial to people in a variety of ways. 

First and foremost, computers have been found to expand our knowledge by providing us with an unprecedented amount of information easily accessible at our fingertips. In this way, computers are a valuable resource for enhancing our daily lives. Additionally, computers provide new opportunities for students and adults in this digital era. Through online coding and programming classes, individuals can acquire skills needed for countless industries.

Most recently, computers have been utilized to assist in the field of health. For example, they have become useful in connecting medical professionals and patients, providing personalized health information and tracking health trends. Computers also make it easier to store and process data, making medical research easier.

Overall, the benefits of computers are vast and it is important to emphasize their positive impact on our lives. With all the positive effects computers can bring, I strongly urge your readers to appreciate and embrace the positive ways computers are used in our lives today.

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
