The Empire State Building was the tallest building of its kind when it opened in New York City during the 1930s, and was the first towering structure tall enough to be used as a docking station for dirigibles. Despite this revolutionary innovation, the development process faced challenges in the way of intricate engineering and construction.

The building’s mooring mast, designed to hold the dirigibles in position, was a key component of the Empire State Building’s dirigible program, and presented many engineering challenges. At the time, dirigibles were barely able to maintain altitude and had poor maneuverability because of their immense weight. This meant that the mooring mast needed to be strong - but not too heavy - so that the airships would not be dragged off course. This presented a difficult task, as the mast’s design had to withstand the shifting forces of the wind while still allowing for some flexibility and an easy release.

After months of trial and error, the engineers developed a special locking system called the “butterfly hitch” which could be quickly and easily released, allowing for easy maneuvering of the dirigibles in varying weather conditions. At the top of the mast, a block and tackle system was also included to control and further refine the flexibility of the mooring system. 

The mooring mast also had to reach high enough to make sure the dirigibles were above surrounding buildings and skysc
