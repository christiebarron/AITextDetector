One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was 6 years old. This feeling was similar to the feeling I had when I was 13 years old. I felt so happy when it happened. And I still do. Sometimes my parents talk about 'our little girl' because it can seem like I'm not being recognized either. But for me now, my feeling is like most kids see a child and love a great man when he's a girl. You know when you see a beautiful girl like my mother or my brother who has grown up and is still around and is a good girl and is willing to work hard and make a positive difference to others. That's usually when I love a girl. It doesn't mean I don't care about her or my love. It means I love her unconditionally. I still love her unconditionally. It's very rare. And she is still my girl in spite of her father.

So I think women make more mistakes, do things that are not your natural instinct, and not really want children but they have choices to make. When I was 12 you have these stories about your parents not being able to love you because they didn't give you enough money or for not doing the right thing for you. So, I think people make less of an effort to support their kids.

So I don't think women should not be responsible for what other people do to themâ€¦ that's actually something the men who are around your age
