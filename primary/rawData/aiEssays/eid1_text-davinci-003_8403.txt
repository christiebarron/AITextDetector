I was at the grocery store trying to get some essentials but the five ahead of me in line had so many items that it was taking forever. I was quiet starting to get annoyed and had contemplated cutting in line when I noticed an elderly gentleman at the back of the checkout line. He was obviously using a walker and I could tell he was in pain.

He gingerly placed his few items on the belt with a heavy breath, followed by a deep sigh. He flinched a little when he moved from one side to the other, obviously trying to keep the pain at bay. He apologized each time he shifted, saying he didn't mean to inconvenience others. 

Rather than focus on my own frustrations, I decided to focus on him and try to help in any way I could. I grabbed the items he had difficulty reaching and even held his items at the conveyor belt. His face lit up when he thanked me for my help and he appreciated my patience. 

By the time the elderly gentleman checked out, the line had been bearable and manageable and I ended up not needing to rush. His worries and hardships had been taken care of by the time I was done and that made me feel good. It reminded me that it's important to be patient and mindful of those around us.
