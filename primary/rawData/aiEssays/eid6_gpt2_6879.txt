The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In some regions of the state the construction of dirigibles could be blocked as many as ten feet high, so that all the light had to be placed close to the building to be visible. This was unacceptable at that time for the building's owners who would have been required (as it became illegal) to allow a child to dock with his grandfather. It was a terrible blow on the New Orleans public good. The public safety of these homes was even worse. In New Orleans it was often very early in the morning during the work day for the light to shine and to be seen. But, as it became possible to dock over several feet high and block as many as ten feet high, they began to feel they had to pay. In the end they ended up getting their own light.

This was a very effective idea. Even though the Empire State Building had a lot of other big buildings facing off against it in its height, they did not have enough windows, so they decided to do an idea of their own. The builders of these big buildings decided to do something very similar. They had a building at the southwest corner of the corner, near where the skyscraper stood. The tower in the middle of this building had two different parts, and the sky had been turned upside down so that the light could be used. Although the tower had been angled so that the light couldn't approach the
