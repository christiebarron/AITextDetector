I remember a time when I went camping with some friends and our trip was a complete disaster. For starters, our tents had holes, then it began to rain so heavily that our gear got soaked. As we were packing up our stuff, my friends starting to complain and grumble. It definitely wasn’t a fun experience. I, on the other hand, kept my cool the whole time. I was patient – I understood that things don’t always go as planned and that complaining about it wouldn’t help the situation. So instead of joining in the grumbling, I kept quiet and coaxed my friends to try to see the silver lining in the situation. By being patient, I was able to keep the peace and help everyone stay calm and collected until we figured out a game plan.  Ultimately, this allowed us to get our stuff packed in an orderly manner and make it back to the car as quickly as possible.
