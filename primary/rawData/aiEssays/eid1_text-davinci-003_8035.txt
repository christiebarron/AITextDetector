The task of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was a formidable undertaking for its builders. The attempts to grant permission for the docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building had to overcome significant obstacles both inside and outside of the building.

The size of the Empire State Building, standing at 1,250 feet, presented the first major challenge as the building was too tall for the mooring mast to be integrated into its design. The mast would have to be an added feature which posed a danger to air traffic traveling around the building. The mast also posed a problem for the architects and builders. Not only was there the worry of the added structure being unstable and unsafe, but the mast itself would require structural alterations that had to be carefully calculated and constructively scheduled.

The dirigibles themselves posed another factor to keep in mind. The unpredictability of their sizes and airfoils made it difficult to ensure that the mooring mast would be able to accommodate any size. Additionally, since a dirigible was seen as an unstable piece of air transportation the insurance rates for the building would skyrocket if moored dirigibles were included in the design.

The size of the airspace around the building posed another obstacle. To ensure the safety of the Empire State Building, designers needed to ensure that the airspace around the building was wide enough that if a mooring mast were to be added, it would not interfere with any other air traffic.
