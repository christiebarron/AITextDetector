I remember a time I was very patient. I had gone shopping with my mother, and we had a very long list of items to buy. We had been shopping for what felt like hours, and we were both starting to get really frustrated. We had been to several stores, and were starting to run out of places to go. 

My mom was about to give up and head home empty handed, but I encouraged her to stay patient. I told her that everything would work out, and that eventually we would find what we were looking for. We kept searching and eventually found everything on our list. 

I was glad we kept looking - I could see the relief in my mom's face. We returned home with all our items, but most importantly, we left with a lesson in patience.
