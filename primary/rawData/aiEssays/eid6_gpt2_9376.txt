Winogrand's famous tree was in use in the United States for over 100 years before its time. It was an architectural masterpiece. He saw it built on top of the state's tallest building, and for a brief time had visions of the building being built atop it. That idea turned into a real estate development in 1893.

But it was Winogrand's vision in 1909 that eventually drove
