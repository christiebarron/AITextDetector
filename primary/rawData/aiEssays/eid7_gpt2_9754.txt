An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when we all had a fight, which I remember was during summer break; the doctor was doing his best to take him out when she saw his arm and he did not do anything to keep up."


"I was like 'that's really pretty cute'. I was like 'nah, it's okay, I need help doing this'. I am so grateful so much to everyone who helped me."


In 2005, Michael Phelps, US Olympic gold medallist, was awarded the Medal of Honor for a lifetime achievement on Olympic-level swimming.


The man who inspired Phelps and Paralympics legend Paul Gallen, became the first person in US history to receive the award and was an international runner-up.


It was first presented in the United States in the form of a trophy presented for "performance-enhancing" drugs such as phencyclidine, amphetamines and methylphenidate at the 2008 London Olympics.


The medal of honor is the lowest award an athlete receives on the United States swimming team since the 1920s.
