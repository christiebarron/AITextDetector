Dear Editor,

The rapid spread of computers in modern life has had an enormous impact on how people operate in their daily lives. From home to work, nearly all aspects of our lives require some form of computer usage, with the internet allowing us to access vast amounts of information to aid our research and development. Though essential, excessive use of computers has also amongst other things led to the shortening of concentration spans, impediments to physical activity and in some cases loss of real world interaction between people.

Many organizations want to stay ahead of the curve by using computer technology in their production processes and as such its use has become endemic. Though this has undoubtedly yielded a great many benefits, with faster communication and improved business operations for example, it has also had an adverse impact. Excessive staring at computer screens can impair eye health and the effects have been noted to potentially impact physical health - obesity being a particular concern. In addition, the speed of technology has meant that people are less likely to stay on one task than before - zapping between a variety of tasks frequently as opposed to work on a single one for a period of time.

Maintaining a sensible balance between using computer technology and altogether avoiding it is essential to our wellbeing. It is important that we recognize that technology can improve lives, but should not govern them, and the temptation to use computers for every little task is one that should be resisted.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
