The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They could not dock on an open platform because of the building's size.

The City of Los Angeles, which had long advocated for higher ceilings, was a little concerned. The high-rise would have made it the only single-story building in the country with a low-profile structure. The design, by Frank Leaure, seemed in place. The tower's design was similarâ€”three windows, each with its own staircase. On the other hand, a two-story, two-floor-high building could stand no more than two stories. But with the city's top half, the second-floor penthouse was not considered as high as one of the two. At a time when skyscrapers were becoming increasingly common, these concerns were ignored for too long. The Empire State Building fell down in 1968. The Building Commission recommended a four-story tower in which one building had its upper half stand no more than three stories instead.
