The Empire State Building was a true marvel of engineering of its time, with a groundbreaking design that involved the challenging feat of docking of dirigibles on the building. Attempting to dock dirigibles on a building that rises to just over a thousand feet in the air is no small task. The builders of the Empire State Building who had hopes of allowing dirigibles to dock encountered a variety of obstacles along the way.

One of the most evident and challenging obstacles for the builder of the Empire State Building was the sheer size of the building. It presented an incredible engineering feat to design and construct a structure that was almost 103 stories, over 1000 feet tall, and simultaneously had the capacity to dock dirigibles with a 800-foot long mast. The designers had to come up with a quality engineering solution to fasten a mast to the top of the building that could house and protect dirigibles while also bearing the weight of the dirigibles themselves.

The various elements presented in the design of the Empire State Building also raised a few obstacles for the builders. The sheer weight of the dirigible would prove to be too much for the window frames that made up the outer frames of the building so adequate support needed to be established to accommodate the load. In addition, there was the issue of strong and gusty wind currents that surrounded the building which made it increasingly difficult to dock the airships. As such, the designers had to find a way to make the building
