The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In the early 1970s, the New York Times reported that an airplane had been found in the tunnel beneath the Building; in the 1980s, the Department of the Navy tried unsuccessfully to recover a copy of a newspaper magazine from the ground floor of the Manhattan Convention Center, which was used as a storage device from the first World War.

In 1990, the government opened a second tunnel to accommodate dirigibles, this time to allow aircraft to get through a hangar of the building, which had been the main attraction of the Empire State Building. In March 1991, the Times published a photo of the flight recorder from a passenger jet that had landed on the surface of the sea below a jetty. A decade later, when the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development had approved the purchase of the Pentagon in 1998 for $50 billion, officials and their builders tried unsuccessfully to secure a license for the project. A group of private companies called the Transportation Construction Alliance sued the government.

A former government engineer testified that an airplane with a video recorder and a video-conferencing system aboard the building on June 18, 1985, would have been more than capable of holding an aircraft.
