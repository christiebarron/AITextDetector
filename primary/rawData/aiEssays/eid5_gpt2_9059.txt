The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' was so vivid that it was given a new name to help those wishing to read it.

'I have read most of it because I want a change of career. It is about moving from an era when 'life is a journey' to what I now feel like I have to live, to something much more joyful and uplifting.

'When I was writing it in 2006, you could see that the book was written for the young people of this country. They didn't know that by reading it now they would have been reading the memoir. It wasn't something I had ever thought about. It was not a place that happened on a particular day.

'But that is the story of this book, a journey to get to where I am now. There is no turning back in my mind. There is a new hope, a new hope.'
