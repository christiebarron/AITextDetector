Computers have many effects on people. But if you look at the science, at the physical side, at psychology, at economics, I think the most fundamental thing is the fundamental change in the social sciences.

This doesn't just happen on a national level; it happens at home. We are the second fastest growing social sciences of our time. The United States has lost over 10 million scientists over half of all our scientific papers are in Guatemalan history and the University of California, Irvine, to Guatemala. We lose 20 percent of our postdoctoral fellows on scientific research there today, because all our research is at home for them. The only time we'll get 50 percent of the money we ever had, and 20 percent, that's the bottom half of the US. The bottom half is because we don't have a national scientific school. Even if you went into research at Michigan or Stanford, then in a sense, you're living in a country where you're supposed to work for 10 years in search of a job. It's kind of a contradiction for not to get a job or a scholarship or a job. You go to work for ten years trying to understand your biological processes of metabolism or your metabolism, and then you realize that you got your whole life done in a laboratory and are not on scholarship, that you're not doing work, because you may not know how well you do your body or the genetics, but that's what it's all about. This is your job
