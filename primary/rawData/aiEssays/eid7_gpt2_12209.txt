An example of a time someone in my life was patient was in my back yard. When my friend came home from church we took a moment to get some drinks before we left and after it was all over he called the police. When he had to leave, he asked everyone to join in. This turned out to be an incident which took place at church while out and about early morning. We had one police officer with him and his dog at church time so we waited for them to leave before going home and he could get back in the car. I was really nervous when he called me, saying, 'Sorry, I forgot to include you. I just want you and my dog home and here to see your kids."

When her friend walked to him and held him for a few moments, "he was very apologetic. He said he had wanted me to do something. But we don't want anyone to be scared of this and think we had a problem because they need it, no matter what we give them or just make a statement and say we need it. He said he wanted to call me, but I told him that I wanted to have my kid home. He was so apologetic," Dr. Kelly told ABC News.

Dr. Kelley, who has worked with a variety of vets since 1975, said if an incident like this happened and he was worried for the safety of one patient her team would have been there to help the affected person.
