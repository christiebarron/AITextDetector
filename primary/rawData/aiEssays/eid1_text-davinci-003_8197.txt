The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The most significant challenge was the practicality of having airships dock on such a tall building. As Marcia Amidon Lüsted recounts in her article ‘The Mooring Mast’, the Empire State Building was an unprecedented 1,250 feet tall upon its completion in 1931, and this posed a problem that went beyond the limited experience of the engineering staff. 

The building lacked any dedicated accommodations for docked dirigibles. The structure of the building itself was built for strength and rigidity rather than flexibility, and the presence of airships was something the builders of the Empire State Building had not planned for. Furthermore, strong winds blowing at high altitudes as well as the lack of nearby berthing facilities presented architectural and engineering risks and needed to be taken into consideration.

The rooftop of the Empire State Building was too narrow to accommodate the large size of dirigibles, and there was not enough room to build a large enough mast to support these airships. Rotating the airships in the narrow rooftop area was therefore deemed too dangerous, and putting them down directly onto the observatory was deemed infeasible. Thus, dirigibles were unable to dock at the Empire State Building.

In addition to the physical obstacles posed by constructing a docking mast and the size of the airships, the Empire State building was also located
