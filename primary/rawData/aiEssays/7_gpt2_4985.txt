An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was at a birthday party. There was one kid who said, "Don't try taking my pills, it's just me." This guy got really depressed. He sat in the corner and said, "I didn't have it any more." This kid was depressed because he couldn't take pills. He had a lot of painkillers FedEx got him. He started taking medications which made it much worse. One of my nurses said, "You can't just take any medication because you are ill. The medicine won't work. It will only relieve pain." It gave me a lot of comfort.

I've also watched a lot of guys get up when they feel sick and get up and start to move. They come out of bed and come out with their eyes rolling in their arms. It happens when you want to work out. "What's a little bit more important than working out?" "Anything. There will be no regrets about it." If you work out, do that and you will become a better person. That kind of work out will give you a better life.

JOB DESIRE: The challenge is doing well in life and how we learn from other people. And if you put yourself there, you have to be ready for this challenge and be able to give. In the end it is what I call "the life of failure."
