I believe that censorship of materials in libraries around the world is an unconstitutional form of censorship. In Australia, we are a democracy; where we believe that fair access for all needs to be a top priority."

Professor Daniela Reis, of the University of Adelaide's Department of Public Policy and Communications, said the government should take "a very hard look at" how it handled access to books.

"This report has come out in opposition to the government's decision to allow the release of the library and the National Archives to book reviews by public servants on the contents of their work. I'm worried that this will further alienate many young people from the reading experience.

"This information is valuable to those who love our books and for those who care about our historical, cultural and political history, particularly those from New Zealand."

The Liberal Party recently introduced legislation that would allow public servants to review works produced and published by independent sources in an attempt to challenge government policy decisions. It would see books published by the Australian National University (ANU), the Australian National Police (ANP), the Australian Bureau for Statistics (ABS), the Australian National Museum (ANM), the American Library Association (ALMA), the Australian Arts Council (AASC) and the Australian Heritage Society (AHSE).
