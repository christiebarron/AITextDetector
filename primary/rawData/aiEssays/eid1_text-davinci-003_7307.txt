In the beginning of the story, the cyclist is riding in a wooded area with trees on either side of the road. This gives the rider a sense of comfort and peace, which is beneficial to the cyclist as it provides him with a relaxed atmosphere in which to ride.

As the cyclist continues his journey, he finds the terrain to become more difficult and the landscape to be ever-changing. The rider must climb hills, pass stones and debris, and even navigate stretches of mud. These challenges the cyclist to become increasingly aware of their environment in order to potentially avoid any potential danger.
