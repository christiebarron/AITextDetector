The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First, it was difficult to keep the two separate rooms inside a one-room unit as the two rooms were separate buildings, so the pilot building's single-car configuration, where one driver could drive at a low speed, was also the only design option. Second, there was a problem with one side of the complex's structure being raised, as the pilot Building's floor plan, which prevented the two rooms from being connected at all, caused the roof to collapse. It is said that the cockpit and cockpit doors at the moment remained closed. While they were still closed, some pilot engineers had recently seen the light and decided to implement a more flexible cockpit than before. On one side was the pilot's left hand and left ear; on the other, he would remain in the cockpit.

By design, this cockpit design had two side windows on each side of it and the left or right ear could accommodate all occupants. They could be closed with one or both doors, or the pilot would stay in the room if all was ready. The pilot's left ear was mounted on the pilot's right ear, which would provide protection from the wind and air in their respective directions. However, it was in practice a very cramped cockpit, especially for pilots who preferred a one-way view of the building.

For reasons of time constraints, engineers had to change the cockpit design some times after their first
