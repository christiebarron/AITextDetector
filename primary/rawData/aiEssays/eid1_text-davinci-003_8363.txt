It was a long, hot summer that year and I had just started a new job. I was a waitress at a small diner on the edge of town and I was still trying to learn the ropes. One day my assistant manager, Bill, asked me to help him stock the drink station while he checked the bathrooms for supplies.

I obliged and quickly began my task, but it wasn’t long before I realized that this was going to take much longer than I had anticipated. There were so many cans and bottles to count, label and arrange – it was overwhelming.

That’s when Bill stepped in. Instead of scolding me for taking too long, he was patient and understanding. He even offered a few tips and tricks to help me get organized. Before I knew it, the task was complete and I had learned something along the way.

I’ve since left that job, but I remember that moment in particular. It taught me a valuable lesson in being patient, no matter the situation.
