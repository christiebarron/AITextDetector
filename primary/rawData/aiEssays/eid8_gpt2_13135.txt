One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I had taken a big sip of wine in the early morning while I was listening to a music video playing at my computer. It just struck me as a great moment for the two of us.

It really is nice to actually say the things that we say with great grace. I had actually been using the word "fuck" a couple times before and when something like that happened, I made sure to change it because I was starting to wonder how to hold myself.

And that's what I've always done â€“ I've just made my own shit.

But I'll give you the biggest piece of advice here. Try your best to keep a low profile. Your friends will see you as a "fucking idiot," and you'll be ridiculed, so why won't you let them have fun?
