Dear Editor, 

It is with great enthusiasm that I take this opportunity to discuss the effects of computers on people. 

While computers are certainly beneficial in many ways, such as helping us access information quicker than ever before, there are many potential hazards associated with them. 

To start, the use of computers can limit a person’s socialization with their peers. Since most activities related to computers are performed alone, it can provide a convenient excuse to remain indoors and isolate oneself from others. This could lead to feelings of loneliness, and even depression. 

In addition, the extensive use of computers and technology can have a negative impact on physical health. Computer users tend to spend long hours seated in front of a screen, leading to conditions such as obesity or poor posture. 

Finally, computer use can have a detrimental effect on a person’s productivity. The false sense of security and lack of discipline accompanying computers could cause a user to procrastinate and become unproductive. 

In conclusion, although computers have certain benefits, one should use them with caution and moderation. Too much engagement with computers can have serious implications for a person’s wellbeing, both emotionally and physically. 

Sincerely,

[Name]
