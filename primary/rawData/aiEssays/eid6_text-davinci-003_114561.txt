The construction of the Empire State Building was a daring and ambitious undertaking in the early 1930s, and it presented unique challenges due to its revolutionary plan to incorporate mooring mast towers that would allow for dirigibles to dock. Despite the engineers' enthusiasm for this innovative concept, the difficulties to make it a reality were daunting.

The most immediate challenge was creating a mooring mast capable of accommodating the size and weight of a mooring dirigible. The engineers had to build not only a tower in which dirigibles could dock and be tethered securely, but also a reliable system for them to enter and exit safely. The tower itself was built both high enough to survive the strong winds of the region, and low enough for the size of the largest dirigible, the USS Los Angeles. 

The engineers also had to consider the strongest possible material to construct the tower, and an inflexible part at the tip of the mast in order to attach the cable from the dirigible. The mooring mast was also equipped with an elevator that could simulate the force of the wind when the dirigible was approaching for docking, and guide the airship during even the most difficult winds.

In addition, the engineers devoted tremendous efforts to ensure that the mast would be able to withstand the mooring, winching, and unwinching processes to safely secure the airships and prevent them from crashing into the ground when dismounting. The engineers
