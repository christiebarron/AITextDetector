Computers have many effects on people. The simplest is that they increase their risk of developing cardiovascular diseases like coronary heart disease, stroke, and diabetes, or cause them to suffer higher rates of stroke and related complications than any other group of people. If this kind of effect is not accounted for into the causal analysis, then, although the effect of computer systems on patients is largely driven by people using computers (particularly computers in the form of "smart" computers, computer-related software, and other "smart" systems), more often these effects are the result of people using more advanced technologies that allow them to control, manage, and control their own lives with relatively little interference.

This doesn't mean computers are somehow more dangerous than other human behaviors. In fact, the more complex and less well-defined the human computer experience, the greater the chance that it will be a more deadly source of the problems you'll face if you're really that good at some kind of advanced program.

The problem with these predictions, of course, is the fact that if you use the above models, then they won't look like so much an oversimplification as a plausible explanation for why computers are becoming dangerous. For example, if the "smart" user, or programmer, has some particular computer system in them, they may not be better prepared to deal with the "smart person at work" in a much less hazardous way. But some of the other less-well-defined computer experiences may
