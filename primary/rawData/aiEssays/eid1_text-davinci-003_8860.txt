There I was, on my first date with a new guy. We had been talking for a while and had a great rapport so I was really looking forward to the date.

We ended up going out for a meal at a great Italian restaurant and everything was going perfectly. As our conversation progressed, we started to get more and more comfortable with each other. It was so nice to finally be around someone who was on the same wavelength as me. 

At one point in the conversation, my date started to tell a joke and I couldn't help but burst out into laughter. He saw that I was laughing and followed suit, joining in on my laughter. We both just looked at each other and started laughing uncontrollably for what felt like eternity. 

I thought that was going to be it for the laughs that night, but it wasn't. Our conversation flowed so naturally that we kept finding things to laugh about. We talked about our favourite movies, laughed about past experiences, and just generally enjoyed each other's company.

When our date came to an end, I couldn't believe how much fun I had. It was so wonderful to be in a place where I could relax and be myself; I felt like I'd known my date forever and the laughter was definitely a huge part of it. 

It's now been a few months since our first date and we are still laughing every time we're together. Laughter has kept us young
