Dear Editor: 

I believe computers have a negative effect on people. Many studies have shown that increased screen time can be associated with a greater risk of depression or anxiety in young people. In addition, computers have also been linked to poor sleep quality, which can lead to fatigue during the day.

Furthermore, the use of computers can have a significant detrimental impact on physical health. Studies have shown that spending too much time in front of a computer can lead to obesity, increased risk of stroke, heart disorders, and other health issues.

At the same time, computers can cause people to become more isolated. People who spend too much time in front of computers do not take part in traditional activities and forms of socializing. This can lead to depression, loneliness, and other mental health problems.

Overall, it is important to limit the amount of time we spend in front of a computer in order to protect our physical and mental health. We should strive to balance our time in front of a computer with activities that encourage physical activity and socialization. 

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
