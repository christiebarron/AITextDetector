An example of a time someone in my life was patient was in the mid-1990s and was given a second opinion about whether he was going to continue smoking dope before quitting. What's funny is that he thought it was the last time. I kept asking him, "Yes, but you are still going to quit smoking." It was then he was a little more patient. Then the question hit on him, and I just told him to stay away from drugs. He wanted to quit, and I said, "OK, okay, but if you don't move, then keep going and do something more." So that was what started it. Now when you go to a doctor, you don't even know if there's going to be support. It just seems to come out on the other side of the fence when everything that happened in that moment, that is the reason you are feeling like you're at peace.

When I'm writing on this topic, it seemed to have some sort of an interconnection with people, and other than having this kind of support system for me with people that I don't really know personally, I don't meet with people that I consider in a good way. It's interesting, because I don't find that helpful either. In retrospect, I do find I see a lot of support systems in the world, but when I go out, that stuff just doesn't work for me. And there are still people out there that would rather just live
