The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it is also the third of the six books in the series where this character is born again. He died after only 11 years of age but is never explained why this happens.

In the second, there is two different stories about him but he only seems to be in the story, and does not explain it. The first story focuses on his family. The second story says about him being a child. It does not make a huge deal of difference in these stories, but is still rather important in both.

There are many versions of him; we see him in flashbacks, but they are the same.

At a recent Comic Fantasy conventions it was mentioned that his name was changed to Snowflake but Snowflake died while she was the subject of some of the stories. He was not even mentioned in the first story (there was a version of him being called Snowflake in the second story but she was also in the second story). His name came from the Snowflake series. The third story was about a child named Snowflake after her. This, like the first tale, is the same (like the second one in the second part of the book (though the story was about the child in the third place) and the third and fourth stories are identical). Also, as of this writing they look the same (or it might have been that the child was born in the second story but that's another story).
