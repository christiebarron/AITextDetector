The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' and the fact that the story has a lot of similarities with the early days of the film, makes the work a lot more interesting as this might actually be an attempt at a novelisation of the book but, well, the book wouldn't know if they were going to write one by now.

One other point on Watchman's work that might also be interesting considering Watchman's relationship with the DC Comics character The Flash was already explored on television first?
