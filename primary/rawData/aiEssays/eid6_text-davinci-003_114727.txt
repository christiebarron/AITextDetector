The Empire State Building was an immense engineering project, and one of its key features was the 200-foot tall steel mooring mast that allowed dirigibles to dock. However, it was certainly not an easy procedure. As Marcia Amidon Lüsted explains in her book, “The Mooring Mast,” the construction of the mast for the Empire State Building faced numerous challenges.

First, the mast had to be built high enough to allow the dirigible to clear the surrounding buildings easily, but low enough to prevent any collision with the top of the Empire State Building itself. Second, workers had to consider the weight of the airship as it was being moored. There were numerous safety concerns involved in making sure the mast was strong enough to secure the dirigible at its peak weight. This meant that the mast must be made out of very strong metals, which added extra costs.

Third, the mast had to be constructed with great care and accuracy. The slightest miscalculation in the placement of the docking cables or in the tension of the cables had the potential to cause a disaster. Many safety tests were carried out, with the workers using dummy dirigibles to ensure the mast and mooring system were able to handle the weight and to see if the cables were correctly placed and tensioned.

In addition, the logistics of constructing the mast were a major challenge. The entire mast had to be constructed on the 86th floor
