Censorship in libraries is a controversial topic that continues to spark debate and divided opinion in our society. It refers to the suppression or restriction of the dissemination of information, ideas, expressions, images and books.

Libraries play a key role in our society, providing access to information and entertainment. It is therefore essential that we maintain the integrity of the services that they provide by preserving the freedom of choice available to library patrons. Removing materials, such as books, music, movies and magazines from the shelves, that are deemed offensive by some would be to severely limit our freedom of choice.

It is true that access to certain material should be restricted, especially for children and vulnerable individuals. However, it is important to remember that as adults, it is our responsibility to exercise our own judgement when it comes to what content we read, listen to, or watch. We should not be dictated to by the supposed sensibilities of others. 

It is also worth reflecting on the thought of the celebrated author Ursula K. Le Guinn, who wrote “When you suppress something, you have to ask yourself, what are you afraid of?”. To censor books does not remove the idea from the public discourse, instead it paradoxically gives it more power and a larger platform for debate. 

In the interest of protecting the freedom of choice available to library patrons, it is essential that censorship is not used to suppress or restrict the types of content available
