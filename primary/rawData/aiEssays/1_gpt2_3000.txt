Computers have many effects on people. Most of the time when you start learning about computers it causes problems. However, I want to point out here for you that I recently made one of the most important changes to my life. I started developing new ways of analyzing data, how to solve problems quickly. As I've mentioned before, I have the power to change all the world's problems - in a more rapid and accurate way. Now, it looks like I can do something to change human behavior, which I hope will help in many other areas such as computer science, information technology and mathematics.
