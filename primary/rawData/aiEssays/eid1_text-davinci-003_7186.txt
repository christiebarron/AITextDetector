The setting of Joe Kurmaski’s ‘Rough Road Ahead’ is an important factor in the cyclist’s journey. The challenges of the terrain directly affect the cyclist’s physical and mental state as he navigates through the rough roads.

The beginning of the story describes a landscape of uphill hills, sandy surfaces, and fallen rocks. This terrain alone tests the cyclist’s strength, as he is defined as a ‘strong rider’. The attention to detail in this description implies that the cyclist is familiar with such terrain and is well-equipped to handle it. The uphill hills challenge the cyclist’s strength by forcing him to expend a great deal of energy in making progress. The sandy roads prove treacherous, making it difficult for the cyclist to keep his balance. The fallen rocks further make the journey difficult, as the cyclist must be careful to not get caught in them while riding.

In addition to the physical resistance that this setting offers, ‘Rough Road Ahead’ also presents the psychological challenge of perseverance. As the cyclist’s journey turns out to be longer than expected, the cyclist must remain committed to the path he has chosen and continue to push forward. The challenging terrain also heightens his awareness, as he must pay close attention to the road in order to safely navigate his way back.
