An example of a time someone in my life was patient was this conversation he had with him about why the Bible says nothing about murder, and he said it wasn't that specific. "When I see my family, it's because I see them as people who have died, they're loved, and it's the best way to be sure they're loved. This is what we're seeing all over this country, people who are living difficult life, and they can't hold onto any of it, and they're sad."

"You may believe some of the things that come with life and see that it helps all of them," he said. "But that's a thing they'd say. And this will be the biggest story for the rest of time."

He told me they are waiting for them to hear how his family will feel about it, and about how God has the right to judge what they have heard.

"The Lord's work is to have mercy on his people, to have mercy on his angels, to have mercy on his sheep, to have mercy on his livestock," he said. "I'm happy they are there and they're there fighting for the right thing to do."
