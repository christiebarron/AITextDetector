Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects of computers on people. In today’s world, computers are becoming increasingly integrated into our lives. We use them for everything from daycare to business operations. Though technological advancements come with clear advantages, such as improved communication and efficiency, an overreliance on computers can be detrimental to our health and daily lives.

For one, an overuse of computers can lead to neck and back pain due to poor posture from prolonged sitting in front of a computer monitor. Additionally, the blue light emitted from digital screens can have serious implications on sleep quality and our general health. Finally, the use of computers can leave us feeling drained and unproductive, causing us to lose touch with our physical and social lives.

It is important for us to recognize the potential long-term health risks associated with excessive computer usage and take precautionary measures, such as limiting screen time, taking frequent breaks, and exercising regularly. We should also prioritize physical interactions with others and engage in activities away from screens.

It is evident that, though computers are an invaluable asset, an overreliance on them can be detrimental to our health. Therefore, I strongly urge readers to take steps to limit computer usage and recognize technology for what it is meant for—to supplement our lives, not take their place.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
