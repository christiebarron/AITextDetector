I recently was listening to some friends argue over whose turn it was to lead in a game that we were playing. They began to raise their voices and it seemed like it was going to get ugly. I was determined to remain patient. 

I asked them to take a few deep breaths and think about the situation carefully. I reminded them that everyone had a chance to play the game and that if they simply took turns, it would be much easier. After a few moments of silence, they both agreed and resumed playing.

I was glad I had taken the time to be patient. We got to finish the game without any more arguing and everyone had a good time. Being patient with my friends was a great way to avoid conflict and keep the game enjoyable.
