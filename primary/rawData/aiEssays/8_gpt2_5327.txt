One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was in college - when my classmates said it was funny but we had a joke we were doing in class about how many people would be like 'oh my God. Who was the funniest person in school?', and I would laugh it off because it was so funny. It was a good year. But once it got to the point where I started to think it was just another word that people would use to describe my body, I could no longer think about that. I would just keep doing what I started doing, which was just to relax - in fact, I found humor was not a good way to feel.
