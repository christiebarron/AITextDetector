Once I was driving home from work in my car and I got stuck in a traffic jam. I was starting to get frustrated and impatient, but then I noticed the woman in the car next to me. She had the window rolled down and was laughing and smiling with her two children in the back seat. Even though she was stuck in the same traffic as me, she wasn't letting it ruin her day. This made me realize that I didn't need to be so frustrated. So, I took a deep breath, let go of my expectations and just went with the flow. I was able to enjoy the music I was listening to and just appreciate the fact that I was in a safe place instead of being inside my office. This was a great reminder to me that even in difficult situations, being patient and slowing down can make the situation much more manageable.
