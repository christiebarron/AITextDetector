I believe that censorship of materials in libraries would be an effective means to safeguard freedom of expression in libraries as it protects the freedom of public expression. Libraries operate under a free press policy. This policy aims to protect the freedom of public expression while at the same time protecting freedom of expression in schools and institutions. There is some debate as to whether there is an appropriate level of censorship that is necessary. However, the Government says that:

The content of libraries should not be subject to personal preference. Libraries should be free to use their materials without discrimination, including discrimination concerning race, sex, culture, national origin, gender identity or expression. Libraries also should not be compelled to distribute prohibited material unless all the relevant information is reasonably available to the public.

An open-access approach is also the most effective means of protecting speech from government interference. These open-access policies have proven effective and have not been restricted in any way. However, there is concern that the principle of censorship of speech will be affected in some areas where the media is relatively new. The Government believes that the legal status of libraries has been determined by the government.

The Public Library Law Council argues against the restriction of materials that are protected under the 'right of free speech'. This includes the right to refuse to share certain materials in schools, to refuse to publish certain documents in the public library if you are not at liberty and to share papers and papers on the Internet with others, for example.
