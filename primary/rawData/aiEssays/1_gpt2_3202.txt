Computers have many effects on people. Your mood can drop sharply with the cold or the heat. Your mood can go a bit hazy with cold. You're going over your head very easily. You tend to have trouble sleeping. For example, if you are looking for something to write, you will start writing and you will have trouble staying focused and calm. It usually becomes very hard, if not impossible, to start and finish something or not. As you get older, your depression gets worse. You start thinking harder and thinking different at times. You begin to forget what happened. You start becoming frustrated, and you start trying to deal with what happened to you - sometimes this causes you depression. You start going to the gym to get high and sometimes you go to the doctor to have some type of meds and try to get rid of stress or anxiety and do some other other activities of the same type. However, depression isn't as big a cause of self-harm as some would think. As a result, there are many ways to reduce the stress that people have on themselves. By taking certain drugs, like sleeping pills, antidepressants and a combination of these, that are known to ease depression, you have the chance to save someone's life. Your own lifestyle helps to reduce stress and worry - while helping people, by helping us feel better about ourselves.
