Dr. Robert J. Cogan is Chief Executive Officer of Health Solutions, Inc. He was interviewed bymulti-media.com and was on call during the call to discuss his company's products and services.

The call was also shared by Moms for a Better Way, which provides health services with information about how to reduce teen pregnancy.

Health Solutions is known for its use of a unique methodology. According to the company, which promotes safer sex, teens are more motivated to use condoms than to use a condom in the first place because of the cost and time they spend with others, while the method saves them and the girls time while they grow out of being sexless.

Dr. Cogan says the results aren't new.

"I think we have been very focused on abstinence-based methods since 2009," Dr. Cogan said. "And the best way is to focus on what is best to help adolescents, not what is good for them, whatever that is, and to focus on how much has changed and what was the main change."

Dr. Cogan is a consultant on prevention and treatment for the nation's youth.
