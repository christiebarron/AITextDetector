An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was hospitalized in an accident. As I'm typing this, no, this happened just yesterday. No, it took a few hours. I was already feeling sick. Then the ER staff came to me and said, "I was going to do this, but you need to go to the doctor and find out," and I said, "It was my fault for not performing my part." So, after we spoke to each other for a little bit, he said, "I mean, there were so many things going on that you could have just taken it as a sign that it might help to have this surgery. Like, in general, you can take it and be great, but you should also be a little better." So, we took that decision and went home and that's why, I feel, that just gave you that benefit.

Why was it that you chose to take your time making decisions about certain matters, like whether you were to have a vasectomy or not? And how did that help you as a self-proclaimed 'pro-life' person?

I think this is the only thing that's relevant here, the second one because it's a self-image: as an advocate for your rights based on your beliefs. I believe I've been doing this for 20 years and I know that people think sometimes they don't care about that all that much, that's not it?
