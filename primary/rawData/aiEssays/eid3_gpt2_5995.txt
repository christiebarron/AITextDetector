Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

For example: a cyclist might be sitting on narrow roads or a track that narrows considerably and they could pass a lot of road and then encounter a lot of bumps, trees, hills and other obstacles.

When the setting is relaxed, your cyclist will tend to see better conditions like the ones described under 'Rough Road Ahead' in more detailed maps, as well as on some of our latest weather and terrain maps.
