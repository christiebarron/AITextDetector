The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' will change. He said he took a number of photographs that were taken during what became his own "fantasy." Some of his subjects were played by actors playing the characters from his book.

In a statement released by his publisher, BAFTA, Souten claimed he was "deeply saddened" after having the book investigated by New York's investigative service and the New York Times.

It said: "Souten's own life was changed forever when he was exposed to the sexual exploitation of children, women and children in the public spotlight while he was in public life, and his book gave the public a glimpse into the deeply troubled life of an African-American.

"It is truly extraordinary for someone like BAFTA and The Intercept (to claim this book as an influence) to deny the human rights of so many of the so-called "little black boys."

"The real subject here is the subjectivity of the work Souten has written and the real subject it would be to examine his own lives as a young man and in any book or piece that he might write about his life as a teenager."
