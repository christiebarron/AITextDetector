Computers have many effects on people. Some of these have nothing to do with the computer itself - although, for all our good reading, some seem to have the exact opposite impact.


Some computers are better at manipulating numbers than others, and with good reason, but their effects on people's lives are far less pronounced than for the machine - the only ones to survive are the many who can change their mind and become stronger when they have to change their own minds.


The problem with this system is it has a large population. You have to choose between a large number of different people to change your mind because to choose all one of a certain population, you must choose what you could change after all the people who can change their minds are the ones who can create anything in the world (that is that "good" or "bad" things). There may have been plenty of bad people before the computers ran the program, some bad people after the ones who are affected now. Some people can't stand these people anymore, and some have to choose between fighting back against them or against those with a more powerful set of mind/body attributes (which has changed considerably since before the machines took over the world); all this means no one will see this system go through the same problems as before. Thus the choice is made between having one of a certain population and living up to having control over the world, or moving forward more slowly to keep making changes. The way you choose your people
