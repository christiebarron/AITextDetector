The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. After years of having to build an air-raid shelter during winter storm season, builders of the Empire State building were forced tohardt the city's underground structure to provide safety for workers. A contractor in May 1913 built a 1 ½-million-horsepower turbine with a 4,000-foot lift. Another contractor, at the time William E. Jackson, built a 4,000-foot lift near the city center, but the project cost $100,000, and Jackson was fired due to poor performance at the turbine. The contractor also had to build a safety valve on the bottom of the concrete slab at a third-story rate for hydraulic ventilation. This required the erection of a third-storey building in 1927. Construction continued for several times, from 1930 to 1938, and construction continued until 1945. The first such building was at Union Pacific and a few years later it was converted into a hospital for emergency physicians. Construction continued for nearly two years (1951-1960) until 1945. Two additional buildings — that of the Empire State Building and that of E.M. Witherspoon's Building on Fifth Avenue in the west courtyard, and that of the Central Bank Building in the northwest courtyard — were constructed in 1930. The second building had to be a large hospital, and then a more complex building at Eighth and Eighth Avenue. The new building was completed and the hospital opened in 1961
