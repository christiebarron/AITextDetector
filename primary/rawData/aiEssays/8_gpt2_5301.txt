One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was 14 years old when someone pointed a baseball ball against my face and I stopped it, I saw it and realized how small it was and felt very proud of myself.

This feeling of happiness and comfort is very contagious to anyone and even strangers. It's something everyone I know felt like when we stopped laughing, just as our children used to. But at the same time, many of us still laugh. And there's a way to put things in perspective that can help clarify a message.
