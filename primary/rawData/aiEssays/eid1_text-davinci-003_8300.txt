The development of the Empire State Building in New York City was a massive project, and one of the decisions that had to be made was whether or not to allow dirigibles to dock there. Even though it seemed like a simple decision, the builders faced numerous obstacles in accommodating this type of transportation.

The most pressing safety concern for builders of the Empire State Building was that the building was not prepared for the mooring of dirigibles. The building was simply not designed to secure a floating airship. It was much too tall and too slim to provide a stable mooring mast. One potential solution to this was to construct a separate, shorter mooring mast near the Empire State Building, but this came with further costs and delays.

Additionally, the wide, open atmosphere surrounding the building posed a unique safety issue. Although the mooring mast itself could have provided adequate security, the winds and turbulence caused by the nearby tallest buildings presented a potentially dangerous challenge for dirigibles. The builders had to consider whether the winds could become strong enough to rip the dirigibles away from the mast.

Along with the safety risks, the project was also faced with the legal considerations of accommodating dirigibles. Building an appropriate mooring mast for dirigibles was certain to raise numerous legal issues, including a possible dispute over ownership of the airspace where they would dock. The builders also had to consider whether dirigibles would be subject to the same
