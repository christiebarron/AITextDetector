The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because there is nothing there that seems to justify writing or drawing that many pages of the prose. The short story begins with something about a person who has lost his mother and the story closes with something quite compelling to our protagonist. Then comes a very, very dark story about the family of Mary Eileen. In the novel the characters are given a very interesting backstory. We don't meet the details of the stories that the characters are given until the very end of the book. There are some points in this story that are significant to the characters and it is because of this that I wrote this book:

This story is not a true story, it is an uninspired, a lie that makes us believe more and more that they haven't seen a family member for over 100 years. They can't see the real Mary, not even for the last 15 years. Calculator has revealed that he was not the last person to receive this knowledge, that the life of Mary would change for all time. His death was a suicide of a very tragic nature and he can be called a hero. Because the characters are told this is also just a lie; this is a lie that would be completely without the slightest merit in its own right. And then the story moves into more of a new direction so we get out to a place where we can be sure if we really feel that the story goes on as the reader expects.

How was this
