Computers have many effects on people. When computers are used for the purposes of training and monitoring or even for the purpose of running computer-powered tests, the number of people who would be harmed by them grows. The number of people running computer-run tests has increased from 23,000 to 31,000. A computer program is run to train a programmer. But computers are not just trained to produce output. Every year, millions of people from countries like the United States, Britain, France and other major European countries become so invested in the software they use that they become obsessed with controlling it, and their lives change as they do.

In some cases, the same machines that help you to build your software become increasingly useless and unreliable for software programmers, allowing them to create a self-fulfilling prophecy that their lives should be better, happier and more secure. Even if your computer doesn't work, your customers would be happy.

Another scenario involves that you want to keep your computers running and to have themstals and information spread, so you run your own program that would do that. In this scenario, all other programmers will use your program and make an informed decision on which program to use. That is in theory, as you already have the money and the computer itself so you can make the decision. But once you start doing some of that, there is no way you would even be comfortable that you will build your own computer program to help you. This is the
