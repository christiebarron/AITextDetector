The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' by British writer Stephen Fry explains how the novel took it to a new level.

In its first two volumes, the novel follows a group of friends who have just had a difficult relationship. As tensions escalate and a young girl is accused of having a miscarriage, a group of women from the village have to step in to stop the affair.

The book follows two women who come up against prejudice as they fight for rights after being attacked by a vicious mob.

Their struggle starts with them staying close to each other and being told they're not allowed in. Their struggles grow in intensity as they travel across the country each summer to help a refugee family of five get back their daughter, but the next couple are pushed back if they're caught together.

"There were women who used the book and I just kind of saw each other as an equal," Fry said.

At its core, 'From Home is' reflects a complex relationship between two young people who have faced prejudice and abuse in an attempt to find meaning, and it reflects one particular relationship between a group of people in this post-apocalyptic novel who are trying to understand one another after seeing what's going on in the world.

The book opens with a series of flashbacks where two women tell a story about how the novel came to be written and the first three issues take on a life of its own.
