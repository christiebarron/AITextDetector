I was recently in line at a grocery store when I noticed that the woman in front of me was having difficulty understanding the cashier's instructions for using the self-checkout machine. She seemed frustrated and was starting to get frustrated. However, before I could intervene to help, the cashier stepped in and asked the woman if she would like assistance. The woman asked for help, and the cashier patiently showed her how to use the machine.

I was amazed by how calm and patient the cashier remained. She explained the instructions step-by-step in a gentle voice. The woman eventually got the hang of it and thanked the cashier for her help. It was a great reminder to me how important it is to stay patient, even when we're feeling frustrated or overwhelmed.
