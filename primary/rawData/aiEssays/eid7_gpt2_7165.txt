An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when the person in my head had a cold. Someone who went to bed with his hands to his face came to my ear. He wasn't cold, maybe just cold. On the other hand, I took the time to watch my son, just before bed. He had a cold, and I noticed you weren't sitting, or didn't have anything, or hadn't thought you would hear through the pillow. He was sleeping on the floor, and what was he doing with himself? Something was wrong, he couldn't talk. He couldn't read, he couldn't see where the pillow was, nor was he aware of how to touch his son. To be honest, he wasn't scared of you, except for when I told him I was tired. I told him how he'd had to move out of bed. I wasn't afraid to get to him about stuff. That's how he would move forward. My son is not scared out of sleep though. He'll try again later as he was awake. A Patriarch, who's always been in love with his children, doesn't come home to sleep at night until the Patriarch says and I tell him things so he can understand. He wants his children to grow up to love their Heavenly Father. I think the Lord was too selfish to give his children as gifts. It won't happen for them right now.
