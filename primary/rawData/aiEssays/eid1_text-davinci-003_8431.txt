I was recently on vacation with my partner and we had a really tight schedule for the day. We had a lot of places to visit and only a few hours to do it in. We had already been on our feet for hours when we finally decided to take a break. 

We wanted to find a place to buy a souvenir, but every shop was so busy and crowded that it was nearly impossible to even move inside them. After trying several places, we eventually found a tiny store on a side street. 

The shopkeeper was so friendly and willing to help us find the perfect gift. Unfortunately, everything we wanted to buy was already sold out. We could see the shopkeeper was a bit flustered apologising profusely and explaining that they hadn't been expecting so many people that day.

Even though our time was running out, I was patient and tried to stay positive. I thanked the shopkeeper for their time, gave them a warm smile, and went on our way. It was a small gesture, but something that made us appreciate the shopkeeper's kind attitude even more. 

In the end, we were unable to buy a souvenir that day. However, I'm glad that, while we were dealing with a stressful situation, I was able to stay patient and kind. It's not always easy, but it's always worth it.
