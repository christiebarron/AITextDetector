I believe that censorship of materials in libraries and in public spaces is essential. It would be better to allow that to happen as widely as we've done for years now at major libraries.

You know, I think libraries do a good job of having a dialogue, especially as more people express their views through their stories — and I think the fact that a diverse community has such diverse voices is what's required to develop the kinds of dialogue that I admire from my students and from the community in general.

And you know, I think libraries work best where every person is able to share what they do, how much it can cost, and the level of their own opinions and how much it will cost to have this conversation with anyone who questions or shares this very important work.

It's a good job for my students to be able to share what they do, and not just some opinions that are deemed offensive — that are deemed objectionable by our audience. And I believe this should happen within the university community and in libraries. We're in a community right now where a wide variety of viewpoints can be expressed.
