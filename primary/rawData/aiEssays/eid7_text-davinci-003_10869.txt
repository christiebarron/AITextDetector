I remember it like it was yesterday. My daughter had been asking me all week if I could take her to the movies. But, I had been so busy with work that I had been putting it off. But on the Saturday she asked one more time, I finally said yes.

We got in the car and I started driving, but traffic was unusually slow. We had left with plenty of time, but it was taking us twice as long as it usually did to get there. My daughter was starting to get impatient. She was tapping her feet and asking why every light was taking so long.

I decided to take a deep breath and be patient. Instead of getting frustrated about the traffic, I turned up the music and tried to enjoy the drive. I even started talking to my daughter about her day and what she wanted to see at the movie theater. It took us twice as long as it normally did to get there, but we eventually made it - and in the end, we still had time to make it to the movie.

My daughter never forgot that experience. We laughed about it, and afterwards, she was always impressed with me for staying so patient. It wasn't easy to stay patient in the situation, but I knew it was important to model that behavior for her, and I'm glad I did.
