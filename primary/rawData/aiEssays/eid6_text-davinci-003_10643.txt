The building of the Empire State Building presented a unique challenge to its architects and engineers, that of allowing dirigibles to dock there. The very concept presented a myriad of obstacles that had to be overcome, from technical challenges to regulations and local laws. In “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, the gradual progress made towards achieving this ambitious dream is described in detail, along with all the obstacles that had to be faced and overcome in order for the Iconic building to become the first permanent dirigible landing site. 

The first obstacle faced was that of the existing regulations and laws in place at the time, which prohibited dirigibles from flying above the city. In order to allow them to dock, these laws had to be updated or changed. This process proved to be slow and arduous, with little initial progress being made due to strong opposition to the proposal. However, with the help of influential public figures and a demonstration of the potential safety benefits of such a project, it was eventually successful.

The technical aspect of this project was also a major obstacle. It was necessary to construct a mast, or tower, strong enough to withstand the weight of the dirigible as it docked and the sudden changes in wind speed. The mast also had to be properly equipped with lighting and communication radios, as well as the docks, or mooring mast, necessary for the airship to actually be able to dock and stay securely
