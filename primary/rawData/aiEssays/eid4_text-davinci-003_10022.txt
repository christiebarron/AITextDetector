The ending of the poem 'Winter Hibiscus' by Minfong Ho symbolizes the idea of resilience and hope in the face of adversity. The protagonist of the poem feels discouraged after taking and failing a test, so she decides to take it again in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return, and the hibiscus buds. This is meant to symbolize a new beginning, when the protagonist will be in a better state of mind to take the test again and hopefully pass. The image of the hibiscus blooming symbolizes the idea of a beautiful transformation taking place in the protagonist, who is given hope despite facing adversity.
