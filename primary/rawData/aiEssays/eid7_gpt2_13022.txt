An example of a time someone in my life was patient was an incredibly kind man from New Jersey who was having an affair with a beautiful woman in the West. I was there to help the man with an affair with the woman, and his face was smeared with blood as if he had become in love with her.

"I said, 'Don't worry about it; we'll let you know about it, but you have to be willing to say you love her and he'll give you back the money.' He told me, 'It was a matter of fact. Not because he said so.' And he said, 'It happened to have been a lot cheaper to marry that man because he had paid me for this.' And I said, 'Okay, fine, we'll discuss it later.'"

It just so happens that, at the time, a man wasn't living in New Jersey, so the police arrived immediately. A week later, he was arrested. Afterward, he started a new life in Los Angeles and started to live off of weed and that's when he met a great guy named Kevin Dolan.

"When we did the interview, I said, 'Hey, Kevin, I'm an artist,'" says Dolan. "'He's my friend,'" Dolan says. "I said, 'Are we dating now? What's going on?' He said, 'No, I just know I can do anything with him.'"
