I was out fishing with my best friend one summer day when I noticed a fish in the water. I made a silly face at it and shouted, "Hey, fishy!" Just then, my friend turned to me and said, "Do you really think that's gonna work?" 

Before I could reply, we both burst into laughter. We laughed so hard that we had to sit down in the boat and catch our breath. We hadn't realized that our little joke had been so hilarious! 

After our laughter subsided, we looked out at the horizon and just enjoyed being out on the water. That moment of laughter and camaraderie has stuck with us ever since. It reminded us both that even in the small, silly moments, we could find joy and connection with each other.
