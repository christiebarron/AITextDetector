I was on a flight home from visiting my family halfway across the country. I had had a wonderful visit and was looking forward to returning home. I had been seated by the window and was happily gazing out at the clouds, when suddenly I became aware that a pair of eyes were fixed upon me from the seat adjacent to mine. I slowly turned to meet the gaze of a middle-aged woman wearing a bright pink sweater. She was beaming at me with such an infectious smile that I couldn’t help but return it. We exchanged pleasantries and then began talking about our respective families and the places we had just visited.

Eventually our conversation drifted to some of the hilarious adventures we’d been through, and we began to really get to know each other. At one point the lady started talking about a particularly embarrassing incident that had happened to her. We started giggling at her story, until we were both howling with laughter. We laughed so hard that we almost forgot we were on a plane!

We continued talking for the remainder of the flight, even after we had long since finished laughing about the lady’s funny story. By the end of the flight, I felt as though I had known her for years! It was then I realized how powerful laughter truly is—it had created a connection between two strangers in the time it took to travel home.
