Dear Editor,

As technology has advanced over the years, computers have become a commonly used tool in our lives. But at what cost? While computers provide people with innumerable benefits, these same devices can also have a negative impact on our physical and mental health.

From a physical perspective, people suffer from issues such as poor eyesight, chronic back and neck pain, and obesity due to long hours of sitting in front of a computer. Furthermore, the risk of development of diseases such as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome and Computer Vision Syndrome is significantly higher with extensive computer usage.

Mentally, computers can be extremely addictive and lead to a lack of physical interaction, concentration difficulties, and reduced imagination. People can develop an unhealthy dependence on the internet, leading to them spending hours glued to the computer even at the detriment of important activities. They can also become alienated from those around them and miss out on important social experiences due to their reliance on technology as a communication platform.

In conclusion, while computers provide great convenience and access to knowledge, we must also be aware of the potential damage they can do to both our physical and mental health. It is important to be mindful of excessive computer usage and its repercussions.
