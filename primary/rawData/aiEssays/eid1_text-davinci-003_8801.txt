I remember being in college and having a really tough day. The assignments were piling up and there was a ton of stress weighing me down. So, my roommate and I decided to have a much needed break and watch a funny movie. We both laughed so much that our eyes were filling up with tears . After the movie ended, we both just sat there for a minute in total silence, smiling and shaking our heads at how ridiculous and hilarious the movie was.

Suddenly, I started laughing so hard that I almost couldn't breathe. My roommate had the same reaction, and before I knew it, we were both practically rolling on the floor â€“ laughing our hearts out. It felt like the best way to relieve my stress and the tension that had built up after a difficult day, and it only made our friendship even stronger.

This moment of laughter is something I'll never forget, and it always puts a smile on my face whenever I think of it.
