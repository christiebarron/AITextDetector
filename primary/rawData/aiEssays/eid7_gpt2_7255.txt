An example of a time someone in my life was patient was before or after a drug overdose. I was working on my career and I was on vacation when they took me to the hospital. That's what happened but a few weeks later there were kids coming home from school. One of them gave birth, and that's when I saw my husband, I got up and left and I ran off on my own. So it made me even more afraid. I got on the bed and started screaming at them. I didn't understand. I felt like I was bleeding out, like I was going to bleed out. One of them, the nurse, was taking my heart out and trying to get it replaced. She was in tears. We came to the hospital and it took them 12 to 16 hours to replace the replacement card because I was still on the bed.

I was thinking, "I'd never work here without having my heart broken." I didn't have much. I was so scared. By the time I woke up in the middle of the day, my whole heart was pounding on my chest and it kept on pounding until I couldn't stay alive.

I never had any experience of getting more of the medication and it was only when I took it to the hospital that I realized they took medication for life-threatening problems.

Now that they've done the job for me, I take it. They don't let me go to the ER or even go to
