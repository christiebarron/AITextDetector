Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. The most important being that any attempt to reach the designated spot will result in an injury or fatal injury. The 'Trouble Zone' is the most common area that gets most attention and is a significant source of potential danger to pedestrians, cyclists and pedestrians in the general public. A person trying to reach the 'Trouble Zone' on the way to work or school or on the roads can experience an impact in 'Road Work' (RWD).

The Trouble Zone is typically used by people who have had their bike taken out by someone on the same street. A cyclist trying to reach the 'Trouble Zone' by going through a heavy traffic (especially an approaching traffic lane) can targets their bicycle just outside the Trouble Zone area. A person trying to reach the 'Trouble Zone' would get into a fight with a parked bike, or get into a fight with a person who was in another group outside the Trouble Zone (also known as group A) without the help of a friend or group member.
