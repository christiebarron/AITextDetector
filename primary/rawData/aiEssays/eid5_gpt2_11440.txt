The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' — a biography of the "great American family" — is a tribute to former president Jimmy Carter and his son Ronald Reagan's vision of America and a statement about the country's role as a "good man of many people", as well as to Ronald Reagan's words regarding the Vietnam War.
