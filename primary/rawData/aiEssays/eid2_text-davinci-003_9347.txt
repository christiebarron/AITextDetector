As an avid reader and library user, I would like to offer my opinion on the contentious opinion of censorship in libraries. In a world that is becoming increasingly more digital, there still remains a need for libraries. Libraries provide valuable resources to a community, allowing individuals access to a wide-range of materials, including books, music, movies and magazines. 

I believe that libraries should not entirely remove offensive material from their shelves, but rather modify their approach to content acquisition. Although certain materials may be deemed offensive by certain readers, there is still value to the informational and educational content provided by these books, magazines, and movies. The availability of such materials can foster intelligent dialogue and encourages readers to challenge their own beliefs and perspectives. 

Libraries can still play a role in protecting a communityâ€™s sensitivity by providing content warnings for certain materials. Allowing readers to make their own decisions based on their own criteria is far more effective than prohibiting access to certain materials altogether. This approach still gives a sense of protection and comfort to those who appreciate such warnings without completely blocking access. 

I would suggest that libraries offer an open dialogue among the library staff, patrons, and community members to discuss the materials available, and to create a welcoming environment where controversial topics and opinions can be understood and respected. Taking this approach can create an atmosphere in which censorship does not exist, but instead provides a platform where readers can engage in meaningful conversations about different perspectives.
