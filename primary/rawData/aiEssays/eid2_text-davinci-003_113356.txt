It is generally agreed that censorship in libraries is a highly controversial topic. Some people believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. I disagree. 

For starters, libraries represent the diverse views of our culture. They provide access to a variety of books, materials, and resources that reflect this diversity. The right to access information should be respected. Censorship, specifically the removal of literature, infringes on the right to freedom of expression. It limits the opportunity to explore and discover new ideas and challenges. 

In addition, censorship can be ineffective. It is impossible to control access to certain information and it only serves to push those who wish to explore such materials further underground. If materials are removed, it does not mean those who want to debate and discuss these topics will no longer seek them out. 

Libraries need to have a credible system in place that effectively manages the access and use of materials deemed offensive. This could include restricting access to minors, providing parents with a warning about explicit content, and providing alternatives for those who find certain materials objectionable. 

We should strive to create an environment in libraries that encourages free and open access to information and encourages exploration of new ideas. We should also be mindful of the fact that certain materials, while deemed offensive, can foster meaningful dialogue and create a more informed society. Censorship is not the answer.
