The construction of the Empire State Building posed numerous unique challenges in allowing dirigibles to dock. When the Empire State Building was completed in 1931, it was the world’s tallest building and the era of passenger air travel had only just dawned. In order to capitalize on the growing popularity of air travel, the building’s owners proposed a mooring mast at the top of the building for blimps to use as a port for docking.

The project was technically difficult and had never been attempted before. Designers needed to reinforce the steel frame of the building and install lightweight mooring cables sturdy enough to hold a large airship. They had to carefully calculate how to maneuver a dirigible safely into the building’s small airspace. The mast had to be lightweight yet strong enough to withstand New York’s strong winds and prevent the airships from crashing into the building upon docking. Because no one had any experience with mooring large airships, it was unprecedented territory and the design was not without its problems.

The engineers initially had issues with the material they chose for the mooring mast. Lightweight steel was used, creating flexing and stress that was amplified in high altitude wind conditions. Adding a platform to the top of the mast proved ineffective, as it only increased the risk of the mast toppling over due to its shifting weight. Engineers also had to contend with the building swaying and the uneven distribution of the
