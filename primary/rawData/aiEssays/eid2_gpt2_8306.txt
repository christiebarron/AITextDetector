I believe that censorship of materials in libraries by government has been greatly reduced," said Lee Kwon-Yang, the coordinator of the National Council on Library Technology Policy and Communications, at a press conference in New York City on Wednesday.

"The censorship apparatus is based on ignorance, on ignorance of the issues of content management and censorship," he added, adding, "Today's events demonstrate how these concepts fail to take into account the needs of government."

Last week, the National Public Radio said that more than half of all websites in its online community were "under siege" in China by censors. These include the top-rated news and media network, the state-run newspaper and the government-owned media watchdog, the People's Liberation Army Radio.
