In recent years, censorship in libraries has become a more heated debate as more people become vocal in their opinions of what should be accessible to library users. In most cases, the decision lies with the library directors and the board members to determine which books, movies, magazines, and music should be removed from the shelves if they are found to contain offensive material.

There are two sides to this discussion; to censor or not to censor. On one hand, censoring certain materials can help avoid exposing library users, especially young children, to inappropriate content and can help protect them. Furthermore, libraries should be a place of respect and a safe space, where people of all ages and backgrounds can come and find something that fits their interests. Censorship can play a role in preserving that environment.

On the other hand, some argue censorship is a form of oppression that prevents some users from accessing the content they wish to find. This would limit freedom of thought and expression by denying people access to information that could be thought-provoking or educational.

In my opinion the answer lies somewhere in the middle. Libraries should of course practice a certain degree of censorship in order to maintain order and preserve the values of library users, but they should also practice transparency and allow for library users to make up their own minds on material they find. Books, music, movies, and magazines that are potentially viewed as offensive should not be removed from library shelves but should have clear warning labels attached to
