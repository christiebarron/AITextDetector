Censorship in libraries has become a heated debate over the past few years. As librarians are in charge of deciding which materials should be made available to patrons, opinions on the matter can vary greatly. Is it ever appropriate to remove materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines from the shelves if they are found offensive? In my view, such action should not be taken lightly.

At its core, censorship in libraries is an issue of freedom of speech. Libraries are one of the few places in our society where we can still access information without fear of persecution. To allow books, music, movies, and magazines to be removed from the shelf because they are considered offensive is to limit the freedom of patrons to explore, challenge, and debate differing opinions.
