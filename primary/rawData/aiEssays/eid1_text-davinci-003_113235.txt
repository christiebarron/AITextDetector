As a community, we have all been aware of the increasing prevalence of computers in our everyday lives. While many have heralded them as a valuable resource, I strongly believe that the effects computers have on our society have been both profound and under appreciated. 

Firstly, due to the integration of computers in the workplace, we have seen a rapid increase in productivity. People no longer need to waste countless hours on manual labor and are able to devote their time to higher-level tasks with the help of computers. This has resulted in businesses becoming more efficient, creating more jobs, and providing better wages and benefits. 

In addition, computers have also helped to bridge the digital gap. In this day and age, it is almost unavoidable that we interact with computers on a daily basis. We are all able to take advantage of the many online tools to stay connected, regardless of how much access or resources are available. This has enabled us to form great online communities and digital networks, allowing us to easily share resources, ideas, and goods across the world. 

Finally, computers have also helped to reduce the amount of environmental damage. We use less paper and are able to reduce our waste. In addition to that, computers use less energy and we are able to become more aware of our resource consumption, which helps us make more conscious decisions. 

To conclude, I'd like to suggest that we recognize the beneficial effects computers have had
