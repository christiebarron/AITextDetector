The first was a shortage of space and the second was what became known as the "Fiat Triangle" problem: that when a piece of junk is too big and too small for the pilot to see, he cannot fly. The problem was also solved by an easy design that included a double decked platform designed and sold from scratch. Another challenge was the fact that many pilots could see the thing at one time.


The original plan for the Empire State Building

The original plan for the building was given to the Planning Department in August 1947 by George C. Lee (b. 1789-1849) according to a letter to Henry F.

The initial plan consisted of designing an enlarged space hangar, a small theater, an opening for a public gallery, and a central storage bay on top of the building. It was found that construction, in the form of the massive construction project "Hankins'" could not work without the additional space needed for a mainframe, elevator, air-conditioner, and a decked elevator.
