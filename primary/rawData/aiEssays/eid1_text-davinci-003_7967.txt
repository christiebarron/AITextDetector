The memoir "From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives" by Narciso Rodriguez is a heartfelt account of coming of age as one of the first Hispanic-American fashion designers. The author’s memoir is a rich exploration of the multifaceted landscape of the immigrant experience with stories that are both personal and powerful.

The memoir captures a range of emotions from feelings of excitement, joy, confusion and even shame. Rodriguez is skillful in crafting a mood through his descriptions of his growing up in New Jersey. He speaks of his teenage years with a certain fondness and nostalgia, which is drenched with bittersweet undertones of what it was like to live without real roots, surrounded by people who weren’t like him. This sense of “otherness” is poignantly illustrated, creating an atmosphere of profound loneliness but also a joy of discovering culture and creativity that shaped his growth as a person.

The author is also passionate about his exploration of formative years and the act of homecoming. His recollections of family gatherings are particularly vivid and bring forth a strong sense of identity that stems from their shared cultural and personal bonds. The memoir is a powerful love letter from Rodriguez to his homeland and his people, one that is infused with a deep sentimentality. 

The mood in the memoir is intimate and grounding. It captures the experiences that led to the author’s sense of belonging and his pursuit to feel at home.
