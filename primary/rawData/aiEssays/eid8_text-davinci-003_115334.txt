It was one of the warmest summer nights I can remember. I had just finished dinner with my girlfriend, Sam, and we were out walking together to enjoy the weather. We weren't talking very much, simply enjoying each other's company in companionable silence. 

Suddenly, something caught our eye. There was a woman walking two huge dogs ahead of us, and one of them had taken a liking to a light pole. Every time the woman and her other dog moved past it, the mischievous one would circle back and ‘hug’ the pole with its front paws. We watched in amused disbelief as this happened for probably the fifth time, and then something else happened. 

We both started to laugh. It was soft at first, but then it grew louder, until we were both doubled over with laughter. We noticed other passersby looking at us in confusion, but we didn’t care. We were in a shared moment of joy, and that connection could never be broken. 

The laughter slowly died down, and we continued our journey. But to this day, when we talk of that summer night, that laughter still dances between us.
