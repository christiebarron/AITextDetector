The idea of allowing dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building was a daring endeavor. Even before its official opening on May 1, 1931, the building was already being seen as a symbol of engineering prowess. As the first skyscraper in the world to be equipped with mooring masts, its invite for airships to dock was unprecedented. Although dirigibles, or airships, provided groundbreaking travel options, attempting to dock them at the Empire State Building was risky.

The first issue with the mooring mast was that it was incredibly small, with a diameter of just two feet. While an aircraft carrier mast consists of a forty-foot radius, the Empire State Buildingâ€™s mast was only a small fraction of that size. This small size made it difficult to guarantee the safety of docking a dirigible. The mast only had enough room for the airship to be secured vertically, which was not the natural landing position for any dirigible. As a result, it was uncertain how a dirigible could land safely and securely. 

The second obstacle to docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building was the difficulty in controlling them. While dirigibles are incredibly large, compared to most other aircraft, they can also be incredibly cumbersome to turn and control. They are sensitive to changes in the weather and the wind, and require masterful piloting skills to dock safely. Without the right kind of training, it was difficult to ensure that a
