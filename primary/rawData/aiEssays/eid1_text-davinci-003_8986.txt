Dear Editor, 

I am writing in regard to the effects computers have on people. It is my opinion that computers have had a positive impact on our lives by providing great educational and recreational opportunities, as well as allowing us to stay connected with our loved ones and to access a vast amount of information.

First of all, due to computers, we can now access educational opportunities that were previously unavailable. There are numerous courses and tutorials available online that anyone can take advantage of. Thus, computers equip us with the knowledge and skills that are needed for success in our continuously evolving digital world.

Moreover, computers provide us with many forms of entertainment, such as gaming websites and streaming services. This not only makes us more productive by helping us relax and destress, but it also allows us to interact with people all around the world and to discover new cultures. 

Lastly, computers provide us with the ability to stay connected with our loved ones. We are no longer confined to make expensive long-distance calls. Instead, we can now instantly talk to and see our family and friends with just the push of a button.

To conclude, computers bring about evolution and progress in our world without a doubt. This is why I urge everyone to see the value in computers and to recognize the positive effects they have on us.

Sincerely,
