I remember the time that I was the most patient. I was at the store, picking out groceries for my family. It was a Friday night, and the store was crowded. The line was long, and the cashier was going at a snail's pace. People in line started complaining, but I just stayed calm and asked the people around me how their day was going. 

A few people started talking about how long the line was and how little the cashier was doing. I just ignored them, smiled, and patiently waited my turn. Finally, when it was my turn, the cashier made a mistake and needed to start over. Instead of getting frustrated, I just took a deep breath and waited patiently for him to finish.

By the time my groceries were put away and I was ready to leave the store, all of the people who had been in the line ahead of me already left. It was a moment of satisfaction for me because I was the most patient one in the line.
