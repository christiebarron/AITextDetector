The Empire State Building was one of the first structures to be built to accommodate air transportation, specifically the docking of dirigibles. This unique feature was met with a number of obstacles along the way, from design elements to safety considerations. In Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s The Mooring Mast, she describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock.

Before the Empire State Building was even built, a number of considerations had to be taken due to the size and shape of dirigibles. The design of the building had to incorporate an incredibly strong anchors, which could secure a dirigible that was far larger and heavier than most other ships. Additionally, it had to be built high enough off the ground to make space for the tethering system and the landing of the aircraft. 

The Empire State Building also had to face the challenge of clearing an acceptable safety zone for docking and landing. Since dirigibles were massive and slow-moving vehicles, they needed ample room to safely maneuver. With the large crowds and buildings that dominated the New York City skyline, a dedicated safety area had to be crafted for the dirigibles to land without fear of colliding with buildings or scaring off pedestrians.

Because of the practical concerns surrounding dirigible docks, the design of the mast—which was the main structural element of the building—had to be heavily considered as to constantly be able to accommodate the changing
