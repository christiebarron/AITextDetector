Dear Editor,

It is no doubt that computers have had a profound effect on modern society. There are many positive elements, such as increased efficiency in the workplace, access to information, and the ability to keep in contact with people beyond geographical boundaries. However, I believe there are some negative repercussions that cannot be discounted.

The increased prevalence of computers has had a detrimental effect on our physical and mental health. Posture-related health problems are increasing due to the long hours many people are spending in front of a computer screen. Mental health problems are also being exacerbated by regular exposure to computers and their associated online environments. Research shows that there is a link between time spent online and an increased risk of anxiety and depression. This indicates that reliance on these advanced technologies can have serious consequences for our wellbeing.

In addition, computers can contribute to a sense of isolation and disconnection from the physical world, potentially damaging our social lives. We have become increasingly reliant on computers to manage our lives, which means that many of us do not perform day-to-day tasks which used to provide interaction and human contact, such as going to the bank or post office. This can further influence feelings of displacement, creating a less meaningful life for those heavily reliant on technology.

I urge your readers to consider the potential risks computer use can have on a personâ€™s mental and physical health, and our collective social life. It is important that computers are used in a mindful way
