Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, is a heartfelt glimpse into his life story and how the events of each moment shaped and changed him. The memoir creates a feeling of nostalgia and longing, a type of melancholic wistfulness for the past and seeking of inner peace in the present. This is achieved through the themes of home, identity and family presented throughout the book.

The memoir starts with Rodriguez remembering his childhood home in his native Cuba, and how his family was forced to flee the country to escape political oppression. This powerful introduction conjures a feeling of longing for a former way of life and a longing for a permanent place of home, as Rodriguez and his family had to constantly move throughout his childhood. 

Throughout the memoir, Rodriguez writes about his enduring search for his identity, to find where he truly belongs in life. This creates a sense of alienation and introspection, as he contemplates his future and his place in life.

The memoir also reflects on the importance of family and how his familial relations have profoundly shaped who he is today. His loving memories of his family bring to mind memories of happy times in his life, which create a feeling of warmth and contentment.

Towards the end of the memoir, Rodriguez speaks of having found a type of peace and fulfillment in his life. This sentiment of inner peace is both reflective and hopeful, creating a feeling of optimism and possibility.
