The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One of those was the decision Aden had made on his second attempt to build a dirigible at the New Orleans Industrial Park, just outside of New Orleans.

In the late 1940s, the building's twin towers were nearing collapse, and Aden decided to design a bridge to be built between them – possibly to allow cars and bicycles to cross for an instant. The idea was to use the tower as a stage for a massive aerial shot of the Empire State Building to demonstrate what these objects could look like.

It was an extraordinary idea at the time, and Aden wasn't alone in seeking to recreate the tower. American architect Thomas Edison had already worked with a private group to construct the second-story structure, which once stood at the end of the New Orleans Canal, from the same heights we did back Dems and the USMC.

In May 1954, an Air Force surveyor of his design team visited the top of the second-story, and was astonished to find it was still standing. On that night, however, an airman spotted the huge structure and alerted the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which ordered the building to be removed. Within 30 nights of this occurrence, the Twin Towers of the world are still standing in traffic.

What would the Empire State Buildings be like today?
