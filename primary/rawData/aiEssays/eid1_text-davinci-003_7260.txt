The setting of “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski is a winding, rural mountain road, intersected by numerous deep gullies and ravines, and perhaps most defining, by an especially hazardous bridge. The setting puts the cyclist, who is on an itinerant journey, in immediate danger both from the surroundings and the unfamiliarity of the terrain. 

The winding nature of the mountain road suggests a constant risk of going off the edge. Whether the cyclist is distracted by the scenery or not, the potential for crashing is a serious concern. The cyclist is also isolated from help should any trouble arise, creating an even more perilous situation for him.

The numerous deep gullies and ravines create further risk of a hazardous fall. The cyclist must traverse these gaps with the utmost care, knowing that any incorrect timing or disregard for the road’s condition can easily result in going tumbling down. Additionally, the immediacy of each gap and the fact that the cyclist has to jump over them suggest that he is not well-experienced with such terrain and is thus poorly-equipped to traverse it.

Most undeniably, the hazardous bridge is the pinnacle of danger in the cyclist’s journey. A single misstep on the bridge can result in a catastrophic fall, reminding the cyclist of the importance of caution and awareness. 

Overall, the setting of “Rough Road Ahead” truly sets the stage for the dangers
