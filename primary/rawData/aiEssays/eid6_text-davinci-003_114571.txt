 

The idea to add a docking station for airships onto the Empire State Building is nothing short of incredible, boggling the minds of engineers and architects alike. From the moment the concept was put forward, numerous obstacles stood in the way of putting the plan into motion. Despite this, an ambitious group of engineers managed to build the mooring mast—a tower allowing zeppelins to dock onto the top of the Empire State Building—and created a work of captivating technological wonder. 

The many obstacles the engineers faced initiallly included opposition from the Civil Aeronautics Authority about the mooring mast. The authority was interested in the idea of an airship docking station but did not wish to approve anything that would decrease the safety of the other passengers in the Empire State Building. As such, the engineers had to ensure the mooring mast was able to minimize the risk of damage to the surrounding area. Additionally, the mast’s structural integrity had to be certified by the CAA in order to ensure it would be safe for passengers of passenger airships that were not familiar with the Empire State Building. 

Besides the bureaucratic obstacles, there were also engineering difficulties. To make the mast stable enough to withstand the stress associated with mooring a dirigible, additional attempts at steel reinforcing were necessary. In order to do this, engineers had to fit between 2,500 and 3,000 feet of cable into a 2×3-foot
