I was walking down the sidewalk when I saw her through the window of a cafe. She seemed out of place sitting by herself, so I instinctively decided to walk in and join her.

We chatted and soon I learned that she had just moved to town recently and didn't know anyone. I shared my own story with her, and we slowly felt more comfortable with each other. 

In spite of the initial hesitation, we began to laugh about the ridiculousness of life and enjoyed the casual banter. When the moment was perfect, I teased her by making fun of her secret guilty pleasure of a TV show. This amused her and we exchanged bemused glances. 

The laughter was contagious as it kept building up until we were both doubled over in our chairs. We laughed away most of the afternoon, and when it was time to leave, I realized I'd found a friend. 

That day, laughter was the bridge that connected us two strangers, and it surely won't be the last time it does.
