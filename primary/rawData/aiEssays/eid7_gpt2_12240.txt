An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my sister," her mother told The Times of London. "When she first got sick, she was a frail teenager who couldn't walk. She had just three-quarters of her body weight – only one inch thick. Her whole brain was missing.

I couldn't stop worrying that my sister was in an asylum – but I couldn't understand how it could happen to a young lady."

Sara and Chris, 24, and their friend Emily, 20, have both recently moved into the London area under a new home without their father.

"The most terrifying thing is that we had a child and our father had moved us from our home in Kent to the next house we'd bought," said Chris. "So we wanted to take advantage of those benefits.

"I could sense the power that the people [around us] gave us, but I was afraid of all the abuse, so it wasn't enough.

"I started paying back student loans and working as a taxi driver before I was admitted to hospital.

"I couldn't afford the medical bills – which wasn't enough to last two months. But I got paid back, and my sister's health was great.

"We got to the hospital within five days and couldn't get anything done.

"This made us very sad. It felt like it was her fault that she could only live so long.
