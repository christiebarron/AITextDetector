In 'Rough Road Ahead' by Joe Kurmaski, the features of the setting affect the cyclist's path in a variety of ways. 

The first feature of the setting that affects the cyclist is the somewhat mountainous terrain, which makes the ride physically more difficult and challenging. As the cyclist climbs over the mountains, he has to expend a great deal of energy, making the journey more mental and physical taxing. This is further compounded by the scorching sun rays, which are intensified due to the lack of shade in the area. As a result, the cyclist has to constantly battle the heat and rough terrain, making the ride physically strenuous and mentally exhausting. 

The second feature of the setting that affects the cyclist is the lack of traffic. As the cyclist passes through the barren terrain, he finds himself uninterrupted and alone with his thoughts. The loneliness and isolation of the setting also bring on a sense of apprehension, as the cyclist is fearful of what might lie ahead on the lonely road. This further affects his mental and physical state, as the fear and exhaustion begin to weigh down on him. 

Finally, the lack of human contact is another feature of the setting that affects the cyclist. The cyclist has to travel for long periods of time without any interaction with other people, furthering the sense of loneliness and fear. This further wears down his mental and physical strength, as he is constantly struggling against his feelings of isolation and fear.
