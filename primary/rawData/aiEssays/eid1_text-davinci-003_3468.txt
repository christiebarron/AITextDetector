Dear Editor,

I am writing to outline my opinion on the effects computers have on people in today's society. It is my belief that the use of computers has not only helped society in numerous ways, but has also had certain detrimental effects.

To begin, computers and the internet have opened up opportunities for computer users that were unimaginable in the past. For example, there is virtually unlimited knowledge at our fingertips. People can now learn about virtually any topic from the comfort and convenience of their computer. Additionally, many businesses now rely heavily on computers and the internet for both communication and data tracking. 

On the other hand, computers can also have negative effects. For example, too much screen time can be damaging to one's physical and mental health. As people spend more time in front of a computer, they are exposed to more blue light which can disrupt sleep. Furthermore, people can feel isolated if they spend too much time alone in front of a computer. 

In conclusion, it is clear that both positive and negative effects arise from the use of computers. We should all be mindful to use healthy limits when it comes to computer time. It is important to recognize the positive contributions that computers make to modern society
