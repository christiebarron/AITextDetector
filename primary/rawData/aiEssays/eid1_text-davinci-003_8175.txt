The Empire State Building was built in 1931, with a dream of one day allowing dirigibles to dock there. But before the dream of having airships dock could become a reality, the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome many obstacles. 

The first challenge the builders faced was the design of the Empire State Building, which was completed before airships became commonplace. As a result, the original plan lacked the necessary features making docking a dirigible safe and feasible. To modify the building to the needs required to accommodate a dirigible, additional features had to be added to the structure. The addition of the mooring mast, located on the six-hundredth floor, was necessary for the docking of the dirigible and added to the existing height of the building, which already stood at 1,250 feet tall.

The mooring mast, which stands at sixty-five feet tall, was designed specifically to accommodate dirigibles. To ensure the safety of the incoming dirigibles, the mast had to be equipped with multiple levels of safety mechanisms, including guiding cables, a system of pulleys, buffers, and trailers. The mast could accommodate a single dirigible at a time, as it was located in the same place as a single elevator within the building. The mast helped to ensure the space was not overcrowded and also enabled workers to secure the airship onto the mast in a controlled manner.

Apart from the technical challenges,
