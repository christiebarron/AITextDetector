The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because there are ways in and out of all of this that are truly amazing. It's a wonderful treat to read through from the beginning of the novel to the end. The second half of each chapter opens with the beginning of the story, and there is a big battle between the two factions at the beginning of the story. The first chapter is focused on battle against a group of bandits who have raided their encampment. For this chapter, each of the two parties is led by a boy named John, and in each of the main chapters, you will fight a bandit who is not John. He is one of their main fighters, and not only did they fight a bandit for years, he was even forced to abandon his life. The second and third chapters of the book give you further and much smaller battles, but I'll give you a more complete understanding of where this story will go later on in the book. We will be focusing mostly on how the bandit fights. The fight is going to be quite short when it comes to the chapters that do not start in chronological order. I would recommend you read the chapter at the beginning of each chapter, since it has the power to change from one to the next. These chapters, if you're a seasoned veteran, will give you much more understanding, if you just read through through the first half of each chapter and are comfortable reading the next half.
