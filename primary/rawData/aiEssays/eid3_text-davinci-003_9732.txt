In the poem “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, the cyclist is presented as a rider who is trying to make his way up a difficult terrain. The features of the setting that affect the cyclist in this poem are the road, the sun, and the wind. 

To begin with, the road the cyclist is trying to traverse is rough. He is unable to ride in a straight line, as “he keeps bouncing and swaying,” and the road itself is “rock hard.” This difficult terrain forces the cyclist to continuously adjust his course, making it harder for him to progress. 

Additionally, the hot sun is described as “blazing,” and the cyclist begins to feel “the burn in his legs.” The heat is clearly making the cyclist tired and reducing his energy reserves. Not only does the burning sun sap his strength, but it also prevents him from seeing far ahead - something that could be beneficial in the difficult terrain. 

The final feature of the setting that affects the cyclist is the wind. Despite his best efforts, the wind attempts to “slap him and shove him” off course. Much like the features of the road, this makes the cyclist’s journey more difficult as he has to fight against the wind as well as the terrain.
