An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was 18. When I was 19 I went on a six hour train ride. It was a great experience.

Then I got out of school and I realized I didn't want to do anymore things at the school. I went back into work and that's when I wanted to start a family. A lot of other people wanted this family.

When the decision to switch jobs came, the family was with me.

When my mother was not available or I was not able to go on a day's shift, my younger brother and I went on a week's and I was able to take care of his mother and stepfather for about five years.

That's about it.

So now, when I am working in the private sector, doing stuff that's not as glamorous, it's a matter of money to pay off our bills.

One day I have to leave a job, so I look around the office to go up and buy the car. When I go to buy my first car, I pay the $700 rent from my parent's house and I'm getting out before the rent bill begins.

That's how I repay the loans that were already paid on time. I don't owe anything on the car, it just gets left on the roads.

I am so grateful that it is, I wouldn't owe it to anyone else.
