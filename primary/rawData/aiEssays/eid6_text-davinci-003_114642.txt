The Empire State Building is one of the most iconic structures in the world, and much of its fame is related to its daring architecture incorporating the ability to moor dirigibles. Not only was the construction of the building itself an impressive feat, but there were a number of obstacles standing in the way of allowing dirigibles to dock safely. This essay will discuss the challenges and obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome in order for the building to accommodate dirigibles.

The first obstacle was the process of fitting the Empire State Building with a mooring mast. When the building was first proposed in 1929, the concept of docking dirigibles was a relatively new one, and the complex engineering requirements called for a solution that had never before been attempted. To make matters worse, the mooring mast needed to be built on a moving structure - the Empire State Building - that was still under construction, making the project all the more complicated. The architects had to devise a way to securely attach the mooring mast to the building while allowing for the movement generated by the wind on such a tall structure.

Another challenge facing the builders of the Empire State Building was the need to create the high-pressure, low-altitude harbor that was ideal for dirigible docking. To achieve this, the Empire State Building's foundation had to be enlarged and reinforced to accommodate the weight of the mooring mast as well as the additional loads associated with
