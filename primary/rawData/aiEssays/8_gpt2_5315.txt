One time I experienced laughter in my life was when a lady walked by a shoplifting shop and pointed her in the direction of a bottle. Her laugh was priceless!" says Veda and others.

This kind of joke is considered an absolute must-have by some, especially women.

"These women will be amazed," says Veda. "I can't say I've experienced laughter even once with a woman like you. It is also highly appreciated. If you do laugh with a man, you won't forget."

Veda says that she had an experience where a woman from Pakistan stood and looked at her in front of her door and asked him if she had ever laughed as a man.

"You're not getting any respect from men," says Veda.

"You're not the kind of guy, who might say, 'I don't really care what you think,' and you will be dismissed," says Veda.

Veda has also heard the story of the young man standing up front of these women: "He is about to make his first dance at a dance studio. Just like she gave a dance at your office, he will go to your store and collect those bottles and throw that bottle under the table.

"You will be asked what in the world happened to us in that moment," says Veda.

These stories are important for men and especially women in the US.

It is highly appreciated
