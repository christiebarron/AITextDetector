The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it includes a detailed summary of the history of the first frost and how its life has occurred for all time.

The novel also goes on to include a brief introduction by the author and the fact that the original Frost's family was in exile in Africa during the reign of Constantine.

It also goes on to address how the original Frost's life was changed over time due to some very small details included in the book, for example, that the two frost kings of Armenia and Bithynia were not alive at the time. This may be the case and it's important that it has been written as well as possible to emphasize this point and that the history is still going on.

It also brings up another point: the original frost could not have been completely destroyed, but rather if it had been, it would have become a different form of frost, more like a white frost which was also known as a dark dark. This dark, not to mention a type of dark winter cold that was used in many medieval and Roman cultures by some people to cause frost in a way that is not usually seen today.

The last part of our review focused exclusively on the historical background behind the word "Winter Hibiscus" for the title and to some extent on how this is written and done. It was probably one of the more interesting readings of our time and the book is well worth the hard work.
