 

I remember back to a time when I was a young child and my parents had recently gone through a divorce. As a result, I found that I often had to alternate weeks at both parents houses. During the transition of moving between homes I tied to stay positive but there were moments that I struggled. One night I found myself particularly irritated. I had stayed at my mom's house for the week and was getting ready to head back to my dad's. I was having trouble packing my things away and in frustration I started throwing all my belongings haphazardly into my suitcase. 

My mom noticed my distress and instead of scolding me, she encouraged me to take a break. She told me to take a few deep breaths and she gave me a hug. I quickly realized in that moment that my mom was being patient. She could have gotten angry with me, instead she took the time to empathize with my difficult situation. Her understanding gave me the patience and strength to calmly finish packing my things. 

I will never forget that moment. It taught me that while difficult times can be frustrating, we have to be patient and tolerant with ourselves and with those around us.
