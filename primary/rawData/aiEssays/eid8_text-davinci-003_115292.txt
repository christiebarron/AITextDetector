I remember when I first met my partner. We had a mutual friend that we had been talking to online and they decided to set us up on a blind date. We met in a bustling cafe in the city centre and I nervously pulled up a chair across from him. At first we were both shy and didn't know what to talk about, but soon our conversation began to flow and eventually we found ourselves deep in conversation about the work we did and our shared love of movies. 

Just when it seemed like the conversation had died down a bit, he asked me a funny question. I was taken off guard and, before I could even think of an answer, I started to laugh. He stared at me for a moment in surprise, then something seemed to click in him and he started to laugh too. We ended up laughing so hard that the people sitting in the surrounding tables turned to look at us. The longer we laughed, the more our connection grew, and we knew that we had something special. 

This moment of laughter was the start of our relationship, and we still fall back on it to this day. Whenever we start to feel a bit disconnected, we can always look back at the first time we met and how our laughter brought us together.
