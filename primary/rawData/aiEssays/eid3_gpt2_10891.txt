Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. It is probably the most detailed map you can imagine of the setting because it can be very important. In particular, the 'Street Vision' setting should really make the cyclist feel safe to drive. (If you are taking it on a weekend, drive in the right direction for a round trip, it should feel like the most dangerous place to drive.)

A second set of setting details are important for driving and riding well in tight terrain. These may mean thatasting, or staying in the middle of the road, will keep you safe. In fact, getting out of the way of road accidents can provide a great way to get into a crash quicker.

One more set of setting features will make a cyclist feel safer overall â€” "Good Safety", "Good Safety, I just want to slow down and stay on my way until the time comes, okay?". These values are important for many road cycling events, including the 'Elderly Week' (week of riding only), where you get two days of back-to-back rides.

However, when it comes to making cycling safer in a certain setting, you will be able to make good use of these settings if:

you don't want to take the cycle too often or go too long after dark.

it is too challenging for riders with strong stomachs.

you tend to fall off on some routes
