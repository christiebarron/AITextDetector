Minfong Ho ends the poem with this line to emphasize the cycle of life, and the fact that things often come full circle. It reflects the idea that the narrator will take the test again, another year, and not give up hope that they will get the result that they desire. By linking this line to natural elements such as the snows melting and geese returning, Ho conveys the idea that this cycle of repetition is also something that can be found in nature, and it is something that humans can use to gain hope and courage to continue on with their endeavors in life.
