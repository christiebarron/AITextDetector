One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I first started my practice for meditation. I was afraid of the laughter and the fear of laughter coming from other people. I would not leave a conversation about what I had done, because laughter would be a distraction. When you can't hear laughter, it doesn't make any sense."

In response, an editor named Michael writes,

"What CFR did was wrong â€“ they are not like 'people who laugh at laughter,' they are not like adults who feel a need to be offended or intimidated by the behavior, and they are not like children that are hurt by the behavior."

He concludes with: "I applaud the courage of the people who say that the government could do more, if it went to the top."
