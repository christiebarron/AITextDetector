In Joe Kurmaski’s ‘Rough Road Ahead’, the cyclist faces a great challenge in tackling the rough terrain. The setting of the story features a dense greenscape of thick evergreen trees, meadows, and paved roads. These physical features add dimensions of difficulty to the cyclist’s journey that they must overcome in order to proceed onward. 

The most challenging aspect of the setting is the road ahead itself - rocky and filled with bumps and dips. This rough road creates an added level of difficulty that the cyclist must navigate around in order to keep up their progress and not come to a screeching halt. The trees on either side also limit the cyclist’s visibility of the terrain, making it extra difficult to tackle the road as they can't see what's ahead of them. 

Moreover, the meadows surrounding the cyclist make it much harder to stay focused on their goal. Meadows often attract wildlife and the cyclist is very aware of being both vulnerable and exposed in such an open structure. Furthermore, the contrast between the paved roads and rocky terrain creates more of a barrier to maneuver around, as the cyclist must shift between the quickness of the road and slow coordination of the rocky terrain.
