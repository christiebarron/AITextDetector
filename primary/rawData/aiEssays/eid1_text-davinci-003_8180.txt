The Empire State Building was a monumental engineering achievement at the time of its completion in 1931. Not only was it the tallest building in the world, it was also designed with the intention of allowing dirigibles, or airships, to dock on its roof. Despite the enthusiasm of the design team, the task of accommodating the docking of dirigibles on the Empire State Building turned out to be a difficult one.

The first obstacle that the builders faced was the lack of suitable materials for the mooring mast. The needs of the building were complex and a mast made of cast iron or reinforced concrete was too heavy and expensive to install. As a result, the builders had to search for a material that was lightweight and strong enough to handle the mooring rope, as well as the airship. They eventually settled on a new material, created from aluminum and chrome steel, which served the demand of the Empire State Buildingâ€™s design.

The second obstacle was the length of the mast. The longer the mast, the more space it takes up on the roof. Dirigibles require a large enough landing space so they could land and take off without creating too much turbulence. Therefore, the mast had to be tall enough to create enough clearance for the airship, while at the same time not taking up too much roof space. The design team eventually settled on a height of 420 feet for the mast, which would allow enough space for the airships to dock
