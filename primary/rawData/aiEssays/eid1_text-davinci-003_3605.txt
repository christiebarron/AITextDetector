I remember the first time I met my now-husband. We had been chatting for a few weeks online and had finally worked up the nerve to meet in person. We were both so nervous! We both dressed in our best, but I could tell he was even more anxious than I was deep down, even though he desperately tried to play it cool.

After some awkward small talk and a few shy smiles, we began to relax, and the conversation flowed more naturally. I kept him laughing with every anecdotal I told. Finally, we both let out a sigh of relief as we could sense something genuine beyond the awkwardness.

The conversation got deeper, but we were both struggling to choose the right words. Suddenly, I got an idea. I suggested we make up a silly secret handshake for us both. He laughed so hard at the idea, and I found myself joining him. We exchanged a few goofy motions and pretended we were doing ninja moves. That's when we both knew we were meant for each other. We spent the rest of the night talking, with lots of laughter in between. 

It's been five years since that night, and he still effortlessly melts my heart with laughter. I'm so lucky to have found him!
