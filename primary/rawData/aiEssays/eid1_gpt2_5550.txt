Computers have many effects on people.

On the computer side, unable to communicate with it on the server side or to complete tasks, people get bored of it.

On the server side, the computer has certain capabilities. You can make sure that the computer is connected to the Internet, or it can be set up to get some things done but not with enough processing power. And the power will not be there every night and your computer will get bored for a few hours as the time goes on.

On the CPU side, it is so important that you can run programs to speed it up or speed up it down, to help it perform a particular task or to change settings. You can also run programs which do the same thing, like the browser or the browser loaders.
