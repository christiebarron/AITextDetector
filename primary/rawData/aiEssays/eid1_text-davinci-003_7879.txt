The memoir 'From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives' by Narciso Rodriguez paints a vivid, immersive and nostalgic narrative throughout. Rodriguez recounts personal memories and stories of his grandmother passed down to him from his mother in order to celebrate her life and the Cuban heritage in which he grew up with. The vivid descriptions of his family, culture, and homeland allows readers to feel a comforting in the descriptions he paints.

One can easily sense the nostalgia of Rodriguez when he writes of his mother who was devoted to her children and their household, helping him immensely in keeping his family's culture alive even when it was difficult to comprehend. Rodriguez paints pictures of Cuban life; the smell of daily cigars and strong Cuban coffee in the morning creating a warm atmosphere in the home. At moments the family’s devotion to their culture becomes overpowering, as his mom jumped in a river to guard the wooden crucifix around her neck.

The mood of the memoir by Rodriguez is often filled with pride and admiration through his retelling of these memories. This pride shines throughout the memoir and readers are able to feel a strong sense of identity when they immerse themselves in the culture being depicted. Rodriguez emphasizes that “home” for him is a safe place where one can take refuge, while also being a place of joy and reflection. This sense of safety and belonging is something Rodriguez wants to pass down to future generations in order to hold onto his Cuban heritage even when life changes.
