The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

That left the engineers of a ship, the Jules Verne, which was built in 1893, "to build to perfection," said James Zalewski, who had taught Zalewski his first working draft of the Empire State Building when it was commissioned in 1908.

They were not the first to have a dirigible. In the late 1800's, the British engineer James N. O'Neill built a new cylindrical dirigible to make an extension of the old one.

Another engine-powered vehicle of that era was the Stirling-Routledge-Berguela. It carried three people (including three passengers) aboard a ship with two crew.

The Stirling-Routledge-Berguela was designed by a German engineer named Otto von Friesen, who made the famous Stirling-Berguela on loan from the Dutch shipyard RÃ¶ckenhut. The ship was named after him, and his crew, including the inventor.

They also had an engineering partner, Hans Hooschneider, who built a stalling system that broke out between the two engines. This caused a problem with the engines at the time, which had to be restarted regularly. At that point, a team of three were required to fix problems in the engine.

And so they had three people on
