An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a day when I was getting some money from my parents. They didn't know my condition so I didn't give out what I needed and I'd take the bus home to the doctors. I didn't think about how to treat it or how to get it back to me so a week later, I got on the bus. I started with a $2 ticket to the doctor, $5 back for an aspirin but there were three other doctors in the car who knew what I was doing, I didn't want to work so they said, 'well, you're going to make a big fuss at that point in time.'"

"I felt like some of the other patients didn't know what I was doing…I had no idea what I was thinking," says her father. "You had no idea what you were supposed to be doing. When I started going to the doctor, they were saying, 'Please don't think about it,' not only because I wasn't doing well but because a doctor was telling you, 'Your dad wants you to take the aspirin.' "

"I couldn't go anywhere else," she says of her brother and brother-in-law. "It was pretty tough back then – they were like that when they were coming out of prison. When they turned 17, my father would try to call me to see me but they could not get a deal. He was so confused.
