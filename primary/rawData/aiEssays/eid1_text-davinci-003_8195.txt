The Empire State Building was a marvel of modern engineering when it was completed in 1931 — at the time, it was the tallest man-made structure in the world. One of the most innovative features of the Empire State Building was its mooring mast, which allowed dirigibles — large, airship-like aircraft — to dock within the structure. This was a highly ambitious undertaking but not without its obstacles.

One of the primary challenges was the sheer height of the Empire State Building. In order for the mooring mast to be effective, dirigibles needed to dock at the 81st story of the skyscraper. This was not an ideal spot for dirigibles, as the air currents at such a great height were stronger and more unpredictable than at lower altitudes. This posed a large safety risk to passengers and crew of the dirigibles, as it could be quite dangerous to moor them atop a skyscraper.

Another challenge faced was creating a strong and stable mooring mast. Such a structure had never before been attempted at such a great height. Many difficulties had to be overcome in the engineering process, such as girders and ironwork that could withstand the strong wind gusts that buffeted the mast at such a height, and ensuring that the mast was of an appropriate length to safely secure the dirigibles. 

Finally, dirigibles themselves presented a challenge, as the airships of that time period were difficult
