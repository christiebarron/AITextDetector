The speaker in the poem is reflecting upon their own feelings and experiences of school. The speaker questions their poor performance on a test and reflects that their garden looks much different in winter than in any other season. They connect this to their own struggles, as their mind feels similarly bare when faced with a hard test. As the poem ends, they come to a realization that the hibiscus will come back in the spring, and they will take the test again. This serves as a reminder that things can change and their struggles are only temporary. Life goes on, and the changes that come with the passing of seasons show the speaker that they too are capable of renewing themselves, of powering through their own hardships and finding a way to succeed.
