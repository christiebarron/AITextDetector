I recently had the opportunity to witness patience in the form of my older brother. My mom had asked him to help her in the garden, something he really didn’t want to do. She knew he wasn't thrilled with the idea and tried to be supportive by talking him through the process. But when he couldn’t figure out how to use the garden tools, my mom began to become frustrated. My brother took a deep breath and remained patient while my mom tried different approaches to teach him. He kept his composure in the face of my mom’s rising frustration and tried to stay positive. After some trial and error, my brother finally figured out how to use the tools and completed his task. I was really impressed by his patience in the midst of a frustrating situation.
