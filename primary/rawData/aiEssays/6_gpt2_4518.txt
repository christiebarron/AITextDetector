The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The tallest of them was at about 11,000 feet, but the Empire State Building in New York's Upper East Side is higher.

The tallest in Manhattan was 18,900 feet (26,640 meters) and the least, at about 8,000 feet.

The only remaining tallest is the Central Park Tower in New York City on Broadway.

At times like those, the makers of the Empire State Building could make more sense than they could if the plan were to build dirigibles at more than three-quarters the current height, it's estimated.

"We had no idea that we were going to build dirigibles like these," said John R. Sullivan, who has been in use at George Washington University's Air Force Academy since 1983. "We don't know what height we started with â€” that's all we know."

The Empire State Building, which will likely be demolished the following year, might be more important than skyscrapers or the current height of the building, said David Lee, spokesman for the New York City Department of Buildings and Development.

It could take decades to build the tower if it's designed right.

"By the time you get to the other side, there's a lot of problems that have to be solved, either through getting people on the ground to say, 'I think it's best that way
