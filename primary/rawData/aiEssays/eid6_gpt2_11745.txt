The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. During the 1950's the government also had to deal with a lack of interest in having private planes in the building.

During 1964 the Federal Building was approved as a temporary building for large private aircraft operating at a rate of two a day, though it remained available until late 1965, when the Empire State Building was moved from a temporary building to an official one. While on the lease and in use, BEWT continued to maintain military and military facilities.

Boeing 747
