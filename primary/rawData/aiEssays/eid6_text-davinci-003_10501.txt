The process of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was full of obstacles that needed to be overcome. Despite much creativity from the Empire State Building's builders, the primary challenges well exceeded the technical capabilities of the time. Despite these obstacles, the goal was achieved with innovative engineering and some creative thinking.

One of the first obstacles was the location of the building. Most of the tall buildings in New York in the 1920s and 1930s faced a problem due to the heavy downtown Manhattan winds. This made the Empire State Building a particularly difficult building to dock a large, unwieldy dirigible on. The building was also surrounded by tall skyscrapers on its side, making it difficult to bring the airship in close enough to the building for mooring.

Another technical concern was the use of the mooring mast, or the tall pole situated at the very top of the building that allowed the crane to securely latch onto the dirigible. While the mooring mast could withstand the weight of a dirigible, the crane was not specially designed for the task. Standard cranes were far too heavy and large and posed a risk of injury to people on the ground. The builders of the Empire State Building had to engineer a much smaller and lighter crane with specific safety and security features to ensure the safe but secure docking of the airship.

The airship itself was another major obstacle. It had to be able to withstand the high winds
