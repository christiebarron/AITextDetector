The setting of Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead” plays a critical role in the cyclist’s journey and ultimately influences their overall feelings and experience. The story begins when the cyclist spots a dirt road lined by tall trees as they move through the countryside. This rural terrain creates a sense of emptiness and solitude as the cyclist rides. The scenery inspires a strong sense of peace and allows them to find clarity in their thoughts and emotions.

The rough and hilly terrain of the dirt roads creates an extra layer of difficulty for the cyclist. The cyclist is forced to adjust to the obstacles the setting provides and overcome them in order to make progress. The cyclist’s emotions are amplified as they rise and fall with each climb and descent on the road. The physical challenge of the terrain combined with the inner struggle of the cyclist gives the story a new level of intensity and emotion.

The vastness of the landscape also affects the cyclist in the story. The cyclist is able to appreciate the feeling of being alone with the open space and time that the environment provides. The feeling of insignificance in comparison to the wide open landscape provides clarity in the cyclist’s thoughts and decisions.

The features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead” amplify the effects of the cyclist’s journey. The environment challenges them and adds a layer of intensity to the story as the cyclist negotiates the toughness of the terrain.
