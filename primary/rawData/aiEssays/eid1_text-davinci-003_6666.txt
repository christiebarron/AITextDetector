Dear Editor, 

Today, computers are used in every corner of the world. As technology advances, so does our dependence on computers. Thus the effects that computers have on people have become important to consider. In my opinion, computers have both positive and negative effects. 

On one hand, computers provide us with a way to save and organize information. It has become easier to manage our day-to-day tasks with computers. Online shopping, booking tickets, banking and even learning are now made simpler with computers. As a result, people are able to stay up-to-date with current events and issues with ease. 

On the other hand, computers can have negative effects on our social lives and physical health. With the rise of online social networks, people have become more devoted to their devices instead of each other. This has led to increased physical isolation, loneliness, and depression. Additionally, long periods of using computers can cause physical health issues such as carpal tunnel syndrome and poor posture. 

Ultimately, computers are essential to our modern lives. However, it is important to be aware of their potential effects so that we can use them responsibly. We must not become too reliant on computers for the essential tasks of our lives. 

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
