At the end of the poem, the narrator is reflecting on a journey they made with their family. Their family had gone out into the world in order to find a better life and the narrator stayed behind to take a test. The narrator mentions how their families are gone and the winter hibiscus alone is a reminder of them. The narrator ponders if they will be able to take the test again, and if their families will come back when the snows melt and the geese return. This ending gives the poem a hopeful note. It conveys the idea that the family may come back to the narrator in the spring, and hope that the future will be brighter than their present circumstances.
