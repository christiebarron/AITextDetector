I recently had to wait in line at the bank for what felt like hours. The tellers were taking their time, and the line was growing increasingly long. I was getting very frustrated and impatient, wanting to just get in and out as quickly as possible.

However, I made the conscious decision to take a breath and be patient. I reminded myself that everyone was in the same situation and that the teller was simply doing their job. I allowed myself to take time to observe the people around me, while distracting myself by scrolling through my phone. 

After what felt like forever, I finally made it to the front of the line. I stayed calm, collected, and I was polite to the teller. He thanked me for my patience and even gave me a complimentary lollipop. My patience wound up paying off in the end!
