Should libraries take the power to decide what books, music, movies, and magazines should be available to the public?

Libraries are often key educational resources and should not provide access to materials that could have an unwarranted influence on vulnerable minds. Similarly, allowing such materials will create a negative and unpleasant atmosphere in the library.

Libraries should ensure that any decisions to remove or censor certain materials are taken thoughtfully and respect this right. It is also essential that libraries do not censor works of fiction or art that are based off offensive topics. Instead, libraries should strive to educate people on these topics in a productive way. 

Above all, it is vital that libraries discuss why censorship is needed for certain materials and understand which materials may conflict with the values of their community. Libraries should also provide a clean, safe, and comfortable atmosphere for everyone, no matter the demographic. If
