To the editor of [Newspaper Name],

Greetings. It is my opinion that computers have greatly impacted our lives in a positive way, and I believe others should take this into consideration. 

Computers are the ultimate problem-solving tools that make completing tasks much faster and easier than ever before. Todayâ€™s students are given access to programs that can better teach them the basics of topics like history or mathematics, helping them become smarter, faster learners. For educators, computers provide ways to monitor student progress more closely and allow them to create personalized learning experiences that may distract from more traditional methods of teaching.

Moreover, computers facilitate collaboration in the work place, allowing us to communicate with someone in the world in mere seconds. For those in the business world, they allow access to applications such as data analytics and presentation software, enabling increased efficiency with certain tasks. In addition, computers provide instant access to communication tools and cloud-storage applications, both of which are essential for an efficient and productive workplace.

Finally, computers enable us to be creative when the traditional means of doing so are difficult or limited. Many people make use of computers to create artwork, compose music, design websites, and much more. The possibilities are practically endless.

In conclusion, I believe that the positive effects of computers on our lives are undeniable. They promote knowledge, productivity, and creativity, and I encourage others to consider and appreciate their importance and ubiquity.
