I believe that censorship of materials in libraries and libraries is an effective action through which citizens, rather than people doing what is needed, can develop a fuller understanding of their rights to use or have access to their literature. If they do, they can contribute information to the community and contribute their insights to the public.

The government is committed to combating the spread of information and disseminating information to make our community more accessible. To date, there is a strong government policy which aims to make access to literature a matter of choice to all citizens. In these areas, governments are working with the libraries of Canada as well as with government partners for the implementation of this policy.

I believe there is a need for a public interest group, the library committee of Toronto, to meet with stakeholders to evaluate the need for a policy to improve accessibility of libraries.

The Library Service Board welcomes comment from members in the library industry.
