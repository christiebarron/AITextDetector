I was in line at the supermarket the other day, patiently waiting my turn to check out. I stood just a few people back from the front, but even still it was taking an extremely long time for the person at the cashier to finish the purchase. The person in front of me seemed to be having trouble with their card, which was increasingly frustrating as my groceries were beginning to feel heavier and heavier. 

Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed some of the other people lined up behind me start to grumble and whisper to each other, clearly getting annoyed with the situation. A few were even checking their phone for the time.

Yet, I remained patient. I focused on staying calm and breathed deeply. I reminded myself that not everything goes as planned and that sometimes we have to wait a bit longer than expected to get the things we want in life.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, the person in front of me had finished and I was finally able to make my purchase. I smiled politely at the cashier as I walked away, thankful that I had practiced patience and didn't let my frustrations boil over.
