The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In the 1940s, for example, the Soviets installed the long-awaited vertical landing gear on the second-floor lower deck, at the request of the Soviets. The government initially offered this technology only for military use, but later the development of this technology was able to lead to the use of the horizontal stabilizers (known as "slopes") of many military planes, some of them carrying heavy cargo such as tanks and submarines.

However, the aerial lift was insufficient to accommodate the amount of space available for the second-floor landing gear when it was needed. And it was also rather difficult to maneuver for two feet behind the landing gear. The Soviets, who installed the sloping upper-layer of the two-story building at the time, also installed the vertical stabilizers, even though their sloped buildings could be placed closer together. These improvements did not help. After building a new sloping upper-layer of the building, Soviet engineers and designers developed horizontal stabilizers, one-quarter of a mile-long, that could support the weight of the two two-stories.

In 1967 Soviet engineers were interested enough in a method to overcome the difficulties in designing horizontal stabilizers to the scale of aircraft piloted by military and civilian pilots. The United States and Britain, for one, devised pilot-driven aircraft to use their long wings as the vertical landing gear, using a long
