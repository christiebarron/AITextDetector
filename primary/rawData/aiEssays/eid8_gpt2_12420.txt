One time I experienced laughter in my life was when it was so cold out. The first time I tried ice cream! If you're a kid who has never been around ice cream, you should never go through the hassle of trying it. There isn't a lot to like about the ice cream you can use and be sure to experiment with different flavors throughout your holiday. While I can promise you that using some of the best ice cream (or whatever it has to offer) is a no brainer and will be fun, I can also organs myself.

For those of you who haven't visited the ice cream and haven't been to a local Ice Cream store, that's not the end of the story. If you'll remember this post, last year I was able to go to a local bar to buy several brand new flavors. The flavors were great and the location was packed by 2 hours long without waiting much. I've had ice cream at Ice Cream Man, Dunkin Donuts, Subway, etc. It's awesome that I could go to any of them and do even better than some of the other customers.

The only difference this time around is that the ice cream is actually pretty cheap. The cheapest is 2-3 cents dollars but the one I used in the store for $18.95 included one $15 ice cream and the rest of it was $12.95. So it's around $19 for 3 bottles of ice cream at the time of writing
