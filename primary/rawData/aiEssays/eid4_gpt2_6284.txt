The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because of the story's many twists and turns throughout. The story begins a number of times, depending on who you ask, so if you're reading on or off the internet at this time, be sure to get a copy. The book is well worth your time.

For those interested in learning more about what Hatha is all about, I highly recommend this book by D.W. Meeks.
