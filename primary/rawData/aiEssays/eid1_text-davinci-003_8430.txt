I remember when I was visiting my grandparents in Philadelphia. We had planned a large family gathering for that weekend, but a snowstorm caused many people to be stuck in traffic and miss it. Everyone was so frustrated and wanted to get on the road as soon as possible. 

I felt a sense of calmness wash over me, and I tried to remind everyone to be patient with the situation. Instead of making the situation worse, I suggested that everyone take the time to enjoy some of the down time and catch up with each other until the roads cleared up. 

My patience helped to put everyone in a better mood. We all ended up having dinner together and had a great time. That moment taught me that being patient doesnâ€™t have to be a bad thing; sometimes it can be the right thing to do.
