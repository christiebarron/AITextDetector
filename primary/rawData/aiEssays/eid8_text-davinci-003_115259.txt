I remember the day I met my best friend like it was yesterday. I was at a party, and I was feeling a bit out of place. I didn't know anyone and had a hard time trying to fit in. 

Then, he walked in. He was so different—taller, with a funky hairstyle. He was from a completely different background than me, but there was something about him that I immediately connected with.

We started talking, and light-heartedly arguing, about anything and everything. We quickly realized, we had an uncontrollable habit of making each other laugh. Suddenly, the party was different. Everywhere I looked—people seemed brighter, louder, and more exciting.

Eventually, the night wrapped up. I had made a new best friend, and we had laughed more than I had in a long time. I remember we hugged each other goodbye, and realized that it had been a special evening, bonded by the laughter we shared. From that day on, our friendship was forged in laughter.
