The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because you must be convinced by the premise that there would be a "wary little tree" in the book that makes his death "the worst of all." As The Wall Street Journal points out, some of the comments made by some of the book's authors suggest this isn't the case!

I agree with the author on this point, so please keep that in mind until after reading this book and you might feel compelled to seek therapy or simply turn back and reread the entirety of the book yourself.

I have been saying this for a while now, but it's now time to take it a step further and talk about how we can help those who have this happen in their lives!

I want to encourage you to do your own research to see if someone has any suggestions and let me know what works for you.

I'll be doing this next week, but if I can keep going, I'll make sure to post my blog post every Thursday!

Enjoy!
