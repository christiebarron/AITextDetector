Computers have many effects on people. For example, there's the tendency that the first human is the only one who gains ability to process information without understanding it. This makes it hard for people to develop certain strategies to solve problems and they end up losing focus when they encounter problems. The same goes for language. As I explain in the book, these two characteristics of language are sometimes said to cause the brain to become less productive and to lead to some problems. In other words, the more you study language, the less efficient its processing machinery becomes. This can lead to a tendency toward misdiagnosis and premature retirement because of low cognitive skill, which is why you'll often have a young child with a limited vocabulary and have an awkward, impulsive style; it's also why you're prone to being confused. It would be a big mistake for your children and those of those with disabilities to be taught to think through the consequences of language usage when they have to listen to children understand.

In a more interesting way, there's an amazing book called "Focused Effort" entitled, "Building a Comprehension System of Language and Language Memory." In it, you make many arguments against studying "process," suggesting that it simply doesn't take as much effort as other topics.

Now with that in mind, let's find out more about "words" and how people learn them.

What do "processing" do for people who need help with language learning
