Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my thoughts on the effects that computer technology has had on modern society. The rapidly changing technological landscape has undoubtedly had a diverse set of implications on the way we communicate, work, and interact with the world.

At its core, computers, smartphones and other technological tools have reduced barriers to entry and increased opportunities for people to access a range of services. We now have access to a wealth of information at our fingertips, and the convenience of computers has helped increase efficiency and productivity. 

However, there can be serious drawbacks associated with over-reliance on computer-based solutions. Humans are naturally social creatures, and use of computers can detract from the time and effort we would ordinarily use to develop the relationships that make us prosper. Furthermore, computer devices can be tools of distraction, dependency and addiction, diverting us from more meaningful pursuits.

Despite the potential challenges of computer technology, on balance I believe that we should embrace its impact and use it to our advantage. Computers can be a force for economic and social progress if used mindfully; we should strive to control our usage and make sure itâ€™s in line with our priorities, values and goals.
