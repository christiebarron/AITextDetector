When one looks at the Empire State Building in New York City, one could never guess that it was ever intended to serve as a dirigible docking station. However, when the concept was proposed in the early 1930s, the challenge was taken on with gusto. Yet the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome in order to allow dirigibles to dock were many, and each one of those obstacles was necessary in order to ensure that the landing of the dirigibles was safe and hassle-free.

The first obstacle was the design of the mast. The mast that was designed had to be tall enough for the dirigibles to comfortably anchor to. In order to accommodate these airships, the mast had to be 445 feet tall. Not only that, but the mast also had to be designed in such a way that it was firmly attached to the building in order to withstand the powerful winds of the high altitude air currents. This was achieved by running cables through the core of the mast to secure it to the building.

The second obstacle was the construction of the mooring mast. This was a difficult feat because the mast had to simultaneously be strong and lightweight. To meet both criteria, the builders used tubular steel that was lighter and stronger than traditional steel and aluminum. This structure was also built to withstand the potentially extremely strong winds.

The third obstacle was the placement of the mast. Since the dirigibles had to be
