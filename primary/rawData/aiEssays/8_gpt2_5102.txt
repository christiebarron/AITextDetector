One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I stopped to watch a comedy show and realized he had been performing "Finnish Man of the Year."

But now, as something called "Pineapple Pie," it's called "Pineapple and Chocolate Cake." The recipe calls for chocolate and cookies, and to top it off, I like to whip up a little cinnamon. Here's how to make it…

Ingredients

3 cups a large, fine chocolate cake

2 tablespoons of sugar

3 tablespoons baking powder

1/4 teaspoon baking soda

1/4 teaspoon baking soda

1/4 cup dark cocoa

1 teaspoon instant coffee

2 cups powdered sugar

1/3 cup vanilla extract

Step 1

Preheat oven to 350°F. In a stand ratcheting pot, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda and instant coffee. Bring to boil, stirring frequently. Let stand 5 minutes and allow to cool to room temperature. When ready to use, spread out onto a work surface. Using a whisk or a wooden spoon, spread out onto a flat surface. Spread in an inch thick, about 5 inches thick. When ready to use, flatten chocolate turret over top and let rest for 10 minutes, stirring frequently. Let rest for 3 to 5 minutes. To assemble, flatten 4 inches of chocolate turret in half lengthwise, roll each half in half lengthwise,
