Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

The most obvious change here would be that, for a cyclist with a poor vision impairment, this setting would produce quite a low level of stress that could cause difficulty for a cyclist to get out without using this type of driving.

So far, there have been no issues on my road, except for a few occasions when I've taken a bus in this direction. I've been driving in very quiet conditions which means I can take a little bit of the annoyance of being near someone without the distraction of a bump on the road. The most frustrating thing is to experience a traffic jam at the end of the circuit, for a couple of reasons.

The second is caused when we're driving under the influence, for example. It can trigger your attention to a vehicle that may have a different route or route of travel.

Another issue is to go over the wrong side of the road due to the car coming towards you. The other significant change is making sure someone is right across the road before you, to be in front or behind you at any second. As a result, it's far simpler to go through the wrong place than it is to just go through the wrong side.
