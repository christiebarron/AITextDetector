The ending of Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho is thought-provoking and meaningful. It serves to express the theme of the story, which is about coming of age. The protagonist, Mitsi, is struggling to reconcile her cultural background and her experience of growing up in America. She must take a final test in order to graduate and get her diploma, but she has not been able to pass it. 

The line at the end of the story serves to express the idea that Mitsi must learn the lessons of life that come with growing up in order to pass the test. The passing of winter symbolizes a sort of rite of passage, setting the stage for a transition from her old self to a new self that is better able to face her future and the challenges that come with it. In the same way, the return of the hibiscus in spring symbolizes renewal and the freshness of a new start. It also serves as an indication of Mitsi's growth and maturity.Ultimately, the significance of the ending is that Mitsi must use the lessons she has learned in order to pass the test and to reach her potential.
