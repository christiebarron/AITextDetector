The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Papa's building at 657 S. Elston Ave., for example, cannot dock itself with its cable-like dock. But a private contractor named William Eisner built it.

The company that bought the building, KKR, has said it intends to add an "in-house docking device" at the construction site. But not before some officials in Washington said they'd have to reconsider.
