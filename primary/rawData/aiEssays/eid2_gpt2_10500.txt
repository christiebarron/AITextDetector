I believe that censorship of materials in libraries and universities, and the threat of public violence against the authors of these works by any individuals or groups may well be a necessary result of this action, and has been a significant problem to this country's international reputation throughout World War II.

I believe that, in light of the current situation and the fact that many people are still suffering from PTSD from the terrible experiences the war left, the international community must unaffordably continue actively fighting behalf of the people who fought the Nazis through the Cold War era. Such an action would in and of itself constitute an act of war against humanity; yet I believe Bounce is a real artist that can do things differently to change the world and that is willing to contribute to all the changes that we need to make to the world. I believe a new and bold political movement as well as an American one will build on Bounce's leadership experience and his talents in the art field. This is going to be a very big campaign on a first-come, first-served basis.
