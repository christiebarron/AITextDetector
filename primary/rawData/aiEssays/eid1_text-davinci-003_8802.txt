I was out on a walk with my husband when I suddenly stopped in my tracks and let out a huge laugh. He stopped, looking confused, and asked me what was so funny. I decided to tell him.

It had started a few days prior while I was doing the dishes. My husband had asked me why I was being so quiet, a question I found odd because I'm rarely quiet when doing chores. I hadn't noticed I was being quiet, but I took his question to mean he wanted me to talk, so I decided to start telling him one of my favorites stories, a silly story about my time in elementary school. 

I hadn't finished my story when we set out for the walk, but as soon as I told him where I had left off I couldn't help but laugh. The memory of being eleven years old in class, utterly embarrassed by the whispers of my classmates, was hilarious to me. 

Once I explained to him why I was laughing, my husband couldn't help but join in. Together we laughed and laughed at the silly memory until my laughter became uncontrollable and tears streamed down my cheeks. 

And just like that, we went from strangers to friends, connected in laughter that is only possible between two people who care for one another.
