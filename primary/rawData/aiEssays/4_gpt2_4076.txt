This is one of the biggest mistakes of his career. His second season of the Golden State Warriors was like a rollercoaster. There was no clear path to the playoffs — the Thunder were the undisputed front-runner. The Cavs were the best of the other three, but no one really knew what else they needed to improve. What they should have done was run into Boston, to Los Angeles and other markets where they can win games. There's always that moment where you've given up, let a team lose and you forget. But every little sign this is a team of great leadership and perseverance was the most encouraging thing about it all. And now they're winning.
