The Empire State Building, which was built in 1931, was the tallest building in the world when it was built. It stood an impressive 1,250 feet high and was the first building in the world to have more than 100 stories. This feats of engineering and architecture was made possible by the hard work of thousands of workers and architects who worked tirelessly to construct this masterpiece. One of the most impressive and ambitious projects undertaken for the building was to design and construct an entryway and dock that would allow dirigibles to dock on the peak of the skyscraper. 

Though the initial proposal for a docking station was met with enthusiasm, the engineers and architects involved encountered many obstacles in actually constructing the entrance for the dirigibles. The most obvious obstacle was the fact that this goal was out of the ordinary- never before had a structure of this size been built that included an entryway and dock of this nature. As a result, the engineers did not have an easily accessible blueprint for designing and constructing the mast and entryway, but instead had to devise their own plans from scratch to fit the unique requirements of the project.

In addition to the lack of a blueprint, the engineers had to battle with the complicated logistics of construction. The Empire State Building was extremely tall- reaching up 1,250 feet- almost twice as high as the standard dirigibles of the time. Because of this, the engineering team had to factor in an additional 800 feet to the mast to provide
