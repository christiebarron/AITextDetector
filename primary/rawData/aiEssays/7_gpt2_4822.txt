An example of a time someone in my life was patient was watching her watch over her husband for a few minutes. By then she was in bed and couldn't go out anymore. It seemed they had been sleeping on their lap for a significant amount of time and the family was getting ready for a big baby walk.

What it means then, that we, as parents, were so busy trying to make it to the day of our daughter's birth,

We missed, and I, as a parent, missed that moment when there was still a sense of joy and hope (as if a small miracle can somehow be passed down). After all, after all that, you still want to know why it is that you were able to leave the day you couldn't get to work.

We miss it.

There are times when you just will not go. There are times when you really know what it's like to leave. And there are times when the only person you care about can't think for herself.

The real question is, do you feel lost on your own children?

We know we lose. But do we want to keep that experience with you even if the day doesn't start coming easy on us? What's more, do we really want our love to fade away so you get to watch some of your best moments as you take a child out for a walk and you don't feel even like you're getting ready to experience the joy
