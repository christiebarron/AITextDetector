The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

"It was a lot of money and a lot of building space," said Mark Williams, who designed the Empire State Building in 1953.

Williams said the tower's layout required that the building's two main towers be separated.

But the design team decided to divide the building's lower-levels - the lower part of which are attached to the main building - so that the two towers had to be separated from one another.

The architects then turned over a design firm's design services to U.S. District Judge Richard Durbin. On June 24, the building was ready to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. U.S. District Judge Richard Durbin ruled that the building's upper-level and lower-level elevators were to be separate, meaning each of the elevator levels could be different.

This was due to the fact that the Lower Level is where the lower elevator from the Tower of London can descend to.

So it required engineers to make a decision based on that. The new building's first two elevators were a little different, and some parts of the lower level, under the wings of the upper level, must also be separated.

Some parts of the structure were different. So the design team decided to split down the hall for the lower level.

In December 1964, engineers developed a more modern structure
