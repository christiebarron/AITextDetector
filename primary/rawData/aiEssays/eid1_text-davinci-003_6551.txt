Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. In the modern world we live in, computers can be found in almost every home and business. As technology advances, more and more people are using computers for their everyday tasks and activities, and while they do offer many benefits, I believe they can have a detrimental impact on individuals as well.

On the one hand, computers can be used to help people stay informed and stay connected. For example, people can easily access the latest news, communicate with friends and family through social media, or explore the wide range of information available on the internet. They also promote a higher level of productivity in the workplace, allowing us to get more tasks done in less time.

On the other hand, computers can be incredibly distracting and can easily lead to procrastination. People may find themselves spending hours online, playing video games, or simply scrolling through their social media feed. This can take time away from engaging in healthier activities, such as exercising, being outdoors, or having interpersonal conversations with family and friends.

In conclusion, while computers can be useful for certain purposes, their excessive use can be detrimental and should be monitored. I believe that with proper use, computers can be a valuable tool for both productivity and entertainment, but if abused, they can quickly become a distraction.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
