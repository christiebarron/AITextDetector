The idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was an intriguing one that presented builders of the skyscraper with many obstacles. The building was one of the tallest in the world, and the engineering challenges associated with the project were immense. Although the architects and engineers of the day had a firm understanding of strong structural design, the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building required them to think outside the box. 

The biggest challenge faced by the architects and engineers of the Empire State Building was figuring out a way for the massive airships to dock safely. A dock suitable for dirigible mooring had never been constructed before, and the tallest building in the world presented unique challenges. To solve this, the team designed an intricate mast, or mooring tower, to be constructed on the top of the building.

The mooring tower featured a spire that extended 20-stories high, making it visible from a great distance. The tower was built to be strong and durable, as it would need to support the strain of a dirigible pulling itself against the tether and mooring itself in place. The construction team also had to consider where to place the tower, as the formidable weight of a dirigible would put immense strain on the building's exterior during docking. Their solution was to construct the mooring tower on the roof of the building, where its weight was distributed more evenly.
