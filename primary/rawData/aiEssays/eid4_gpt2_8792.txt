The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because its world is set against another world in the future - a world beyond itself which does not include what may come up in New Zealand. One thing this happens to people who grow up in Britain, New Zealand and Australia, is that it is almost impossible to understand what it might mean to actually live for two decades on this Earth. The story begins with the first children (actually, we have five, but a couple is a much better number) and gradually as the story progresses to the tenth, it can become difficult to follow, especially given the time of year the story is set in: "a long-continued cycle." Even in the book, it often changes at one point throughout the plot before falling to another place. In general, the focus here should be on living for the long-term, not on just surviving as long as the last one.
