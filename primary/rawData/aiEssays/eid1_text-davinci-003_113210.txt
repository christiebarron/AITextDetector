Dear Editor,

I am writing in response to an article published recently about the effects of computers on people. As technology progresses, so does our reliance on computers, which can lead to serious consequences.

While computers are undoubtedly useful and efficient, it is important to recognize their downsides. The use of computers has been linked to a myriad of issues, including physical health, psychological well-being, and social ostracism. Physically, prolonged exposure to computers can have a negative impact on posture, vision, stress levels, and sleep quality. Psychologically, people can become detached from reality and overly reliant on technology, leading to diminished social and interpersonal skills. People who spend excessive amounts of time on their computers can also be socially ostracized, resulting in feelings of isolation and loneliness.

As a result, the excessive use of computers should generally be discouraged, and appropriate measures must be taken to ensure that people are not becoming overly reliant on technology. For example, schools should consider decreasing the amount of time children spend behind computers, and parents should set firm limits on their childrenâ€™s computer use at home. Additionally, workplaces should implement workplace policies that prioritize social interactions over personal technology use.

I urge readers to be aware of the potential risks associated with overusing computers, and to take the necessary measures to protect themselves and their loved ones.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
