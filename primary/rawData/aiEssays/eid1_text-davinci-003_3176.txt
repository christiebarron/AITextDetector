It is important to understand the implications of computer use and to consider how computers can be used to bring positive beneficial change into peopleâ€™s lives.

The potential benefits to people from computer technology are tremendous. Computers allow us to communicate with each other quickly, easily and from all over the world. They can give us access to vast amounts of information, help with problem-solving, and assist us with mundane tasks. They help us to become more organized, efficient, and productive. Most importantly, computers can give us the tools to advance society in ways we could have never imagined before.

Despite the benefits, there are some potential negative effects to computer use. It is possible to become addicted to the internet or to computer games. Research has also suggested that computers can have a negative impact on our physical health by causing eye strain and fatigue. Computer use can also lead to a lack of social interaction and increased isolation.

It is essential for people to be aware of the impact that computers have on our lives
