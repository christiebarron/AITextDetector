The challenges faced in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building were numerous. Most prominently, the architects and builders of the Empire State Building had to grapple with structural design and logistics that had never before been tackled. This complex task was required due to the massive size of the airships, the strong air currents around the building, and the fear of disaster should something go wrong.

The first challenge was finding a suitable place for the airships to dock. The architects had to balance the placement of the docking station so that it wouldn’t interfere with the offices and apartments, the observation deck, or the exterior of the building. In order to find a perfect spot, the architects had to survey the entire tower, which took several days.

Once the architects had identified a suitable spot for the docking station, the actual structure–known as the Mooring Mast–had to be constructed. This was a massive undertaking, as the plans for this structure had never been used before. The supporting columns had to be able to withstand the force of the airships, the strong winds around the building, and any sort of mechanical malfunction. In order to make sure the mast could handle the airships, the architects and builders constructed a special pulley system to aid the ships when docking. This system contained multiple chains, pulleys, and hooks that allowed the airships to be steadily lowered onto the mooring mast. 

The engineers and builders also had
