The Empire State Building was once considered a marvel of modern engineering due to its impressive height and grandeur. It was an architectural wonder, however, that featured one of the most unique features of all — built onto the building was a mooring mast, or a tower designed to receive airships, which would dock at this 103rd story supply dock.

The architects of the Empire State Building had their work cut out for them when they began to plan the mooring mast. Everyone was certain that it would be a boon for business within New York City, as, once airships could dock, passengers from anywhere in the world could disembark right into the heart of the city. However, there were several obstacles that needed to be overcome before the mooring mast was built.

The first was the sheer height of the building. With the top of the tower reaching 1454 feet, it was the tallest structure in the world for nearly four decades. This meant that the mooring mast had to be strong enough to withstand extreme wind speeds, and large enough to safely accommodate the airships. The engineers and architects also had to consider the safety and security of the passengers and crew aboard the airship, which was a daunting task at such a great height.

The second obstacle was the mooring technique itself. Otis Elevator Company, the company who designed the Empire State Building’s lifts, was also charged with designing the mooring mast
