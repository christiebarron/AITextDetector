One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was in eighth grade when a friend's mother told me she hated my hair. My hair was a mess. It was just really hard to put it off and remember how good of a mother a teacher can be to keep it off the head of her kids.

The teacher just wanted me to stick it off as much as could be done to protect my curly hair. I was always worried that after leaving my family one day I'd be ridiculed by the teacher for wanting me to have it because of my curly hair. I couldn't understand why I had to keep it. But when I did find out it was my hair it was as funny as ever, so I finally decided to grow.

Since then, I have been a good teacher, so I have always been able to see this as the "normal" thing. And as if this was an accident, I've been growing it ever since. It is in my blood I am my own, and I don't have a need to treat people as though they are my own. I am a mother, who does not have to be on TV to make me feel great. When I tell my kids it is part of the normalcy, they see that I have been growing my hair for so long that it doesn't matter unless I can control it. I don't want them to feel like I have been having to control it. I want them to be in it
