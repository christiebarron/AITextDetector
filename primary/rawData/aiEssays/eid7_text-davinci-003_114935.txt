I was recently out shopping with my family when something quite unexpected happened. There was an elderly woman in a motorized scooter who was attempting to maneuver around the store. She became stuck in the awkward position of being in between two large shelves, and was unable to move in either direction easily.

After a few moments of realization, everyone in the store stopped to watch her. I knew I had to do something to help her, so I made my way over in an attempt to assist. The woman was so appreciative when I began to take command, and worked hard to push her through the obstruction.

It took a bit of maneuvering, and a lot of patience, but we finally got her back on track. It was a long process, but I stayed calm and eventually the elderly woman was free. Once the job was done I received a huge hug from her, and we went our separate ways.

The whole experience taught me a lot about patience, and how even a seemingly simple act of kindness can go a long way. It was an incredible moment, and Iâ€™m proud to have been able to help in a difficult situation.
