This ending helps the speaker to build a cycle of hope and recovery for themselves. They are struggling with a test, so they look to the cycle of the natural world of the winter hibiscus for hope that they will do better in the future. The resonant imagery of the snow melting and the geese returning reminds the reader of the cycle of life and its necessity in the face of difficulty. As the hibiscus blooms in the spring, the speaker is therefore encouraged to come back and try again. The ending provides a sense of positivity and renewal, and shows that with determination and a focus on the highlights of nature, the speaker can overcome any challenge.
