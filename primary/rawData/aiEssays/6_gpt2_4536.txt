The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The New York City Public Housing Authority (NYPLA) built some of the first, but did not allow a dirigible to dock in all its three buildings. (The Metropolitan Transit Authority, meanwhile, had to build it for its stations and the government had to develop a bridge over the Hudson River.) The only dirigibles to dock with the MTA were the "unlocking" towers of the Empire State Building at 7th and Sixth: the $19.8 billion Central Park-Temple Avenue-Mullen building, and a $29.7 billion Empire State Building at 8th.

At least four of those towers were completed, one in 2006, but the building itself, with its first concrete section, was completed just two years later.

The Empire State Building was built before the Empire State Building was purchased. The Empire State Building opened in 1889, but there were several more that didn't begin that same year. The most common is the $24-million Empire State Building â€“ not to be confused with the $5 million new state building of the same name.
