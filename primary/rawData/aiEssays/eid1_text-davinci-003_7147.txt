In "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski, the features of the setting have an undeniable impact on the cyclist. The road itself is covered in pot holes and broken pavement, making it difficult for the cyclist to maintain a steady cadence. The cyclist must contend with this rough surface while remaining balanced on their bike, making the ride difficult and treacherous. Additionally, steep climbs and tight turns make even the most experienced cyclists work hard for their progress.

The cyclist is also further hindered by the weather conditions. The road is slick with rain, inhibiting the cyclist's ability to stop, turn, and corner quickly. Additionally, the short-range visibility due to the rain and fog further complicates the cyclist's ability to safely choose the best line through the course.

Finally, the characteristics of the setting--from the physical features to the weather conditions--are a perfect representation of the cyclist's journey. By tackling this course, the cyclist is forced to accept the inherent challenges and risks, while working to improve his mental strength. This is represented through the setting; a difficult journey through a picturesque setting, a place where only the brave and fearless can succeed. Through the features of the setting, Kurmaski is able to create a sense of tension and anticipation, making the reader root for the cyclist, despite the seemingly insurmountable odds.
