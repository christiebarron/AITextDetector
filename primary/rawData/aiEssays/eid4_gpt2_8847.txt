The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it is a true story.

The book starts with a little girl who was a student of the "Hibiscus" school because she became so attached to a man. The hero, the old man, takes a lot of a beating in the name of Hibiscus and she gets an education in the school. In fact, once her teacher was killed and no longer caring about her, the little girl would find a way to find the school and use everything she was finding to help her become a hero. She eventually gets into the library to find a place to learn how to read books before her teacher dies with no help from the school staff. At first she is glad to find a place she can study for long enough and eventually can get over her pain as someone who had no place to learn and her heart needs to be opened wide to people. But the real story of Hibiscus is her quest to find the school and help its children become better people. As the story progresses, things change dramatically. The story shifts completely from the "Hibiscus" school to the current day Hibiscus school. But the hero of this story has a different life story and in this case is Hibiscus. All of her friends die and only she can save her friends and protect them.

Hibiscus is the story behind the book Snow White has been telling about the world of Fairy Tales from
