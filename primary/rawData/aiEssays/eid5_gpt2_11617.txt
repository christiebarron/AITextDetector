The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' took many years to gain momentum. The book was published in 1983, and was subsequently reauthored by J.L. and R.E. Browne in a special edition titled 'The Story of Me Too. The Story of Me Too.' The final book was published on November 6, 2002.

This original book was collected in 2003 and re-released in 2005 along with the 'Book's Life' collection of 'From Home is.'
