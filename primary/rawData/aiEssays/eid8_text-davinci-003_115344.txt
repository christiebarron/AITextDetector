I remember the time I was walking down the street with my friend and we saw a billboard advertising a new movie. We both started laughing because the movie had a face on it that was oddly drawn. We couldn't believe how bad the artist must have been. 

So, we stopped on the side of the street and started taking pictures of it and trying to recreate it with a combination of bad accents and poses. I'm a little embarrassed to say that it wasn't long before we were both laughing so loud that people were stopping to look at us.

When I think about it now, I still feel the warmth of that moment and the reminder that laughter is one of the best ways to connect with someone. Even if all you end up doing is sticking your tongue out at them and making funny faces, you might just be able to bridge the gap between two people.
