I believe that censorship of materials in libraries and other institutions means that there are fewer effective ways of combating censorship and that less effective mechanisms have to be developed to address this reality," says Richard Fetter, Executive Director (the Center for Digital Research).

Fetter and other researchers examine the state of online platforms and use them to uncover potential challenges, using current technology to find information that helps them to make informed decisions. They also focus on what they call public information systems or digital tools and what they call the open Internet, a movement to make the internet more open and open to all.

The study was published in a public domain journal.

This research focused on the use of digital devices as the platform to protect information about students. The tools are sometimes placed in public spaces but also inside classrooms, home walls and other premises.

"In this situation, the only way to see what a student actually knows is to ask them questions that are important and perhaps critical. An active public information system that includes all relevant information is really a critical means of this," says Bodey.

The National Center for Cyber and Communications Policy recently announced the release of a report examining the effectiveness of online systems for protecting public information and how it is used to protect students from censorship and cyber crimes.
