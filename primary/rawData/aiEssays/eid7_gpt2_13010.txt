An example of a time someone in my life was patient was my oldest son and this friend who I always considered one of the most important players he played with. At the time I was a good basketball student but the whole time it was a completely different situation with basketball.

The next time I attended the gym they were all dressed to the tatters and all the girls were in front of the whole group. I would go in and out of the room just as I went home. Then when I got home, they would be looking over their shoulders and looking really bored. I think that all these years have been like a phase in my life. It's something I still want to see.

The next time someone would talk to me because they were so tired or sick or just because a good friend or brother or another player had passed away I just knew I had to do something. I remember having to go out to the hotel as I had done that time to watch other girls lose their money and even their boyfriends. It was a great feeling.

Now that I'm here it's a lot of fun. I have a new life here. If anyone here really wants me, it would be my brother or this team or anyone they can think of. I have a new life and a new way to live that I would love to live. I do have an old life but it might just be my new year in California. You see how old I am and how
