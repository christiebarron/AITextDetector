The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it reminds readers of the life-particle life cycle of this year's Winter Hibiscus - the story of a woman's struggle to become the man that really makes the world. Her struggle changes the course of her life, both emotionally and physically - literally the entire season.
