The Empire State Building, built in 1931, was the first ever building to feature a mooring mast on its roof, allowing dirigibles to dock. This feat of engineering and construction was a unique window of opportunity for travel, as it conveniently combined modes of transportation in an era before the explosion of the automobile and airplanes. However, the Empire State Building was not a forgotten building, and the builders faced a number of obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

The first major challenge faced by the Empire State Building builders was safety. The mooring mast had to be very sturdy in order to ensure that the massive weight of the dirigible could be safely sustained, yet at the same time was also required to give way with the dirigible’s upstream just as it reached the top. Additionally, the mast also had to be windproof as to avoid swaying excessively while moored. For this reason, the team of builders was instructed to use steel girders that could resist lateral movement in order to safely moor the dirigible. 

In addition to safety concerns, the Empire State Building builders also had to consider the logistics of passenger boarding and disembarking. The dirigible’s crew must be able to access the rooftop with the required amount of personnel and equipment needed to dock the ship. This meant the builders had to also construct an elevator that could take passengers and crew to and from the roof. Moreover, the builders needed to plan
