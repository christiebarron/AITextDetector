Narciso Rodriguez's memoir From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives creates an overwhelmingly intense and deeply powerful mood. Through narration and anecdotes, Rodriguez captures the complexities of being a queer immigrant in search of a home and an identity. In the vivid memories of his upbringing, the reader can almost feel the warmth of his nurturing mother and the community of Miami’s Cuban exiles who provided refuge from his turbulent family life. Rodriguez's recollections of visits with his uncle Umberto reveal recurrent themes of anxiety and desperation as he struggles to reconcile his identity within the context of his Cuban heritage and his sexuality.

Rodriguez further conveys the oppressive nature of his Catholic upbringing, and the anti-immigrant sentiment running rampant throughout his formative years.

Throughout his journey of self-discovery and exploration, Rodriguez reflects positively on his experience and confidently asserts his identity. Despite the myriad of obstacles, each chapter builds a stronger narrative as he honors his Cuban heritage and lovingly creates a home on his own terms. By gracefully navigating the volatile family dynamics and the condemnation of those around him,
