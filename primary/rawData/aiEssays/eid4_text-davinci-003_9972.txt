The author ends the poem with this sentence to emphasize the power of resilience and rebirth. Winter Hibiscus is a story of a young girl who is struggling in school but finds hope and strength in the hibiscus plant in her garden. The poem comes full circle as the hibiscus remains dormant in the winter just as the girl found herself struggling in school, and returns in the spring and is blooming just as the girl finds the strength and courage to take her tests again. In setences with the repetition of the word "when," Minfong Ho paints a picture of the collaboration between nature and the young girl--how by witnessing nature and the hibiscus cycle of life, the girl was able to find her own inner strength and persevere. Ultimately, the poem is saying that just like the plant, people too are capable of rebounding and finding strength in times of trial.
