The setting in Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead" has a great influence on the cyclist. To begin, the road itself is an important factor that affects the cyclist. The road is rough and bumpy, which causes the cyclist to be jolted and jarred. This creates a physical discomfort that makes the bike ride more difficult and exhausting. Additionally, the cyclist is surrounded by steep hills and landscapes dotted with thorny bushes and sharp rocks. The menacing atmosphere of the environment is a reminder that the cyclist must be extra careful in order to avoid obstacles or dangerous creatures.

The setting also contributes to the cyclist's emotional state. The path is described as "lonely and lonesome," leading to a feeling of isolation and uneasiness. This lends an eerie quality to the journey, heightening the cyclist's sense of fear and dread.

Finally, the setting has implications for the cyclist's pace. The rider must take care to maneuver around the hazards of the road in order to avoid potential accidents, and the rough terrain contributes to the cyclist's fatigue and slows down his or her progress, creating a sense of frustration.
