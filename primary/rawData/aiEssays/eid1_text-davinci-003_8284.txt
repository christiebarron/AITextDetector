The Empire State Building has had an interesting and varied history, including experimentation with allowing dirigibles to dock. However, the builders faced numerous obstacles to make this idea a reality.

First, the idea of docking dirigibles at the Empire State Building was met with some opposition at first. Without an established track record of success, outside investors were hesitant to put up large sums of money for such an experiment. Furthermore, New York City's building codes would have to be amended to allow for such an endeavor. Doing so would be a laborious process and required the efforts of a team of legal professionals. Additionally, the public was skeptical and wary of airships in general. It was assumed that the dirigibles, with their large hydrogen bags, posed a potential danger, however insurmountable, which needed to be addressed.

The financial costs were also significant. Building codes needed to be amended, the engineering costs for rigging equipment to the spire of the Empire State Building were expensive, and the cost of governing the dock itself was steep. Additionally, the area around the docking deck proved problematic, as the area needed to be kept clear day and night in order to provide safe operations. Throughout the entire construction process, the Roebling family, the original owners of the Empire State Building, needed to constantly reassess the project's finances and insist that the costs of the venture were kept within a manageable budget.
