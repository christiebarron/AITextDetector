I believe that censorship of materials in libraries would, indeed, be far too draconian for the current political climate.

I am a proud liberal liberal who loves my children's education, the free press, and the need for people to have a say in their public opinion. I have always disagreed with the notion that we can allow political correctness to creep into our public life. In many ways, this is what I find to be an enormous strength of American democracy. I am a strong supporter of open and informed government and of the freedom of our elected officials. I think that that is the most important thing to do.

I believe that we must do more, more â€” and that we can be more transparent about what is happening at our library. I believe that, in the end, libraries are institutions that are just and reliable tools of speech and assembly that can be the foundation of our democracy, and I hope that people are encouraged to have a conversation when they see someone who holds hateful views.

Sincerely,

Bob Dylan
