One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was going out of town. I was going to be a stripper because I didn't want to take on a world. Now, I was having some fun and I wanted to be the most famous stripper of all time. But, it wasn't good enough. I felt like I was getting burned out.

The next time I saw a stripper I said, "Why don't I come down with you?" She was so shocked. So mad because she was too intoxicated. And then I went and went to see her, and I said, "Well, what is it?" she said, "I really love being stripper. I am just trying to become the greatest. I want it. It is all about working hard, just doing what you want." I was just thrilled.

I found a lot about myself. I had lost many of my friends because I was so focused on my craft. I remember, when I first started working alone, I was always thinking to myself, "This is what I really need." It was so freeing when working with a stripper. Now I was also more focused on being like a star â€” a legend.

What's your career going through?

My career is starting to change. When I was still in college, I had some experience, and now I am very comfortable working with the kind of people I met once.
