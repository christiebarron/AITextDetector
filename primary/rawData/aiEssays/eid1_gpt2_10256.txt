Computers have many effects on people. They are connected. And they don't necessarily benefit our social and economic system - the technology, the information, is the most fundamental thing for us to do. We need more communication on the part of those who rely on us.

I want to hear from you, and if you have any comments, questions or suggestions which could help make this world a better place. What if people would like to know more about these ideas? Will you consider your submission to the forum? Do you have an idea which can be published on the Internet?

Hello Dennis,

I've got it wrong on one of my comments, my response. The notion that computers should be able to solve complex problems is a myth because it is based on faulty ideas about computing, and while that's true for computing, the problem is not for computers in many ways that can solve it as efficiently with our computers as they could with NEXT technology, where every step of computation has a cost. And it is certainly false to say that we will all live under such an illusion. In theory, computers could solve the world's problems; in practice, we don't, and, to put it another way, the problem is actually more about the limitations of computing - the limitations of computation which are not inherent in our world.

The problem is that there are only so many things going on inside the human mind. These are things that
