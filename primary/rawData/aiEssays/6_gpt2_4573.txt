The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One was their view of the Empire and the way in which skyscrapers are constructed, or how they use sunlight to provide shade and heat to the rooms beneath. Another was their own lack of familiarity with the way lights and buildings are manufactured, and how they approach design-guided design methods when planning and building with light.

In general, the world is a much more green place when it comes to the light bulbs and LED arrays. But with more and more technologies pushing the envelope on how light is controlled and used, such as a system that lets users control their LED on demand, the question becomes what needs to be addressed before their home can be converted into a smart, eco-friendly home. Here are 16 smart LEDs and a few LEDs that do what they need to do to keep the project green:

1. Anode

The A-pillar uses a 3D scanning program (called 'anodesign') to scan through an LED and render its image on screen. Using these smart and simple methods, the A-pillar is able to get around some of the technical hurdles created by the older technologies such as those in-------------

– The LEDs need to produce a high amount of radiation when they are placed in a glass enclosure. This produces a green, low power consumption when operating at high temperature.

– As an LED grows in intensity, each wavelength shifts and
