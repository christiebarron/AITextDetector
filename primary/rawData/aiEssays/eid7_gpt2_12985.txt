An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was an 8 yr old that we did not get the day they went sick and went to the vet, and they got out and looked at us. I know I did not do anything wrong and I will never forget when they gave us our dog. The day we received these pictures of my new dog, it was such a moment for me and I have to give my thanks to everyone that helped with this project for the many hours it took me. They will always remember my love for this little puppy and that we all will always support our families and this project.

Thank you so much!!
