They are not happy about this day because you would think that they are getting paid the same wages as the average guy. It is what it is and now we are in so much better contact. I can't remember all my last four years but we are just a new part of the business and we are taking our company to new highs. It has been wonderful. It looks cool, it's a great day, but you have to be open to everything you see and to those who tell you they don't understand what is going on. You have to tell them it is going to be alright.
