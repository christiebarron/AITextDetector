Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects of computers on people. Over the course of the last few decades, technology has advanced so rapidly that it has already become embedded in our daily routines. Computers are becoming increasingly important in our lives, and there is no denying that they have created an immense impact on the way we survive in modern society. 

First and foremost, it’s important to recognize the positive influences computers have had on the lives of individuals. Research has shown that computers help increase efficiency, accuracy, and performance, leading to better job results and increased work effectiveness. With the help of computers, there are endless possibilities to learn, explore, and experience new things. Computers also provide additional entertainment, allowing us to watch movies, play video games, and connect with people around the globe. 

On the other hand, there are certain negative impacts computers have had on people. Computers make it easier to become distracted and diverted from meaningful relationships with other humans. Furthermore, there is the potential for addiction, with studies showing that compulsive computer usage can lead to physical and psychological health issues. And lastly, too much time spent in front of the screen can lead to neglecting one’s physical and mental health. 

All in all, it’s important to recognize both the positive and negative side of computers. I believe that if used in the correct manner, computers can be quite beneficial
