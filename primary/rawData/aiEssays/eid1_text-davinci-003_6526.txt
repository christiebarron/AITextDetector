Dear Editor,

As technology has advanced, computers have become an integral part of society. From online classes and business meetings to playing video games, it’s hard to think of a situation where computers don’t play a role. However, it’s important to keep in mind the effects computers have on people.

At one end of the spectrum, computers can help us stay productive, connected, and informed. They allow us to work from home or in remote locations, giving us the opportunity to interact with more people than ever before. Additionally, computers can provide educational opportunities for people of all ages, both in the classroom and in their own homes. Furthermore, the amount of information available on the internet is unparalleled and often invaluable.

At the other end of the spectrum, computers can be an addiction. Spending too much time in front of a screen can lead to physical ailments such as headaches, eye strain, and poor posture. It can also lead to mental health issues, such as depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Research has also suggested a link between computer usage and low self-esteem.

Overall, it’s safe to say that computers have both positive and negative impacts on people. While it’s important to recognize the various benefits computers can bring us, it’s equally important to understand their potential drawbacks. We should take steps to limit our usage and make sure we’re not missing out on valuable experiences
