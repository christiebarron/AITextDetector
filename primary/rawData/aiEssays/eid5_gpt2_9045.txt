The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' by a young American writer named Edie Thomas reflects what happened to her father as she struggled to make ends meet. After he turned 40, Thomas recalls, she told him about the pain that young men went through in their work. "He kept crying because he didn't go home."

The next day, Thomas says, she was able to talk for hours with her father and two of his closest friends, and he wrote her a letter of apology to her father. But her father was concerned. "I said, 'I don't wish to hear that.' " recalls Thomas.

But the father's concern was justified when she read him, which led to her father's letter being forwarded to her mother by email (in full above). By then, Thomas was living a life well below the law.

Not only did she spend a time at a local strip club every day - though she was never in a car, with a woman or with men - she had been doing so for a very long time. "I don't think any of us would have dreamed about that at that age," she writes.

"How long has been it since you have met a man? Why have you never talked to a woman?" Thomas asks.

Although Thomas describes the physical, emotionally and psychologically scarring of her childhood, she also claims that it has only affected her in the few moments that occurred outside of marriage
