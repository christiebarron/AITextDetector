Dear Editor, 

I am writing today to voice my opinion on the impacts computers have on people in todayâ€™s world. I believe computers have had a largely positive effect on the way people think and live.

First and foremost, computers have made our lives more convenient and efficient. For instance, researching a particular topic used to require long hours, poring through library books. Now, we can use a few clicks to find the information we need in moments. Communications have also been revolutionized by computers. It used to be that sending a message required physical mail delivery which could take days or weeks. Now, with chat programs, emails, and instant messaging, we can reach people all over the world in an instant.

But computers have had an effect on our lives in other, subtler ways. We have access to more knowledge than ever before. With the help of computers, we can gain insights into cultures and histories that we would never have access to otherwise. We can find books, websites, blogs, and various other sources of knowledge that we can dive into and learn from. Computers can even be used for creative pursuits, such as writing, editing, and music production.

In conclusion
