An example of a time someone in my life was patient was that moment my husband lost consciousness and was in a car accident while riding his horse in Iowa. I had worked an extremely long time and I couldn't believe how wonderful and normal it was. He was walking and was laughing and he felt great. He was getting on the way up his journey and feeling good, at the same time, his spirits were up. He was taking the stairs to the front of the house and when Secure walked in with a flashlight the young man knew he was there.

So Secure had brought a lantern to the window of my house. He would not see my husband or let me know what he was doing. He kept saying: "I need to get the other kids out of this. I can see you. You need to go back to your family. Look here I have a little problem you had. It looks like you got a tattoo on your arm. So I will fix it. How bad is it?"

I wasn't going to be able to walk away from Secure, and I couldn't be more thankful. We were all so thankful for how fortunate this young man had been. We were all so thankful for how thankful for his beautiful wife. You can't take the time to thank those people, but to put the little man's life into wordsâ€¦ how much more thank you can it be to our other children.
