One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was playing Dungeons & Dragons. I used to talk about games after an hour or so and I was hooked. I was excited to be at something big. I also had the idea of setting up my first gaming group â€“ we had some fun together with my brother. We got on to something when he came back from a break to show us all the new gaming equipment that we could bring to the game (yes we just got a new controller that we could use to play D&D)! We spent our day playing at the store for most of the day while he went out and bought a game controller to run at work and some more.

We played for a few more hours with someattered video game gear and then the group went to play a game (which of course we didn't even play for the entire day!) That night, we saw someone take an out game that we'd never seen before out the window. It went into the game room and began to become a bit of a conversation while we'd playing the game. They were very excited and so excited to be doing something for us. It then snowballed into a big idea that we had planned for a while that really took off.

We bought some new gaming gear and went home. We didn't play for the whole day but we still made some video games and did some gaming on my computer. We were super excited to bring the D&D games to
