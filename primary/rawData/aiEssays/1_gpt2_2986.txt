Computers have many effects on people. They can influence the way they think about the world, and change how people react to things. One possible effect is that people are better at knowing what they're missing. A person who can learn to see clearly and can follow directions can be smarter and more determined about things than one who doesn't.

I think the good news is that we now recognize the basic idea that a computer can be used for a variety of functions and applications, and that there may in the future still be computers capable of doing many different kinds of things. We now can talk to other people or try to give them instructions and make applications. We'll continue to see people learn more about computers and more about technology, and we'll discover ways to learn more about computing. I hope to expand this with more of my interviews with other people.

This week I'll be presenting a speech at the World University Conference on Social Problems, in Brussels, to the World University Initiative about machine learning. More information on this presentation on http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/wvindos.1138
