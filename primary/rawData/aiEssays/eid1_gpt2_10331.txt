Computers have many effects on people. The most important one is that many things that people do in response to stimuli are always going to do something, and in turn, do something that makes someone happy. That's why you'll never be able to build a better life because people will get hurt. You could say that all those people who are happy are because we started to think there were good things out there. But it takes a long time for people to develop that.

This is my conclusion: No matter who is in charge, how many people work, what job they do, how many kids do it in a year, and then you have to look at it as an individual, and that's not how you build that life. You have to look at it, understand the complexity of it, and then understand how much energy it takes to make it.

Q: If you were to get 100 people into a car in 1,000 seconds to drive home, how much would you spend?

MS: I'd spend about $5 a gallon ($5 of every gallon of one gallon or about $3 of $3 a gallon for a gallon of groceries).

I also spent $3 a gallon on food, for sure. In fact, I ended up saving $4 a gallon on food as well in the last couple of months. You could put that down to food being a lot healthier than gasoline.
