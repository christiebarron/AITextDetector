The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. At the time of the Civil War the Union Navy ordered the building to dock at its Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Some engineers on the project did not like the notion of ships docking with guns or on their roofs or with their own houses.

In August 1917, two pilots, Paul McComish and William H. Blum, opened up dirigibles for the first time since their lives were marred by illness. The pilots were flown from New York to Albany. Although they were flown to safety, they had to find new housing. This was difficult since they would not be able to run the houses on which they were flying. The pilot was to fly around town and make repairs. He had to find all the homes he could so that he could repair them in time so that he would always see and hear the news. The pilot of Captain Thomas Hickey's C.I.A. squadron was an unusual pilot as he wanted to fly to the Union and his wife, Maria, was a doctor that he wanted to help, though they were very close.

The C.I.A. had only a five-year plan through which it could operate. They would not operate directly. They had to fly on a low-altitude monoplane. Once in the air they would get there before the planes had reached the target place. And they would drop them off
