Computers have many effects on people. In particular, the brain is affected by many different factors. If you eat too many eggs, your brain will fire off more of those compounds than it should if you eat fewer. Some people who have high blood pressure or diabetes, for example, need to eat a more saturated fat diet in order to maintain this level of energy, so they may eat a diet low in saturated fat.

Why so high in saturated fat? Some studies suggest that some saturated fat occurs in other foods, such as dairy products, because it is high in cholesterol.

How much can be saturated fat? In many trials, researchers have found that consuming the same amount of saturated fat daily can improve blood health and increase your immune system's ability to fight infection, disease, and injury and to fight inflammation. (If you want to read more about how saturated fat affects brain activity, visit the American Heart Association's website.)

In contrast, some studies suggest that the intake of dietary saturated fat is higher in people with high cholesterol and high blood pressure. Because of the high amounts of saturated fat in the diet, more fat is put in the bloodstream, which causes atherosclerosis, or thromboembolism.

Why do all people with atherosclerosis have cholesterol levels higher than average? In addition to cholesterol, some people with high cholesterol also develop hypertension. With too much cholesterol, heart disease symptoms and other cardiac problems can increase.
