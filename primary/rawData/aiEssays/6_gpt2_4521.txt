The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In order to allow them to pass over many windows (which could then become obstacles for passing through), the first required window construction was with a wall to obstruct the view of the bridge. The problem of this required the installation of "spine bridge" spans with walls to restrict the view of the bridge, with the effect of increasing the danger to pedestrians. These spans needed to be at least 1m wide, and at least 1m thick, for the viewing and navigation of the bridge. Despite these construction requirements, the Empire State Building finally began to provide dirigibles that could be used to navigate this area.

In 1797, the U.S. Government made a proposal to include the observation tower of the New York City Bridge with the Empire State Building. This proposal included a high-speed, beam-driven dirigible capable of carrying an enormous amount of cargo, but the public was not interested in the cargo. They had only to pay $1700.00 to be allowed to fly over the roof and fly inside the building without getting any tickets.

On 5 June 1799, The US Government finally enacted an ordinance to allow dirigibles. This proposal included a high-speed, beam-driven dirigible, capable of carrying an enormous amount of cargo, but the public was not interested in the cargo. They had only to pay $1700.00 to be allowed
