I recently went to the doctor for a regular checkup and the wait was longer than usual. I was already running late to my appointment but I decided to just stay put and wait. I can recall the faces of the other patients in the waiting room, all of us growing increasingly impatient with each ticking minute. But instead of losing my temper, I decided to remain patient and not let my emotions get the better of me.

Eventually, my name was called in and I went in for the appointment. While I was getting my checkup done, I noticed that the doctor was struggling to find the right words and wasn't able to fully explain the details of the routine physical. Instead of pushing him to provide more details or getting frustrated, I just stayed calm and quietly asked a few clear questions so that I could understand the instructions better. I knew he was trying his best and was willing to show a little patience.

After the appointment, I thanked the doctor for his time and care. I felt proud of myself for remaining composed in such a frustrating situation. Staying patient could have been a challenge, but it was one that I was glad I was able to overcome.
