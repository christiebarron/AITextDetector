The features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead” play an integral role in the story and affect the cyclist throughout the narrative. The first and foremost feature of the setting is, of course, the rough terrain of the cycler’s path. This terrain is described as “uneven, winding, and arduous,” and it is this rough terrain that provides a potent challenge to the cyclist. Not only can the cyclist find this terrain physically grueling, but they also must constantly be aware of and prepared for the unexpected bumps and turns in the path.

The physically challenging terrain provides a great mental and emotional obstacle for the cyclist, as they must confront their fear of the unknown as they go along. In addition, the scenery of the setting also plays an important role in the story, particularly through its beauty. The cyclist remarks on the “stunning views” of the rocky valley and the “rugged mountains” that surround them. Although the cyclist is often exhausted by the journey, they take solace in the beauty of the setting and are ultimately driven to push forward.

The presence of other cyclists in the bike tour also presents a challenge to the cyclist in the story. While having a group of supportive individuals to ride with can be encouraging, the individual cyclist finds themselves in a competition with their peers, as they are all striving to be the first to make it to the top
