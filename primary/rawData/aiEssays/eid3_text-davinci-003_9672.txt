In Joe Kurmaski’s "Rough Road Ahead,” the cyclist's journey is affected by both the environment and the terrain. The rural countryside is described as having winding roads and hills, setting an atmosphere of challenge and possible danger. The cyclist faces difficult conditions that can make it hard to keep going, like the hilly terrain and less-paved roads.

The cyclist’s journey is hampered by the wind which can cause headwinds, making it difficult for the cyclist to keep going forward. The cyclist's pace is slowed by the rough and overgrown road, forcing them to travel at a slower speed and making it difficult to establish a consistent rhythm on the bike.

The cyclist also deals with the heat from the sun and the humidity from the surrounding environment. The heat saps their energy, making it even harder to press on and reach their destination. The cyclist is burdened by these physical conditions, making it difficult to continue with their journey.

The cyclist’s journey is also hampered by the lack of civilization while out on the road, making it difficult to find a place to rest or receive help if needed. This also makes it more difficult to maintain a light and positive outlook throughout the ride.
