The author uses the ending to draw a comparison between the return of the hibiscus flower in the spring and the protagonist, Mei, preparing to take a new test the following year. The author implies that both Mei and the hibiscus have gone through a period of challenge and adversity, yet they are still standing and can look forward to a future of new growth. This ending conveys hope and resilience, which is a fitting message for the story as a whole.
