One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I told a friend there was a joke and she turned it down. When they came with me to the shop they told me I can still laugh.

"But they'll do what they can to help with that. I don't want to do that. I am a writer. I am a human being. And so it wasn't fun at that time."

A friend said it was a big step.

"So now I want to help people as much as I can get my laugh," she commented.

She is hoping to have the opportunity to work on more than the one-trick pony series.

"But of course if people were to learn from my story, I would certainly like to be considered for a part. And if I am still in my mid-30s I am doing that," she said.

But they might not realise how much they're willing to give them in exchange for finding the right words.
