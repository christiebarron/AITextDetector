I've always loved laughing with my friends. For me, it's one of the great joys of life.

Recently, I was out to dinner with a group of friends. We had a great time chatting and catching up. There were plenty of jokes and lots of good-natured ribbing. 

As the evening progressed, the conversation grew quite silly. We started making up absurd stories and comparing childhood memories. Eventually, I couldn't help myself and I started laughing so hard that I was shaking. 

Everyone at the table was soon laughing along with me. The laughter was contagious and we just couldn't seem to stop. Tears were streaming down our faces and, in between gusts of laughter, we kept repeating the stories that had us doubled over in stitches. 

It was one of the best times I've ever had with my friends and it reminded me that, no matter how serious life can get, it's always possible to find joy in the little moments. 

So, if you're ever feeling down, I recommend spending some time with friends who will make you laugh. Trust me, it's definitely worth it.
