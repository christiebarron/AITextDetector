Dear Editor, 

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people today. From my perspective, computers have enabled us to be incredibly productive, and stay connected to our loved ones, as well as people across the world.

Though undoubtedly useful, I believe that computers can also have detrimental effects on us. To start, computer use could be linked to mental health problems such as depression or anxiety. People can become addicted to being online, which has been identified as a factor in many cases of mental illness. Being constantly exposed to screens can fatigue our brains, or cause headaches or neck problems from not having the correct posture.

I believe that we should take the time to understand our computer use and use them responsibly. It is important to ensure we take regular breaks from screens, remain active, and get enough rest. We must be mindful of how our computer use affects our physical wellbeing as well as our mental and emotional wellbeing.

At the same time, computers allow us to spread our ideas and opinions, and they have given us access to immense knowledge. Computer usage allows us to advance in many aspects of life, and if used correctly, our lives can be enriched.

I am confident that if we all limit our computer use responsibly and monitor our mental health, computers can be used for our benefit and not be detrimental to our wellbeing. I hope my readers will agree with me as we must appreciate the technology we have at our fingertips
