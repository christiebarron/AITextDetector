The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it tells the story of a young young student on a mission to save a dying planet from a technologically advanced alien war machine. This mission, from the perspective of the author, has yet to take place, but the book shows that a lot of the plot points do exist. The main character is still at this very early point in the story so he has little idea what he is actually doing unless he's just exploring the galaxy to help discover a new weapon. The only two times where the story ends is in the third book's book. I wish there was an introduction to the alien war machine, because the writing Von Neumann seems capable of providing, even though he knows nothing about any of the alien weapons you might find.I did just want to point out what would have happened had those aliens had survived on Mars as usual. The book was based on the official series for Space: the sequel, and I wasn't so fond the first book. It never looked like any kind of futuristic future. But, like most of the events, it worked out for them. Even the fact that the main character has his girlfriend and his best friend killed was a major point for me. It shows him being a good person and being a good individual, but being like a bad person doesn't matter. Von Neumann is kind of a poor man's man in terms of making his universe look cool, no matter how many other characters he creates
