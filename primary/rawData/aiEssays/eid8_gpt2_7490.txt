One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I saw the man with the black pants, he pulled me over and walked over my shoulders.


We then walked over to the car with our children and the teacher. He sat me down next to the teacher and started beating my face. Then he told me that he told me what I need to do and how to do it. He told me how to love the person and how much I needed it. He made the best choice I have ever had and I am very happy for him.


As a father I never think of what this man did to me or make a difference. He is a decent man and does what he likes within his power.


Thank god I am able to talk to one person at a time, not just my parents who went down from college during his time.


Thank heaven it was my family who allowed him to go down here and to take me back where I had always come from. I will always be praying for them all and always with all my life. -Rochelle, New Mexico
