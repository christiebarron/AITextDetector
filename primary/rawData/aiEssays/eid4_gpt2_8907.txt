The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because, with an extra chapter dedicated to it, we don't have to rehash a bunch of important facts â€“ the books you've already read, including most of the more recent novels written by them. We could even rehash several well-known facts because they'd already been forgotten by an erstwhile reader and we can make something of them later on.

The thing with the modern story is, you're more likely to get it right in writing a novel than if you're just starting from scratch. A good book will get written in roughly 45 minutes, but not a great novel in just 5 or 15 minutes, so that's just not in my book.

The only way to get the best book for you is by sticking with what you know the best and not writing that book when it actually comes together. Once you get to that point, you should be fine writing the book for that amount of time (I recommend a 30 - 100 minute book each).

I know there may be others who find my writing, as difficult as some of the authors, frustrating, but I try to keep them honest and honest in my writing, and take the time and patience I spend with these books to keep them honest and honest. So you can expect the same in all of your stories.
