Dear Editor, 

It is no secret that in todayâ€™s society, computers play a major role in day-to-day life. As a result, there is much debate over the effects computers have on people. I believe that computers have both positive and negative impacts.

On the one hand, computers have the capability to make life much easier. Nowadays, computers are used by students to research topics for essays, stores use barcodes for inventory, and large companies use computers to calculate their payrolls and track their profits. There is no denying that computers make information more accessible and tasks that would take much more time to complete now, can be done in a fraction of the time.

On the other hand, some argue that computers may invoke too much reliance on technology and lead to people becoming lethargic and more inclined to use their computers for entertainment and social media, at the expense of their physical and mental health. In addition, computers can be used as a platform for cyberbullying and other potential hazards to our children. 

Overall, I believe the advantages of computers far outweigh the drawbacks. With proper use, technology can be of great benefit to us all. As long as we stay vigilant and make wise decisions when it comes to the use of our computers, we can all be successful in reaping the rewards that come along with this type of technology.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
