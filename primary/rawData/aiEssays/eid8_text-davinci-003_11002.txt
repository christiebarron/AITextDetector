I had been nervous to go on a blind date with someone I met on a dating app. My friends had egged me on for weeks, telling me I deserved a break from my studies. I finally agreed, and headed out to meet my date.

When I arrived at the cafe, I was apprehensively looking around for him when I heard a loud peal of laughter. I saw him then, in the corner, looking my way and laughing. Embarrassed, I waved and went over to join him.

He stood up to greet me and the energy between us was electric. We spent the rest of the evening talking and laughing, telling jokes and making up stories. I liked the way the laughter felt. We talked so easily and naturally that I felt like I had known him forever. 

The evening ended sooner than I had hoped. I left the cafe sharing knowing glances and smiles. Our conversation was light and carefree but full of understanding.

Laughter was the key to unlocking the connection between us. It helped us to build a bridge of understanding and new trust that was stronger than any awkwardness. In that moment, laughter was the shortest distance between us.
