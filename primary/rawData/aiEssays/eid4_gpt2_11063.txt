It is important to note that this book was published as a free book, but is not a fully sold product, either. We still buy it if you buy your free copy. We are not responsible for any money lost if you buy the book. However, we can still offer you some useful hints, as a result of purchasing an original book from us and some of it's chapters; they are written by our friends at Amazon.com.

The book's title does not quite add anything to the story. It simply lists things you can read, like how some people died after living in a country that was so far away from your home of course. We also suggest some books and games, such as the one by the author for children and the book, and the ones from the authors (Somos) for adults.
