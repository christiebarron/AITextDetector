I remember it like it was yesterday. It was my first date with my now husband and we had just finished dinner at a nice restaurant. We wanted to cap off the evening with something fun and decided to go to the movie theater down the street.

As we were walking, we got into a playful conversation about our favorite films and what we were hoping to watch that night. We quickly descended into an argument about whether or not a certain genre of films was worth watching.

As we pressed the issue back and forth, neither of us wanting to give in, we started to get louder and louder. We didn't even realize it until we passed a couple who stopped to stare at us with their mouths agape.

Suddenly, my husband and I both burst out laughing. It was the first time on our first date that we shared a genuine laugh together. In that moment we both knew that this was something special.

We eventually agreed to disagree on our movie tastes that night, but that first laugh we shared together sealed the deal. Since then, laughter has always been some of the most treasured moments we have shared. We have come to depend on our shared laughs to keep our relationship going through the tough times.
