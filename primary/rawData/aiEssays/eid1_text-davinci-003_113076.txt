To the editor of [newspaper name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the impact that computers have had on our lives. With the emergence of technology, computers have become a fundamental part of everyday life for many people.

The efficiency and convenience of computers have certainly had a positive effect on our lives in many ways. For one, computers have enabled us to easily access information and resources, in turn equipping us to make better decisions and stay informed. Additionally, they afford us the opportunity to make connections with people all across the globe, offering us a greater diversity of perspectives and exchange of ideas than would have been possible before.

However, we should also be wary of the potential dangers of overreliance on computers. This is particularly true when it comes to our education system, where computers can promote a reliance on ‘quick solutions’ instead of critical thinking and problem-solving. Additionally, computers can lead to a sense of disconnectedness and social isolation, as the need for interaction with others and physical interaction may be reduced.

Overall, while I accept that computers have opened up a range of opportunities and advantages, I strongly believe that we must remain mindful of the risks associated with overreliance on computer technology.

 I hope that readers of this newspaper join me in recognising the importance of taking steps to use technology responsibly and in moderation.

Sincerely,
