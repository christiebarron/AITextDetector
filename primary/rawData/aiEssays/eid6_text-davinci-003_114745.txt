The Empire State Building was the first skyscraper in New York to feature a mooring mast that was meant to be a docking station for dirigibles. However, the construction of the mooring mast and allowing dirigibles to dock posed many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome.

One of the most significant challenges faced by the designers of the mooring mast was ensuring it would be strong and steady enough to handle the large airships. The Empire State Building stood at 102 stories tall and the steel mast had to be built at the top of the building, reaching up even higher to 400 ft. Designers had to construct a 900 ft. cable system that included steel wires, pulleys, and metal eyelets that would securely anchor the dirigible to the building. This was a formidable challenge as it had never been done before and it would need to be able to withstand very strong winds and varying weather. The designers had to be precise with their calculations and measurements to make sure the mast was strong and anchored securely in order to properly support the weight, pressure, and movement of the airships.

Another challenge the Empire State Building faced was figuring out the most efficient way for dirigibles to dock. Initially, the designers planned to have the air ships circle the building and lower their grapples to attach to cables at the top of the mast, however this proved to be inefficient and time consuming. They eventually replaced the overhead cables
