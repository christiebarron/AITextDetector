The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' by photographer John Brimmer was much different. The song is about an old friend's death in the 1950s/early 60s. An aging friend was killed in his own house in the early 90s as a result of his alcohol and drug addiction. He eventually took over, and had to turn his life around on behalf of his estranged wife and the others involved.

Brimmer, who had shot 'From Home is' with three of his closest friends, is from the small town of Rockbridge, Virginia. 'From Home is' won the National Book Award, and was covered at the time by Rolling Stone. It was also the subject of a 2011 documentary directed by filmmaker Michael Cera, called 'The Life of Mark Brimmer'. The documentary was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award (winning actress Kate Beckinsale for 'The Best Young Actor'), Best Director at the International Film Festival, and Best Picture at the Venice International Film Festival.

The memoir 'From Home' may have had a more'realistic' purpose. It's not the last word in Brimmer's story of how he started off sobbing and taking pills after hearing about being raped and killed in the 1960s. The author, whose memoir 'From Home is' won the National Book Award, tells us that he was just 15 after being taken into treatment for alcoholism on September 24th 2000 at his home in Green Rock, Arkansas.
