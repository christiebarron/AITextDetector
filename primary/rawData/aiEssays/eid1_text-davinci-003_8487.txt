I recently had the pleasure of seeing firsthand the incredible patience of my mother. During the Covid-19 pandemic, my mother was struggling with deep anxiety. She was worried about contracting the virus, feeling isolated, and was concerned about the future. 

I struggled to console her due to feeling anxious myself. But despite the difficult situation, my mother refused to succumb to fear and instead held onto patience. She practiced gratitude every day, meditated regularly, and utilized breathing exercises to stay calm.

I really admired the way she was able to remain patient even during such a difficult time. She never stopped believing that things would eventually get better. Whenever I felt frustrated and wanted to give up, I thought of my mother's patience and it inspired me to remain calm and to continue to trust in the future.
