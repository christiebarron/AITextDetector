In the song “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, the setting plays an important role in how it affects the cyclist. This is seen through the numerous references to the environment and the descriptions of the cyclist’s experience. 

The setting of the song is a long and arduous journey on an unpaved road. This affects the cyclist because it is physically taxing, requiring greater effort from the cyclist to traverse the surface. This is seen in lyrics such as “bumpy road ahead” and “every bumpy mile felt like ten.” These descriptions imply that the road is difficult to traverse and highlights the physical effort required of the cyclist.

Furthermore, the setting also seems to represent a metaphorical journey through life. The road is described as long and dark, with “nowhere to call a friend”. This description implies a sense of loneliness, suggesting that the cyclist is alone on their journey through life. This is echoed in other lyrics such as “but I kept pushing” which implies a personal strength that is only strengthened by the difficult environment.

Overall, the features of the setting in “Rough Road Ahead” greatly affect the cyclist’s experience. It is both a physical and a metaphorical journey that is characterized by difficulty and loneliness. It is this journey, and the challenges it brings, that allows the cyclist to grow stronger and discover their strength.
