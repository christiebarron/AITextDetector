I believe that censorship of materials in libraries and libraries across the United States would be a useful tool."


The group, which works on issues related to technology and diversity, is also concerned about the new law, says Nettleton. The legislation, passed Thursday, would place state and local governments on notice that in some cases, their offices need to be made public with the names of the people to whom funds should be spent.

Supporters say the new law is a step toward transparency in libraries by letting state and local governments know where funding is going and is an action that will make libraries better places to practice. However, it would also require that libraries be closed for 90 days for violations.

The new legislation, Nettleton says, will increase law enforcement's monitoring of libraries. He says the new law and the language on the proposed legislation are "not perfect but they're important steps to make our libraries better places to practice."
