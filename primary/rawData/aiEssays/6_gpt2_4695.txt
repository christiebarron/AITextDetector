The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Each unit has an air compressor and two air compressors, which had to be bolted shut first, to avoid obstructing the vertical separation of the air compressor. In the end, however, the ducted air compressor separated the building's exterior light and the building's interior lighting. Finally, the "Fantastic Four" came to the rescue when the building's ceiling collapsed and the stairwell of the ceiling was toppled off its foundations.

The Empire State Building was constructed in 1917 by an architect known as Frederick K. Ochs, Sr., and was completed in 1948. At the time, the Empire State was a residential property, so it's a bit of a surprise to come across a building designed by such a skilled developer. Even so, the building's original plan states that the building would be enclosed for more than 30 years, making it the longest working-class building in the state.

The building's modern design reflects that, according to the architectural firm of F.W. Bader, the original plan provided architects with a high level of control and flexibility that ensured that the building would not be completely isolated from the rest of Manhattan. And of course, the tower itself was a complete disaster!
