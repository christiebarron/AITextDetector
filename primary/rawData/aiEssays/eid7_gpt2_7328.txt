An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the woman called in sick to be taken to hospital to be checked out. I had to pay a $1.3.100. Another was a group of people waiting in the parking lot and waiting outside asking for assistance. All the waiting was over the radio and I didn't want anyone to get hurt but I am very happy to be able to give your story and tell someone. The people did ask for some stuff. Even though it does help with the medical bills they still got me a good one and gave me a great feeling to call. I just got back the little bit and will be back next week. Thanks so much for sharing your stories and I hope you enjoy this interview.

And in your first storyâ€¦

It seems to have taken some time to finish but thanks for the help I got a good one. Also I am still working on it in college so I am pretty happy with my final post. Keep 'em coming in here at the top.

Thank you. And a few more from your show:
