Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, creates a sense of nostalgia and longing. Rodriguez's abstract memories of growing up in the Bronx, blended with the physical story of his escape to New York City, craft an overarching sense of wanting the past and striving for the future. 

There is a sense of temporal ambivalence within the narrative. Rodriguez grapples with his mother's longing for her home in El Salvador and his own desire to establish a place of permanence. Through his recollections, Rodriguez captures the emotion of this fundamental duality — being torn between the past and the future. 

The author sets most of his narrative in the past. He takes us into the corners of his childhood home and into the stories that were whispered around the dinner table. He reflects on memories of nightfall, when his mother told stories of the Virgin Mary — stories that he still remembers after all these years. 

The mood created is one of beauty and melancholy, of dreaming and existing between two places. Rodriguez's narrative captures the feeling of wanting something that feels distant, yet at the same time treasuring the closeness of childhood memories. Rodriguez's beautiful prose and imagery, filled with nostalgia and longing, create a one of a kind story that lingers.
