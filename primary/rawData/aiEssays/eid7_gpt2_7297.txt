An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a girl who lost her entire life. She was not a young woman, but I knew where she went where she lived. I wanted to help her find peace and let her use the best of my life. As a friend, even as a person, I knew that in my time I could be compassionate and support others and my friends too. Thank you so much, Dr. Lott. Thank you again for all of your kindness and compassion. [Pause.]

If we want to live in a world where everything is valued and our work is valued, we would like to do all we can to protect our freedoms. If we want to live in a world of equality that is free and equal for all of us to thrive, we need to work together to give equal protection to all. In our lives, we must make the decisions we make and treat others equally. And that's what we are going to do in coming weeks. In coming days, we will look to you for support. We will be there for you when we say yes â€” and we will always be there with you.
