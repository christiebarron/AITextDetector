Computers have many effects on people. It can lead to depression, which is something that we often associate with social anxiety. It also can contribute to depression. People who have the same problem, or both, can interact with each other, but it's a different form of discrimination than it is for those who are at peace with what we are.

A large body of research has been based on this. For example, the University of Rochester and the University of Arizona found that one in three people in the United States have a severe form of "racial anxiety disorder." This can be classified as "psychopathology" or a "psychopathic disease" (or whateverolving on the basis of such criteria).

A number of studies have found that some Americans become self-sabotaged. But, as is generally the case, "I am well aware of my experiences with depressionâ€¦I'm very familiar with all types of conditions and people who suffer from this facilitates self-sabotaging and recovery of their suffering."

It can be seen, for instance, that in more than half the years leading up to the 2004 Presidential election, over 400 people, or one out of every four Americans, had suffered "depressive symptoms." That's a high rate of suicidal thoughts, and if that's the case, "people who have mental illness get depressed sometimes or the first time it gets out of control, but they never give up that hope."
