The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The city argued that their use would result in more problems with an airport â€” particularly for tourists coming to Chicago and the suburbs. They argued that if planes flew into Chicago by taxi and then landed on the site, passengers would lose their access to Chicago's main thoroughfares.

The architects agreed in the end, leaving aside the issue of which kind of cars would arrive at the airport if planes made the right turn. The government of Chicago considered what the cost had been before building the International Olympic Village and other such facilities, and was presented with a proposal to purchase an airplane at a cost of $3 million with no impact on Chicago's airport system.
