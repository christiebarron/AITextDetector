I once had a friend who I hadn't talked to in years. We had a lot of nostalgia for our friendship, so we decided to reconnect. But it was a slow process because we both had a lot of obligations. We decided to try and make time for each other, but it wasn't easy. I was busy with work and my family life and my friend had just had a child.

We often had plans that had to be cancelled or postponed, such as meeting up for dinner or catching a movie. But each time this happened, my friend was incredibly patient and understanding. Even when we were both running late or had to put something off until a later date, there was never any frustration or anger from her.

It was a reminder to me that patience is key when it comes to relationships. Even though it was difficult to coordinate our schedules, it was easy to stay friends because my friend was so patient. She knew that sometimes life can be unpredictable, and that we needed to accommodate such uncertainties. That kind of grace and understanding allowed us to eventually get back on track and rekindle our friendship.
