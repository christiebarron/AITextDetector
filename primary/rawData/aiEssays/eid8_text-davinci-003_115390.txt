As I drove up to the house to meet her parents for the first time, I remember feeling a bit apprehensive. My hands were sweaty on the steering wheel and my mind raced with the fear of saying or doing something wrong. I was so focused on not making any mistakes that I almost didn't notice her right away in the doorway as I pulled up.

She saw me though, and as I got out of the car, she suddenly burst into the most infectious laughter. It was the kind of laugh that makes your heart jump and your cheeks hurt, the kind that is so full of joy that you can't help but laugh too. Before I could even manage a hello, I was already joining in her laughter, the slight tension I had been feeling quickly replaced by this easy and wonderful moment. 

It was then that I realized how silly I had been worrying. Her parents were going to love me for sure, if only because I was able to make their daughter laugh like that. We may have been two nervous strangers in that moment, but in the moments that followed it was laughter that really got us through.
