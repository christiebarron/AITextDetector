An example of a time someone in my life was patient was in the Navy. After that, most of us were out for food and then at a certain juncture we started doing a job in the Navy. It was a very tough time for me as a person. But I didn't want to go back. I didn't want to let my family down. I just wanted my mom and dad in the Navy so that I could go to school. It was a very hard time for me. I would look out for myself to make sure I wasn't leaving the Navy. I wanted those kids to have fun and be around other kids too.

This year, my family and I were at a wedding. I don't know what you were doing on that trip to Hawaii to celebrate the ceremony. I didn't even go home because I wasn't so happy about it, I was in Japan. My wife and I were still married, but it wasn't that easy. But I would be away from our house to go to school. I would be away from my family and work. So, my family would be at a ball game, and I would hear their favorite radio show of all time, that was at the ball FD.

People are still talking about you and some people have expressed a desire to meet you, but that doesn't mean you want to meet that. It doesn't mean it's a good time.
: We still plan on meeting you shortly
