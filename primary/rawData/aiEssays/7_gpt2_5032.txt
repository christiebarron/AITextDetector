An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a patient in my own life who died. She was a young, beautiful young woman. I couldn't even begin to imagine how she had fallen apart, all over her body. She wasn't going to die, it was just that she didn't do it. It was just like being a good kid or something.

This happens all the time. So I have to remember that I'm not alone. What I'm about to look at is how things have just started getting weird. What if I don't know you? Maybe that's not what the story is for you, but maybe that's who I am, that I get it. Maybe that's not who I am. These are things that happened to me or to anyone around me. The world seems to have forgotten this, and we're left to cope with what's happened. For us, it's really the world, and the world has to be able to hear our stories, and to let ourselves talk.

Why did you create this project out in the first place?

For me, as a person, the whole idea behind that project is that there are many things that can harm this world, but the most important thing is that you always come to that life in your own little way. I have to say that about all of these people that I've ever met â€” they're amazing people or amazing people, I hear it all the time
