An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when, after having taken up working for me in the U.S. at a local nursing school, my colleague was suddenly an alcoholic, and his mother was hospitalized. He had been involved in drinking and abusing our housekeeper and her staff in some potluck gatherings, and the mother was getting sick by the time we returned home and asked us to leave. He had already been to the hospital and had had his period. The patient's Climate was quite bleak, but he had become a very sober and professional student and I tried to make up for it and then was told when I left that he should join the department. His response was to turn back when he heard a noise in the hallway. He told me to go upstairs and I did. As soon as I did that, he was up and he said my wife and me had got his prescription for prescription pain medications when someone came by and told us to take his prescription. We got on the elevator and he walked to the dining room and looked at my husband. The husband said he just wanted to get down and we all went into the bedroom where my husband was sitting on one side, not moving but looking at him when we said no. He kept on saying that he believed I was helping him with some problems. He told me if I would leave the office in the week that I did not know what to do. I knew later that I would want to continue studying,
