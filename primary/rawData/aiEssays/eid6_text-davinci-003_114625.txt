The Empire State Building, when first constructed in 1931, posed an incredible challenge to the builders who sought to allow docking of dirigibles. However, in spite of the obstacles that presented themselves, they persevered to craft a technical marvel that continues to amaze and impress generations of people. 

The most apparent obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building needed to overcome was the height of the building. With a massive height of 1,250 feet, it extended far beyond the area where most dirigibles hovered in the sky. The engineers had to devise a way to anchor the dirigibles to the building, which proved to be more difficult than initially anticipated. 

The solution was discovered with the introduction of the mooring mast. While other buildings in the area featured similar mooring masts, none of them extended nearly as high. With the installation of the mooring mast, the engineers were able to provide an anchor point for dirigibles due to its height of 1,502 feet. This mooring mast, which was an engineering marvel in its time, allowed the secure docking of dirigibles by using a system of shock absorbers which absorbed the shock of the dirigibles anchoring and reduced the risk of damage. 

The success of this mooring mast was further established with the advent of the Graf Zeppelin airship which safely docked on the mooring mast of the Empire State
