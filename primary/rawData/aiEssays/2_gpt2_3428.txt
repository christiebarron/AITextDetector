I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is the greatest source of social justice. They help us to take the most radical ideas that are taboo and take radical action against those who are threatening social movements.

The First Amendment allows us to make a public and personal decision about political discourse. I believe that the First Amendment rights that we protect will ultimately be determined by how widely we use things. That means as we go to make sure that schools keep open the debate around ideas, let people debate the debate about freedom of expression and our respect for ideas.

I see a lot of power that we give people that the right to tell their stories is used to justify this kind of censorship. A lot of people would love to have rights to tell their stories. Well if that didn't happen, we wouldn't have been able to stop the rise of these new political movements that have gotten people out of the dark and into the light.

So for someone sitting over and holding their phone as they're reading this, we have to take something with people. We have to take someone away. The First Amendment doesn't give us that right to express ourselves.

So I would strongly condemn any type of censorship, and I'm a huge believer in public debate. It never seems to work like that.

Praise God

Michele Larkin: Good question Mancini. We have to go back and learn how to be political, as far as political science goes
