The setting of Joe Kurmaski's 'Rough Road Ahead' is of paramount importance to understanding the struggles the cyclist faces in the story. Set in an impoverished town on the outskirts of a much larger city, the cyclist is both physically and psychically tortured by his living conditions, environmental hazards, and a lack of resources.

The cyclist’s physical struggle is a direct result of the town’s unfortunate condition. With roads that are in desperate need of repair, potholes and debris fill the streets, offering only a few treacherous strips of pavement that may be wide enough for bicycle passage. The conditions pose a constant threat of injury to the cyclist and his ability to remain on course, as small hiccup can leave the cyclist bruised and battered.

The cyclists mental struggles are greatly influenced by his desolate living situation. A sense of hopelessness fills the town, with all those within it relegated to the same destitute fate. On the outskirts of the larger city, the cyclist is constantly reminded of the bright future that is available only to others as he is forced to face the consequences of his lack of economic privilege.

Fast paced, the cyclists journey is fraught with danger, physical and emotional. The reader is placed in the cyclists shoes while Joe Kurmaski paints a vivid picture of his environment. The setting of this story creates a challenging, but formidable experience for the cyclist, allowing for a unique, non-linear structure of progression and growth
