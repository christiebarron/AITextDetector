Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my opinion on the effects that computers have on people. Many people believe computers are only beneficial, allowing for enhanced communication, easier access to information, and increased efficiency for businesses. While these positives certainly exist, there is an aspect of computers that is too often overlookedâ€”their negative impacts.

Computers are believed to foster creativity and independence. However, many people's lives have become dependent on their computers. We have become so reliant on computers that a shortage of technology can easily result in a widespread lack of productivity. Additionally, computers can become a source of distraction. Hours can be wasted browsing the internet, watching movies, or playing video games.

Furthermore, computers can contribute to social isolation. Spontaneous face-to-face conversations are no longer common. Friendships are maintained primarily through online interaction or apps. Unfortunately, this lack of physical connection can result in a lack of meaningful relationships in life.

In short, people need to be aware of the potential drawbacks of computers and use them responsibly. Too often, we forget the importance of meaningful relationships and fail to recognize when technology usage has become excessive. Taking mindful steps to monitor our use of technology can ensure that it is used in a beneficial manner and not as a form of escape.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
