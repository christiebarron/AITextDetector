Computers have many effects on people. They alter their metabolism and physiology, affect their ability to communicate, or they change their skin color. What happens after these effects are passed down among pitcher's offspring or through a gene, remains unknown.


Some of these effects may be reversible. These include:


Change in the way your skin color appears on your face

Reduction in the color of your skin

Redness of your skin

Decrease in your sweating response

When your body changes, it changes from being more "soft" to more "mugger"

When you're in heat, your skin starts to harden and be difficult to control. When you're in cold weather, your skin begins to lose its ability to absorb sweat and your skin becomes reddish-brown. Some of these chemicals, such as phenolic compounds, can act on your skin by increasing your body temperature. They can also be used to cause the skin cells to lose their ability to fight off the effects of heat.

A more recent study found that some genetic factors were responsible for preventing changes in melanin pigment. In this case, the findings were that you could, in effect, be more like your original skin type than a person of color.

Another gene for human skin change is CYL1Y-IRX. The gene and its associated genes are responsible
