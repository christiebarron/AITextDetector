Censoring books, music, movies, and magazines in libraries is a hotly debated topic. On one side of the aisle, some argue that offensive materials should not be available to the public, while on the other side, many argue for freedom of speech and the right of Library patrons to make up their own minds regarding what they consider offensive. 

I believe that a library’s collection should reflect a diverse range of viewpoints, including those that may be seen as offensive. Libraries should remain as free and open sources of knowledge, so that all patrons can access the materials of their choosing. It is not the responsibility of the library staff to censor materials and create an environment that only exposes patrons to opinions that may fit into certain accepted norms or viewpoints. 

If a patron finds a book or other material offensive, they are free to disapprove and not read or use the material. The library, however, should not be the one to make the call on individual material. Furthermore, libraries are not responsible for being a form of entertainment, and it is the patron’s responsibility to decide which materials they find suitable. 

Censorship can lead to a stifling of free expression and alternative points of view, which are important for a balanced perspective on any given issue. Instead, library staff should be there to assist patrons in locating the materials they need while providing an impartial, helpful service. The idea of libraries should be that of a sanctuary for readers,
