It was my first date with Karen, and I had been really nervous the whole night. Everything felt new and unfamiliar. Dinner was awkward and slow, and I wasn't sure if things would work out between us. 

But then, one of us said something that made the other laugh. Suddenly, a bridge seemed to be formed. We both just started laughing hysterically. I remember it felt like the most genuine expression of joy that I had ever experienced. 

The laughter continued through dinner, and even spilled over into the drive back. Unlike during dinner, it felt like conversation was now free-flowing. It was if a barrier between us had been torn down.

By the end of the night, I felt an indescribable closeness to Karen that I hadn't even expected. I realized then that laughter is a powerful connective force between two people. It can bring warmth and understanding like nothing else. 

I'm happy to say that Karen and I have been together ever since that night. We still laugh like crazy when we're together.
