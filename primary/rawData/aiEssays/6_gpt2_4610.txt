The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. They wanted to use small mirrors with a window on the top to provide safety, so the idea was for them to connect the front and back windows from the inside.

The idea was conceived by Joseph J. Lister, who was the American architect of the Empire State Building at the time. He thought that mirrors with a top would also be useful - and that they would enable people on the outside of the building to see their surroundings without the need for a special, "loud" sound sensor.

Instead, Lister used lasers to illuminate the inside of the Empire State Building in order to help reduce the glare of the spotlight.

In the final design, which was announced in New York City, Lister painted a high-profile square with a high-quality glass overlay on every corner to prevent reflections.

When there was no glare, Lister used the mirror image to create some illumination, making the effect feel much more dramatic. Eventually, Lister's mirror was placed on the outside-to-inside gap of the building, so that people could see and hear the interior.

Other designers were also working on the project. When it was finally time to do its unveiling, Richard M. Schramm, the new vice president for design and engineering at the New York Planning Council, wrote an essay criticizing his design. He called it:
