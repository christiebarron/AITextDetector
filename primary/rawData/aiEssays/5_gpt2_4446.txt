The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' has been a reminder of just how far we went to get what we want. Yet it has, if you look at its more mature and more realistic depictions, been more prescient to your emotional reactions. The book is far too sensitive to negative moods; it's far too raw and hard to be sympathetic towards. No matter your emotions, there always is the temptation to throw stuff at a bad person.

There's not many examples, but 'From Home' is one: with its humour and humour is the way I want to convey what we want to be when we write. It's not telling you how to feel or how to respond to things - things that are not personal but are in our relationships. It may feel a bit cliché, maybe even clichéd, and it doesn't give you a genuine sense of what is happening. There's a lot of other great comedy writing on Tumblr and elsewhere, but I don't think "From Home" conveys anything we know enough to be true. The real thing is what we have at our fingertips.

'From Home' is a great work, but it's also a shame to miss that one moment in time. As I mentioned, I love every detail about the story and hope it finds a place in the larger book. It takes its readers with it, but it carries on feeling at the same time in a way its characters are.
