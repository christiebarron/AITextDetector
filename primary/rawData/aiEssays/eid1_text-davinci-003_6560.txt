Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion regarding the effects computers have had on people. I believe computers have had a significant positive impact on society. 

For starters, computers are immensely helpful in the work place, creating opportunities for increased productivity and efficiency. With the help of computers, businesses are able to generate leads and communicate with customers. Likewise, it’s easier for employers to track their employees’ progress, pay people accurately, and collaborate with colleagues from different parts of the world.

Computers also enable individuals to stay connected with one another. Social networking sites such as Facebook and Instagram facilitate the connection of family members, friends, and even strangers who share the same interests. Moreover, thanks to the internet, people can access vast amounts of information with ease.

Furthermore, computers have given everyone the opportunity to express themselves better through different forms of media. We now have the ability to share our own music, photos, videos, and art with the world.

To sum up, computers have allowed us to connect better with one another, to be more productive, and to express our creativity more eloquently. I believe that in this digital age, every home should have its own computer.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
