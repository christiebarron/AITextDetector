I recently found myself in the most awkward of circumstances at a dinner party. Out of nowhere, there was a sharp awkward silence as everyone felt the pressure to find something to say. Not being one of the most outgoing or sociable individuals, I could feel balloons of fear slowly beginning to swell in my chest. Thankfully, in the nick of time, my kindly hostess spoke up. She told a classic family joke that we all knew by heart. Everyone around the table howled with laughter. In that moment, the atmosphere completely changed, and suddenly we were all comfortable, connected, and free to carry on sharing our stories and conversations. The laughter between us helped bridge the initial awkwardness, and soon enough the dinner party was in full-swing once again. Laughter is often the best medicine, and that night was no exception.
