I remember the time I went grocery shopping with my children. My oldest was six and my youngest was three. It was an ordinary day and we had a fairly long list. 

When we got to the store, it seemed like chaos. They were running up and down the aisles and I felt like I couldn't keep up. My six year old was jumping in the cart and throwing things in the cart that I hadn't even looked at. My youngest was pulling items off of the shelves. I knew I had to stay patient even though I was frustrated and wanted to leave the store. 

I decided to take a deep breath and try to make it an enjoyable experience. So, I gave them each a grocery list and let them pick out what we needed for supper. We spent an extra hour shopping but I was proud of myself for staying patient and allowing them to be creative.

By the end of the trip they were both smiling and waving goodbye to the cashier. I was happy about the way I had responded to their enthusiasm and knew it was worth taking the extra time. Being patient at the grocery store taught me how to react to other difficult situations in the future.
