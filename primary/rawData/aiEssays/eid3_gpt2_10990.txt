Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. The cyclist's riding style, the setting of hills ahead, the position of a roadway, and then, finally, the cyclist's body position.

A range of riders have been trained to perform various 'riders' in a rough road ahead. In the following table, an approximate topographical chart will help explain the cycling method used in the following table. It will give you an idea of the potential advantages of the chosen method. It's an attempt to quantify the bike's ability to change direction and time the cyclist at different points without changing the positioning of others.

As the rider's choice and experience level goes up from this first list, there may even be some benefits to be given to the cycling method which are not otherwise described here, which is to see how it relates to others.

The Cycling Method

As the cyclist's ability rises in various ways according to the cycling method he selects, his ability will gradually increase over time.

A young cyclist may choose to move to a larger or larger riding area while riding at a higher pace, and then to take on a larger or smaller training group as he grows older, which will provide his ability with an advantage in the long run. He may choose to use less equipment or to use more equipment that is more effective for the rider or group, and this is why some bike shops will offer training for older riders.
