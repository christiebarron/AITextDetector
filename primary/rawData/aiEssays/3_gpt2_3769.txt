Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. For instance, on its face, it is a wonderful, safe ride; but it often comes across as an overly harsh and unruly experience. Here are 12 reasons why you might want to avoid the 'Rough Road Ahead' setting while enjoying cycling along it.

4. It has its own bad side

While the set is obviously a fun, enjoyable and exciting ride it isn't quite as hard to understand as it sounds - one would think that the overall experience of touring the environment would be a little less pleasant when it is quite a different landscape.

The fact that it is a very old location and it can be very difficult to get close to is also encouraging.

In some ways the setting is really 'dirty'

I would not rule out that the setting is simply not clean either. It is quite difficult to get close enough to the bike and be safe in a good, well-lit setting without all the dirt.

If you do get to where you want to go you'll likely need to stop and cycle.

But even if you do get a little close to it when setting up it just doesn't stand enough for some of your cyclists.

4. It is a little heavy on the back

The back of the track really does make biking difficult.
