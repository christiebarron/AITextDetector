The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because of the writing process. I spent months writing my first novel in June 2012 and finally finished on June 26th 2013. That was a big help because I still don't know where Winter Hibiscus will remain on a shelf so I can talk about this book even more. I hope you like it too so you can read it in your head. Thanks for reading!


This is my first review.

Reviews are all that matters. People send me suggestions, my answer is always the best, always. It doesn't matter if it's great, great, terrible, great, terrible, or terrible. Sometimes you get some great reviews, and some can be amazing and sometimes you get some great reviews, and some can be awful.


It will still be worth reading.

I'm really glad you found my review so wonderful. Thank you, everyone, you made it so much easier!

This is a lot of info but I'll only give it a 1 star. A whole lot of people know it's wrong and it's not because it's good. You should also take your time getting in touch with people interested in Winter Hibiscus and keep looking the book up, it is an amazing book, and its not what I had hoped for. I still remember reading it myself once and it ended up sounding just so good to the ears of anyone that might have read this. So,
