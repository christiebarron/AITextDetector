Dear Editor,

I am writing to share my opinion on the effects computers have on people. Computers have become a major part of our daily lives and have a significant impact on how we think, learn, communicate, and work. 

Focusing primarily on how we learn, computers have enabled us to access incredible amounts of information and knowledge. As we gain quicker and easier access to this information, it has become easier to comprehend and remember data and concepts. We are also able to take this newfound knowledge and broaden our horizons, learning more each day. Additionally, computers have revolutionized how we interact with one another. We can connect with people from around the world in an instant, allowing for never-before-seen avenues for collaboration and information sharing. 

On the other hand, too much reliance on computers has its downsides. It requires that a person be adept at using the tools available to extract information, and those who are not tech-savvy may be left behind. Furthermore, there is an increasing lack of personal contact due to people turning to emails and social media platforms to talk, as opposed to communicating face-to-face.

Overall, while there can be drawbacks to computers, the positives far outweigh them. Computers are a powerful tool that help us in many aspects of our everyday lives. I urge readers to embrace this technology and make the most of its advantages. 

Sincerely,

[Your name]
