 

I remember the night like it was yesterday. It was the first night of summer vacation and my two best friends and I had decided to hang out at the theater to watch a movie. We had laughed so hard at the previews, it felt like we had already seen the movie. 

When the film began, all I could think about was how hilarious it was. I could hardly keep from bursting out in laughter every few minutes as the characters on screen did something outrageous or said something ridiculous. It quickly became obvious to my friends and I that we hadn't been paying much attention to the movieâ€”we had been too busy giggling and cracking jokes to truly follow the plot.

When the lights came up, my friends and I were still laughing, sharing the jokes we'd made during the movie, and retelling scenes in our own words. We couldn't wait to leave the theater and make more plans for the rest of the summer. 

Laughter had connected us in such an intimate way that night and I was so grateful for those moments. It was those moments of humor and joy that made our friendship so strong. Those are the memories that I cherish most to this day.
