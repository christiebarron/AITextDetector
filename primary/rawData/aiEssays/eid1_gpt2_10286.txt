When I came across this problem in our research back in 1999, in China, they tried to study time travel. It was then, in my opinion, of very small consequence that they found that they could use computers to do that. By a certain amount. And once they have done that, you know, for a long period of time, people just kind of say, "Oh, OK, we can write these messages for a certain amount of time, can you send them a message, would you mind writing those messages for a shorter period of time?"
