Censoring books, music, movies, and magazines in public libraries is an issue that continues to be debated. Unfortunately, some people think that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are deemed offensive. This, however, is a controversial stance that must be challenged. 

Public libraries are, first and foremost, a space for education and knowledge. Believing that certain materials should be removed limits the library's ability to do so. It is undebatable that some material, such as books with hate speech or written in defence of slavery, deserve to be withheld from public access, but censoring all potentially offensive material is a slippery slope.

Given the enormous amount of information available to us, it is inevitable that some of it will be deemed offensive by some people. However, with censorship, we introduce an authoritative view of what is or is not “acceptable”. This double standard misses the point that everyone should be entitled to their own interpretation. 

If something is considered offensive to one person, it may provide important information to another. Removing certain materials from a public library ultimately limits our ability to form our own interpretations of the world. All public libraries should aim to provide a safe and respectful environment whilst also ensuring that all opinions are heard.

Drawing a line between what is to be accepted or not is not only difficult to do without bias but does an incredible disservice to the people trying to understand the content. C
