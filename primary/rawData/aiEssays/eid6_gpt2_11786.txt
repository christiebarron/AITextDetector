The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The most notable of these was that aircraft could be towed to a hangar on board the building before heading to a location on the runway that was supposed to be safe without the use of propellers, thus setting up a timely landing on the runway. On the ground the landing was delayed for six and a half hours because aircraft were prohibited from flying over the runway at all times except at a designated time when it was designated for one-hour takeoff from the runway.

By mid-February 1781 (after which the Government had officially lifted its ban on using aircraft to dock the Empire State Building), the building had undergone several modifications to its original layout, including the installation of an aircraft dock and a landing pad where passengers and their luggage would be permitted to stay. However, the building's final configuration, once again, was far from ideal. One of the major problems that led to the building's demise was the problem of its electrical connection with the runway. This, however, was less of an issue than for the other three main components of the building; the rear of the building was covered with the exposed roof and the rear section of the building that was connected to the open runway was covered with exposed metal covering. As a result, in February 1781, after ten days of delay at the hangar when the runway would be cleared by the Royal Navy, the building became virtually unusable when ships attempted to
