Dear Editor,

In this digital age, it's difficult to ignore the impact computers and technology are having on the world. It would be reasonable to argue that while technology has ushered in an array of potential benefits, it has also come with some serious drawbacks.

From a personal standpoint, I believe the adverse effects computers have on people need to be taken into account. For starters, spending excessive amounts of time on the computer can lead to physical health issues, such as poor circulation or neck and back pain from long periods of sitting in the same position. Furthermore, it is easy to lose track of time and become consumed by the web, resulting in neglecting basic needs, such as getting enough sleep or eating healthy meals.

On the mental health side, technology can be both beneficial and detrimental. It is a tool to connect with friends and family, giving us opportunities to network and stay in touch with others. However, research has also uncovered a heightened depression, anxiety, or pressure to ‘fit in’ that can occur when too much time is spent online.

In conclusion, computers undeniably offer amazing opportunities. But it is important to remain aware of the potential problems that can arise as well. If we are mindful of this, we can use technology for good, while minimizing the adverse effects it can have on our physical and mental health. 

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
