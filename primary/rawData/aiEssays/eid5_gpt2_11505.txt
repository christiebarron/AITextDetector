The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' that this was a difficult journey and it is difficult to see you as it was.


There's even a line that I've never read and it's always been on the back of every book you've ever read that there was this really difficult scene where they're going through the back of the building and everyone's like "Wait, what? No, let's just finish it at the beginning". I don't know what the exact line was.


What has been your story about it?


As you say on the book one, I am looking at it through the lens of a young black teen who happens to be in a gang of white boys in a low-income ghetto, and he is basically a drug addict, just talking to a prostitute he lives with, but in the hope that everything he says will lead him to go on to find some sort of redemption.


He goes.


I wrote, I didn't actually read the book until I read the memoir. It's pretty much about that time period. I know that he's looking at it right now, and he's very sad, or he wants to. But I'm also in the middle of the night, I'm sitting there, and he's about to leave. "What's that? I had a bad dream yesterday. Are you sorry?" It's been such a strange time, but you get to tell that story.
