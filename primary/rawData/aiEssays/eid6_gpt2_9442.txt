The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. On top of that, the dome was so large that it could only handle a full-size version of the building, meaning that the only way to put a dirigible into motion at that size was to make another dirigible.

On September 26th, 2010, former Obama cabinet secretary Valerie Jarrett released a statement titled, "For the next several years, President Obama plans on making the Empire State Building his center of gravity for the next few years. Because of the huge scale of the Empire State Building, his new plan, which will replace the two-story building that it was originally called, is a perfect fit for his plan of changing the world."

As for the actual project, this statement was made in a Facebook event with the building's founder Joe Rambold, which was held on August 9th 2010 (with the building's architect Joe Roth).

"We hope they build the new Empire State Building at the same time when its new master building will be completed," Rambold said. "If you see Joe Roth here, you've seen his new home in this beautiful facility. Joe is in there doing everything he can to make this building that much more special for him, and for all of us who know him. His work is the envy of our city."

The building was first constructed in 1906, and was designed by Samuel H. Green
