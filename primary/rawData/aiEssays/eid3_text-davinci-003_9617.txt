In the short story "Rough Road Ahead" by Joe Kurmaski, the features of the setting – particularly the terrain – have a great impact on the cyclist. The story is set in a rural area of Colorado near a lake and mountains. The road is unpaved and full of potholes, rocks, and other obstacles making the ride difficult. The cyclist is described as "a tiny figure on the open road, huffing and puffing away" and must use all of his strength to traverse the rugged terrain.

Furthermore, the landscape itself presents a challenge to the cyclist. The lake forces him to make steep climbs while the mountains provide a long, difficult descent. The lack of pavement and the rocks and potholes on the road surface add to the difficulty. The cyclist has to focus all his energy and pay close attention while he navigates the twists and turns of the road.

Finally, the environment of the story can be seen as both a challenge and an opportunity. The cyclist does not take shortcuts through the rugged terrain but instead uses it as a chance to hone his skills as he struggles to conquer the higher and more difficult peaks. The journey itself is also an obstacle, as the cyclist must learn to endure even in the most difficult of circumstances. In the end, the cyclist achieves a great victory by successfully conquering the rough road ahead.
