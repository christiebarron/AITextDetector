One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my mother had put on a tuxedo," recalls Wanda. "She asked me what type of costume I wore and it was so funny.

Wanda told me to dress up like how I look with my eyes closed.

For the entire time the tuxedo ended up being the best costume I have ever worn.

Wanda says she would go braking for it and get up to make it work.

"And then they would make the man fall over and they would sit and pretend to be dead," she says. "And I would stand up in the chair, and I would say 'Hello.'

"And then all that went through my head, I would say, 'Why don't I start walking?'"
