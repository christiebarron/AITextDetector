Computers have many effects on people.

It is now easy to see why, as a child, the world felt cold and distant.

The people who lived on earth were not the ones who got sick. All they knew was the dark side, though — people with dark thoughts, who lived in fear of the darkness.

These people called themselves "the blind" and "the weak" or "the sick." But they were also the ones who knew the earth was dark.

This is what makes people sick: they are not allowed to be aware of this darkness.

They are, for example, given wrong things.

In reality, they are seen as being ignorant of these things — or, at least, they are not in control of them enough to prevent them from appearing.

For example, one of the reasons you are scared of this disease is because you are not in control of any other things like air pollution, or radiation. If you were told you have cancer, you wouldn't have any awareness of these things, so you're less likely to be aware of them, too.

You're also not able to imagine that you have a way to prevent the disease by using smart phones.

It's easy for you to get a sense that they are not really aware of the problems caused by cancer, as if you have an implanted medicine to cure certain diseases, and you're also not aware of the bad things
