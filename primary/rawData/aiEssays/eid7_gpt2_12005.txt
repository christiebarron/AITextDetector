An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a friend of mine who was really good at the piano that we used in our show, and then he would open his arms and then he put his arms around me. It was weird, I think, because I'd gotten so used to it that I didn't even look at someone's back, because she would get very scared on the piano. So I would try to get her and get to the front, and when she got lost in the back he would take her and turn with the back foot around, turn his arms around, and the front-foot would have come back and there it was. When you're thinking of being patient and you have kids you have to realize that maybe your therapist is just using your own emotional responses, not how you'd normally react.

This is not how you tell your child, "She should not be allowed to listen to music for the rest of her life." And so when she does that, she's just being insensitive to people, not to the way the music is playing. When children are doing the same thing, just for a moment, that's what's the problem.

And soffie.

I mean, if your child is having a hard time getting her to say, "No, this is not what I like or what we can do, if I ever do something, because I'm a music pro, I'm not giving them anything"
