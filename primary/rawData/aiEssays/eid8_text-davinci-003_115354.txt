I had just moved in with my best friend, and felt so lucky to be surrounded by her love and support. We were having a night in, making dinner, when I made the mistake of accidentally setting one of the pans on fire. We both panicked for a moment, until I ran and got the fire extinguisher, and put it out. I guess the mix of shock, relief, and our general silly natures got the better of us, and before long, we were in hysterics, laughing about the entire situation. 

Afterwards, we vowed to take all fire-related precautions for our future cooking endeavours, but that night, we knew we would never forget the image of me with the fire extinguisher! From then on, it became a bit of a running joke between us, and each time we needed to exhale some tension, one of us would say, "Remember that time you set the pan on fire?" That always set us off, and we would be doubled over in laughter again. 

That little shared moment, as ridiculous as it was, made me realize just how strong our friendship really was. Laughter had a way of connecting us even more, and it was something we drew on throughout all of our adventures together.
