I remember the first time I ever shared a laugh with my best friend. We had been friends for a few weeks now and were beginning to get to know each other better. One day, we were discussing our thoughts on a certain news article, but neither of us found ourselves agreeing with each other. We went back and forth with our points of view for quite some time, when suddenly I made a joke about the situation, which humorously summed up our disagreement. 

My best friend replied with a hearty laugh and we both found ourselves doubled over in fits of laughter, unable to stop. It was at that moment that I knew we were truly friends. We could disagree over issues and still find a way to laugh and enjoy the light heartedness of life. 

That moment of shared laughter made our connection so much stronger. Through that moment, I realized that laughter truly is the shortest distance between two people.
