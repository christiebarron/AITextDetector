I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is one of the strongest means for free expression under the First Amendment," said Susan Weil, co-director of the American Library Association. "The ability to gather evidence to hold someone accountable for their actions demonstrates why a government may seek to regulate the expression of thought and ideas."

Borrowing a language from the Second Amendment "would help protect constitutional rights for those who are exposed to ideas of a kind that are not based in free speech," said Kelli Jones, a lawyer for the First Amendment Foundation, a legal nonprofit group that works to preserve free speech. "That's why I believe the government must not tolerate speech that might be held constitutionally unpopular, and so, instead of making the situation worse, it would be a way to safeguard those who would fear retribution for being exposed to ideas of any 187-year-old."

The group opposes government shutdown plans because of budget challenges that could affect funding for schools, libraries and schools in the South and elsewhere.

"There is no reason a government shutdown shouldn't be a way to ensure the safety of library workers and the people of South Carolina," says John Weil, chairman of the National Right to Life Committee and president of the North Carolina Committee for Human Rights. "So, while we think it is wrong for the government to limit speech, we agree that any time something is being blocked, it's not just being protected for it is a good idea."
