The Empire State Building was constructed in the 1930s, rising a total of 102 stories into the New York City skyline. The building was designed with innovative features, including the ability to tether, or “moor”, dirigibles -- early airships and aircrafts -- in order to dock. However, the designers and builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the building.

One of the primary challenges was the concern of creating strong enough mooring facilities to support the weight of the airships. In order to accommodate dirigibles, the Empire State Building had to have mooring facilities which could bear the weight of these heavier-than-air craft. As Marcia Amidon Lüsted explains in her book, The Mooring Mast, the architecture of the building had to be designed with strong steel mast and cables so that the airships could be securely tethered. In addition to the building itself, the ground below also had to be secured and stable enough to have the heavy airships moored to the building. This involved a significant amount of engineering as the designers had to ensure that the mooring points were properly secured into the stone and earth below.

Another obstacle faced when allowing dirigibles to dock had to do with weather conditions. Airships were affected more by wind and weather than airplanes were and thus they were potentially more dangerous to tether to a building. Because of this,
