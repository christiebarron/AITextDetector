At the end of the poem, the speaker is reflecting on how they have persevered through a difficult winter. The hibiscus, as a symbol of the speaker's own resilience, will eventually bloom in the spring, and the speaker takes this fact to heart. The speaker has not passed an important test yet, but the speaker is inspired to try again, confident that with the spring comes new possibilities.  The phrase “when this hibiscus is budding” emphasizes the speaker’s hope for new beginnings, but also the idea that difficult challenges can be eventually overcome. Therefore, the poem ends with the speaker being hopeful and confident that they will take the test again in the spring.
