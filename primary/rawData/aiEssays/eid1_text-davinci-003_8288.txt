The Empire State Building was built in the early 1930s, and the engineers and designers had the ambitious goal of allowing for dirigibles to dock atop the building. But achieving this goal was not simple, and the project faced numerous obstacles that forced its completion to be delayed for a significant period.

One of the biggest challenges when building the Empire State Building to enable dockage of dirigibles was the lack of suitable mooring materials. Ground-based moorings for dirigibles often included strong steel cables, the likes of which could not be used atop such a tall building for fear of destabilizing it. As such, the engineers were left with few options when it came to designing a suitable structure for the dirigibles to latch onto.

The engineers also had to contend with issues surrounding urbanization: the air around the Empire State Building, now in the heart of a major city, was much too turbulent and heaving compared to calmer altitudes for dirigibles to safely navigate. To compensate for this, the engineers constructed a 1000-foot-tall steel mast that would stick up above the building and into calmer air.

The mast was completed and put into use in 1931; however, it still faced further challenges. Two sets of booms with crossbeams attached were added to stabilize the mast and help control the dirigibles. But the booms proved to be too lengthy for the weight-load capacity of the dirig
