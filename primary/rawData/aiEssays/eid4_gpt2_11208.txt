The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it looks at both the world and its inhabitants, whether they realize it or not. The author is as serious about the characters, both physically and psychologically, as ever: you only have to skim his pages to have a good look at his life.


I do, as I have stated since starting this book, have an incredible admiration for the people behind the characters as well as for their personality and relationships, whether you're trying to be a successful book reviewer or a charming little writer. But those I've met who are reading The Dragon of the Moon, which is my favorite, will come back to me and say, "Oh my gosh, look, this book has a lot going on here, especially for an author such as mine!" This is just so much fun to look at, and how it can be a hard job getting started. I'm always looking for a little challenge here and I appreciate it too.
