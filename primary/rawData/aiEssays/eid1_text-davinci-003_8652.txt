I remember my first time meeting my now boyfriend. Weâ€™d been friends for a few months, but had only met in person a few times.

The day we decided to go out on a date ended up going differently than I expected. First, we went to a (terrible) Chinese restaurant and then decided to catch a movie. After the movie, we decided to take a walk in the park nearby and that's when all of the laughs began. 

We were walking, talking about our lives, and suddenly I said something that made him laugh. It was contagious - soon we were both laughing uncontrollably about the most random things. It was like we had known each other for years! We kept walking and talking, our conversation ending in more and more laughter every time. 

The night ended with us saying goodbye at the park entrance, both of us still laughing from the funny stories we had shared. That moment was something special: I knew that this would be the start of a long-lasting relationship.
