The Empire State Building was a feat of architectural and engineering accomplishment, and it symbolized the modern time in which it was built. In the 1920’s to 30’s there was a great sense of excitement surrounding the opportunity for dirigibles to dock on the mast atop the building. This was, however, met with many obstacles. 

At the time of the building’s construction the transportation methods available were limited. Dirigibles were a highly advanced form of technology and a great technological achievement of the time that people were eager to be able to utilize. After its completion in 1931 and the installation of the 201-foot steel mooring mast at the top of the building, a flurry of excitement and anticipation surrounded the potential use of the Empire State Building as an airship port.

A number of obstacles quickly became apparent surrounding the requirements of the airships. Firstly, the dirigibles had to be modified in order to be able to dock at the mast. The sheer height of the mast meant that the airships had to be considerably larger than the ones available at the time, so it was necessary for builders to create larger, more structurally sound dirigibles which could safely dock at the extreme height. In addition, the airships needed to be lighter than the air they flew in, an unlikely prospect given the weight of all the equipment required for the journey. This posed a major challenge to the engineers and pilots.
