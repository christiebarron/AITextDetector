I believe that censorship of materials in libraries must stop. No matter the cause, we do not need to be concerned about censorship at all. We simply need to demand that our people have the freedom to choose as the institutions that they want to be.

We have been very fortunate to have you on our advisory board. We hope that you'll make strong and meaningful contributions to our efforts. If you find this material enlightening, feel free to read it. We hope you will support public education across the country and throughout the world, including through our network of community based nonprofit foundations.

We are grateful to all donors who support our efforts. Please help support Public Citizen by helping us raise money to support a variety of activities and for our upcoming campaign.

Thank you all as always.
