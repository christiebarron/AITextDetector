Dear Editor, 

In recent years, computers have become an integral part of our lives. They shape our culture and connect us with the world around us. However, it is important to recognize that computers can have significant negative effects on people if used too much or in the wrong way. 

Computer addiction, where a person starts to prioritize time spent on a computer or device over time spent with family and friends, is of significant concern. This can have a damaging effect on a person’s social and emotional health, leading to burnout, sleep deprivation and even mental health problems. 

Another issue is that technology can multiply one’s access to information. This is both a blessing and a curse, as constantly being exposed to information can be overwhelming for many people and can lead to an increased fear of missing out. Additionally, information accessed through a computer is not always reliable, and people can often find unsolicited or inappropriate material, leading to confusion or distress. 

In light of these facts, it is important to have proper computer use policies in place. Individuals need to monitor and limit their screen time, while parents need to ensure that children only have access to age-appropriate content.
