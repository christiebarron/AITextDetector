I remember the time when I was living with my parents and my younger brother. We did not have a lot of money and were often struggling to get by. My parents had to work really hard to make ends meet and it could be a bit of a difficult time for us.

One day my parents presented my brother and I with a surprise; they told us that they had saved up enough money to buy us both bicycles. My brother and I were so excited and couldn't wait to go and pick them up.

When we arrived at the shop my brother was far less patient than I was, he wanted to get on his bike right away and kept begging my parents to hurry up. I on the other hand, was much more patient and understanding. I knew there was a lot of paperwork that needed to be done and my parents were doing their best to get it completed.

Though it felt like forever, my brother eventually calmed down and after about an hour or so, we left the shop with both our bicycles. I was so proud of myself for keeping patient and not letting my brother's impatience get the better of me. It was a great lesson to learn and one that I still remember to this day.
