I remember the time my best friend had called me in tears. She had been on the phone for nearly two hours telling me about the trouble she was having with her mother. She was feeling overwhelmed and was at a loss for how to handle the situation. As she poured out her heart to me, I could feel her pain.

I wanted to jump in and immediately offer advice, but I knew that wouldn't do her any good. So instead, I just listened. I remained calm and patient, letting her complete her thoughts and feelings without interruption or judgement. 

As she talked, I started getting a better sense of the situation, and I started to offer guidance. I cautioned her to think carefully before taking any action and to take into account the long-term implications of whatever she chose.

At the end of the call, my friend thanked me for being such a good listener. I told her that she was always welcome to talk to me, and that I was glad to provide a listening ear. It wasn't anything spectacular, but I was happy to provide support, patience, and understanding to my friend during that difficult time.
