An example of a time someone in my life was patient was in a depression. I had a friend with a severe case. I talked to a doctor about trying to help. He told me that he didn't know why anyone might go through something like this. What I then remembered thinking to myself was this person might be able to do something that would help them. This person thought that I was helping them. In my mind I thought, this is a nice and simple way to help you but then when my friend pointed out that my friend seemed hopeless this felt quite odd to me.

For the sake of this book's success I have published a short post about my experiences with meditation.
