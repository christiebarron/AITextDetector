The features of the setting of ‘Rough Road Ahead’ by Joe Kurmaski greatly impact the cyclist. The bike trail the cyclist is taking is an old train track. The train tracks are not a smooth surface for the cyclist, providing a bumpy and uncomfortable ride. This uneven terrain becomes even more difficult when the cyclist encounters a heavy rainstorm, as the trail’s wetness causes her bike to skid and slip over rocky and wet sections. 

The environment also impacts the cyclist’s ride. The cyclist is surrounded by a thick evergreen forest, and the tall trees cause the ground to stay cool and damp. In addition, the trees impede the light from entering the area, causing it to be extra dark during the late hour. As a result, the cyclist is more likely to run into an obstacle such as a tree root or rock, making the journey even more difficult. 

The heavy rain and wind also add to the intensity of the situation. The rain starts as a slight drizzle but quickly picks up, and the strong wind creates an icy chill which permeates the air. The harsh weather increases the risk of the cyclist slipping and falling, adding an extra layer of danger to this journey. Furthermore, the cold and wet conditions diminish the cyclist’s energy, making it more difficult for her to complete the mission.
