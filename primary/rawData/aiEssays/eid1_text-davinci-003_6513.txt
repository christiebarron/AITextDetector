Dear Editor:

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects of computers on people. Computers have become a vital part of our lives, affecting us in both good and bad ways.

The positive effects of computers are well-documented. We can use computers to help us work more efficiently, by speeding up tasks and providing access to information and other resources around the world. Computers can also help us stay connected with friends and family, no matter where in the world they are.

However, there are also some negative effects of computers. People can get addicted to scrolling through social media sites or playing online games for hours at a time. This can lead to feelings of disconnection with the physical world around them. Additionally, computers can cause stress when their functioning is slow or unreliable.

Overall, I believe that computers are essential tools in our modern world and that the benefits they bring far outweigh any of the potential drawbacks. If used correctly, computers can empower us, making our lives easier and giving us more opportunities to access information. I urge people to use their computers in a positive way, and to be mindful of how they can affect our mental and physical wellbeing.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
