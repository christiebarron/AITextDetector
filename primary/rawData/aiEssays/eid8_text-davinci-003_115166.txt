It was my first time visiting my grandfather’s house, but already I felt as if I had belonged there all my life. Growing up, I had heard many tales of his wild antics that had since made him a successful and respected business man. Unfortunately, however, my grandfather had long since passed away, so I never got the chance to meet him. 

But as I stepped through the doorway of his home, I felt almost as if he was still alive. I instantly felt a warm and comforting presence that immediately filled me with nostalgia. 

Trying to soak up the moment, I took in the house’s quaint yet intricate furniture and décor. As I did, something suddenly caught my eye. I couldn't help but chuckle at the sight of it.

Hanging from the living room wall was a large oil painting – one a child had made my grandfather in his old age. It was a beautiful picture of a lake, with wooden boats gently floating across the surface of the water. Against all odds, it looked almost like a real painting – a true your of my grandfather’s skill and knowledge.

It was then I heard a voice coming from the kitchen. It was my dad, slipping into his signature chuckle. I knew he was laughing at the painting too.

It was in that moment that I knew my grandfather was still with us. The laughter that filled the house was unmistakably him.
