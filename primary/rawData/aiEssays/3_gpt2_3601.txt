Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

You probably already know this through their description of the road before and throughout the game. There are many, many roads on the map and each one is different from the last, with some things not so easy to get used to as there are all kinds of challenges which you can play through, you can only run for a few minutes on the first day, you can't run until the second day of the game and it's much higher paced so it will feel a bit like you have to run the same route in each one.

Even though you still have to go through a series of obstacles, it's easy enough for you to just find 'road 1' and move onto the next one, a lot of challenges are in the way of that. To get around that difficulty, you have to build your skills against the walls. The game tells you so but as soon as there's one obstacle and you can move up until it, it's easy enough. You can also build your attack speed and your pace up but it feels more 'off' when compared to other levels because of how quick you can move up the walls. There are many other obstacles though and this game doesn't encourage you to build as much as you want but still maintain it as long as you stay in the right rhythm.

And how about the other 3 levels?

Don't expect it the way
