To the Editor,

I am writing to this newspaper to express my opinion about the impact that computers have had on the lives of people in recent years. While the majority of people agree that computers have made our lives and work easier, I strongly believe that computers have had a largely negative effect on us.

One of the most significant ways computers have a negative effect is by reducing our physical activity. Computer usage often involves sitting for prolonged periods of time, leading to obesity and general physical deterioration. Not only that, the lack of physical stimulation often leads to people feeling fatigued or becoming disinterested in activities that involve physical exercise. 

Furthermore, computers have led to people becoming increasingly dependent on them by transferring manual tasks to machines. The addition of artificial intelligence and automation into our daily life has also caused people to become less creative and lose the ability to think independently. Many of us have become over-reliant on the power of algorithms, leading to us becoming illiterate when it comes to solving problems without the help of a computer. 

In conclusion, computers have undoubtedly made our life easier, but the negative effects cannot be ignored. We must begin to take into account the effects of our over-reliance on technology in order to prevent further physical and mental deterioration.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
