Dear Editor,

As a long-time reader of your newspaper, I believe that the effects computers have on people and society should not be overlooked. Indeed, computers have become an integral part of everyday life, from the classroom to the workplace. But with these digital tools come both benefits and risks.

On the one hand, computers provide several advantages to our lives. They make it easier to access information, reduce time to accomplish tasks, and enable us to work remotely. Furthermore, the use of computers has opened up new opportunities for creativity and collaboration.

At the same time, however, there are drawbacks to the increased use of computers. Prolonged use of screens can strain our eyes, and technology can cause us to become easily distracted. Furthermore, computers have enabled the spread of fake news and malicious software that can harm both individuals and businesses.

Because the effects of computers are so varied, it is important to use them responsibly. We should learn to set healthy limits on our computer use â€” limit screen time, take breaks during work, and manage distractions. Similarly, we should always verify the accuracy of the information we receive through computers.

In conclusion, computers have both positive and negative effects, and it is essential that we learn to deal with them.

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
