The setting of the story is rural Washington, which adds an element of isolation and danger to the cyclist’s journey. The rural location also adds the danger of encountering unexpected wildlife, including an animal Kurmaski calls an elk, which can startle even experienced riders. 

In addition to this danger, the setting is also bad weather. The cyclist faces rain, mud, and cold. These conditions can make it more difficult to control the bike as the mud and rain can make the roads slick and treacherous. The cold can also sap the cyclist’s strength and can even lead to hypothermia if they become soaked.
