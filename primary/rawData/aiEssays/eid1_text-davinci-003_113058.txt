As we become increasingly inundated with technology, we increasingly rely on computers to improve our lives and make things easier. But at what cost do these conveniences come? Is technology actually helping us or is it more of a detriment? After hours of research, and gaining a better understanding of the effects computers have on people, I am compelled to present my opinion to the local public.

First and foremost, I strongly believe computers are negatively affecting our physical health by decreasing our time pursuing physical activities and putting computers in the position of replacements. We sit longer hours in front of computers at home and at work. This sedentary lifestyle can lead to weight gain, poor posture, vision problems, and an increase in stress.

Not only are computers having negative effects on our physical health, but our mental and cognitive health as well. When people spend extended periods in front of a computer without taking a break, their efficiency decreases and their tendency to make mistakes increases. Using computers can also lead to an addiction to a specific game or application which can lead to a mild form of OCD.

In my opinion, we need to understand when and how to use the computer. With disciplined use, it can enhance our productivity and provide us with amazing opportunities that werenâ€™t available before. We need to reposition ourselves away from computers and start adopting habits that improve the quality of our lives.

In conclusion, computers can be incredibly useful tools, but
