An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when we were both 19 and the other a college student. The reason that we were all involved in a mutual discussion about how to improve the life of the company, I've been able to articulate my thoughts on the current state of the industry as well as get my own perspective...........My dad's sister had a degree in Engineering when they were the second year and in particular she was a very innovative person with a very keen understanding of engineering. She did a thesis on the field and she is well versed in several specific concepts: the invention of the computer (i.e., the computer processor), the use of optical materials (i.e., the use of optical fibers, polymers like polymeric plastics, etc.), the use of electrical cables and electrical capacitors. She got her M.S degree from Harvard where she spent two years in the electrical industry. The field is moving forward, but at present her thesis is still in its development stages.She worked on numerous prototypes of her new invention, which has been developed in collaboration with Google and some of her colleagues over the last few weeks. She is currently the President of her university and she has built the prototype to demonstrate a specific form of wireless networking which can be used with smartphones (which is why she is so excited to be working at Google). I am very excited about this project and will be sharing my ideas and observations along with the details of the technology we are
