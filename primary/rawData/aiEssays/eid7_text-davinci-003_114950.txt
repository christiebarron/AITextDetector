I recently had the opportunity to visit my father-in-law, who has been confined to a wheelchair for the last few years. He is a very independent man, so it was an adjustment for him when he was no longer able to walk. On this particular trip, we wanted to take him out to dinner, but his wheelchair wasn’t compatible with our vehicle.

My husband decided to call a taxi to take us to the restaurant. We quickly realized that the taxi he called was not specially equipped to accommodate a wheelchair and we weren’t sure if Dad would even be able to get in the cab safely.

We stood there waiting, not knowing what to do, when suddenly a much larger taxi pulled up. It had wheelchair-accessible ramps and all the necessary equipment needed to transport my father-in-law safely. We thanked the driver but were unsure how to pay for two cabs. However, the driver waved us off, saying that someone else had called him to provide us with the accessible taxi.

We were all deeply touched by this random act of kindness and so grateful for the patience and understanding that the driver showed us. He could have easily written us off and gone about his business but he chose to demonstrate patience instead. It was a beautiful reminder that sometimes even the smallest gestures of kindness can make a big difference.
