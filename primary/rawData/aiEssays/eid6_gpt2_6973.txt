The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first is the fact that they couldn't really tell me what kind of a vehicle they were building. To me, the building was much like a tank. Not for purposes of defense, but to keep the rest of the building safe. And from the moment I walked down Fifth Avenue, I never wanted to leave.
