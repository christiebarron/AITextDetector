I always remember one of my first conversations with my best friend, John. When we met, we were both feeling unsure and a little bit awkward, but as we got to talking, something funny happened. 

It started with me making a comment about something mundane that had happened during the day. “That was really strange,” I said and laughed nervously. John laughed too, but it was a full-hearted laugh – not an unsure, forced one like mine. 

Suddenly, I felt something loosen inside me and I started laughing again – this time it was genuine. John looked over at me and began to laugh even harder, and I couldn’t help but smile. I shook my head in disbelief at how silly it all was and started to giggle uncontrollably. 

I can look back on that moment now and remember how, in the midst of feeling unsure and unfamiliar, laughter brought us together. That moment gave us the courage and comfort to share more of who we were, and from then on, we knew our friendship would last.
