I recently had to go shopping for groceries to help my family during the pandemic. It was not an enjoyable experience. When I got to the store, the lines were long and I could tell that it was going to take a while to get through the line. Despite the frustration that was boiling inside me, I reminded myself to stay patient and remain calm. I took deep breaths and used this time to also think of the things that I was grateful for. 

I was able to make it through the line without having any outbursts. When I finally got to the register, the cashier was having difficulties operating the machine and I had to wait even longer. This time, I meditated on a peaceful mantra and distracted myself by looking around the store. I was able to stay composed and eventually got out of the store with all the groceries I needed. 

Being patient in that moment was difficult, but I am proud of myself for not letting my frustrations get the better of me. I was able to stay calm and remain kind to the cashier and that made the experience much less stressful.
