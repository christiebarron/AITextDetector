The engineers who designed the iconic Empire State Building took a bold step when they proposed a mooring mast be attached to the building for dirigibles to dock. Although it was a daring move, it was one filled with many obstacles. This essay will discuss the challenges the engineers faced as they worked to make their vision become a reality.

The first, and arguably most important, obstacle the engineers had to overcome was the stability of the mooring mast. Due to the ever-changing atmospheric conditions, the dirigibles, which were large and highly combustible, had to be well balanced for a safe landing. The mast would also have to withstand the immense pressure exerted from the fast winds and heavy airships. To ensure the stability and safety of the mast, the engineers made sure the mast was built several feet below the top of the building where winds were less likely to reach. The mast was also reinforced with steel bars and provided with an efficient anchoring system. 

The second obstacle was making sure the mooring mast was strong enough to withstand potential crashes. With the inevitable problems that come with a new engineering technology, the engineers had to create a design that could handle a rough landing. The mast was constructed with an intricate network of cables that could take the full weight of a dirigible. Additionally, the mast was surrounded by a safety fence to protect nearby pedestrians from potential danger.
