The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One was the need for multiple, separate cables. A major challenge for the engineers of Columbia was the sheer amount of cables needed to keep lights and other equipment properly lit. The designers and builders faced a much deeper problem: how to make sure that no light was lost when one of the "highways" was lost, thereby isolating the whole installation while preserving vital features.

Another hurdle was that of the use of the camera. The main source of illumination was that a flash bulb would provide almost no visual information. This was problematic in that for many reasons, particularly of an aesthetic point: the sun shone through the windows, but the flash would dim and the lights dimming to zero. The problem was compounded by the fact that if a camera fell into this problem, it would never work. If the city got lucky, the camera might be working perfectly fine, but the problem was that its very existence would be affected by a509's lack of the best lighting and the fact that many times, the city would have to pay for an extra light meter. By the time the buildings were nearing completion, it was obvious to the city's population that the new street lights, whether they were for streets or buildings, were not up to scratch.

The first practical way to handle this problem is to use an existing lighting system consisting of a small light fixture, a small light tube positioned in front
