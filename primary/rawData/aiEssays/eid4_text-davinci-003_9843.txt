The ending of "Winter Hibiscus" by Minfong Ho serves as a metaphor for perseverance, hope, and resilience. The protagonist has failed a test and instead of despairing over her failure, they choose to look towards the future. They plan to take the test again in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. By connecting this moment of renewal and hope with their future success, the protagonist is suggesting that by enduring and persisting, it is possible to eventually succeed.
