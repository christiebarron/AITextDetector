One time I experienced laughter in my life was when watching this movie I had to stop.

I just saw it! I saw it with my very own camera!

I got the hell out of there.

Why would you think that? Why would God allow it?

Well, look at your movie, watch it! It shows that you're a good man and you should do what you have to do, not what somebody else says. You're not doing it for the glory of his kingdom, and you deserve it if your kingdom gets divided or is at stake. So you see, the people are a bunch of people who can be very nice to others, but in the end they don't get to see everybody's bad side. Nobody cares. Some of them will see people who are great, and all of them are good people.

Let's put it this way: if anyone can do what you want to them, what would they do about it and how would they live out their lives?

We've started paying attention to the people we hate. Who are he going to listen to?
