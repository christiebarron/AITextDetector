The setting of “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski has a significant impact on the cyclist and how he navigates the terrain. The cyclist is struggling to travel an old mountain road, facing various obstacles along the way. The road is described as “familiar but foreign,” recognizing that the cyclist is both aware of the path that he must take yet also unfamiliar with the many obstacles. He faces steep ascents and descents, and narrow and twisty turns. These make the ascend more strenuous. The cyclist must also confront an “ever-present tight crosswind” that is difficult to battle, forcing him off the saddle and leaving him exhausted. The darkening sky is a reminder of the end of day and of the cyclist’s isolation.

The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a number of ways, creating varying degrees of difficulty. The terrain causes much of the difficulty as the cyclist has to navigate steep inclines and sharp turns, fighting the wind. The fact that the cyclist is on an old mountain road leaving him disconnected from any outside help also adds to the difficulty of the journey. The unpredictable weather creates a heightened sense of danger and risk, leaving the cyclist on his own. The darkness of the sky is a reminder of his seclusion, reminding him of the loneliness of his journey.
