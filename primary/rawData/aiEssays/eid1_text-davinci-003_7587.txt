Minfong Ho ends the poem "Winter Hibiscus" with this line to emphasize a hopeful message of second chances and renewal. The imagery of the geese returning and the hibiscus budding is a metaphor for how every bad situation can eventually turn around and bloom into something beautiful. The speaker is looking ahead to a new time of hope and opportunity. By testing again, the speaker is hopeful that the results will be better and that these difficult times will eventually turn around. It's a reminder to keep striving for what we want no matter how difficult the road ahead might be.
