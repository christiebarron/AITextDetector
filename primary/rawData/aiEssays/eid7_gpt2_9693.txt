An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I saw her at a store in Detroit and she had two little daughters. She asked me, "Can I help with your children?" I said, "Yes, I'm gonna go- buy some of your old shoes." So she had them from the back of the store, then later on some of the shoes she had. I started to play with my new shoes again and it was such a miracle that she loved them, then I went on a mission that was to have it all replaced.

So after a while I was starting to get my feet wet again. My wife always was, "Are you doing a proper job?" "No." I still remember thinking "Wow," that didn't work. She couldn't take these things on, not with the kind of integrity I was looking for.

I was still in college, maybe when I was about five and a half years old. She was still young when I started going to high school, and I was like, "You know what, I've changed, I've learned and it's been a job." She could take things and I had taken them on and she did that on her own for me, not really.


AVC: In the end, there's no question you were not a role model for girls and women in a world where you weren't doing a lot. Do you have a personal memory of that situation?
