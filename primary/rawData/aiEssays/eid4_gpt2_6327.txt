The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it concludes the book's history as well as many more. In fact, each chapter ends with another of its own. It's nice to be able to read so many books before one's old age, but this is the final chapter, and as you might expect, it's an absolutely amazing book that has always been around a lot longer than you thought it would. To get a sense for how long it was after his death, read the book after reading the book after reading the book on its own.

I do recommend the book to anyone with a Kindle Edition who loves the history of how they came north of the Mississippi river, as this is the story that gives us so much of its story in so little time. The book also contains many stories about the town of Jackson, one of the greatest in history. I enjoyed the narrative in Part One, even though it wasn't nearly as interesting as its namesake would have been. There's a really nice chapter in the book titled "Eggshell Cursing," which is actually pretty amazing! This chapter has a really nice ending, and there's something about how cold weather in the city in the late 19th century made their chickens grow so fat. Oh and there's also an amazing part in the Chapter Three page, entitled "Life in Jackson." I really just wanted to give it a try as the chapter endsdenves into the very end of Chapter Two,
