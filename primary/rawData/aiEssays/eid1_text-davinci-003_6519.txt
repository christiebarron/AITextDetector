Dear Editor, 

As technology has advanced, computers have become more and more present in our everyday lives. Many people believe that computers can be both positively and negatively impacting us. I believe that on balance, the effects of computers are beneficial. 

To begin with, computers greatly reduce the burden of mundane tasks. Before computers, it took rigorous effort and software engineers to process large datasets. Now though, with computers, it can be done in a fraction of the time by even the most technologically challenged person. This makes complex tasks much easier and allows us to be more productive, efficient and successful. 

In addition, computers provide virtually unlimited access to knowledge. With the internet, anyone can access virtually unlimited amounts of factual information on anything. Computers offer students a chance to advance quickly through their studies, make informed decisions, and become incredibly knowledgeable.

Finally, computers are widely used in ways that can benefit society. Whether its artificial intelligence helping to develop cures for illnesses, computer vision being used to detect objects in video, or machine learning being used to predict trends and analyze data, computers are an invaluable tool.

Overall, I believe computers are a net positive on the lives of people worldwide. They provide tools to increase productivity, access to knowledge, and a way to solve society's most intractable problems. I hope that readers today now recognize the value that computers bring to our lives. 

Sincerely, 
[Your Name
