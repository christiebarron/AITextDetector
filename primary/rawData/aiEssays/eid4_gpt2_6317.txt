The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because with it comes an interesting and detailed backstory, the relationship between the heroine and the monsters. The problem that remains is that the novel does not describe their lives, the actual lives. It is rather like the characters are told. This novel ends in a more complex way to me. It's a novel that brings you closer to the end of an era, at least a lot of a different kind, and has real life, real people who are the real characters. I enjoy reading these books because they bring you closer to the characters. It helps the protagonist, to understand these people and to experience them through a novel without telling the reader the story. That's an interesting thing to read about a novel, for me.
