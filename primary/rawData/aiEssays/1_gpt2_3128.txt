Computers have many effects on people. When you're living in the United States and you're using up an entire year's worth of power from what you're using as a computer to feed your whole lifestyle, it's pretty bad.

Another issue is time constraints that limit the number of computers you have available to you, or even less. One such is a computer that you have installed and now have to use for your daily lives. But if you don't have your own computer installed on the same machine that you have that way of keeping your data, the limits are simply too great. It's a shame that our country's computing power is limited so long as our government can force us to run it faster or less.
