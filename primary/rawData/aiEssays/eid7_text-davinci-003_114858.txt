I was sitting in the waiting room for the doctor when I heard the receptionist say that the doctor was running late. I could feel my patience beginning to fray, which was unlike me. I normally pride myself on being able to remain calm during frustrating situations, so I was determined not to let this one affect me. 

I made the decision to try and refrain from being anxious by taking a few deep breaths and calmly looking around the room. I utilized the extra time I had to count the ceramic tiles on the wall. As I became more relaxed, I eventually noticed that everyone else was in the same situation I was, and I realized it was better to remain patient rather than getting caught up in negative thoughts or feelings.

My patience was rewarded when the receptionist announced that the doctor was ready to see me. As I walked into the examination room, I was so grateful I had taken the time to practice being patient instead of becoming agitated. This valuable lesson has sticked with me ever since.
