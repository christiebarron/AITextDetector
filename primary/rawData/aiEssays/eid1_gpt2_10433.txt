Computers have many effects on people. For instance, there is some evidence that, for some people, IQ matters. If IQ were measured in real life, then we might think people like myself, my mother, my grandmother, my parents, and the general public will share that, but for many people, it not. To assume that IQ in real life will influence our thinking often takes the view that IQ is important—or the product—of human biology or human culture. However, most people who understand, or understand deeply about genetics or socialization and its effect on their behavior, may not do so in the foreseeable future and that is a major flaw in the theory. People who believe that IQ influences behavior, the ability to make choices, the ability to think, are not in this world and we should take the next few years. The argument to promote the theory is simple. There is much we can learn about what geneticists call 'IQ' or "genetics," but this can range from just how effective genetic technologies are at making the body work its way into a 'better' person. What if you could simply make the brain work? I'm thinking of a machine in a lab, that might do that because it could think so much faster. But it would also do things that are impossible in biology—and I am not talking about a machine which produces new ideas through the process of gene or genetic modification. The problem is not that there is a problem—it is that
