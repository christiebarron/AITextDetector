One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my wife was taking me to the office, and then a few other women were sitting down together and talking. (And they didn't really seem annoyed or out-of-kind)

The point I bring forth is not that those jokes matterâ€”I mean, how many times have you spent laughing over someone you don't know about you? I mean, it's a joke, and you aren't mad about it, aren't you? So when you laugh this year, it's because you were doing your job properly.

No, this is not, that is not why this is funny. I'm joking about this because laughter doesn't matter to me now. In fact, I'm laughing about it on a couple levels. But it's because the laughter I'm using is something that actually affects my life. It affects my kids. And, my friends. And, my family. I am so glad no longer people can joke about this in this way. They don't need to. It simply creates a world of a less joyful, fonder, and more beautiful day.

I'm writing to share some of the funny things that I'm seeing these days happening around me, specifically.

I am so sorry. For what? I know now it just has to do with the fact that people seem to be doing a different job. Sometimes that job is being too creative and being overly hard on myself,
