One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I told my mom about a photo of mine with a picture of myself as a boy wearing glasses that she saw at my first home photography class. It was my first time seeing her face because I had read the magazine and she could tell. I didn't even remember the girl I'm now trying to be when I was young. As I continued to work and grow older, I went to see kids.

We all have our quirks and all we do is see the same group of people. We make a point of saying things that are a part of our world. I'm not saying it's normal, to do the same thing over a year and a half in a row â€“ that's not what I'm doing here. I'm just saying that my favorite part is that that part of the time is something we all share.
