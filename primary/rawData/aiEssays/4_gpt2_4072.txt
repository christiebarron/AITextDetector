The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it is so true.

Saving Shakespeare's life is much more important to the rest of Shakespeare's career and the world than saving his wife's life on that very page. But there's no way the book is anything like that.

The book is as much about protecting Shakespeare, and being able to protect him, and keeping him safe. In the book, we are told that if the story fails, Shakespeare will die.

But does it ever fail? Absolutely. Why do things always end the same way? It's not that this book tells me why it never did end. It's all you could argue about this book. It would not have happened, it wasn't a bad ending or any of thatâ€”it's just that one bad ending in the book is irrelevant, and all that matters is that this book ends with his death anyway.

The books keep telling us the same story of how a tragic death leaves Shakespeare in a situation that the story goes through. This is what Shakespeare did.

How do you handle that? The question is kind of self-explanatory to me, because I'm a sucker for that line, "If the story ends, not really because of his death, but because of an unforeseen circumstance." The reason that Shakespeare survived is because he did what is good for Shakespeare. That's what his life ended for him. He wanted to have children.
