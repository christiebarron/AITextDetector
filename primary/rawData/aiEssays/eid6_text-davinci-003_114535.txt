The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles when attempting to dock dirigibles to their building in the 1930s. Building the Empire State Building was considered a modern engineering feat of the time and was the first skyscraper to have incorporated a mooring mast on the 102nd floor. This mast was designed to allow moving airships, known as “dirigibles”, to dock and fuel up. However, the mooring mast was eventually removed due to the various obstacles it brought. 

To begin with, the mooring mast was situated on the highest tip of the Empire State Building. This meant that if a dirigible was to dock, strong cross winds and gusts from up top would affect the ship. Such winds can make it difficult for pilots to maneuver the huge balloons and could even tip the mast over trying to survive the gusts. Furthermore, dirigibles, even during the most calm days, drift unpredictably and require constant maneuvering from their crews, making it difficult to dock them in a fixed position. 

Additionally, the mooring mast itself was not securely attached to the building. It was held up by two steel cables that terminated at lofty anchor points on the rooftop. As the steel cables were not anchored to the ground, the mooring mast was unable to withstand the immense static pressure from the weight of the dirigibles as they tried to dock; the cables would often break under the strain
