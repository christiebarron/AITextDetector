To the Editor,

It seems like computers are becoming an essential part of our lives – from the moment we wake up, to the time we go to bed, they are all around us. As such, I believe it is important to take a look at both the positive and negative effects computers have on people. 

On the one hand, computers can make life immensely easier – they make complex calculations, store large quantities of data, and provide us with access to the global information network. Computers are also an incredible entertainment source, providing millions of people with access to streaming services, video games, and other forms of entertainment.

However, some of the effects of computers can be quite damaging. For instance, people who spend too much time in front of computers may suffer from physical and mental issues, from back pain to issues like depression and anxiety, all due to heavy use of technology. Another issue is that computers have revolutionized the way we communicate, and while it is now easier than ever to stay connected online, it is also becoming increasingly easy to stay distant in real life.

Overall, I think it’s worth understanding how computers affect people in order to ensure that we use them in a healthy and balanced way. Computers can be a truly awesome tool, but if we don’t stay aware of the dangers, then they can quickly become a source of frustration and unhappiness.

Sincerely, 
[Your name
