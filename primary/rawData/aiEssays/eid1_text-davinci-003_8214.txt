The building of the Empire State Building was a feat of engineering and resilience, but one particular obstacle faced by the builders was ensuring that dirigibles could dock. The design of the building needed to meet this requirement in order for it to be useful to the masses. Throughout its history, this has been an issue, leading to changes and modifications to the structure of the building. In the book “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, she describes the obstacles that had to be overcome in order for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.

One of the key challenges faced by the builders was the sheer size of the Empire State Building. The building stands at 1453 feet and was, at the time, the world’s tallest building. This presented a range of challenges, such as ensuring that the structure was strong enough to bear the load of a large airship. Additionally, the draught of dirigibles was relatively large, which presented an obstacle when considering the size of the mast at the top of the building. To ensure safe mooring, the builders had to design a suitable reinforced platform from which dirigibles could dock.

The height of the building also posed a risk; even if the mast was deemed strong enough to dock an airship, the height of the building posed a danger of the dirigibles crashing into it. This had to be taken into account when designing the mast, to
