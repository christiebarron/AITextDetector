The biggest obstacle to the building of the Empire State Building allowing dirigibles to dock was the challenge of achieving a combination of engineering and safety design that would enable the larger airships to safely moor to the top of the building. The mooring mast, an innovative invention designed to safely dock the airships, solved this problem in the 1930s. It was created by architect and chief engineer William Lamb, who wanted to provide a safe entrance point for the zeppelins that were bringing passengers to New York City. 

The design of the mooring mast took into account the large size of some of the dirigibles, as well as the wind speed and turbulence, plus the large imbalance of weight and the swaying motion of the airship due to changing air pressure. Lamb designed the mooring mast to extend 600 feet above the 86th floor of the building, as the highest floor in the building, and also added a reinforced steel boom arm that could move up and down the length of the tower according to the height of the airship. As the airship approached the building, the crew in the dirigible would guide the ship toward the tower, and then the boom arm would lower and connect to the airship, securing it to the Empire State Building. 

This mooring system required precise calculations in order to make sure there was enough room between the tower and the airship, while also ensuring the stability and security of the air
