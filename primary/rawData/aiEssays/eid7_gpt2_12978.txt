An example of a time someone in my life was patient was with a group of people. Then I saw them take off running while stations near my school. I didn't want to see them at the station, because they were pushing. A lot of people were really afraid â€” the people I never met in high school. But I never let it get to the point that I was having fun.

Then my friend and I started noticing something unusual. I was wearing a red shirt with no button-down shirt. I was not wearing a red button-down shirt and white shirt to go without putting on a tie. I was wearing this red shirt with a black tie. When they started talking to me, they could just tell me my name and the message on it. I just tried not to say anything but just stay calm and listen, just keep up with them.

I'm probably one of most people who would have done this as a kid, but the way my friend told me to do it, just kept me up. I would think to myself, "Oh God, oh God, I'm not allowed to do that again." So by the time they had told me to get dressed, I was still thinking, criticized by everybody. But if you really follow how normal and well done you're, then you will get better. That's exactly what I wanted to do. And I didn't want people to see me as being any worse than I've been at that
