Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways.

'Drivers who have difficulty making a call must have their own private vehicle. There is no penalty for failure to show up to work. Drivers who cannot work may still be subject to a personal injury act if the car is not in the proper position. Some drivers may be less able to do their duties to their passengers on a roundabout on the road. It is recommended that drivers should have personal vehicle insurance to shield from this kind of situation.

'Drivers who do not report their failure to use their car must pay an amount of money, normally 20 Euros, when selling to the public in France, up to 20 Euros per day after they leave the office.'

The bill of materials should have a statement 'on the circumstances' about the insurance.

The costs are deducted and it is possible for a claim to be made if people had their car insurance on because they were unable to use it.

The police are obliged to put 'impartial control of accidents to a serious degree for the purpose of assessing public health and safety'.

The law is aimed at dealing with the problem of pedestrians and cyclists being hit by vehicles and motorists who are passing them, a spokesman from the Transport Ministry said.

He added that the safety check is based on the number of collisions taking place and it's an attempt to reduce crashes.
