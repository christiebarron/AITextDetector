Dear Editor, 

I am writing to state my opinion on the effects computers have on people. As technological advances continue to shape our world, more and more people are beginning to rely on computers for their day-to-day activities. While computers can certainly be useful for a wide range of tasks, I believe their prolonged use can be detrimental to individual health and development.

From physical effects such as eye strain, bad posture, and neck and back pain to mental issues like depression and increased stress, the risks of computers are numerous. With such easy access to a plethora of options, it can be difficult to focus on one task and switch off which can lead to overstimulation. This can, in turn, make it difficult for people to stay emotionally balanced.

Kids are particularly vulnerable when it comes to technology. Not only are they exposed to multiple distractions, but they can also be exposed to inappropriate content and cyberbullying. Such experiences, especially in young age, can have serious psychological effects on their development.

I am not advocating that computers should be completely removed from our lives, however, I think itâ€™s important that people are aware of the potential risks and educate themselves on proper computer use. Taking regular breaks from the screen and finding other activities to engage in can significantly reduce the undesirable effects of technology on our lives. 

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
