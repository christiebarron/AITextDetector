The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it is as good as most of us have come to know. It explores why things like the cold and thunderstorms are so destructive, why birds and rabbits need a break from their lives, more. There are few better examples than his book, In Love Without a Wings, of how a bird is created with a love of her wild animal to protect it. It is an experience that transcends geography, geography, geography, the universe of nature. By showing a bird loving its own life, the author provides an even greater understanding of what being a bird can mean for you, for your soul, and an even greater appreciation of how a bird can make a world of its own.

The book is not, like most other authors I admire, written by an American scientist, but it takes you inside of the bird's mind: the bird as a living being, the bird as a living being, the bird as a living being. The book is meant to be read as a journal. Reading it makes us think how far we have come from understanding the bird as a living being. It will create the imagination of people who need a break from the simple and human-centric idea that birds live and breathe, that they are animals when it comes to their biology, that they live and breathe and want to live and that they care about and live for them.
