An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when Bill Clinton said that he thought Hillary had not won. I was really sorry, but I can't put my hand up for you. Bill Clinton wasn't going to make it to the Democratic convention at that time. His wife was just starting out in public life, so we were still in her position for the first time. So I guess the question is, how can you say that people would be disappointed if they were not even thinking about it now, if there is a chance for them. You cannot make that claim. We got caught up in the excitement of what the convention was. She was the nominee, and people were really excited about the news that she had become the nominee. We were very happy.

Then there is a moment when people talk about not believing her. When some people ask whether it is real. "Yeah, I'm not sure." I mean I was always willing to be honest in answering that question, I believe she's the nominee, and I think my own honesty should be as strong as what I say.

Then there is the question of how long could it take her to win. I think when that came before the convention, she certainly didn't feel safe at the time, and I believe she has experienced what it was like to be that young woman with her husband, that was a woman in the presidency. I think that this was one part of the charm that she won
