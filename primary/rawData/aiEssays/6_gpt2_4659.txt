The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

By the 1950s, space requirements were in flux

In 1960, the American government imposed the first limits on the size of ships for space voyages. During the Cold War, private companies had a limited commercial space available for space voyages. From then on, the only restriction was the required length of the space to allow an escape.

The American-led effort to reduce the length of spaces on US ships to 5-6 ft. proved to be a success.

This meant the US Navy could finally afford nothin' like an escape tunnel, a small-masted space facility that could allow a private jet to make the long voyage. The US military then used the same technologies and materials to make a private space capsule known as the Shuttle. By the 1950s, this capsule was officially seen as a military utility vessel.

The Shuttle, now known asptinj and called on to be the U.S. military version of the Eiffel Tower in the 1970s, was able to make the journey from its home port of Kennedy Airport to its first runway at San Francisco International Airport in 1961.

The US Navy had to figure out ways to bring in more space travelers (and a couple of exorbitant cargo ships) every single day.

By the end of the 1960s, the shuttle had been fully operational thanks to the development
