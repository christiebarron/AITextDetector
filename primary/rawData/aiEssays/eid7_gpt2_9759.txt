An example of a time someone in my life was patient was a couple of years ago when I was playing golf. The first round and the one with the right shot on, you just roll your eyes a little bit when I roll my eye. I kind of don't remember my first round. My first round was at a hotel just like my first round. It was the same as in the first game. I was playing a game of poker. I was playing for the first time and I was thinking "I don't think I had a chance. I want to play my first round". It was at the moment I was playing poker, I was playing for the first time for the first time in my career. I thought my game was good. I made me my first round game and I was thinking "Can this game help me stay on the winning side or is it just too much to handle?" Now I'm still thinking "Yes it can, but I need to practice every day." I did some of those different things. I was working from an office at the airport in Dubai where everything was done, a few guys and me playing on the same table of chairs. I was going to practice all the time, or maybe I was working from the office after the first round that was in my head, maybe as soon as I got all the way into work we were playing. It was really important to get on it and get ready. I think I was a big part of that
