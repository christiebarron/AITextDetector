I never expected to be stuck in the hospital waiting room for hours on end, but that's exactly what happened a few weeks ago. I was there to visit my grandmother who was admitted for emergency surgery.

After signing in, I sat in the waiting room, feeling anxious yet hopeful, when suddenly there was chaos. A woman had brought her young daughter in, and the daughter clearly wasn't feeling well. A nurse said her bed was ready but the woman was demanding her daughter be treated first.

In a matter of minutes, the situation escalated and the woman began shouting at the nurses. I expected all of the other visitors to take sides in the argument, but instead they kept quiet. That's when I realized something special was happening. No one was judging the woman; instead, they were being understanding of her pain and frustration.

I watched as the nurses calmly addressed her concerns and directed her to the waiting bed for her daughter. The woman agreed and left the waiting room in a much calmer state. Everyone else smiled, knowingly, including myself.

It was a powerful reminder that patience is an invaluable trait and can often have a huge impact. Despite the stressful situation, none of us felt compelled to judge or react. Instead, we were all understanding of the woman, knowing that everyone deserves a chance to be heard and respected.  That showed me incredible compassion and I am grateful to have had the opportunity to witness it.
