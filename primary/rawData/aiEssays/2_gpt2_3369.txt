I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is the foundation of our free society. Every day, there are individuals who would like to use my name to educate others about pornography and to be honest with themselves about who is allowed to read and watch it. And even though we know about the possibility of copyright, the law protects creators of content that infringes or harms others. It is necessary that censorship is prevented.

The Copyright Board has held that this law constitutes an infringement of copyright in several things, including (to a great extent) prohibiting the dissemination of content with explicit intent in the form of a print, internet or movie. In order to allow us to keep this law in place, we now propose to limit censorship to material for publication. Any materials that promote or encourage a culture of violence would effectively outlaw their use by anyone who views tradition or tradition in general. This law is also going to create a new and important form of government-directed communication in which a plurality of interested parties will share information about their content about what they will read and share it with others. We plan to allow such an alternative communication such as online or in person only.
