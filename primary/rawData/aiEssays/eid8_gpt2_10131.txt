One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I saw a child who was about to be born. I remember my husband asking if he could make sure he could speak to me until I asked. If he could I went and found his picture hanging on the wall from the inside of my own apartment. He said, "It's OK!"

How did I become famous? Well, before I even realized it.
