The Empire State Building in New York City was originally designed to allow dirigibles to dock on its mast at the top of the building. Unfortunately, the obstacles that the designers faced when engineering this ambitious idea were daunting. This essay will discuss some of the difficulties encountered during the design, construction, and implementation of the Empire State Building’s mooring mast.

First of all, the design of the mast posed a significant challenge in itself. The Empire State Building’s mooring mast had to be strong enough to support the weight of an airship while being lightweight enough to facilitate rapid ascension in order to bring the dirigible in to dock. There were also a number of safety considerations that had to be taken into account. As Marcia Amidon Lüsted notes, a complex system of switches and levers had to be installed “in order to automatically cut the power to the engine once the nose of an enemy dirigible touched the mast" in the event of an "unfriendly" visitor. In addition, the design also had to incorporate a mechanism to mount stainless steel ladder rungs so that crew members could board the airship for inspection.

The construction of the mooring mast also proved to be a challenge. It had to be affixed to the outside of the building in such a way as to ensure its stability during gusts of wind caused by the airship coming to dock. To ensure the safety of those on board
