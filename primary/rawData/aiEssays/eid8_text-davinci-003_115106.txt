I was walking to class on a cold and rainy day. It had been a long morning and I was feeling a bit down. Just as I was about to round the corner, I saw my best friend, Emily, walking in the opposite direction. I waved and smiled in surprise.

Emily saw me, and before I knew it, a huge grin spread across her face. She quickly changed direction, and before I knew it, she was standing right next to me. We both started laughing and I couldn't help but feel a little better.

The sky was still dark and the rain had not let up, but our laughter was infectious and it somehow made it all better. Emily looped her arm through mine and we began walking side by side to our respective classes. We kept laughing, even though we were both late for class, and I couldn't help feeling grateful for our friendship and how it continued to bring us joy.
