 

Dear Editor, 

As technology continues to advance, computers have become an integral part of our lives. But not all the effects of computers are positive; the impact they have on people can be detrimental.

In today's society, computers monopolize our time and attention. We spend more hours in front of screens than ever before, and we are increasingly disconnected from physicality and real-world activities. This can have an impact on our mental health, as decreased social interaction can cause feelings of loneliness, and a lack of exercise can lead to decreased physical health.

The use of computers can also lead to increased distractions from tasks that require mental effort. It's easy to be drawn off course and end up surfing an endless wave of YouTube videos and online shopping. On a larger scale, this can hamper business success and a person's capacity for productivity. 

Finally, there are concerns on the security side, as computers are more vulnerable than ever to cyber threats. People need to be careful about what they share online and aware of the ever increasing risk of sensitive information being stolen or compromised.

Overall, computers have revolutionized society in many ways, but these changes come at a cost. I urge your readers to consider their own relationship with technology and think about how they can use technology in a healthier way.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
