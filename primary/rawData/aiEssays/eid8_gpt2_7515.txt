One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was 11 years old. I had an experience where it wasn't at all surprising for people to notice and just watch me laughing, but then when I was 16 years old I was actually laughing harder and harder than anyone in the world. For some reason I was constantly talking about and getting some attention, and I really did get more attention.
