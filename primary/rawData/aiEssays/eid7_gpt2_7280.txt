An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when she left me and said I had an affair with her, so I said to her, 'How on earth could you do this?' And she said, 'You have worked very hard. But look!' And I said, 'I don't work hard.' For like two days when we were still at home, I said, 'You've had too much time to think. We know all your secrets. But if you can work, you'll be a better businessman. You know it.'

And that's how he got my job in 1979. And I didn't think, because my story was not so great, but when he came to me and told me the next day that the truth of who I was was out there, I was quite astonished. And I said to him, 'You've met the best people in the world, I'm sure.' 'A gentleman!' And he kept on asking me what the good things would be if we didn't work for him, and I said, 'No, no, I don't want you to say that. I'm just saying that the good things happen when you work for an organisation that will stand up for the interests of everyone.' The fact that he said that had nothing to do with what I do as an employee of a company is what caught my eye. I was surprised, I was actually very happy for him â€“ he's an amazing man to work
