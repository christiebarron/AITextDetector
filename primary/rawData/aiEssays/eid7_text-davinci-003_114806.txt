Once upon a time I was at the gas station, and there happened to be a really long line of cars waiting for their turn. I was only running in for a quick thing so I was getting impatient waiting my turn for such a long time. But then, out of nowhere, an elderly lady started walking towards the front of the line. 

She had a cane and was moving very, very slowly. Part of me wanted to get aggravated and complain, but then I realized how patient these people behind me were being. They weren’t honking or raising their voices; they weren’t even saying a word. They just patiently waited, and eventually, the elderly lady reached the front of the line. 

I can’t help but admire and respect the people in line for being so patient with this woman, even though they were making them wait. In that moment, I got a good lesson about the importance of being patient.
