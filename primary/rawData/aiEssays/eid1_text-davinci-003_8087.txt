The Empire State Building was an ambitious project that stretched the limits of engineering during a time when dirigibles were becoming increasingly popular for transport. However, enabling dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was not such a straightforward task due to the many challenges it presented. In her article “The Mooring Mast,” Marcia Amidon Lüsted explains the obstacles that faced the builders of the Empire State Building in order to allow dirigibles to dock. 

The Empire State Building was built with innovative technologies of the time, such as electric elevators and pneumatic tubes, but establishing an area for dirigibles to dock posed an entirely new challenge. The flat rooftop of the building was simply not suitable for large airships to make a safe landing, and other potential solutions would require costly and drastic modifications. The most optimal plan was for the installation of a 50-foot mast on the rooftop, from which the dirigibles could be tethered in order to slowly descend.

The project of designing and building the mast was allocated to the Star Iron Works Corporation, who had to contend with a number of atypical engineering concerns. Elevated winds could cause airships to sway dangerously while tethered to the mast, so the mast needed to be able to account for this shift due to its height and position atop the building. Additionally, to provide extra security for the airships, the mast needed to be able to be quickly disconnected from
