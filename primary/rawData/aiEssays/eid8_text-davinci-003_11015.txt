I was out on a blind date with the cutest driver I had ever seen. We were sitting at a small cafe enjoying a coffee, when suddenly, I started to laugh out loud.

I couldn’t help it: his awkward pun, while intended to be funny, was totally off the mark. But the more I laughed, the more he seemed to relax. We just sat there, laughing together for what felt like ages.

The moment instantly brought us closer. I felt like all of a sudden, there was this connection between us neither of us could ignore. We just kept laughing and talking about nothing and everything all night long. It felt so natural and freeing.

By the time we parted ways, I knew I wanted to see him again. To this day, I’m sure that laughter was the shortest distance between two people, and it helped pave the way for a lasting relationship.
