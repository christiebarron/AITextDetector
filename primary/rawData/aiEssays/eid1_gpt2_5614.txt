Computers have many effects on people. They can reduce or eliminate their needs, like by increasing their work hours while increasing their time spent in their household to the point where it makes up for their lack of time for the other people around them. These people can have poor economic life, which means their life savings are far out of balance. Therefore, these people make much more money from selling a computer because they are able to save more. The results may be a loss of income or a loss of interest in a long-term relationship. While most of these people lose their social impact soon after the computer's introduction, a large fraction develop and pursue other projects that benefit their families, their communities, and the planet. If a small fraction of these people experience poor earnings, it's not possible for some to develop the self-fulfilling prophecy described above.

Finally, while research is ongoing, we have to recognize, that some people and families have a better chance of surviving in a world where there's little opportunity for self-sacrifice and social disruption. We can make the case that a world where there's no chance for such people doesn't exist (and people who could end up experiencing it, like the ones we will see if we have a computer). We also know that we have to give something up in order to survive. A computer might not even allow the survival of some.
