Computers have many effects on people. The most obvious one for me is the effect it has on my mind, making it harder to relax. I have a constant need to look at other people or things and I've noticed over and over that they've lost their focus. For me, I also think people lose their control over how they do their jobs sometimes, because in terms of dealing with people and things that usually keep them from falling asleep. I think that in the long run, people will lose their control of what they do, because they will try to control their minds. That's going to go a Hopkins Way, and I think it will happen eventually. I guess we're going to find out. But, if we do do something like that, and if it helps them deal with what was happening at the time, there's a lot of hope. I think that a lot of people are afraid that the Internet will be a place where they can learn, or that they can actually learn and they can be successful. So I think that what I'm hoping for is a way for people within society to learn and to become successful. If people can learn and be successful, we can move forward. But, if we fail, there's no hope for us. We're going to have to live a very difficult future in order to continue to live that way. And that's what I hope."
