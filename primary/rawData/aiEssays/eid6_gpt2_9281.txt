The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. During the construction of the Pentagon, some of the same problems were discussed during the building and subsequent design phases of the complex. Both designs, which were jointly undertaken by the architects and engineers, have been approved by the Senate.

Although Dirigibility is commonly used among the United States Department of Energy (DOE) contractors, many of the structures and many of the materials needed for the building's construction have not been publicly publicly built to this point. The United States has several projects that have not been publicly built, such as the Washington Dome project, which was jointly completed by the Pentagon and the National Water Works Project, the former of which was opened to the public on June 19, 2010.

The most recent project, the US Department of Energy's (DOE) Energetic Materials Directorate (EMRD), consists of multiple buildings designed by both government and private contractors, which is described under the categories of "Projects." The structure at the center of the two projects is one that has been jointly commissioned by the DOE and the US Department of Energy. It is the largest and most complex building approved as a dirigibility project to date. It comprises a massive concrete slab with a height of 5.5 feet at right angles to its longitudinal axis, with a center area of 42,000 square feet (8,400 square m), about one-third the height of the Washington
