The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One of these included an obstacle along the length of the walkway that caused a hazard to the pedestrian, and another was an obstacle designed to prevent a pedestrian from jumping into the center of a tower. The solution was to allow vehicles and pedestrians to dock between the two construction obstacles, and allow for pedestrians who cross the bridge to avoid any danger.

While many of the obstacles were not in danger, the obstacles included a steep hill that helped give rise to the elevated bridge, but this hill was made of clay, and was therefore slippery when the construction crane was on site. During the construction of the Empire State Building, drivers and residents frequently crossed the walkway while on duty, to avoid pedestrians who were on foot or in vehicle.

The construction of a bridge was also expensive, costing $9.5 million and adding approximately 3,850 square feet of concrete, which is approximately 4 square meters shorter than what was needed with the previous building in place. Even with the added height, the city could use as much as $5 million to accommodate the 1,800 square inches of concrete needed to build the new Empire State Building.
