I remember a time when I was at the supermarket, and there was a line of people waiting to be served. I was in a bit of a rush, so I was anxiously watching as the minutes ticked by. There was one couple in front of me that had an exceptionally long list of items that the person at the register was having difficulty locating. I could tell the couple was just as frustrated as I was, so they asked the cashier to go on break while they finished their shopping. I was surprised at their calm attitude and willingness to wait a little bit longer for their groceries. I was impressed by their patience in such a frustrating situation, and it put my own impatience in perspective.
