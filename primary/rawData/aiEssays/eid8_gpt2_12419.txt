One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I got into an online fight with my boyfriend that happened out of nowhere in my hometown. It was just the funniest part about being around him. When I saw that I was making an awful mistake of judgment and being rude to my boyfriend, I was very, very angry to come across that and tell him to clean up. It's very frustrating because, from what I've been through, this is your first time with a partner who's been attacked and it's been such an ordeal. The other person that was in the fight was one of my closest friends and I don't think there is an abuser out there and he's not trying to stop me from going out or I'm scared to get into trouble. I hope my sister, who's a nice lady and we have a very close bond, can get this through before she's left. I know that I'll have to explain to my dad every single time I ask him the wrong question.
