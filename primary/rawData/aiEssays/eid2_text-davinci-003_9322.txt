In recent years, censorship of materials in libraries has become a hot-button issue, stirring passionate debate on both sides. On one hand, people feel strongly that libraries should only contain materials that are appropriate for all audiences, and should be cleansed of any material found to be offensive or inappropriate. On the other hand, those who oppose censorship feel it encroaches on basic rights and impedes freedom of speech.

Putting aside the moral and ethical questions, I urge the public to consider the practical aspects of this issue. Excluding offensive material from libraries hampers the free exchange of ideas. Libraries exist to serve as places where open and honest dialogue can take place. When some materials are removed from this discourse, it restricts both the range of discussion and the searching minds of those looking to explore topics. 

Furthermore, censoring materials in libraries makes them a less attractive option for public use. Not only does this limit what knowledge can be gained, but it raises questions as to who is charged with deciding what is offensive and what is acceptable. This opens up the possibility for abuse of the power to censor, as decisions can be made that are in the interest of personal or political gain.

What is an appropriate alternative solution? Libraries should be sure to carry the full range of materials available and provide access to differing opinions. Instead of avoiding topics that some may find offensive, libraries should strive to provide the detailed context and discussion required to gain a better understanding of the subject
