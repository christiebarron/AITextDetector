I was visiting my grandparents in Florida a few years ago. My grandmother loves to take us to the beach and collect shells. On this particular day, we decided to wait for the perfect moment to walk out onto the beach, as the tide was beginning to come in. 

Unfortunately, we had to wait a while for the tide to retreat far enough so that we could walk out onto the shoreline without getting our feet wet. The waves were getting bigger and bigger as the hour passed, so I was getting a little bit anxious about it. 

My grandmother, however, was incredibly patient. She calmly reminded me that the tide would eventually go out far enough for us to walk out to the sea. She said, “We just have to be patient and enjoy this time together until the time is right.” After about an hour, the tide receded enough for us to make our way out onto the uneven beach. 

As we were walking out, I thought about how kind, patient, and understanding my grandmother was. She was so patient about the waiting game that we had to play and she found a way to make the experience enjoyable. There was no need for us to be frustrated and anxious because she was so patient. Her patience was a great reminder of how important it is to stay calm in difficult situations.
