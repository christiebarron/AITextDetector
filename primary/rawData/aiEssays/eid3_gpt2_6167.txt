Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. However, as a cyclist using these types of conditions you need to keep in mind that your riding method may make it more difficult to stay safe, and may not be enough. The same is also true when you compare the safe riding mode under different conditions to other drivers' speeds. If you are thinking about a safer bike then a safer mode may not only be an important element to think about but also will be used to help you plan other cycling routes.

However, it remains to be seen how well these changes affect other modes of transportation in the US. The US Department of Transportation believes that it is important to ensure that certain modes of transportation meet the needs of bicycle riders at all times and are used at the highest possible speeds. If you find yourself driving a motorcaded cycle, you are certainly at risk of being hit at or around light speed speeds. Therefore, our recommendation is to take the time to consider options and not wait on road rage to help you to be less likely to get hit.
