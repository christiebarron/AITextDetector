The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The First and Third World metropolis was under strict regulations that forbade moving vehicles (although I believe the buildings were in use at the time), so that they would have a direct line of sight. In many respects they were an obstacle to the new building's entrance. It was possible to move from rooftop to rooftop, but only by climbing or walking on a fixed platform. The builders knew that no vehicle was going to dock up to it and that any vehicle could not dock up above ground level.

This requirement was eventually satisfied by the construction of an underground system for movable objects in the city where the city was connected by rail lines and waterways with numerous highways and roads that connected to the waterfront.

Many of the buildings where the original Empire State Building was located were made of glass or steel. The first buildings on any part of the building, the Empire State, are covered in glass and many of these are in excellent condition. Some of these glass structures are standing still to help prevent corrosion.

In the early 20th century, the State Building in Detroit began to experience a significant decline. By the 1950s, it began to experience a significant decline in the size of its new buildings which included the building of a dedicated state park. The first city to have public sculpture was Washington, DC. The first one to have it on state property was the State Capitol in 1829.
