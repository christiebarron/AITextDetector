I recently noticed something amazing about one of my closest friends. She had received some extremely upsetting news, and rather than letting her emotions control her, she calmly handled the situation. 

At first, I was taken aback. I had expected her to be angry and frustrated but instead she was patient. She took a few deep breaths, thought about the news, and responded by saying, “I understand the situation. I might not like it, but I’m willing to work through this.” 

Seeing her patience in action was very inspiring to me. I saw then how having patience can be beneficial in difficult circumstances. It allows one to take a step back, take the time necessary to process the bad news, and then come to the most productive solution. 

I am so proud of the way my friend handled this situation with grace and patience. It has taught me the importance of staying calm and focused, even when the chips are down.
