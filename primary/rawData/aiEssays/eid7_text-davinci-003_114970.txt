I recently had an experience at a doctor's office that reminded me how important it is to be patient. I arrived early for my appointment and was ready to be seen by the doctor. I waited for more than an hour past my appointment time before I was finally seen. 

The entire experience left me feeling frustrated and irritated. However, I tried my best to stay calm and patient throughout the process. The doctor saw I was getting anxious and apologized for the delay. I smiled and replied, "It's okay, these things happen." 

I'm glad I chose to remain patient during this experience because it allowed me to stay positive. Sitting in the waiting room was not enjoyable, but I understood it was out of my control. Staying patient allowed me to think of the big picture and accept the wait with an understanding attitude. In the end, my patience paid off and I was able to get the help I needed.
