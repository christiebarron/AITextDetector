An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when we watched a couple of episodes of Seinfeld and he said something like, "How do I get rid of the guy without having to ask anybody else." He told me the right thing to do, especially as a child, is ask somebody to do something that you already know. "I'm going to ask for that." He wasn't trying to get a job, he was asking for that.

On Seinfeld, you can make money or you can get rich â€“ if you're in a position of success. But if someone does anything, it's an experience you want to be able to continue to share and learn with this audience.

That is the most obvious point. I think the biggest issue is that you feel like you really have to keep asking other people about you. Do other people make the same level of mistakes they make, do their mistakes and do they get it right or not? And I think if those are not people who trust you to continue learning, because they're not trying to be who they are, there won't be much of value there.

Do you feel like it's impossible to teach the audience your craft or a technique or a tactic that isn't working for you?
