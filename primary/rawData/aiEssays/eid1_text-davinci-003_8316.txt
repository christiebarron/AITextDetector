I recently had a very difficult day at work. Everything that could go wrong, did. I had to deal with customer complaints, missed deadlines, and a feeling of frustration that was overwhelming. Despite all of that, I stayed calm, composed, and patient. 

I tried my best to take a step back, take a deep breath, and focus on the positive. I talked to my team and encouraged them to stay positive as well. We worked together to find solutions to each problem we faced and I tried my best to remain positive even when it seemed like a tall order.

We eventually got through the day and even though I was exhausted, I felt proud of myself for being patient and taking a deep breath before responding to any situation. I was able to remain calm and composed even in frustrating situations, and I was proud of myself for not succumbing to the temptation to be short-tempered. It was a great reminder to always stay patient even in difficult times.
