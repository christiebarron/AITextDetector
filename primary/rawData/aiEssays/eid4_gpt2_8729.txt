The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because the final paragraph tells you just why the author doesn't want you to read it.

From the beginning, "Winter Hibiscus" was a well-respected character, but it seems like the author knew it wasn't going to do well.

The book doesn't do well in this series, because the world around the characters (whether they're on Earth or on alternate realities) looks, acts and is much darker. So a large part of my frustration is the way the story doesn't deliver, either in its dialogue, by making the reader feel like a dead person or by not showing the characters' reactions.

The story suffers from pacing issues, the reader is given an idea of what he's supposed to think in this alternate universe, and that takes much more time than just being good and honest. It gets really repetitive in this universe, especially at the end without any significant characters (even one person) coming face to face with what they've become.

As far as plot points go, it's a short book written on a whim. It doesn't necessarily tell the plot well, but it is good at what it does. I like how even once the book is long, there is an added element of "how do you handle it when you're getting so deep that you can't pull it off at first hand?"

It has some interesting plot elements, but it really is not
