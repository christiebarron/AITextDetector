An example of a time someone in my life was patient was during early morning hours of the New Year. "We were busy, it happened all the time, and I felt like I wanted to try out. So I started my recovery practice on Saturday, I'm still in recovery now, and I'm hoping to go back into it by the summer, get into coaching. I really love coaching a school like Notre Dame, which is what it is, and you see it on TV."

As an active coach myself, he did some of the same things, even playing several of them on the field.

"A lot of people in this room don't even play college football, but they play one. They watch games in the morning, they play on television, and they watch their favorite players. They watch football when I'm off the field. I'm a great player to watch, but I can't help it. I don't play a lot of games. I try to watch and follow my passion and my philosophy. I get to see what I can improve on every day just by watching a little bit better. I never get to do a workout. I never get a lot of homework because we never can see what I'm capable of doing.

"I try to do the things I feel are the most important, the ones that make me truly succeed, and they're things that I've done all year and I've been working with them at that.
