The Empire State Building was an ambitious building and engineering project in the 1920s and 1930s. Planning to include a mooring mast at the top of the building was an especially daring and innovative concept that however faced numerous obstacles. One of the most significant of these was the feasibility of allowing dirigibles (airships) to dock at the Empire State Building. As Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s article, ‘The Mooring Mast’, explains, such a feat would require a number of careful considerations.

The potential of the Empire State Building as a mooring station for dirigibles presented a number of obstacles in terms of engineering and risk management. Firstly, the height and positioning of the mooring mast would need to be considered carefully to ensure the stability of the aircraft as it approached during docking. Height was particularly important in this case as the approaching airship would need to dock in close proximity to the building, at a dock no less than 185 feet in length with a vertical clearance of just 140 feet. Despite this seemingly impossible task, the engineers behind the project pushed ahead with determination, even collaborating with the Goldman-Millar Air Ship Corp. to test the potential of the mooring mast. This was achieved by attaching their mooring mast to a balloon which simulated the size and movement of a dirigible.
