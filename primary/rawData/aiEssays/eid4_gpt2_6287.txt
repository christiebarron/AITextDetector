The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because all the great and all powerful stories in literature about childhood memories and the human experience should be told in a way in order that we can understand them. It reminds us that childhood was an event that brought us to the end of the world. He does, of course, say that at the time it was about the children, but I think readers could also see how memories are a real part of life. It's about remembering that childhood has been so tough, but he also says he found it incredibly interesting to be able to say, I got out of school today and I saw a picture of some beautiful people.
