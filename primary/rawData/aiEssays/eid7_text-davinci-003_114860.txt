I recently had a situation that truly tested my patience. I was waiting in line at the pharmacy and the line was taking forever. Everyone in the store was impatient, complaining about the slow service and about how long it was taking. I heard the clerk apologize for the wait but as he kindly asked the customer in front of me questions, the customer was impatient and rude. I watched him roll his eyes and sigh multiple times while the clerk explained the situation. Even though I was frustrated as well, I remained patient and kept my composure. I listened to the customerâ€™s discontentment and grumbles, but I stayed silent. A few moments later, the customer finally completed his transaction and left in a huff. Seeing this, the clerk thanked me for my patience and said he appreciated my understanding. Afterward, I was pleasantly surprised to find that he had given me a discount for my purchase for being so patient. In that moment, I was very glad that I had remained patient and understanding instead of joining in with the grumbling that everyone else was doing.
