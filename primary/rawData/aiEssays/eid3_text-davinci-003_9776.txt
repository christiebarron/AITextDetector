In Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead," the setting is integral to the success of the cyclist. The harsh, rugged terrain of the rocky Colorado mountains allows the cyclist to stay keen and agile with the terrain. Not only does the terrain provide a challenge for the cyclist, but also the ability to keep his focus and stay alert.

The climate of the mountains also has an important impact on the cyclist. The cold and damp air can be a difficult obstacle for many cyclists, and the cyclist in Kurmaski's story must be constantly aware and mindful of the shifting weather. Hot days can be excruciatingly difficult to ride in, and the extreme cold can drain the cyclist's energy. Also, as the story describes, sudden snowstorms can make riding dangerous and unreliable, adding an extra layer of difficulty to the cyclist's journey.

Additionally, the surrounding environment of the mountains effects the cyclist as well. Though he must navigate the rocky roads, the cyclist also has the beauty of the vast mountain range to help keep him motivated and focused. The lack of human interaction in such an isolated environment adds to the cyclist's challenge, but also creates a feeling of calm and inner peace.

The setting of Joe Kurmaski's "Rough Road Ahead" plays a major role in the cyclist's success. The challenging terrain, variable climate, and calming environment of the Colorado mountains all combine to make for a grueling yet rewarding experience for the cyclist. Ultimately,
