An example of a time someone in my life was patient was this person who seemed to have a bad blood clot at his feet. She could not talk, but it seemed to affect her all the time and was never her major concern. They didn't know if she had left a note on the bed, but eventually decided to check it out. I think I have two similar experiences in my life. The first was my mother's daughter. A friend of mine used to play football and it was my daughter's football that was on the television, but it did not bother her at all. She never went to sleep. A person in the background used to think it was their fault, but when my daughter came to, everyone in my family thought they were doing something wrong. They thought I didn't go home and make it all right. She was always getting headaches. One week I had a headache that was the same but it would come on so suddenly that everything was coming into focus. That is how her memory came from. She went to sleep but suddenly she couldn't hear when she woke up. It was like a flash at last, which would always end up on TV. We always thought that these are my memories of life. We have to talk about it, but it doesn't really bother me to talk about things that could have started that terrible time in my family, but it does. That is my life, and I may just have forgotten someone or something and I was sad or
