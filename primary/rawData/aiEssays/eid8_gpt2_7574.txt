One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I heard a person's favorite song, "God Bless America," and I thought, Why would a Christian, when he is praying to God, want to laugh so he can die?" This is because God bless America, but in ways that lead to the very end of his earthly existence. While many believe those who want Jesus to die and Jesus to be resurrected and resurrection comes within the definition of Christ, Christians make a living (or at least a living a little bit longer) from praying that god is around.

The Bible says:

Then it shall come to pass that a man that shall not receive a son in the name of Jesus shall have everlasting life:

But for an unbelieving Jew he shall grow old and be poor and shall die:

And the Lord shall bring peace to the world.

So those early Christians in the West who did not believe in a Jesus being resurrected or God's word. Even after their faith was founded in the Bible God was going to kill them. It was the end of Christendom.

It would be a miracle if this was true today. We don't have an apocalyptic apocalypse or a great war, but we do have a pretty good view of life for many of us today. We know what will happen to our life and death choices if we don't follow Jesus.

While this is not true today, we did get the idea of death
