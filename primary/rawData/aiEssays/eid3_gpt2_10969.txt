Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. Below are my suggestions for your ride in this mode.


Turning Left

If you're feeling a little more adventurous about going left, you'll start with the right hand side of the road. Don't be scared to turn left as you ride away from a group of cyclists. Once you have to be a little more aggressive, it's time to turn right:

When on a straight section of the road where you're not too close to drivers, the bike will almost definitely turn around in your lane.


Turn Your Way

Keep in mind that the driver will often hit you with a "towel." If the car is about to be stuck in a small lane and it turns right from where they were to the left, it will likely be your turn to ride back.


Stay Behind a Line/Bike, Stay Ahead

If you're on a road where you're moving in some other direction, you're probably in your lane. Some drivers may start to pass one another, giving you one opportunity to push them further into a parking lot or off the road. But you don't need time to be on your "right hand side" in order to ride through in a parking lot:


When you get off a right lane, the driver will always push you into an alley or street. So do don't turn around with the driver
