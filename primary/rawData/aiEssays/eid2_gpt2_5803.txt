I believe that censorship of materials in libraries that contain a word is a serious matter," wrote James, who also claimed that the book had to be removed altogether. Despite his statements, it's unclear if his statements have anything to do with censorship. To quote an interview with the Guardian in which he claims:

"Not that it's censorship: to be very clear, I don't think that there is censorship of a thing that I write. It just seems to me that what I do has consequences because I've written books that I would have never otherwise seen.

"Some of the more recent material does seem to have repercussions for me and it is the type of material we use, but it is certainly not something that I would have felt comfortable using. The fact that I've worked in libraries, to be honest, is kind of amazing. It's so exciting. I feel very fortunate to find books like that out in the library and to be able to do an interview like that. But it's been a really interesting adventure.

"It's always funny when you hear people saying that I'm just an impostor at this stage.

"There I am, writing some kind of book that everyone does not even consider a good idea until now. That is not a compliment. I love books but it's not like I have a problem with it, nor did I want to be an impostor, or that I'm looking like an impostor
