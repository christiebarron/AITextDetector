The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. A long, concrete wall of concrete was added to the former state building to prevent any movement of the dirigibles into the street, which caused many pedestrians to move in the opposite direction when the dirigibles were moving into their path. An additional fence was added around the building to prevent dirigibles from moving across the main street.

One particularly large fence that was installed at the end of the street caused a lot of traffic jams and caused a disruption with many pedestrians walking to work and going about their business on the elevated platform. Another barrier was installed to stop those vehicles parked on the right side of the street from passing through the fence.

The building used to host thousands of residents including many of the country's main religions, with the buildings of the Empire State of Christ still being converted into the Holy Roman Empire by the Empire and the Church of Constantinople until World War One.
