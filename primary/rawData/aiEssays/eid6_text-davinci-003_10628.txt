The engineers and architects of the Empire State Building had to face several challenges when it came to bringing in dirigibles to dock on the building’s mast. The hotel, which was the tallest building in the world at the time, was originally designed with a 200-foot mooring mast in order to accommodate passenger airships. The main challenge arose from the fact that the mooring mast was facing the wrong way, making it hard for large dirigibles to maneuver their way in. 

Other obstacles included the need for a strong gust of air to slow down the dirigible, and even when it reached a steady speed, there was still a risk of being ripped away by the powerful winds created by the buildings tall shape. For safety reasons, the mooring mast was also not able to be used during the day when the building was subjected to thermal transmissions, which could affect the air pressure and lift needed for the dirigible to make its ascent. This meant that only night landings were possible, adding to the difficulty of the project.

Finally, the mast also had to be constantly monitored and adjusted in order to ensure proper safety regulations. It had to adhere to what was known as the ‘three-point rule’, which required the dirigibles to make use of the mast’s three tower points to evenly distribute its weight and prevent any accidents while landing.

Despite these numerous challenges, the Empire State Building engineers
