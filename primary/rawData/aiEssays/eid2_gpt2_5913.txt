I believe that censorship of materials in libraries would be a great cause to put back the public into literacy.

2. To do this, please make clear that I am not, nor am I endorsing censorship as an effective way to encourage or foster innovation. However, I firmly believe that censorship of publications, news and scholarly papers, and the entire internet, should be limited, with minimal government interference and legal intervention. We need to keep an eye on the government and the government-funded media and academia that will create and continue to create new intellectual and artistic projects that will, in turn, inspire those to study and grow.

3. I am also concerned about the fact that an emerging academic ecosystem on the internet is being created, with great urgency, from both our readers, and scholars. This is especially true for the humanities, where there is considerable research capacity and the potential to find new ways to make content that is useful to humankind. The current system is a farce, and my position on this has nothing to do with education and science education.

4. In this post, I have attempted to give an explanation of the challenges to our current system that this new ecosystem of intellectual and cultural communities face, and why this system is not as productive, more inclusive and safe, as it should be.

In addition, I hope that this post will help clarify why we are in this position and why it is so important for us to have a voice when facing challenges
