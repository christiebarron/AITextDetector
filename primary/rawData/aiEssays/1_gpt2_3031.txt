These are the reasons why we need to think about what we do when we're sick or when we take medicine. When we don't use a computer, the things a person doing with a new device will do with it will not be there. We might use a cell phone to send a message, but the person would do with the mobile phone what you could not when you were texting. No one wants to carry on holding off on a long-term relationship.
