I remember a time when I was working as a cashier at a busy store. It was during the holiday season, so the store was filled with stressed and impatient people. One customer who came to my register had a lot of items and became very frustrated as she attempted to find the right coupons in her wallet. Although I could clearly tell she was flustered, I stayed patient and polite with her. I asked her if she needed help looking for the coupons and even gave her the remaining time I had until my break. In the end, she thanked me and said I was the nicest person she had encountered that day. It felt good to know that I had helped to make someone's stressful holiday experience a little better.
