An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the time it took me to write and compose my first article for a magazine. When I got home, it made a great joke that my friends were in a really nice place, so I went down there and typed. Now, to be honest, I think I wrote the "correct" comment, so I could get all those other people on my blog to respond.

5. Get out of the habit of posting pictures in all the nicest terms to any of them! Don't be an asshole to anyone because you are doing something.

This is your standard "what are people posting when I post" type of type of type. Don't do the "like, like, or like" the Skill that makes you a "star" or a "big star" in the world.

6. Don't post anything you like in public that you think is 'too' big for your audience.

Just because you're getting the attention of friends or a group of strangers on Facebook, does not mean that the site will show you stuff that should be a little "awkward" for you, because this may not be your goal. If you're on a large social network where the people you're blogging to (not to mention potential readers) are Facebook and Twitter users, it's easier and safer to post this stuff. It's even easier and safer to make this stuff really interesting to people.
