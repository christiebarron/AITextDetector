The Empire State Building was an ambitious project, conceived to be one of the tallest buildings in the world when it was built in 1931. One of the most daring aspects of the project was the plan to install a mooring mast to allow airships and dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. However, this plan was fraught with obstacles which the builders had to overcome before the tower could become the 'World's Airship Portal'.

One of the most daunting challenges had to do with the building's design. As it was originally planned, the Empire State Building was to be constructed with a flat roof, meaning that the mooring mast could not be installed. This threat was successfully dealt with by constructing the building with a setback instead; it featured smaller, stepped terraces at the top which allowed for the mooring mast to be placed securely.

The next obstacle was the wind. Since it was necessary for airships to dock at the mooring mast, the Empire State Building had to be built so that it could withstand high gusts of wind. This was done by ensuring that the tower was of sufficient height so that it stood above the most extreme wind levels, and that the base of the building was reinforced and expanded to minimize the force of the wind.

The final obstacle had to do with the airship mooring procedure itself. The builders had to install a powerful electric winch on the roof in order to ensure that
