I found myself in a tough situation recently. I was at the airport waiting for my flight and my plane was an hour and a half delayed. Everyone was getting frustrated but I remembered that I needed to stay patient. I tried to do some tasks on my phone to stay occupied and ignore the angry comments from other passengers.

For almost two hours, I managed to stay calm and collected. Finally, my flight was called and we were able to board the plane. As I sat down in my seat, I was proud of myself for keeping my cool and was happy that the situation was finally resolved.
