Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. Most importantly they affect all of traffic going through the city, pedestrians, car drivers, cyclists and pedestrians.

Some people have suggested that if "rough road" meant a good number of kilometres of pavement travelled, that could mean that the___ one in question is being hit by an accident. But to me, this is a very small consideration, especially when it comes to this particular setting. This scenario is extremely unlikely though, because the number of 'rough' road markings that we might see in 'Rough Road Ahead' will still be redevelopment-induced.

As a cyclist I will continue to work along the road and the roads as they do, I believe it is a reasonable question how much, if any, time or safety benefit will be to those working on the roads during the course of the long road trip. Perhaps by 2025, these marks will be replaced by "rough" and others will likely become street or road markings that have no relationship to other streets at all so that the cyclist (and therefore other) cyclists won't be hit by cars or motor vehicles during the roundabouts. In short, this will be a bad idea.

If this was your first trip on the road, or that is the last time you did this with your bike you will note that it's an amazing cycle route, and this is not meant to be a bad thing or an exaggeration of what
