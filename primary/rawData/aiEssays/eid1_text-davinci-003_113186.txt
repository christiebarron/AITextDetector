It is no secret that computers have become a major part of our lives. As modern technology advances, so do our dependence on computers and the associated effects of these devices on our everyday lives. I believe that these effects should be taken quite seriously.

First and foremost, computers have drastically changed the way we communicate with one another. Although this is helpful in certain cases, such as streamlining business communication and connecting with friends and family, it has also caused a cultural shift in the way people interact with each other. The convenience of messaging and social media has caused many people to become increasingly isolated and detached from reality.

Second, computers have caused a decline in physical activity due to the sedentary nature of computer usage. This can lead not only to physical inactivity, but also to an unhealthy lifestyle. Now more than ever, it is essential to engage in physical activity and practice healthy habits in order to counteract the effects of technology.

Finally, computer usage and excessive screen time can have a negative impact on mental health. Studies have shown that excessive computer usage can lead to feelings of isolation, depression and anxiety. It is important to practice self-care and limit computer usage to enjoy a balanced lifestyle.

In conclusion, it is evident that computers have a great influence on our lives both negatively and positively. However, it is important to understand the detrimental effects of computers and actively work to counteract them in order to maintain a healthy and happy
