I believe that censorship of materials in libraries and other forms of public communication is the norm across these societies and that it is unacceptable for any publication to engage in such activities as censorship of materials, whether used as an official or not," he said. "But given the current state of the international publishing scene, we should not expect to see any kind of censorship," he concluded.


The New York Times was founded by former New Yorker journalist Bill Keller. The newspaper previously hosted journalist Dan Rather, and has had a number of other influential sources on the platform including former President Barack Obama's White House adviser Valerie Jarrett and former Labor Secretary Nancy Pelosi's communications director.

The New York Times has also been sued numerous times by a number of journalists and publishers over some of those actions, according to former Times editor in chief David Halberstam. He defended the business group by telling the Times that "the New Yorker is not the Internet itself."

"In this case, the New York Times is no more the company [that] it has historically been," he concluded.
