I believe that censorship of materials in libraries, such as pornography and computer viruses, is a violation of freedom of expression, as are the materials or articles they represent (including the personal information that is disseminated in the form of attachments to and through the Internet).

This statement of legal basis could give some pause if you understand the current situation in Venezuela. According to the US National Intelligence Estimates, the country's government has 1.1 million "high-profile" political activists (from the Democratic People's Party, the Bolivarian Socialist Party, and the National Unity Roundtable; and the anti-government National Guard, which consists primarily of people from the opposition). This means that there are over 2 million people in the nation, making up about 65% of all Venezuelans, and the authorities must be vigilant during a period of upheaval. I propose that the government be open to the possibility of the introduction of law against the dissemination of the material on the internet, even on a case-by-case basis. However, a limited law must be enacted to regulate the dissemination of content that has only been found on our own Internet. We have already stated that we will be opening our web site to the public by January 1st, 2016, and you may wish to join along. If and when this row starts, we should see a number of protests, both violent as well as peaceful. I would like to send you this message on what we are working toward in Venezuela:
