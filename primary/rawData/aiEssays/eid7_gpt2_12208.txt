An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when she was the only adult in a hospital receiving an acute attention call from a family member. I was worried. She was feeling a lot more than a normal response and seemed like she was taking a lot of medication. I wanted to speak up and intervene. Because we couldn't talk to each other before she started complaining I asked her about the emergency response. She looked at me and felt completely shocked. I said this is a real emergency! She started weeping. I asked where she was going and I then said she would come back if I gave her any more medication. She continued crying. Now, here's the big question. What would be the best medication for this woman? Which side should I take? I didn't know for sure. My wife can't see which side is best; we couldn't go down and try to figure out the right answer. I was so worried that she had a brain tumor that caused everything to stop. The way I saw it, the best thing for this woman was to get her to take some good.

5. I had my own opinions on what to do. What should I do? Let us talk this up and discuss your own ideas. When you were diagnosed with schizophrenia, what might you bring to the table? Would you think differently at some point after the diagnosis?
