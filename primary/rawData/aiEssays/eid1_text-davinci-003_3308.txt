Dear Editor,

In our current age, computers play a major role in our daily lives. However, the level of influence of computers on people cannot be overlooked. Computers are no longer a luxury item; they are a necessity. As technology advances, the world finds itself increasingly reliant on computers, which could be detrimental to our physical, cognitive, and social health.

Physical health can be compromised if one is around computers for long and extended periods of time. Computer use can be linked to headaches, exhaustion, reduced physical activity, and even obesity. It is then important to find a balance between physical and time spent at a computer and monitor any physical health concerns.

The body’s level of cognitive functioning can also be impaired. Being overly reliant on computers can lead to a decrease in analytical thinking and creativity. The human brain is an amazing organ; however, if it is not challenged, it can get “lazy” and reduce its sharpness and clarity.

Finally, a person can suffer from social isolation with excessive use of computers. The need for face-to-face interactions and communication is essential for healthy relationships. Human connection should not be replaced with computer interactions.
