The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first was a legal requirement: You had to ship a small section in case you were going to dock. An estimated 10,000 units were available during construction forMajor John F. Kennedy:

"The Federal government, a public employee entrusted with ensuring the safety and security of our nation's capital, put its trust in private contractors to manage all the Federal government buildings and other governmental institutions within the State which the National Capital Commission had designated for maintenance. We are fortunate to have built more than 10,000 commercial buildings at no extra cost to taxpayer." - President Kennedy

"Many of the Federal buildings in the State have had private contractors on board to care for and maintain them for the benefit of state and local officials. Government officials were encouraged to offer assistance under the provisions of the Act because of the great investment in the construction of the building." - John F. Kennedy

"One of my biggest regrets as President, was that there was not a satisfactory solution to the problems identified by the Federal Government for repairs. The Federal Government is committed, in no small part because of the tremendous support and support from the public, to assist the Federal Government and other Federal agencies in carrying out their responsibilities and responsibilities." - President Kennedy
