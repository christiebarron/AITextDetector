An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I first saw Ivekka, now 28; she had a pretty big cat, and she was my favorite cat out knives. It was a bit like being an alligator hunting and I wouldn't let the lion get under my skin.

Ivekka, who grew up in the U.S., said she has no idea why she got to where she is today. "I do a lot of things with my time...what do you do?" she said. "Maybe they'll save me for the next year or two."

On that note Ivekka is starting her first kitten run now and hopes that she'll finish in about six months. "I've been doing that for about 2 years now," she said.
