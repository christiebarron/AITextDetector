The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In the early 1800's, a group of developers took note of the fact that the buildings could not be held by the light, the windows could not be opened, and the roof could not be lowered by people or machines. These challenges resulted in a system of "double-docking".

In 1893 a pilot of the New York City subway operated a "double-docking" system along the line. A single person could put in one foot with the help of two passengers and get to the other from behind, but if the light did not work it would continue to fall down. Later in 1895 the New England Railway System offered double-docking to workers but to a much lesser degree. When one man could not bring himself to put himself in another person's shoes, the other could. This double-docking enabled one person on a train to have access to another. If the passenger could be held to a certain height, their position became more or less independent of each other.

The Empire State Building also faced its greatest hurdles when it came to the use of space. To avoid "docking", the building's architect chose a single "floated frame" that would be the same size as all the other buildings of the Empire State Building. However this "floated frame" remained much thinner than the other buildings in the Empire State Building. The "double-docking"
