I remember it like it was yesterday. It was a chill in the air one winter night, my friend Julie and I had just finished up a movie. We decided to take a walk and chat about it. Neither of us noticed the break in the sidewalk, until Julie stepped on it and started to tumble forward. Instantly, we both started laughing uncontrollably. Even though Julie had fallen and scraped her knee, we kept laughing at how sudden and unexpected it was. The whole way home, we laughed and joked about everything that had just happened. 

When we arrived home, there was another funny moment. Julie made the mistake of walking into her mom's room instead of her own. We laughed until we couldn’t stand it anymore. 

Julie and I had been friends for years, but that night something special happened. We both felt a real connection because of the laughter we had shared. We felt closer, like we shared something special. 

To this day, I remember that night and the laughter that brought us together. Even when I’m feeling down, I still take a second and remember how laughter really is the shortest distance between two people.
