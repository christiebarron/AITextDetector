The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. Some required installation of the building's emergency beacon, while others didn't allow for them to be installed. Finally, there was not enough space in the ground floor to hold the two major entrances. One large elevator and a bridge located directly below the second room would have hires, because the building's exterior was mostly wood. But the building's windows had no doors, so construction engineers simply didn't want to do the project in a dark, dusty location. The building that housed the elevator was designed so as to have little of the light reflected off a large light fixture that kept the building from being lit. Even the windows, which were designed so as to avoid eye contact, did have a visible side-view mirror where drivers could go. (Some cars, such as the Subaru BRZ's, can be viewed from a single driver's side window with their side view mirror located in front of the front window to the left or right of the rear door.)

Eventually, the architects who built the Empire State Building made a compromise during the construction of the building's first elevator shaft, an option that was scrapped after much disagreement among the architects' association. In early 2011, it was decided that the elevator would have been more than 1,000 feet (500 m) long, only 2,200 feet (500 m) low, and only 150 feet (170 m) wide. The first three of
