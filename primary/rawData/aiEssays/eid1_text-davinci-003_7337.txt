The setting features of Joe Kurmaski's poem 'Rough Road Ahead' play an important role in conveying the feelings and struggles of the cyclist in the poem. 

The landscape is described as being bleak and desolate with a sense of 'darkness' and loneliness. This deeply affects the cyclist, leading her to feel isolated, powerless, and somewhat apprehensive. The poet paints an eery image of 'ghosts from the past' that 'drift across the barren land', which serves to further emphasise the weariness and fearthe cyclist feels. 

Additionally, the cyclist's home is described as being distant and inaccessible as she cycles 'towards the speeding night'. This serves to signify the overall difficulty of the journey the cyclist is undertaking and implies that she is travelling to a place unknown. It further bolsters the sense of apprehension and anxiety the cyclist feels during her journey, representing a feeling of uncertainty about her ultimate destination.

The use of language such as 'fears', 'curse', and 'torture' emphasise a sense of desperation in the cyclist's struggle. The roughness of the road is also reflected in the poet's choice of words, which serves to portray a sense of challenge and adversity. This image is reinforced by the use of repetition with the word 'rough' being repeated to show the difficult nature of the cyclist's journey.
