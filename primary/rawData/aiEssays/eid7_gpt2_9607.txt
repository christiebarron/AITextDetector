An example of a time someone in my life was patient was once they stopped asking, 'What do you want to see next?'

"Then they came out with the answer, 'I don't know. It's too scary to die.'

"And so today, I live with the idea of getting through to a patient."

When asked to tell his story, he was emphatic: "It's never too late."
