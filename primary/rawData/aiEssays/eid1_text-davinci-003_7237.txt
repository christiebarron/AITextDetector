In “Rough Road Ahead” by Joe Kurmaski, the cyclist must face a challenging environment. The setting of the story serves as a major hindrance to the cyclist's journey. One of the major features of the setting is the physical terrain. The landscape consists of sharp turns, steep inclines, and rocky paths, thus challenging the cyclist's ability to maintain her balance and overall momentum. The cyclist must be mindful of the rock formations and uneven terrain as she attempts to navigate her way through the treacherous mountain paths.

Furthermore, the setting also presents precarious weather conditions. The cyclist must brave the blistering summer heat as well as the unpredictable winds that come with mountainous terrain. The harsh winds can make it increasingly difficult for the cyclist to remain in control of her bike. Further, the cyclist must bear the colorful thunderstorms that form in the evenings. The combination of the gusts and the rain can make it a daunting task for the cyclist to maneuver her around the terrain.

Lastly, the setting of the story presents a stark contrast between the cyclist and her surroundings. While the cyclist is well-prepared with professional cycling gear and a well-trained body, the setting is much more hostile and elemental. The cyclist is isolated and alone in the big, rugged landscape which can prove to be a challenge for her mental and emotional well-being.

In summary, the setting of “Rough Road Ahead” poses major risks for the cyclist
