The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because of the way it has already ended. But as I've said, it has a happy ending and that is what leads into the final chapters in the novel, just as it was in the book. In other words, I'd say, that's what ended up in the book.

You mentioned this last time about a lot of things. How was this book different from the work on Magic: The Gathering?

Well, from the beginning, what was going on with the game was just about what Magic had been talking about for the last 10 years. How the card is playing out, what's making the card relevant to the game, and how those games were built. We knew the card was going to take a lot of twists, and we knew that eventually Magic would run out of mana in some of these different ways. So we just had to get a lot more stuff out, and that's what led into the book. The card that was being developed was actually a card that was created by Ronin from the beginning of the game, and it's one that wasn't created by any one designer.

What's it going to be this year?

Well, that's all I can say. I like Magic. I feel very good about it. Some other things were pretty awesome that I haven't said, but that's actually where the story went from there. I love the story of that
