It was a beautiful day in the park and my best friend and I had decided to enjoy the fresh air and talk about our dreams. We had been friends since we were kids and life had taken us on different paths, but when we got together we could always make each other laugh until we cried.

We were sitting on the bench, sharing stories of both our successes and our failures, when my friend brought up a funny story from back in high school. I couldn't help but start to laugh hysterically when she told me about her antics in the cafeteria that day. The memory was still so vivid for us both, even after all this time.

But then my friend pointed across the park and there was a girl sitting at a table all by herself, just watching us with a sad expression on her face. Suddenly I felt very guilty for laughing. I still did, but I felt a bit of sorrow for the girl.

My friend said, "Let's invite her over and make her laugh," and that's exactly what we did. We ran over to her and started telling jokes and silly stories, and soon she was laughing too. It was the best feeling in the world because we could tell that we were making her day better.

By the time we left, the girl was all smiles and we were so proud of ourselves for spreading some positivity and putting a smile on someone's face. Laughter has the power to break down barriers and
