The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first was the Federal government's legal recognition that cars should have legs.

The second obstacle could be met in much more recent months, when the Supreme Court ruled that federal legislation did not authorize a vehicle docking program for the first time in years. The case, called De La Renta v. Wills, continues to reverberate. The government has yet to determine whether to grant a temporary restraining order to the owners; a federal judge told WVHT last month that the state may have to file a similar complaint.

Boeing also faced challenges in 2011, when the Federal Aviation Administration denied a request by federal regulators to take control of the building's aircraft, saying the regulations could help prevent accidents. Boeing has so far submitted an appeal.

The FAA's failure to comply with the government's requests, the company said, could have far-reaching consequences, including reducing flights, including from two commercial airports to one, and damaging the air traffic control and inflight signals on the building.
