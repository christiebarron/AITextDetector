I recently observed my younger brother's soccer game. My brother can be very competitive, so I was prepared to see him getting worked up when something did not go his way. However, I was pleasantly surprised when I saw my brother handle each situation with great patience. 

When the other team made a point, he cheered them on and seemed genuinely happy for them. Even when the referee made a call he disagreed with, he accepted it and moved on without a fuss. He remained calm and collected throughout the entire game. 

It was inspiring to see my brother be so patient in a competitive environment. I'm sure his level of patience inspired his teammates to do the same. It was nice to see him take things in stride and find joy in the game, regardless of the outcome.
