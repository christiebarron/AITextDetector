I remember the time my parents took us to Disneyland. I was so excited to go! We had to wait in a lot of lines, though, and it was extremely hot outside. Even though I was hot and sweaty, I was still patient and good humored. My sister was getting fussy and whiny, but I stayed positive and didnâ€™t complain. I kept reminding my sister that our turn was coming soon and that it was almost our turn. When we finally got to the front of the line, I was so excited because I knew the wait was over. We had a great time together at Disneyland, and even though it was hard to stay patient, it paid off in the end.
