The setting in 'Rough Road Ahead' by Joe Kurmaski plays a major role in the cyclist's journey. The lack of direction and the long periods of nothingness are integral to his experience and add to the sense of sadness and emptiness that pervades the story.

The landscape of the setting is sparse and is characterized by flat terrain as opposed to rolling hills. This not only emphasized the lack of any kind of direction for the cyclist, but it also creates a sense of isolating solitude. The lack of hills or other natural features also removes any kind of possibility for excitement or challenge.

The weather in the setting plays an equally important role in the cyclist's experience. The heat of the sun is oppressive and oppressive in its ever-lasting presence. It adds to the lack of direction by amplifying the sense of never being able to escape from this place. The lack of breeze only intensifies the feeling of hopelessness by creating an oppressive atmosphere.

The overall lack of people is another feature that contributes to the cyclist's experience. He is completely alone with only his thoughts for company, and this further promotes the sense of sadness and emptiness. The loneliness of the setting is deeply resonant and adds to the sadness and hopelessness of the story.
