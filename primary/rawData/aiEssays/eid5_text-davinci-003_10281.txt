The memoir ‘From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives’ by Narciso Rodriguez creates a mood of wistful nostalgia as the designer looks back on his childhood growing up in Patterson, New Jersey. The opening lines of the memoir, “I left home at a very young age and have never looked back” gives the reader a sense of the longing Rodriguez felt to leave his childhood home in search of something bigger.

The memoir is full of quiet longing as Rodriguez paints his hometown landscape. He narrates his home life set among the fabric plants and hardware stores of the industrial town. There is a bittersweetness to his descriptions as he speaks of a childhood home lovingly crafted by his father and of long evenings spent sitting in the kitchen surrounded by the aromas of Cuban cooking.

Rodriguez also recounts the joy of feeling connected to the place he calls home. He speaks of the streets of Patterson and its people as if they was like a supportive shelter which allowed him to dream and develop his own personal style. There is a sense of comfort to the memorial as Rodriguez talks of immense family bonds that have endured over generations. 

Despite its underlying nostalgia, the memoir ends on an optimistic note. Rodriguez speaks of the happiness he feels being able to reconnect through his professional life to the people, places and cultures of his childhood. The memoir culminates in Rodriguez’s visit to the house he shared with his father many years ago and
