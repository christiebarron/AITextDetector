I recently made a lasting memory with a group of friends. We were out celebrating my best friend's birthday at a comedy club in town. I hadn't been to one before, so I didn’t know what to expect. After a few minutes getting settled, a comedian stepped onto the stage. 

To be honest, I was a bit nervous. I had never seen live stand-up comedy before and wasn’t sure if I would find it funny. That changed quickly though. At first, I started laughing at the simple jokes the comedian had. Then, as soon as he said something that was truly funny, all of us burst out into laughter. 

It quickly became contagious and before I knew it my whole body was shaking from laughter. I looked around the room and all of my friends were either laughing or smiling. It felt amazing! The remainder of the performance flew by as I laughed the night away. 

I still carry that memory with me that night. I think that’s what the power of laughter does. It brings people together. It doesn’t matter where we come from, how old we are, or who we’re with – laughter is the bond that connects us all.
