I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is an important tool for the promotion of freedom and truth. In general, the library must be aware of the risks that censorship can pose and make sure that materials are appropriately used.

All libraries should set aside some time to ensure that materials are properly provided. The purpose of this is not to punish library patrons, but to keep libraries full of content. Libraries should work collaboratively with the State to address and deter the distribution of materials that are perceived to be threatening or harassing and to encourage independent, open debate about the contents of those materials. If materials are provided for, or on behalf of, a legal entity, then their inclusion in the public domain is a key component of public safety.
