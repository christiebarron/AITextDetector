An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I had a heart attack. That's the feeling I had when I was at home.

"Once a day, I was thinking about my family."

How do you look after yourself outside the cage on big screen?

The key is being smart about taking care of your self.

A lot of people underestimate how hard our society is. We're not taught to be all about self care.

How do you stay home during a loss?

The most important thing is that you are not out of control.

People that are lost when they get out of the cage don't really realise what a loss their self is.

How do you feel, when things go wrong?

I usually don't want to talk to people in public when my family is dead, that's what I get to feel.

Does the stress of it all make you question your self?

My feelings are not about what makes me want to do this or that, but about this or that feeling as a part of the human body.
