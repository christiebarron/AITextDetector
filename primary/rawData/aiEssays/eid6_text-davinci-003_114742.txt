The construction of the Empire State Building in the early twentieth century created a new opportunity to explore how modern technology could revolutionize the way we make use of tall structures. One area where this new technology was particularly exciting was the idea of allowing dirigibles, known as airships, to dock on the rooftop of the massive skyscraper. Despite this potential for the building’s future, there were significant obstacles that needed to be addressed in order for dirigibles to dock safely and securely at the Empire State Building. 

One of the primary concerns was the danger associated with airships docking at such an altitude. Due to the building’s height, strong winds can whip around the structure’s exterior and cause the airships to be unstable while attached to the mooring mast. This was a safety hazard for the pilots and passengers on board the airship, and could have potentially caused catastrophic accidents if not addressed. As a result, the architects of the Empire State Building had to design the mooring mast with strong and sturdy enough cable attachments that would be able to tolerate high winds and ensure the airship remained secure while docked.

Another issue that the design team had to contend with was the frequency of airships docking at the building. Due to the structural integrity and strength of the mooring mast, the architects had to make sure the supplies, materials, and equipment necessary to safely attach and detach airships could be found at the Empire
