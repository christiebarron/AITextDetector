I remember a time when I had to deal with a difficult customer in my job as a store clerk. This particular customer made ridiculous requests and wasn't too pleasant. Even though he was being unreasonable and I had to accomodate his requests, I stayed composed and tried to remain patient as I served him. I kept a professional attitude and didn't let his bad temper faze me. I stayed polite and calm, rarely speaking back although I wanted to. 

It took a lot of effort and self-discipline to stay patient with the customer, but in the end I managed to get him out of the store while keeping him content with the service he received. I felt proud of myself, especially since I knew I had displayed a great amount of patience with this situation.
