The construction of Empire State Building in New York City marked the dawn of a new era in architecture. Although it was an impressive feat of engineering and construction, the building's designers faced a unique challenge in mapping out the building to allow dirigibles to dock. In her book The Mooring Mast, author Marcia Amidon Lüsted recounts the numerous obstacles the builders encountered to make this possible. 

Initially, the Empire State Building’s architects envisioned the mooring mast at the top of the building, made of steel girders and supporting a set of lightweight guide wires, allowing steamships and dirigibles to dock. However, the reality was much more difficult. The mast had to be able to stand strong and firm against the wind and weight of the ships. Steel girders were too heavy for the height of the building, and the mast needed a solid foundation to maintain its weight and stability. As a result, the architects decided to use concrete and steel-mesh, reinforcing it with a series of steel ties.

The Mast also had to include a way to anchor the ships that would dock. To tackle this obstacle, the designers crafted a giant turnbuckle with a twelve-foot-long arm to latch on to the ropes that secured the ships. This way, the Empire State Building could hold the ships in place as they docked.
