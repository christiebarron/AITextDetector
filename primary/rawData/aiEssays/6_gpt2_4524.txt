The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. A lot of the problems involved the ability to carry an object between towers, where it is impossible for a person to make a direct line. And there were few, if any, exceptions that allowed any aircraft, even the best-prepared bomber, to pass by.

It is hard to see why a ship carrying a person would be safer in its cockpit than one flying a ship under sea water.
