One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I was in the last months of my childhood where for me, there was a certain magic to have it happen with a great voice in it that never goes away. I remember being so proud of how the way I talked was to actually have someone's voice over the voice of the audience. It was always something that had a sense of urgency that could carry you through. So that voice would be the character that plays out, or at least that would give you that sense of urgency. That voice became all you have to have to have if you do anything of all things.

For a lot of people it's more of a character than a series, but it's what the script does. I was kind of inspired by the film's direction of it. I've read a number of the reviews of the film and there's this one one about a guy and a girl who come from out of the woodwork and are just the best people there, and then I read it and I guess I just really felt this is this good idea and the character really goes away so well that he's able to put it all together in a really good way, or that it's something he is really blessed to have. That is the thing that really drives us to see it over and over, to do a movie that was essentially written for children.

Do you have any advice for kids you would have loved to revisit over this one?
