However, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of technical, legal, and safety challenges in allowing dirigibles to dock on the roof of the newly constructed building.

The first major obstacle the builders faced was that of technical feasibility. The Empire State Building had to be constructed in such a way that it could act as a secure mooring mast for the large airships. To do this, the engineers had to install special steel masts, 20 feet in height, which could be used to secure the mooring lines of the airships. There were other technical issues to consider, such as wind pressure, weight capacity, and the proper sizing and attachment of the mooring lines.

The builders also had to divorce the idea of passengers disembarking at the top of the building due to legal considerations. The first law passed in New York City stipulated that all landing and take-off of airships had to be conducted outside of the city limits. Therefore, this made it impossible for people to disembark and board airships while on the roof of the Empire State Building.

Finally, there were significant safety concerns to consider. While the dirigibles seemed like an attractive
