To the Editors of The Newspaper:

Censorship in libraries is an important issue that must be carefully considered. Public libraries play an important role in providing access to knowledge and in facilitating education and leisure, and censorship of materials can have a negative impact on these areas. 

Many argue that some materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, should be removed from library shelves if they are found to be offensive. They argue that materials containing inappropriate language, graphic violence, profanity, or obscenity can have a negative effect on young patrons, and should therefore be restricted. 

However, what is considered offensive is highly subjective, and allowing libraries to censor materials based on one personâ€™s definition of offensive can lead to undesired results. For example, if a library decided to remove books containing certain types of profanity from the shelves, they may mistakenly remove books that explore important and relevant social issues. 

Furthermore, eliminating materials because of content can have an impact on access to knowledge. People should not be denied access to knowledge simply because some opinions and ideas are deemed offensive or inappropriate. Restricting access to materials can limit intellectual development and impede the growth of education. 

It is important to recognize the role of public libraries in providing access to knowledge and facilitating education. Banning certain materials due to offense may cause unnecessary restrictions on patrons. Libraries that wish to provide a safe environment for patrons should instead opt for constructive conversations
