I had just started my job in a new office, and I was feeling quite overwhelmed and a little bit anxious. I was trying to find my place and get settled in, but it was still all new to me. 

One day, I was working on a project with one of my new colleagues, and we kept getting stuck and having trouble understanding each other. I wasn’t sure what to do, so after a while of trying to figure it out, I just blurted out, “Well, this is going nowhere fast!” 

My colleague unexpectedly burst out in a loud laughter. I was a bit taken aback at first, and then I started laughing too. It felt so good to just let the stress go and to share a good laugh over the situation. 

As we laughed together, I could feel the distance between us melting away, and we grew closer than we had been before. We were able to complete the project together and become good friends. 

Laughter really is the best medicine, and it had truly brought us together that day.
