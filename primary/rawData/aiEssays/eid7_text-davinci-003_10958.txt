I recently took my 75 year old grandmother to a doctor appointment. She was visiting from out of town and we wanted to make sure to get all of her medical appointments in while she was around. We arrived a few minutes early to the appointment, however, we had to wait quite a while to be seen.

My grandmother was getting frustrated and I could see it. I tried to keep her calm by starting a conversation, but I could tell she wasn't in the best mood. I kept reassuring her that the wait shouldn't be much longer and that we just needed to be patient. 

Finally, after about an hour and a half of waiting, we were finally called in to see the doctor. As we were leaving the room, my grandmother thanked me for being so patient with her. She said she appreciated my understanding and support and she wanted me to know that she was grateful.

This little moment was such a reminder to me about the importance of being patient. It can be difficult to put someone else's needs above your own, but in the end it was worth it. I'm so glad I was able to show my grandmother that she could count on me to be understanding in difficult times.
