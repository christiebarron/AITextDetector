In Joe Kurmaski’s story, 'Rough Road Ahead', the features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. In particular, the darkness of the night, the rain, and its remote location create a difficult atmosphere that impedes the cyclist’s progress.

The night sky obscures the cyclist’s vision, making it difficult to spot obstacles in the road ahead. Additionally, the light from the nearby village cannot penetrate the darkness, thus making it harder to travel quickly and safely. The steady downpour of the rain also amplifies the darkness of the night, further hindering visibility. On top of that, adjacent rivers and hills also reduce the amount of light that is able to reach the cyclist. This situation makes the cyclist vulnerable to potential danger.

The remoteness of the setting is also a major factor that affects the cyclist. Being far away from any civilization means the cyclist is denied the assistance of other people. The cyclist is ultimately alone in his dangerous journey, deprived of the cminfort of safety or help from bystanders. The cyclist’s reliance on himself and his own strength greatly increases the difficulty of his endeavor. The cyclist is further hindered by a lack of street lamps and warning signs, making it impossible to properly prepare for the danger ahead.
