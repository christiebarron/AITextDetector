Computers have many effects on people. People move around. For example, grim and cramped places can become lonely. If you have problems with eating, drinking, sleeping, doing chores, living a social life or looking out for others, try to avoid crowded places and get at least five minutes of sleep a night.

Some people are happy with where they liveâ€”and others aren't. When we live in a noisy city, people don't sleep with their heads turned over, so their head gets turned over more. But in a more normal city, they may just sit at a desk by themselves, or watch a movie with friends or watch TV over the internet.

When people feel lonely for some reason, or think the only way to achieve happiness in modern society is to work towards having more kids, and this changes if you're lonely.

A study I conducted at the University of Southampton shows that some people in a similar situation are happier: one person who says they're satisfied was in the position that he or she was at before they began to feel lonely. Another couple who say they've got good job is in the top of the social pyramid; this is because they have had a good time.

When people are depressed, they feel like they're not satisfied. They even feel depressed when they get angry or anxious. That may make it harder for them to think about anything else. However, that doesn't mean that feeling lonely is necessarily a bad thing.
