I recently had an experience that reminds me of the importance of patience. 

My friend and I were trying to get to the airport to catch our flight. We were supposed to leave an hour before our flight, but got stuck in traffic. We began to worry that we weren't going to make it; all the while trying to hail a cab - to no avail.

My friend became increasingly panicked, and I could sense her frustration and anxiety. I knew that if I started showing signs of frustration, she would become even more anxious. So, I remained calm and patiently kept trying to find us a cab. After about 15 minutes of trying, we finally found a cab and sped off to the airport.

My patience paid off. By the time we arrived at the airport, we had just enough time to get our boarding passes and get on the plane with minutes to spare. My friend thanked me for my patience, noting that it was the key factor that got us to the airport in time.

This experience reminded me of how easy it can be to become impatient, especially when facing challenges or difficult situations. Having patience is an important trait to have, and it can sometimes be the difference between success and failure.
