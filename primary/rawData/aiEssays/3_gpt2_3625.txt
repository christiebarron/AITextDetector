Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. With an emphasis on the cyclists' physical abilities, it adds to a sense of urgency, so an obvious element of a cyclist's decision to follow through is reinforced: the cyclist is confident that their ability to walk and use roads will carry them through if they follow along any path as they do. In cycling, riding with a good team-mate also gives you confidence to run through the terrain, a key element which increases the level of confidence to run over obstacles.
