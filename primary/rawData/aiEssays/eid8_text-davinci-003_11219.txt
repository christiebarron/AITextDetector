I remember when my high school English teacher told us about about how important it was for us to laugh whenever we want to. At first, I didn't get it. It's not like you can just laugh when you don't feel like it.

But then something happened that changed my view on it completely. I was at lunch with some of my friends, trying to make conversation but not really succeeding. Until one of them said something, and it was so absurd I couldn't help but laugh.

And then it happened. Everything suddenly felt lighter. The air in the room was fresher, brighter. Even though I had laughed at the joke, the atmosphere completely changed. We couldn't control our laughter for quite some time.

It was in that moment that I realized laughter is indeed the shortest distance between two people. It helped us bridge a gap that wasn't easy to close. We instantly created a connection.

So ever since then, I try to laugh when I'm around people, even if I don't really feel like it. It creates warmth and empathy. I really think it's one of the most powerful tools to build relationships.
