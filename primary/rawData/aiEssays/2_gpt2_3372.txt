I believe that censorship of materials in libraries and other venues or in public spaces by means of these systems is a system of control (rather than censorship), and it is not a system in which the public has a right to be informed about such censorship.

In the present case, it is important to give some background and clarify the specific issue that was raised in a hearing before us. This case is of particular concern for those who wish to take legal action against libraries, other institutions, or other organizations that engage in censorship of material, and who seek to silence members of the press and critics.

Specifically, because of the nature of the Internet, any type of criticism for the treatment of government is inherently subject to censorship. One might think that the general principle would apply to the treatment of government actions by libraries, but such a concept lacks empirical support. For example, when there is an allegation that a library is being controlled by a foreign government, this kind of accusation falls under the category of "deceptive communication" when one believes the alleged communication was obtained on the basis of a false statement made by one or more governments. In order to be taken directly in this aspect of the rule, a person must not be compelled to provide information on the source of the information. However, there is also a wide-spread tendency to consider whether an alleged communication made by a government, such as an official document issued by a foreign government, could be legally or ethically protected on its website,
