I believe that censorship of materials in libraries should be curtailed or shut down as far as possible. These activities include distributing copyrighted materials, disseminating obscene content, and encouraging the "public" to use other than licensed literature."

In 2013 and 2014, the Chicago Police Department had to file misdemeanor charges of "disobedience to orders," which are punishable by up to six years in prison, even though "there are no indications they are related to the incident," according to a federal court filing.

The ACLU also took a more critical view

Activists are upset that not only will the law be blocked, but that authorities could attempt to restrict freedom to the general public with the help of the "cure letter" or otherwise have access to the material.

"We are going to see more of these stories being done," said ACLU Executive Deputy Legal Director Jennifer Haines, who is taking legal action as part of a lawsuit the city had filed against the NYPD. "The government is going to need permission for this."

"The NYPD's actions are nothing short of a show-stopper," Haines added. "They have shown no intention of basic civil liberties in the process."

The NYPD has already been subject to several "cure letter" laws, including those that give police the power to use force against anyone who attempts to block a library or any form of distribution of a protected work based on a "cure letter."
