I remember one time when I was in college visiting my friend Karen. We had both been through some tough times and were seeking a little bit of distraction. We went to a diner after class for lunch, and the food was terrible. We both laughed at how bad it was and to try and take the edge off the situation.

We eventually found ourselves outside on a bench enjoying the beautiful weather. We were talking about all of the crazy things that had been happening in our lives, and soon enough, Karen just cracked up. I couldn't help but join her laughter, and soon we were both laughing so hard that tears were streaming down our faces.

We just couldn't control our laughter, and soon strangers were walking by and smiling - they must have thought we were a bit crazy.

The whole thing was a much needed release, and we both felt much better afterwards. Seeing Karen laugh made me feel like I could handle whatever was thrown at us next. No matter how tough things got, I knew we could face it together and I was lucky to have a friend like her. 

Ultimately, our laughter showed me how much we cared for one another, and it remains a really special memory.
