Dear Editor,

As a member of the community, I am concerned about the impact that computers have on people. In this day and age of digital communication, more and more people are using computers for everyday tasks. While computers are incredibly useful and necessary for many professional activities, there is a danger in over-reliance on them.

It is important to remember that computers are machines. They can easily replace some human activities, and this means that people are using them more and more. They are vital tools for many jobs, but increased use of computers can also lead to people becoming disconnected from others and even from themselves. Many people are so immersed in their devices, that they forget to take a break and live in the present moment.

In addition, computers have had a major effect on our mental and physical health. Sitting in front of a computer all day can lead to health problems such as poor posture, carpal tunnel syndrome, and eyestrain. Staring at a computer screen can also have a negative impact on our mental wellbeing, leading to insomnia, depression, and stress.

Finally, computers can be a distraction from activities that promote socialization. We spend less time with family and friends when we use our own computers, and far too many people stare into mobile devices in public places such as restaurants and coffee shops.

To sum up, the effects of computers on people should be taken seriously. We should use them judiciously and always
