To the Editor,

In a constantly advancing world, it is no surprise that computer technology continues to become increasingly prominent in our everyday lives. These vast capabilities and resources undeniably has benefits for many people, but as modern society continues to evolve with machines, I fear the effects computers have on people may be overlooked. 

The evolution of technology is a double-edged-sword. Computers are being used more in the workforce and educational institutions, becoming crucial to career and academic success. In a connected world, computers offer tools for communication, marketing, and creativity like never before. While these advancements are undoubtedly beneficial, they can also have insidious effects on our physical and emotional health.

A growing body of research suggests that children have become digital natives, having grown up with the technology, and are not immune to its ill effects. Children are spending more time on electronic devices causing bodily problems that can last into adulthood. Eye strain, headaches, and neck pain are just some of the physical issues associated with overexposure to computers. Moreover, it is becoming increasingly apparent that computer addiction can have psychological effects that can disrupt productivity, relationships, and health.

Though some of the effects computers have on people can be beneficial, these new digital age technologies create an environment for us that carries both risks and advantages. With that in mind, I encourage readers to be aware of the potential consequences of computers on our health and quality of life. 

Sincerely,
