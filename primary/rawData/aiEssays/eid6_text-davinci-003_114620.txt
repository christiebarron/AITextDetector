The challenges faced by the architects of the Empire State Building, in order to accommodate dirigibles for docking, were immense. Despite the promise of being able to transport visitors in a unique and wondrous way, the hurdles were difficult to overcome. In Marcia Amidon Lusted's The Mooring Mast, she explores the difficulties that come with attempting to bring airship docking to the Empire State Building.

The first major obstacle was the building itself. Despite being able to potentially accommodate a mooring mast for dirigibles, the Empire State Building was structurally not designed for the purpose. Up to the point of the mooring mast being suggested, the building had been designed with a focus on cost efficiency and with no thought to any other purpose. As such, it did not have enough structural integrity for the concept and alterations would have to be made with great care.

The safety of passengers was also a major concern. As a result of this, the height of the building was very important. The Empire State was the tallest in the world at the time, but this was still a major concern. The engineers were also concerned the winds at the height of the building could make landings incredibly difficult for the dirigibles, potentially posing a risk to the passengers. To secure safety, they had to construct a strong, weatherproof airship tower to dock the dirigibles to.
