The author uses the ending as a metaphor for hope. By ending with this line, Minfong Ho implies that there is always a chance for change and a chance for a better future. It is a beacon of hope for anyone who may feel discouraged or overwhelmed. The imagery of the springtime melting of the snow, the returning geese, and the budding hibiscus all represent rebirth and the opportunity for a fresh start. The phrase "take that test again" is symbolic for taking another shot and attempting something again, no matter how hard it may seem or how many failures might have come before.
