Censorship in libraries has been a hotly contested issue for decades and has been the cause of much debate. Libraries are meant to provide a safe and neutral space for people of all ages and backgrounds to access information and cultural works and the notion of quashing such material in the name of offense or inappropriateness insults the power of books and the minds of readers. 

Opponents of censorship argue that it is the right of the general public to be able to access ideas and material within public libraries. Supporters of censorship, however, advocate that certain items should not be made available. The problem with censorship is that it can lead to exploitation of libraries as a platform for political agendas. In addition, it can lead to a wide range of censorship issues, such as books containing materials deemed offensive, being removed from library shelves. As such, it takes away the right of the public to make their own decisions to read and absorb the material as they wish.

Although it is true that some books and material may contain subject matter or words which people may find offensive, it is also true that these materials are necessary in order to promote awareness and acceptance of a wide range of ideas and experiences. Libraries have been traditionally regarded as free spaces for exploration, allowing citizens the freedom to learn about information previously absent from the mainstream. Censorship does not allow for such an open-minded landscape; instead, it sets in place restrictions and removes the potential for dialogue and education.
