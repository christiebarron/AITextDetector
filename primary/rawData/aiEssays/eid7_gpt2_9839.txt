An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I asked him to write to me as a friend of mine who had been in rehab (and later left us the system for what she feared was suicide) and this friend was telling me what she thought. It was when, in an awkward silence between myself and our friend about suicide, she suggested that he go to a place where he might have some thoughts about suicide. Another time she said that "no one is going to tell you what to do" (of course not!) and that she, as a result, started taking her friend to the hospital but that was not the point. I am not sure how many of the others said that this was a common habit and that this was a way someone who left home so quickly could feel as disconnected from their family history as she is. I am not sure what she meant or if she was right, her friend who said that her father had always found himself at this point was just saying to me that his daughter's life was good, that this was, in her own words, "normal." I was able to ask her why there were so "normal" people that seemed to have this Biology. She didn't explain what this meant and that was her lack of experience regarding how this behavior should be talked about. I also went back to her response which seems more similar to a woman giving lectures for an academic or an NGO but who has experience as a female suicide counselor or person
