I remember walking into my favorite coffee shop with one of my best friends and bursting out laughing. We had just been discussing our favorite TV show, and my friend had said something particularly funny. I was amused and so was the barista, who could obviously hear us. 

Just then, the customer who had been waiting in line before us turned around and asked us what was so funny. Before either of us could respond, the barista jumped in and said, “They’re laughing at life! Everyone should laugh at life.”

My friend and I were both surprised and delighted by the insightful comment. We laughed even harder, and the atmosphere in the shop suddenly changed. Everyone was smiling and happy, and it seemed like we had all been connected by the power of laughter. Even though it had only been a few seconds, the moment felt like a special one.

I don’t think I’ll ever forget the power of that moment—the positive energy it sparked, and the feeling of connection it gave us to each other. Laughter really is the shortest distance between two people, and I’m grateful to have experienced it.
