The debate over censorship in libraries has been ongoing for a long time. Should material such as books, music, movies, and magazines, be removed from library shelves if they are deemed offensive? I believe the answer is no. 

It is our right as citizens to access a variety of information without censorship. The right to freedom of speech and expression are protected by the First Amendment of the Constitution, and libraries are the perfect place to exercise that right. By censoring materials deemed offensive, this denies people access to these type of works of art, and this is unacceptable. 

Additionally, it is difficult to determine which materials are actually offensive and which aren't. Definitions of what is considered offensive are constantly changing, so existing library books may become offensive over time. This will impose an additional burden on libraries, as they would be forced to continually update their materials to meet changing standards. This type of censorship also eliminates the possibility of books being appreciated under a different cultural context.

Removing books from the shelves also potentially eliminates potential learning opportunities and access to different viewpoints. It is important to provide everyone with access to a wide variety of resources, in order to create a well-rounded, educated population. Having these materials available does not mean that people are endorsing their messages, it simply provides the platform for them to be discussed. 

Overall, I believe that censorship of materials in libraries should not be allowed. Everyone should have the right to access the material they
