I was spending a lazy afternoon with my best friend Jerry. We hadn't seen each other for a while, so we had a lot of catching up to do! 

We were having a great time, laughing and joking about the silly things that had happened since we last saw each other. However, things started to get a bit awkward around the half hour mark. 

I couldn't tell if he was uncomfortable or just had run out of things to say, but the silence was starting to feel unbearable. That was until Jerry said something so wildly out of character for him, that I couldn't help but burst into laughter. 

Confused, he asked me what was so funny and I explained that it was the fact that he sounded so unlike himself in that moment. 

It turns out that Jerry was waiting for me to give the right cue so he could break the silence. It was silly, but it was just what we needed. 

We went back to our conversation like nothing had happened, brimming with laughter this time. We laughed at the absurdity of it all and the laughter brought us even closer together. 

I was truly thankful that day for laughter. Without it, that awkwardness may have never been broken and our long-awaited catch up session would have been a complete disaster. 

But fortunately for us, laughter saved the day.
