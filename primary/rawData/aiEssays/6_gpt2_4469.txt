The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The first was the fact that they were never allowed to lift concrete floors as they had at the World Trade Center on 9/11. In July of last year, a Senate subcommittee in response to two complaints by a builder about some building materials that were "not ready for storage" claimed that they lacked the required chemical capacity. In December two contractors told the United States House of Representatives the steel on the first floor was not ready for storage.

The second hurdle was the fact that neither the FAA nor its inspector general was notified at the beginning or beginning of construction about the hazards of dirigibles. A year ago, the U.S. Navy announced a decision not to certify the safety of its dirigibles for any kind of deployment, even as it was developing a new and more technologically advanced version of the aircraft, called B-1C. The aircraft was set to fly at Mach 6 during the pilot's test flight and for about 60 days before launch.

The FAA approved the design at the last minute and decided that the most important part about the flight was ensuring safety of the aircraft.

The Boeing B-2 is scheduled to fly for about 60 hours when it flies from New York to Tokyo and eventually will be outfitted with the latest version of the new low altitude air traffic control system.

In response to questions about his experience with the dirigibles, Boeing
