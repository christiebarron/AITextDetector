Dear Editor,

As technology continues to develop, it becomes harder and harder to imagine a world without computers. The ubiquity of computers and their integral relationship with our everyday activities is one of the defining elements of our era. I believe, however, that the effects of computers on our lives are not all beneficial and that the negative aspects of this technology should be taken into consideration.

The common perception of computers as tools of efficiency and progress fails to acknowledge the potential for addiction that this technology can cause. Computers offer endless avenues to escape reality, be it through social media, video games or even online shopping. Constantly updating news feeds and notifications can even lead to a form of digital anxiety as users feel this incessant need to stay connected.

It is essential that users become more mindful of how their engagement with computers can potentially affect their mental and physical wellbeing. We should strive to utilize this technology for purposes that will ultimately have a positive effect on our lives.

I urge readers to consider the potential risks of computers and maintain a healthy moderation in how we engage in this technology.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
