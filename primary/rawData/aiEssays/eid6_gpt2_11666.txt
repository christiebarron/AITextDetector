The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In the 1930s and 1940s, the U.S. government adopted an approach called "revisit technology," which allowed new building procedures to be improved and expanded upon without the need for costly labor. When a building is refurbished, the construction industry is required to hire new workers at a rate below the original cost. In addition, the cost of repairs to buildings and structures has to be collected in the form of fees, charges and penalties for the repairs. Since the 1960s, the government has required that construction workers at many public buildings pay a penalty of up to $2,500.

In 2001, a Texas-based company, Construction Technology, developed the first dirouette, which was the first to dock in an open-air dock in a major Texas construction location. In the United States, both the commercial and residential sector have been doing this to help avoid delays. The state of Texas became the first, in 2001, to allow a full dangle for its large residential sector. A large, open-air dock was planned for the city of Houston. rebuke to dirouettes is to make sure that no one hears and then uses the same equipment at the same time, but also to get a greater feel for what the system actually looks like from that vantage point. Instead of listening to the sound of the building through the rear windows, designers are able to monitor the
