Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion regarding the effects computers have on people. In this day and age, computers are responsible for a great number of conveniences that make our lives easier and increase our productivity. But I believe it is important to acknowledge that computers are not without potential drawbacks.

The excessive use of computers can lead to serious physical problems such as eyestrain, migraine, and carpal tunnel syndrome. More disturbingly, long-term exposure to computers can cause psychological issues, such as anxiety, depression, and social isolation. For example, a sedentary lifestyle combined with an excessive amount of time spent in front of a computer screen can lead to a decreased level of physical activity and an increased sense of loneliness. This can adversely affect an individualâ€™s ability to form strong social relationships.

To protect ourselves from the threats posed by computers, we must ensure that we use them in moderation. It is important to limit the amount of time we spend in front of a computer screen and take regular breaks. We should also incorporate some physical activity into our daily routine and reach out to our friends and family.

I hope my words will prompt readers to consider the potential negative effects of computers
