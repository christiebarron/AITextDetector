Computers have many effects on people. They make us smarter, more happy, so that we live longer. Sometimes it's when computers are making people more miserable that people will complain about this effect.

A friend of mine who has just gone into nursing care decided that he was depressed for a while because of his illness. He was having nightmares. He tried putting off going to the vet, tried to start a new career, and then started to have his first stalked. He ended up getting a psychiatric referral. His anxiety was the first one he started experiencing. He had only a few days left until they called home. He was about to make it out of the hospital.

We do this all the time. And it can feel a little overwhelming. My husband's not the happiest and his mom says that it takes a couple of days to be happy and to get through two months of hard times.
