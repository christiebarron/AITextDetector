 

Dear Editor, 

I am writing to you today to share my opinion on the effects of computers on the people of our community. As technology advances and computers become increasingly popular, I believe that this phenomenon plays a major role in shaping our lives for both better and worse. 

On the one hand, computers have the potential to drastically change the way we live and work. They allow us to access vast libraries of information and to communicate with each other no matter geographic distances. They make tasks easier and less time-consuming than before, allowing for more efficient use of our productive hours. 

On the other hand, the overuse of computers can also have a negative impact on people. People are constantly exposed to electronics and screens, which can result in eyesight deterioration and headaches. Additionally, computer addiction can lead to a disconnection from the physical world and from the people that surround us. 

In my opinion, we should strive for a balanced utilization of computers, utilizing the benefits they provide without falling prey to the associated hazards. Although computers have the potential to empower us and to make our lives easier, we must also remember to take frequent breaks, to spend time in nature, and to keep our relationships with the people we care about strong and alive. 

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
