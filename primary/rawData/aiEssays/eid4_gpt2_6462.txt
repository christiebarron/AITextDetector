At the same time Shiro has the need to save herself and her friends, it also proves to be quite frustrating at times. However, things can start to change when the main character begins to become more interested in doing better things, and she begins to develop trust. These two elements become stronger as the storyline progresses and become closer together, however, there are also elements of jealousy.
