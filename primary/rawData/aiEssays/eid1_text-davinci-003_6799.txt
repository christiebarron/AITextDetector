Dear Editor:

As technology advances, people in my community are becoming increasingly dependent upon computers. While computers are a powerful tool, they can also have a negative impact on peopleâ€™s lives.

For example, people can become so immersed in computers that they fail to recognize the importance of physical interaction in their social lives. Online gaming or social media can provide an outlet for socialization, but these relationships lack the opportunity for deeper understanding that can only be found when people come together in person. Plus, long hours spent in front of computers can lead to decreased physical activity and poor overall health.

Computers also can be a potent source of distraction and can lead to reduced productivity. Working people all too often find themselves distracted by the latest email notification or searching for new trending memes on social media.

Finally, computer use can have an effect on language development. People are spending less time writing and communicating directly with others. This lack of practice can negatively impact their expressive language and written communication skills.

It is important to note that there are many positives to computers. However, as my community continues to embrace the advancements of technology, it is essential that we also pay careful attention to the potential pitfalls of reliance on computers.

Sincerely,

[Name]
