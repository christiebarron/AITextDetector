I believe that censorship of materials in libraries could easily get rid of a substantial amount of the content found in websites but which do not come from the most important sources.

It is in fact in the middle of the censorship crisis that more powerful media organizations that need to step up like the American public with the right to control the web. Internet Archive, which collects information regarding the history and development of the online distribution system, has decided at least to stop publishing the material from an early stage of production. Internet Archive has created this project. Unfortunately, this is a very small step in a long process of censorship.
