I remember it like it was yesterday. I had just moved to a new city alone. I was full of anticipation and took myself on a tour of the downtown area to explore. 

As I was walking, I noticed a street performer playing the saxophone. I stopped to listen to the music - it was beautiful. As I stood there, a few other people had gathered around to listen as well. 

We erupted into spontaneous laughter when the performer suddenly started playing a jazzy version of Happy Birthday. We all knew that hilarious song so well and couldn't help but get into the spirit of the music. It was contagious. 

After laughing with the crowd members for a few moments, I looked at one of the men standing next to me and realized that I had never seen him before. We made eye contact, and before I knew it we were both doubled over in fits of laughter. We shared a genuine connection from that moment on, and eventually, that laughter opened the doors to a friendship that has lasted three years and counting. 

Laughter is an amazing thing - it brings us closer together and it can even help us find friendship. That experience with the street performer all those years ago is something I will always remember.
