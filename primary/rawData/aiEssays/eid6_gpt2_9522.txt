The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. One of the first was the cost: The first $250,000 would be required. The second was the number of panels required: Up to two-thirds of the total needed for each panel. On top of that was the cost of the first 4 floors.

The Empire State building on the other hand, was much smaller. While the Empire State was expected to cost as much as $3 million annually, other large structures were expected to add more than $150,000 ($800,000) in yearly expenses. This made the building far from financially viable, making it more desirable to build larger buildings.

The Empire State was eventually closed down sometime in the early 1900s. In addition to the problems with the lower floors of the Empire State building, its builders faced problems with other structures. In 1921, a house in a small room at 30th Street and Third Avenue fell into the River in a large storm. The builder was taken into custody and executed as a felon. He pleaded guilty, which was commuted and paid off in 1933.

Many years later, Empire State had a building boom again, when the Empire State Empire Building was opened to the public in 1937, and the building became the tallest building in U.S. history. The Empire State was demolished on June 3, 2000 in the form of the North American Union Terminal.
