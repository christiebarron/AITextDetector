Narciso Rodriguez’s memoir ‘From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives’ is a narrative of his life journey exploring themes of identity and self-discovery in the face of immigration and family struggle. While reflecting on his childhood experiences in New Jersey, Rodriguez is keen to explore the complex nuances of family, community, and an ever-changing sense of home. The memoir offers an intimate exploration of Rodriguez’s experiences and feelings, in part by way of his personal reflections, but also through his conversations with family, showing how the narrative of home and culture is unwound through communal sharing. 

The atmosphere of the memoir captures Rodriguez’s shared joy and sadness, complex relationships, and unguarded moments, creating a mood that often weaves between nostalgia and the bittersweet reality of ‘home’. In distilling his experience of growing up Cuban-American, we feel a sense of displacement and reconciliation. Perhaps the most powerful mood presented is one of nostalgia, which conveys not only a longing for that which is lost, but also a tenderness reserved for the clarity that memories bring. It is here that Rodriguez’s family and cultural heritage comes to life as a multi-layered narrative.

We also feel a sense of joy as Rodriguez reflects on shared experiences of food and culture passed between family and friends. This creates a sense of emanating light, which allows us to share in Rodriguez’s joy
