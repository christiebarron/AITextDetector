One time I experienced laughter in my life was when my husband gave me a bottle of beer and said "This is the best I've ever had with you." (That is, until they asked if I even remember, or what they really did remember.) And then it hit me: "Yes, I remember, but when you gave me that beer, I started giggling like a baby."

When it comes to what I find most inspiring, however, I try not to let the experience go too far. I love this: I can think about the moments when I didn't hear the music and felt compelled to be kind to people who are close, especially when those feelings didn't come to pass. But once I remember and remember again that it was the first time I ever felt love, I am able to take the full-force, full-strength action of seeing past all that and come psychiatrists and give that person a chance to put a smile on everyone's face. Sometimes people need their stories to get made, but sometimes that means not just telling the story but helping these people navigate that journey.
