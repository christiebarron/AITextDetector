The concept of allowing a dirigible, or airship, to dock at the Empire State Building is one of the most revolutionary ideas of the 20th century. The builders of the Empire State Building faced a variety of obstacles to making this dream a reality. In “The Mooring Mast” by Marcia Amidon Lüsted, we learn more about the obstacles the builders had to overcome.

The first obstacle was the sheer engineering challenge of building a mast to which a dirigible could dock. The mast had to be tall enough that the airship could clear other buildings in the skyline, and it had to withstand the tremendous wind pressure exerted by such large airships. Building the mast was a complicated endeavor, as it required the use of special steel and the reinforcement of existing columns. The mast also had to be capable of supporting an airship that weighed in excess of 200,000 pounds, in addition to the power plants and other machinery necessary for docking.

The second obstacle was the danger posed by the airships. Dirigibles of the era were filled with highly flammable hydrogen gas, and the potential for disaster was great if an airship were to catch fire near the Empire State Building. In addition, the dirigibles of the time were made of cloth and paper, both of which posed a serious threat of static electricity buildup that could spark an accident. To help mitigate these risks, the Empire State Building’s mast was equipped with
