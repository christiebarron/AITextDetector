The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it is a work of fiction, and not a novel, and the series takes its approach to it very very seriously. And that's really the most important goal for those of you who are interested in this new collection if you haven't already â€“ make sure to check our book on Amazon for its highly recommended reading. There are some great books for the reading room this summer, like "A New Hope," by Michael Keaton. And even among the best books you'll find this summer you can also find some excellent books for a group of friends.
