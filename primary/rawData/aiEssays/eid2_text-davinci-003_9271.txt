The presence of censorship in libraries has been a long standing debate, with both proponents and opponents giving valid arguments for their positions. Proponents believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from library shelves if they are found to be offensive, as it may potentially cause psychological harm to library patrons. On the other side, opponents argue that censorship limits intellectual, social, and cultural exploration and hampers free exchange of ideas.

Though both sides merit serious consideration, I firmly believe that, while it is important to be mindful of potential negative effects from alarming materials, censorship in libraries should be limited. Libraries are cultural and educational institutions that are designed to provide access to a variety of content to allow individuals to educate themselves, explore different ideas, and grow as citizens of the world. In addition, libraries often provide the only access to these materials in marginalized communities, which further increases the importance of keeping them open to all.

Censorship in a library should be limited to cases of materials containing truly explicit or malicious content. This should come with age warnings on the items as well as signs in the library alerting patrons and staff of potentially disturbing content. Of course, this stricter regulation of certain materials does not equate to no censorship; however, it ensures that access to all other materials is preserved. 

It is crucial to remember the responsibility of librarians and patrons to ensure that all are aware of potentially harmful content. L
