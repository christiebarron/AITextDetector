The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

At one time, as the Empire State Building served as an industrial park as well as a shopping mall, public restrooms were constructed on land that had been acquired in the 19th century. Though most of these public restrooms now have long been removed, some remained along the way.

The first known public restroom was built in 1871 by James Wobbe to use the existing bathrooms at the city's Central Station from 1855-1863. The building stood about two stories high and had just one room and a laundry.

By the early 19th century, the Central Station also had an indoor swimming pool, which ran from 12th to 11th floors. An early example of the public swimming pools on the original building was erected on May 19, 1856.

Several other public restrooms were constructed until the late 1940s.

The most iconic of these was the World War II Memorial at South Memorial Center that opened in 1939. On its grounds, it used to play host to the World's Columbian Exposition in 1940.

One of the most enduring attractions of the World War II Memorial is its iconic steel arch — which also has the words "Memorial Bridge" etched in it — and the steel arch from WWII.

The steel arch stands just four stories tall and at the bottom of Mount Pleasant in the heart of Washington, D.C.,
