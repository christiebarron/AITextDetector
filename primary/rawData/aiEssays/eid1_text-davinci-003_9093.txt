Dear Editor, 

I am writing to share my strong opinion on the effects computers have on people. With more and more technology making its way into our lives, it is difficult to argue against the positive influence that computers have had on our world.

The advancements in computing have allowed people to get more of everything: access to information, increased efficiency, and better communication. Despite the wealth of benefits that come from computers, there is no denying the potential downsides which are frequently overlooked.

The very tools that allow us to work faster and smarter can also be abused. Computers can create addictive habits, causing people to spend too much time communicating over the internet, playing video games, or engaging in other activities which can become addicting. That time could be used more productively in another way. Additionally, this over dependency on technology can lead to a decrease in creativity for those who rely on computers for all their work.

However, it is also important to recognize that computers can empower us with knowledge and connect us in ways like never before. With them, we can explore new ideas, research anything in moments, and interact with people from all over the globe. As long as they are used with moderation, computers can truly be a force for good.

I encourage everyone to think about the effects computers have in their life, and to use them responsibly. It is only when used in moderation that computers can have a positive influence on our lives.
