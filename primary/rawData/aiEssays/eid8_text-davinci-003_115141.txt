One of the most memorable nights of my life was the summer night that my husband and I spent sprawled out on the hood of our car, gazing at stars and enjoying the peaceful peace of the countryside.

We were both fresh out of college and just married. We had been dating for years, so I felt like I already known what he was going to say and do before he could say it or do it.

That night though, he surprised me. We were talking about his devotion to the Bible and I was honestly a bit skeptical, so he pulled out his Bible from his pocket and started reading. Mind you, I'm a lapsed Catholic, so I was more than a little standoffish about it all. 

But then he started laughing. At first, I thought it was suspicious since this was his beloved Bible he was reading. But then I couldn't control my own laughter when he began to read passages in the most comedic tones imaginable. He seemed to change in another person as every word he read was met with a magnified smile and laugh. 

For the first time in my life, I felt like I was seeing a side of him that he rarely showed anyone. We kept laughing until we were both red in the face and confused, tears streaming down our cheeks.

It was one of those perfect moments that reminded me why I fell in love with him in the first place. The laughter and joy between us that evening
