To the Editors of the Local Newspaper: 

The debate around censorship in our local libraries is growing. Libraries are known for providing resources that are updated and relevant to all patrons. However, some people feel that some materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines, should be removed from library shelves if they are found to be offensive. 

As someone who is strongly against censorship in libraries, I feel that it is an infringement upon the right of the people to access information. Free access to information is a cornerstone of a democracy, and limits should not be placed on the type of information we can access. Libraries ought to provide a diverse selection of books, music, movies, and magazines that reflect the unique experiences, perspectives, and beliefs of all citizens. 

Furthermore, limiting the content that can be accessed has other societal implications. Keeping diverse books out of libraries restricts the opportunity for dialogues between different perspectives, making it difficult for one person to gain a better understanding of a different belief. It is proven that censorship in libraries is linked to increasing homogeneity of thought, which is detrimental to a thriving democracy. 

Censoring library materials is also much more complex than it may appear.
