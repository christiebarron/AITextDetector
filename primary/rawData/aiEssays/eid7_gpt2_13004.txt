An example of a time someone in my life was patient was at work that morning, and I asked him if he knew beard shampoo. He said no. He was a professor. I told him that's a little complicated. I said, hey, I love that, but who knows what would happen if there wasn't a beard product. He said, what if there wasn't something about it that was going to make you feel nice about yourself? I said, ok if it was a beard product, but why use it or not. He said he didn't have any questions, but I'm happy to ask that question. He said, OK that's all a bit tough to talk about. What did you think about the beard shampoo issue? I asked them about that, but it is a bit complicated because people are usually skeptical, and you can't give them that information.

[18:46] And what did you guys think when you came up with the idea for the "Face Brush," because there are some people out there who have a lot of facial hair. So that's a good one to answer. You think of some people doing the beard-hair thing when they know they're not doing anything wrong.

[18:50] I'm sure you guys were there, you knew them. In fact, you were here. As far as the Beard-Shampoo stuff, and the Face Brushes, I always liked that when something was going on.
