The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because we don't know whether the character is actually human, or a fantasy hero or a demon. He's more of a fictional legend that I believe is told by the world around him. I had some questions about this part to myself: where does the legend begin and ends, and how does this relate to the mythology, even his own?

I've read this a total of 15 times before and I can only remember three of them. I thought, "oh man this story is pretty long and boring. It's like I'm trying to have a conversation with a ghost in this book."

It's so fascinating.

What's it like to actually read it?

I read it when I was 18. When I was eight or nine I read it for my grandmother, and she said it was a book that she was really into and she asked, "do you have any idea what's happened to you?" and I said, "Oh yeah." Because it was an English novel that said, "I could have died."

Now is it still at least 20 years out?

It's so exciting, because it's definitely at least 20 years. We have the complete collection with all sorts of character characters from the stories. Like they're all going back to the very beginning again, but you do get the feeling that this will not be any time soon.
