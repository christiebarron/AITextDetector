I believe that censorship of materials in libraries and universities is something that needs to be vigorously and responsibly dealt with. And I think any government or organisation that's going to ask us to hand this to them deserves the same scrutiny on that basis.

Mr Speaker: Sir, would you please tell us which of those issues would be of concern and which needs to be decided by the parliament after it's finished?

Mr Murphy (Mr Speaker): We're going to be looking at it on Friday 24th, and I would encourage anyone asking for that, I would suggest you go to our website.

As part of what is called Safe Access, the government has asked libraries and universities to provide funding sources to support research carried out by people with learning difficulties at home and around the world. That is of particular importance to those young people who are suffering at home or elsewhere in schools.

I would urge the government to ensure that this is carried out by funding organisations in a way that supports those in need as well as helps people who are vulnerable.

The government needs to give funding to those organisations at the same time we do it, and not just at the expense of those people struggling to get by.
