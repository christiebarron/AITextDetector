Dear Editor,

The use of computers has grown significantly in the last decade, becoming an integral part of our lives. A majority of people rely on computers for entertainment, work, and education more than ever these days. While some critics argue computers can be seen as a distraction, I believe the effects of computers on people are largely positive.

For starters, access to computers has provided individuals with chances to further their education. Many schools are now offering virtual courses, allowing students to complete assignments and interact with their teachers online. This has made education more accessible for students who cannot attend traditional classrooms due to a lack of time or prior engagements. Additionally, computers also enable people to connect with others from all over the world, facilitating conversations and collaborations across nationwide boundaries. This creates a more open and diverse environment, which can help promote brotherhood and peace.

Lastly, the availability of computers has made communication faster and easier than ever. With a few clicks on a keyboard, anyone can connect with their peers, friends, and family members no matter where they are. This has allowed for prompt communication and expanded working opportunities, boosting productivity immensely.

To summarize, the effect computers have on people can be seen as advantageous. They allow individuals to expand their education, connect with others regardless of location, and communicate much faster and more efficiently. Therefore, it is safe to assume that the impact of computers on the lives of citizens is ultimately positive.

Sincerely,
Your
