The mood created in the memoir ‘From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives’ by Narciso Rodriguez is one of nostalgia and hope. Rodriguez nostalgically reflects on his childhood spent in New Jersey, vividly recounting the sights and smells of the industrial town that he grew up in. The tone is wistful as Rodriguez recounts the how the small-town sensibility of the town contrasted with the glamour of the fashion industry, which he experienced after moving to New York City.

Despite the feelings of nostalgia, Rodriguez’s memoir is far from a depressing look back on his past. He speaks lovingly of his parents and the lessons that they instilled in him, emphasizing the strength of his upbringing. Moreover, Rodriguez is filled with hope for his career and how far it has taken him. He shares the joy of exploring the world, from the fashion runways of Paris to the city streets of Tokyo. Rodriguez writes as an observer, seeing beauty in his journey and always looking to a future with new possibilities.

His is a story of being both American and Cuban, from home and abroad, a resident of both the fashion world and of the small town he grew up in. Most importantly, Rodriguez celebrates home and family, his spiritual and material roots ultimately providing him with strength and conviction. 

The tone of Rodriguez’s memoir is reflective and bittersweet.
