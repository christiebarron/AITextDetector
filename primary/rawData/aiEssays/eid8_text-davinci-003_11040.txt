I had just gone through a tough time, so I was feeling pretty low. I was out running errands nearby my house when, suddenly, I heard a familiar voice call out my name. I turned and saw my old friends, Brendan and Judie.

We had all gone to the same high school together, but hadn't seen each other in years. We all started catching up immediately. We laughed and joked about all the things that had happened in our respective lives since the last time we had seen each other. Then, suddenly, Judie started telling a story of the time our old school principal, Mrs. Franks, got stuck in the vending machine when she tried to get a Snickers bar.

We all started laughing before she even got to the punch line. We were laughing so hard that we could hardly stand. Tears were streaming down all of our faces. I felt so much better afterward and it gave me some much-needed perspective. Here I was having a breakdown over all of the things that had happened in my life, when all it really took to make me feel better was a good laugh with old friends.
