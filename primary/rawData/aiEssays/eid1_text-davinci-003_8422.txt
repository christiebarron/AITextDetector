I remember the time I was in the checkout line at the grocery store; it seemed it was taking forever. There were several people in line in front of me and the cashier was struggling to help each one as quickly as possible. I had been there for quite a while already and I was starting to get impatient.

However, I noticed an older woman standing behind me. She wasn't tapping her foot, rolling her eyes or sighing. Instead, she was patiently waiting in line with a small smile on her face and a sense of calm emanating from her. Seeing her patience, despite the delay, was inspiring.

Knowing that complaining wouldn't help and that the cashier was already doing her best, I decided to take the cue from the older woman and remain patient. Soon enough, the line started to move. I thanked her for her patience, which she waved away with a small smile.

In that moment, her attitude had made all the difference. Patience is really a virtue, and I learned it from the example of someone else.
