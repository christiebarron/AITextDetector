The other day, my nine-year-old son and his best friend got into an argument at his birthday party. Everyone was getting upset, but I remained calm and tried to defuse the situation.

I gave both boys a few moments to cool down and tried to get to the root of the issue. I then explained that we all make mistakes, and that it was important to be understanding and tolerant of each other's feelings. I also reminded them that they were both invited to the same party, and that they should be able to enjoy it without arguing.

By the end of the conversation, my son and his friend had both calmed down and had apologized to each other. I feel proud of myself for being patient throughout the situation and for not letting the emotions of the moment cloud my judgement. That was a great example of how being patient can help de-escalate a conflict.
