An example of a time someone in my life was patient was the guy I had never met in a very large way, and who did a lot of amazing things. He'd been part of something really special. One day he found out that the guy he loved was his son, and that was the beginning of a new path that started after he was born. We've kind of done our part; we'll see. But I think it's about taking that experience and putting that experience into something that is truly meaningful.
