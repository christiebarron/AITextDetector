Features of the setting affect the cyclist in 'Rough Road Ahead' in many ways. This means the road will be too narrow to pass. Drivers will need to make good use of the space provided.

However, the road should pass slowly through a section of traffic. This means there are plenty of opportunities for traffic to pass, and it is a good feeling to be able to keep in traffic and allow for traffic to follow you at various points of the way.

The following are suggestions for the road.

• The path should not be overgrown by trees or debris; the paths should be at least 1.25 km or more apart.

There should be some kind of ditch at ground level, so you don't have to worry about having to get stuck for a while.

• A trail should be provided for passing cyclists.

• A narrow, straight road or any section within an obstacle course could be used for passing.

• The terrain should cover the terrain of a regular road or obstacle course, and no more than 2.10 km are allowed in the path and any amount of pavement obstructs the road. There should be trees to help prevent a crash.

• The road shouldn't be separated by a large paved, narrow road (up to 30 metres long or longer) so that it passes through the road in a straight line.
