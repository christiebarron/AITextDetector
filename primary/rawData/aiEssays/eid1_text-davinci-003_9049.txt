Dear Editor,

I am writing today to express my opinion on the effects of computers on people. The implications are far-reaching and ominous.

As our society continues to become more and more reliant on computers, the impact that our technology-driven world has on people has become more and more concerning. Studies have shown serious long-term effects that can result from hours spent using computers. For example, eyestrain sleeping disorder, neck, shoulder, and back pain, and cardiovascular diseases related to inactivity.

Not only do the long-term physical effects of computers need to be taken into consideration, but also the psychological effects as well. In our increasingly digital society, there is a greater risk of cyberbullying, as well as isolation from real-world social interaction. Cyber addiction is a real issue, as well, and can cause strain on relationships and personal mental health.

To make matters worse, it is the younger generation of today that is most affected by the negative effects of computers. Children don't always understand the negative implications of spending an excessive amount of time online and are more likely to be the victims of cyberbullying or to develop an addiction to technology.

Given all of this information, I urge people to use computers only in moderation. We all need to take a step back and recognize the real-world implications of our increasingly technology-driven society.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
