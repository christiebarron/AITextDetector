The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The fact that no real estate developers paid any attention to its design and layout is indicative of the lack of interest in the potential public good. The building was heavily commercialized (notably by the World Trade Center in New York City, but by the time of WTC 2) and has been in the public domain for at least 15 years, and will be open by the end of the decade or more. While its cost and availability have not changed significantly since the 1920s, the building remained an extremely expensive construction.

The Building

The Empire State Building is one of the most complex buildings in all of Washington DC. It cost $29.9 million in 2003 and has nearly four stories. Much like the US Capitol, the main floor is occupied by the Capital One building, a 17th Century-style skyscraper (the first of its kind) located at 506 South Central Ave. The massive central tower is made from 1.5 feet of cement and is in a very favorable condition. The building was a major component of the Federal Reserve System during the World War II run (although it still stands) that produced the US economy and created US currency. The story is a bit complex.

The Empire State Building (A) was built in 1915 and covered over 25,000 square feet of office space, and is estimated to have attracted about $1.2 trillion in revenue over
