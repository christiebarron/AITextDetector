The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The Empire State Building was demolished over 5,000 years ago. Most of the building lies in the region of the Bronx, and it is home to the Brooklyn Bridge Museum and the World Trade Center. Other notable landmarks have been the Empire State Building and State House, in New York City â€“ one building is located in the Rockefeller Center.

The Empire State Building was originally used for a gas station on the north side of the Manhattan River. This building, at 957 North 4th Avenue, was originally owned by the National Railway Corporation and later acquired for $7.5 million in 1948 for a total renovation of the building. The station is now only accessible to the working railroad by ferry.
