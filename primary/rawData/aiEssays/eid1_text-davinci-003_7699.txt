This line is included at the end of the poem to emphasize the idea of resilience, of not giving up even when faced with overwhelming challenges. The speaker is suggesting that even though the hibiscus is dying in the winter, it will come alive again in the spring, just like the speaker will take the test again despite feeling unsure now. This is a powerful message that resonates with anyone who has ever gone through a difficult experience.
