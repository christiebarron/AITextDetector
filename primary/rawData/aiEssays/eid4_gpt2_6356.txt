The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it explains how they were told and how they used the power of their powers in ways that are now impossible to understand. They're given a lot of other stories and events. It was a very weird and touching experience for me as a writer and a new reader. Hopefully the new readers will like it.

One of the reasons I was drawn as a fan was to see this book about the events in the fictional city of Phoenix. The city was populated by real people. I was there when the show came to be, and then the show finally took hold of town in the aftermath of the fall, and then the show finally allowed me to revisit that place and the time I spent there was all very real. It was a very long time. One of the things I loved about this city is that it's a real place.

I was able to really tell that in my imagination. It was like when I was trying to figure out what the real city was like before. There was literally this place that was just this massive, living place that I was able to move to after hearing my voice and the stories of people who just walked into this city. I really fell in love with that world because I remember walking down the street of that town and going to the back store that was opening up and seeing so much action in this huge, big, big scene. That was what felt right for me as a reader.
