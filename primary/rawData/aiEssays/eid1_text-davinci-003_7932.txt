Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, From Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, captures a deep and nostalgic mood that is characterized by a longing for home and a deep sense of nostalgia for the past.

Throughout the book, Rodriguez attempts to bridge together the present with his past. He looks back on his childhood in Newark, New Jersey, his family, and friends as an attempt to grapple with the understanding that no matter how far away he may roam, there is always the knowledge inside him of where his home is. He takes us through his immigrant parents highly influenced by their Cuban background, his attempt to break away from their expectations with his career ambition, and the love he holds for his home even when it seems impossible to bridge the gap between it and his present.

The tone of the memoir is one of longing and reverence as he looks back on moments that have changed his life. Rodriguez fiercely talks of his love for his hometown, often reminiscing on his longing for the sense of community that his home once had. He describes the strength of deep connection he has for the place, no matter how much his life may have changed.

The most powerful theme that runs throughout the memoir is that of having a sense of home, regardless of where you are in the world. His nostalgia for his old life appears throughout, but it is balanced with the successes he finds in his new surroundings. Itâ€™s a reminder to us all to hold tightly to the memories
