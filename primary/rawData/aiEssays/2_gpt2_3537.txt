I believe that censorship of materials in libraries would be beneficial to freedom of expression and academic freedom. The problem is, all these attempts at censorship also result in many government decisions.

My own reaction to these attempts is to look into what is happening in libraries across the whole global economy. I believe that censorship is a necessary evil to ensure that every book in the world is free and open, so that the public, wherever it is, will be able to fully appreciate both the original, but at the same time as well as at the same time a source is not censored to protect the copyright owner. When I have said the above things about the freedom of the people, one of two things happened for me: the censorship turned out to be as a good example, so that we would not have to worry about this censorship. I think that is also a matter that can be done under my power.

I also believe that censorship is one thing, but when a government is dictating to its citizens which works, then there is often something wrong. And when that corruption is rampant and so much government bureaucracy and bureaucracy exists without a clear message, then you can see the consequences. This is the only option there is for freedom and free expression.
