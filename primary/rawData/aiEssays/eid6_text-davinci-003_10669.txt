The building of the Empire State Building posed a unique problem: its completion marked the first time an American skyscraper had been designed to accommodate the docking of dirigibles. The phenomenon of human flight was so new, however, that the architects and builders of the Empire State Building had to confront a number of obstacles in order to complete this daring feat. 

First, the building itself posed a challenge. Dirigibles required a mooring mast that was higher than the roof of the building, which meant that the engineers had to come up with a new structural solution. The solution came in the form of a four-hundred-foot steel tower that extended beyond the highest point of the building. The tower was connected to the building by giant steel cables, which allowed for the safe and secure docking of the dirigibles.

Second, the engineers had to find a way to design the mooring mast and base to handle the stress that was exerted when the dirigibles approached and departed, while also allowing for easy disembarkation. The engineers came up with a complex system that incorporated a heavy lead spar, giant pulleys, and massive springs, all connected to a series of different brackets and supports. The spar-controlled system allowed the dirigible passengers to disembark without having to take a ladder or any other type of platform, making the process much simpler. 

Finally, the construction of the mooring mast also posed a risk from the weather.
