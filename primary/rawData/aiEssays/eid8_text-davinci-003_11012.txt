I met my fianc√©e three years ago at a mutual friend's birthday party. From the moment I met him, I was filled with so much joy that words could not even express. Whenever we were together, we were constantly laughing and having a great time, so I knew it was meant to be.

One of my favorite memories with him was the time we went camping in the middle of nowhere. After dinner, we went for a walk and stopped by a nearby lake. As the sun was setting, we just sat there, admiring the scenery in awe. Suddenly, a fish jumped up from the water and we both jumped back in surprise. We started cracking up at how silly we must have looked, and that was the moment I knew that he was the one for me.

We lay there on the grass, looking up at the stars, laughing and talking, until the sun rose. It was definitely one of the best moments of my life, and I will never forget how we connected through our laughter.
