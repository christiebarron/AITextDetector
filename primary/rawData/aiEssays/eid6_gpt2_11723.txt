The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. The biggest obstacle was the fact that they could fly on the same platform as space shuttle launch vehicles. In some cases they could not use the Falcon Heavy itself, so they required the Falcon to be tethered to ground. (See "Empire State Building Triggers Vertical Airplane Use for Unmanned Aircraft" in Flight Engineering.)

The Empire State Building was located on North Broadway, adjacent to one of the two existing rocket companies, Space & Industry & Exploration. The building opened in 1920. The building was designed to cater to the needs of commercial spaceflight. Commercial spaceflight has become largely a niche field in which a large number of companies struggle.

In a year-long study by the California Institute of Technology Research Institute (CSIRO), a joint project between the University of California California Santa Barbara and the Stanford University Graduate Center, researchers sought to understand the future of the space industry as a whole. They examined the state of the aerospace industry and suggested what were the key technologies that would be useful for commercial and commercial spaceflight.


For now, CSIRO recommends the following solutions:

"There are three ways to deploy an aircraft directly on the space shuttle: launch payloads or carry payloads to a remote landing site or use an aircraft that is not controlled by a pilot. In other words, they aren't flying for commercial or commercial use." "In the
