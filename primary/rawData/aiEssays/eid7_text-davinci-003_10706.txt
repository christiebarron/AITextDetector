I remember a time when I was walking home from school. It had been raining, and the sidewalk was wet and slippery. I slipped and fell onto my side. I felt embarrassed, and all I wanted to do was go home. 

But then, a woman walked by and noticed me. She stopped and asked if I was okay. I said I was, but I was really embarrassed. But instead of laughing at me, she just smiled and said, “That’s okay. It happens. Take your time and get back up.” 

She was so patient with me. She waited there with me until I finally mustered up the courage to get back up and continue walking. I thanked her for her help and she simply smiled and went on her way. 

I’m so thankful to her for being so patient with me and not making me feel ashamed. She helped me through a difficult time and showed me that people are capable of being understanding and tolerant in difficult situations.
