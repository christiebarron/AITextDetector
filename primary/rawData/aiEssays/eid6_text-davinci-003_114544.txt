The construction of the Empire State Building and its mooring mast for dirigibles to dock presented gargantuan challenges due to the size and complexity of the project, as well as the magnitude of the task and the cutting-edge technology involved. According to Marcia Amidon Lüsted’s “The Mooring Mast”, many engineers, builders, and pilots were involved in constructing the advanced piece of engineering, but the difficulty with such a task was incomparable to anything ever before attempted.

One of the first and most daunting obstacle was the sheer size of the building itself. The mast was to rise 1,200 feet above the city on the 102-story building, and the mast and root systems had to be strong enough to dock and hold a 200-foot dirigible securely. The foundation and architectural design required a majority of the welding in the building to be done in steel, and fuel tanks had to be installed against a strict deadline. Those in charge of the project also encountered issues because of the surrounding buildings and skyline, which limited the scope of the project while providing potential interference due to unexpected obstacles or hazards from the densely populated urban environment.

The complexity of the mast was another problem faced by the builders. The mast needed to be equipped with sixteen electromagnets all linked to a sophisticated switchboard that was designed to lock into the hull of a dirigible as it approached the tower. Despite its complexity, the switchboard also had
