The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' has remained very positive (to put it mildly) for Mr Turnbull and the Government and it represents a bold new phase in his leadership.

It makes it clear he believes that his party would have been better left to its own devices if it was a single-minded party. He has repeatedly told his party colleagues that he is not against a change to party principles but the party would "work itself out".

In a clear bid for unity, his government has been looking for unity through its support of "minimal political reforms", as Mr Turnbull labelled recently in a letter to the ABC. He called for the introduction of the "no party" policy at the end of the decade.

While the government might be concerned that the party's leadership campaign could be undermined by its decision to abandon an election promise to provide some of the support from the party in return for its support, it is clearly determined to move this forward and to win more unity while still making significant political changes.

While it is unclear how Mr Turnbull's strategy will work, Mr Turnbull believes a change must be made in the party's approach if it is to take to the House of Representatives and win.
