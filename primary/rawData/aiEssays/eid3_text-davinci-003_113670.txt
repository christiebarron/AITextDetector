The features of the setting in Joe Kurmaski’s “Rough Road Ahead” affect the cyclist in many ways. The most obvious is the physical setting—the road itself is narrow and rocky, with many obstacles in the cyclist’s path, such as rocks, ridges, and roots. These physical features slow the cyclist down, making it more difficult for him to reach his destination.

Furthermore, the setting of the story affects the cyclist in a psychological way. The rough terrain and obstacles challenge him to push through despite the difficulties. Notice that this is an interior journey, as the cyclist faces a mental battle of will, as he battles personal fears and doubts, as well as his physical fatigue. He must confront them head-on in the face of the rough and difficult road ahead.

The weather conditions of the setting also offer obstacles for the cyclist. Strong gusts of wind make it difficult for him to reach his destination, while the scorching sun raises his body temperature and makes progress slower and less comfortable.

Finally, the environment of the setting contributes to the cyclist’s journey. The beauty of the landscape distracts him from his struggles and encourages him to keep going. The majestic nature—including the trees, the sky, and the wildlife—all motivate the cyclist to conquer his inner struggles and continue moving forward.
