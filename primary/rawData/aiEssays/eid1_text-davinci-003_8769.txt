I have always treasured my relationship with my best friend, and our laughter was a huge part of that.

We had been best friends since kindergarten, but things really changed when we started high school. We had grown apart over the years, but we still stayed in touch. 

One day, I received a call from my best friend, inviting me to dinner. I tentatively accepted, feeling anxious. We hadn't interacted in a long time, and I was worried that so much time had passed that we'd no longer get along. 

When I arrived at the restaurant, I was glad to see that my worries were unfounded. We immediately launched into conversation, catching up on each other's lives. All of a sudden, one of us made a silly joke and the restaurant erupted with laughter. It felt so wonderful to be laughing and joking with my best friend again. It was like nothing had changed since we were kids. 

We laughed and laughed until our bellies hurt, and we were both wiping away tears by the end of the evening. 

My best friend helped me to realize that our friendship was still strong and nothing could tear us apart, not even time apart. It was a reminder that laughter really is the best medicine.
