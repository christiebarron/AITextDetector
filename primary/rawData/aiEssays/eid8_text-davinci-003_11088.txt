I remember the first time I met my future in-laws. I wasn't sure what to expect when I walked through the front door, so I was pretty nervous. They welcomed me with open arms, but there was an awkward silence in the room that lasted much longer than I would have liked.

Just when I was about to break the silence with an ill-executed joke, my soon-to-be sister-in-law said something funny. We all laughed hysterically, and it was the perfect icebreaker. The tension I had been feeling melted away and we were able to chat and get to know each other better.

That's the thing I love so much about laughter - it can bring people together even when thereâ€™s an awkwardness in the air. We stayed up talking and laughing well into the night and, by the end of it, I felt like I was already part of the family. 

Who knew that laughter could be so powerful?
