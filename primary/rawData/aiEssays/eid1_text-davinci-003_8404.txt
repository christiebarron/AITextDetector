One time I remember being incredibly patient was when my young daughter was learning to ride her bike.

At first, she was so excited and eager to “get it.” But after some initial success, her progress stalled and it seemed like no amount of encouragement and instruction could help her get over the hump.

Day after day, I kept at it, watching her bump along the sidewalk with her training wheels to no avail. She’d get frustrated and start to cry, but I was determined to remain patient and encouraging.

Finally, after months of practice and getting back on her bike after every setback, she finally got the hang of it. She rode around the block all by herself, with a huge smile on her face.

It was an incredibly rewarding experience and a reminder of the importance of being patient. Even when it seemed like she was never going to get it, I knew that if I just stayed committed and kept up that same level of encouragement, she would eventually succeed.
