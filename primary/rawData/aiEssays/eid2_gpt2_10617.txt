I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is the most effective deterrent against censorship," the organization's president, Rui Pong, told the China Review. "However, the fact that some sources, as well as private sources, are not freely available to those in China shows that such sources are also biased."

But the issue is not over immediately for academic critics who have recently been targeted by the authorities.

"This is something we should think about in a more mature and open way, when scholars and government offices can be more transparent about what's going on," Li Jingsheng, vice-president at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Journal Science in 2014.

China's censorship regime will not be as tough as some of the other major countries. It may also see this "censorship" as an opportunity for government and private firms to make things more private and be more open for scholars and policy makers to meet creatively.

For now, academics and policy makers should wait for the end of the year. After the end of the World Cup, the National Academy of Sciences recently published a report calling on the country's education system to implement measures to address online censorship.
