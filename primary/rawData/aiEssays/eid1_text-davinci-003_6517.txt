Dear Editor,

The introduction of computers into the lives of everyday people has had an undeniably large impact on the way we think, communicate and view the world. As technology advances, so too do the implications of relying heavily on computers for our needs.

Recent studies have shown that an increase in computer usage does have an effect on our intelligence and attention span, probably indicating that relying too heavily on machines can limit our own learning and concentration capabilities. Excessive computer usage can also add to feelings of loneliness in some individuals, since the majority of online interaction lacks real face-to-face contact.

On the other hand, there are a number of advantages associated with computers. The easy accessibility of information online has opened up a world of knowledge that would otherwise be unreachable. Computers have also made the job market more competitive by providing fast and efficient ways of working.

In conclusion, computers undeniably play a large role in our lives, but ultimately it is up to us to decide how and when to use this technology. If used responsibly, computers can be a great tool that can help us to be more productive and informed citizens.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
