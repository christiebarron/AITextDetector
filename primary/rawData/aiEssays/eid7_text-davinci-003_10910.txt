I recently had to babysit my two kids while my wife was out of town. On the first night, they were both exhausted from the travel and were so cranky. I was exhausted too and felt overwhelmed with how to calm them down. I was feeling very patient at first, but as the crying and whining continued on, I was getting more and more frustrated. 

Then I remembered something I learned recently in parenting classes - that a calm and patient parent could easily make the situation better. Instead of getting angry, I imagined myself in their shoes - I understood how tired they were, how they must feel having to sleep in a strange place and being without their mom. 

With that in mind, I decided to be patient with them and take it one step at a time. Instead of getting frustrated and yelling, I talked to them in a soothing voice, gave them a warm bath and let them sleep in my bed.

It was definitely a challenge - but in the end, my patience paid off. By the end of the week, my kids were much more relaxed and were much easier to handle. Being patient taught me a valuable lesson in parenting - that it's important to understand and be patient with your kids, even when the situation is difficult.
