I was out on a date with my new boyfriend, and although we had had a great time talking, laughing together and getting to know each other, there was definitely some nervousness between us. When the bill came, I was so awkward and embarrassed because I hadn't expected it to be so expensive. I was about to take out my wallet, and he reached over and put his hand on mine to stop me, saying that he wanted to pay. I had never had anyone ever do that before, and I was so touched that he was so gallant.

At that very moment, we both burst into a fit of laughter. We both were relieved from the awkwardness, and it just broke the tension that had been building between us. We laughed together all the way back to my place, and I knew that night that I found the person I were meant to be with. Laughter had connected us in a way we never thought possible.
