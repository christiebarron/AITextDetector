To the Editor, 

As technology advances, so too have the number of people spending their days glued to a computer. From work to entertainment, our lives are becoming increasingly dependent on these machines. But what are the effects computers have on us?

It is undeniable that the ubiquity of computers has drastically improved the global level of communication. Now, in an instant, people can send a message across the world. That same convenience also destroys the quality of interpersonal relationships as we grow ever more isolated behind our screens. 

On the job front, computers are both a boon and a hindrance. By connecting us and creating easy access to an overwhelming number of resources, we can now complete tasks more efficiently than ever before. But by doing so, computers also reduce the number of manual-labor jobs, a burden particularly felt in the developing world. 

Finally and perhaps most concerning, computers insidiously condition us to seek instant gratification when all too often, we must be patient. But even this latest technology cannot make up for hard work and dedication. 

All in all, computers should be used responsibly as both a means of communication and an aid for tedious activities, but not as a replacement for interpersonal relationships and meaningful work.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
