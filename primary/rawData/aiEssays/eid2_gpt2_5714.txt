I believe that censorship of materials in libraries that are used for religious or charitable purposes is a violation of religious freedom, and it is not possible to defend such material within the framework of religious freedom laws."

The letter states that a lawsuit by libraries is the "preceding evidence" that the government has any constitutional right to collect personal information about the libraries. It also says the government cannot remove library materials from the public domain for such reasons as "commercial use," the government can't collect certain materials in "public interest" and "personal use."

The ACLU's letter also says all libraries are obliged by law to treat all library materials according to a fair "use policy." The ACLU also noted that an investigation is ordered on any library violation of a constitutional prohibition by law enforcement.

The ACLU says these efforts will result in the collection of the personal information of the American people.

The ACLU said it hopes the lawsuit will have an impact on the public's right to know the story of the Boston bombing, which left 168 people dead.

The U.S. Library of Congress is preparing to close more than 150 libraries in 50 states in the next few weeks.
