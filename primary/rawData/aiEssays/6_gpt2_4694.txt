The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. First was a lack of power for the crane's crew. Second was its poor safety record along the Long Line. Third, and more problematic, was the fact that many of the tower's towers have large windows with a red cross coming off and the cross coming backwards, meaning the window was not secure during the construction. Finally, some of the tower's steel beams were too small, especially those for the elevator shafts. Because of that, many builders made the decision in July to switch to a single steel folds as opposed to adding a crane.

The elevator was an early feature for building a crane. But as recently as 1975, it had been designed on the project to be mounted only horizontally, rather than vertically. When the elevator finally broke, the design was criticized for being too narrow. But it proved as far as we were concerned. New elevator construction started in 1981, and it continues to be built ever since.

In May 2002, the first crane built for the City of Sacramento finished work and arrived on the property through a temporary lift. That particular lift ran from 8 feet to 22 feet short of the span. To accommodate the crane's crew, builders had to add more vertical equipment. But they were still working on their own and building a crane that looked more like a crane.
