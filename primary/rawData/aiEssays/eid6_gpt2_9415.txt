The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. In the late 1940s, the company needed to move to the far east of New York to expand its fleet and create new jobs.

The statehouse, built in 1946 or 1947, could accommodate more than 2,500 people, but it never reached capacity.

"No other building in Manhattan was as diverse as this one, and we didn't have a lot of work to do when the State Building was constructed," said Thomas S. Hartman, a member of the executive committee. "We were stuck."

The decision to give up the statehouse came after Gov. Daniel R. Cuomo of New York, the former top Democrat on the State Assembly, asked him to approve the building's new lease, saying it had allowed the construction industry to compete for office space.

Mr. Hartman, who attended the meeting, said that it became clear that the project had not had a chance to go forward quickly.

The government could not afford to wait. The building had already been leased to the state as recently as 2004 when the lease expired, when it reached a deal with the city of Manhattan, to use the building as a private hotel for the New York World's Fair, and then in 2015 when Mr. Cuomo signed an order that required the building to be turned into a separate 109-story building.
