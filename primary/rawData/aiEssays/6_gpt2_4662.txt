The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock.

The main obstacle was the sheer size of its hangar and its lack of a clear "hub" leading to a clear out to the hangar entrance. The narrow opening behind the cockpit door proved to be one of the toughest areas to overcome. Another challenge was the lack of concrete or concrete blocks that would allow a solid concrete anchor (like some used to make concrete in the 1930s) to be anchored to the concrete anchor and to act as a support structure.

In addition the builders of the state building lacked a strong concrete anchor (a kind of steel chain) which would prevent the metal cables from breaking.

So how much of one of these two problems did the Empire State Building have?

That depends on whether you look at the total cost of building, and the general total of the state building materials.

The first problem to consider is the cost of construction. The Empire State Building cost was more than $10 billion. This included all the construction work hallucinogenically (or perhaps just a fewostonians who had never heard of hallucinogens), building materials, and the materials themselves. All of this cost was to be covered by the government.

Even in New York the cost of building a single building was over $40 billion per year. On top of that the Empire State Building would have had to pay for half the city's population and a lot
