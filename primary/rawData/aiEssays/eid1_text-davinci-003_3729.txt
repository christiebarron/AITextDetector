Dear Editor, 

It’s no surprise that computers have become a staple in our lives. We use them for business, entertainment, and communication – and this trend is continuing to grow. However, it is important to discuss the effects computers may have on people in today’s world.

Many people are concerned about the impact computers can have on mental and physical health. Those who spend hours every day sitting in one place with their eyes fixed on a screen can face the risk of developing long-term health issues. There have also been reports of psychological problems from people who are excessively exposed to computer use, such as insomnia, depression, and anxiety.

On the other hand, computers can also be a source of many benefits. People can use computers to search for information, watch presentations, attend classes, communicate with each other, and access an immense database of knowledge. Furthermore, computers make life easier by automating lengthy and tedious tasks.

Overall, computers are necessary in the current era, but it is important that people take breaks from their screen time and give their bodies time to relax and restore. Excessive computer use can be detrimental in both physical and mental health, so it is important to be aware of this and take necessary precautions and practice moderation.

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
