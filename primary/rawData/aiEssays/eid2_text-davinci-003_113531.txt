Censorship in libraries is a hot topic today. Public libraries offer up a wealth of information and resources to the community, and it is critical that their patrons have access to a variety of materials that can help them to educate themselves and form their own opinions about the world. Yet some believe that certain materials should be removed from libraries if they are deemed offensive. 

I disagree with this notion. Censorship in libraries is censorship of thought, and we must oppose its encroachment. Too often, censorship results in the silencing of dissenting or difficult views. It undermines the educational mission of libraries and prevents people from learning the alternate perspectives that might challenge or open their minds.

Furthermore, censorship restricts patronsâ€™ right to information and access to ideas. It contradicts the principles of intellectual freedom and freedom of expression, and runs contrary to the vision of a society that encourages open discourse and equal access to information. Public libraries must not shy away from exposing patrons to a variety of materials. Instead, they should provide access to a range of ideas, perspectives, and worldviews.

Censorship of books, music, movies, and magazines should not take place in public libraries. Educators should act as guides to help patrons navigate the array of different materials and should be encouraged to explore the nuances of controversial materials. Such materials can be used by educators to facilitate lively and respectful conversation, and to challenge their students to think more critically and develop their own opinions.
