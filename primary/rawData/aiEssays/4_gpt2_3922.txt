The world is the same now. The characters in the novel's timeline continue to grow, develop and interact in a real-world world. With this sort of realism, the reader feels more comfortable talking to the characters 306 of "Snow White and the Huntsman". The fact that Snow's world is such a good deal of work means that the reader is more informed about Snow, too, which makes for a more real world setting that feels meaningful.
On the other hand, there is a lot of literature in which the character of Snow White is described and used throughout all kinds of fictional or mythological contexts, from novels written at the end of the 1800's to the present day. This includes The Lord of the Rings and countless other fantasy novels by Tolkien, John Ford, Douglas Adams and Tolkien, and other stories that are being told today. You can go to a lot of information about historical figures including their names, their lives, their professions, their languages, their societies and more by researching each character's story and writing the characters' story in a way that is authentic to that particular historical period. By doing a research, you can make that real-world fictional world feel more authentic to the story of other characters in the background.
