Dear Editor,

As I am sure you are aware, the continued growth and prevalence of computers in our everyday lives has had a significant impact on our society. From the way we communicate with each other to the way we access information, the effects of computers on people’s lives can be seen everywhere.

When used responsibly, computers can be a great asset. By making information more easily accessible, computers can help foster an environment of knowledge and learning. Additionally, computers can help to connect people around the world, allowing us to communicate in ways unimaginable even just a few decades ago.

On the other hand, computers can also have negative effects on people’s lives, such as desensitizing us to the world around us or creating a sense of dependence. We must be thoughtful in considering how the use of computers may be changing us, either positively or negatively.

Overall, I believe that the positive effects of computers outweigh the potential negatives. By continuing to responsibly use the technology that is available to us, I believe that we can adopt the advances of computers to improve our lives as a society.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
