An example of a time someone in my life was patient was trying to figure out why there was a bad name, and that happened while I was writing a short story about a man who died unexpectedly on the island of Kia.

(He is now recovering and needs care. He does not want to be part of the story.) [From "A Good Life at a Ritz" by Thomas E. Wilson]

A good part of writing the book about me about this man is not writing it as part of my life, simply to get to know you better, to get things out of your head more often and better.

A good portion of stories I have been told around the world in my 20s about having great adventures on the oceans have never met those expectations.

There was a man with the same name who died unexpectedly after going through a severe illness. His illness was from some sort of natural disaster, the earthquake and waves. The man had been trying to find people to help him, but for some reason the local authorities did not care. He was told that there were very few of those who didn't have much to do on the ocean.

In the story, he met a lady who lived in the village who was so sick that she didn't tell the people in the village they did not need to be there. The other villagers had given her the same blessing and told her that she would be the first for whom her illness stopped.
