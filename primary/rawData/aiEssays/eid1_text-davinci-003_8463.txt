I was helping a friend with a project that was very important to him. He needed my help to complete it, but working on it was difficult for him. He was anxious and frustrated, and it took a long time for him to make progress. I could see that he was struggling, so I chose to be patient with him. I stayed by his side and encouraged him to keep going. I reminded him that he could do it and that it would all be worth it when he finished. 

We kept at it together and eventually the project was completed. I was so proud of him for not giving up and for being brave enough to tackle something so challenging. Being patient with him was definitely worth it in the end.
