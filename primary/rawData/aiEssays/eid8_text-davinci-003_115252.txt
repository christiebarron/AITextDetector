 

I love to laugh. My friends would often tell me I have the ability to light up a room with just my laugh.

Growing up, most of my friends were boys and so they’d compete for who could make me laugh the most. Usually, they would compete by telling the silliest jokes; although, the sillier the joke, the bigger my smile and laughter. 

I fondly remember when I was about 13-years-old, I went to the movies with some friends from school. We went to see a romantic comedy and, at the end, when the couple shared their first kiss, my friends made some jokes that made me laugh so hard, the entire theater turned around and gave us an evil glare. 

But rather than being embarrassed, I felt tickled and accepted. I felt as if those who were watching us laughing were looking upon us with understanding. As if they were also aware of the power of connection that laughter creates between two people. 

And so, I’m thankful for the understanding of my friends, for their capacity to make me laugh. To this day I still remember that movie theatre incident and the funny jokes my friends thought of to make me laugh. 

They taught me that laughter is the best way to build meaningful connections. And that, without a doubt, is my favorite lesson from my teenage years.
