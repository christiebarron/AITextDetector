Computers have many effects on people. However, it hasn't been clear what these effects are for them or how they alter the actions of the players. If a machine like this is designed to affect how computers work, the problems with its use can be resolved either by solving problems that the players would want to avoid by eliminating computers altogether, or by simply having a single machine run a game instead.

The game has come to understand that this kind of game play is not simply a matter of buying computer hardware, but, more importantly, of getting to know how to get it built out. "Somehow I think the human brain is just like computers that are built for speed, but I actually don't get along with machine parts that aren't designed for speed," explained Gary. "This is going to be, for the most part, a game with a lot of other important issues that people are going to have to deal with. It will be a game where you have to play with a computer, but your time with it will be limited."
