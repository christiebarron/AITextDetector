I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is a central concept in many places, including to prevent those interested in exploring human potential through language as well as intellectual discourse. We believe this will be done in both English and Indian languages in the future, even if censorship has not been officially implemented yet.

One more word: censorship of media content.

Why censorship?

Bully threats and threats of violence against anyone that "blatantly opposes" the current system.

Bully threats are in general considered dangerous, and are quite likely to be used to intimidate those who dissent.

This does not mean that all people should either be silenced in any way or that people should not be able to express their views. All censorship in India is based on these facts.

In the past several years, censorship against freedom of speech in India was more serious than any others in the world. As the Indian government attempted to control media outlets and press freedoms in the name of the government, the government tried to suppress voices. This has led to the establishment of fake news organizations using fake language to report on the events.

The first official attempt of censorship had been made Journalistic Communications Minister (JC) Gopal, who is also a student and author. Journalists and scholars have argued for years that if we look back at censorship of media in India, people have been forced under pressure to provide information on topics such as human rights, civil liberties, gender equality etc.
