Once, I was having lunch with a friend when I suddenly began to laugh uncontrollably. I couldn't even explain why I was laughing so hard, but that didn't stop me from carrying on for several minutes. Eventually, my friend began to laugh too, and before long she was laughing just as hard as I was. 

The original source of my laughter was a total mystery, but it didn't really matter. We ended up sharing an amazing experience that went beyond words. In the midst of all that laughter, we were connected in a way that no one else could understand. 

To this day, my friend and I often talk about that moment and how it was really the start of our friendship. We may never know exactly why we laughed so hard back then, but we'll never forget that moment and the joy it brought us.
