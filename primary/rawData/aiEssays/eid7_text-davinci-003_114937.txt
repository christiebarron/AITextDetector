I was grocery shopping the other day, and it was incredibly busy. People were congested and the lines were especially long. The cashier in my line wasn't very fast, and she kept making mistakes and needed help from her co-worker.

Some people in line got frustrated and began grumbling, but I knew that a lot of people were in a hurry. I decided to be patient and understand the situation; the cashier was obviously having difficulty due to the chaotic environment. Therefore, I didn't express my frustration. Instead, I focused on the positive and enjoyed conversing with the people around me even though we had all been waiting a while. 

Finally, after nearly 45 minutes, I made it to the front of the line and finished the checkout process. Although I had been waiting a long time, I was still thankful that I had remembered to be patient and go with the flow.
