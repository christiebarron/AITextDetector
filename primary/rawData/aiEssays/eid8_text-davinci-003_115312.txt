 

I remember like it was yesterday: my best friend and I were walking to school after a long summer apart. We had just gotten done catching up for the past hour, and we felt like old times had come back. We felt a warmth in our hearts, and I suddenly had the urge to just be silly. 

So, as we were walking, I reached over and tickled her. She started giggling, and of course I joined in. We must have looked like absolute idiots, but we couldn't stop. We couldn't help but laugh at each other's antics, chortling until our stomachs hurt and tears ran down our faces. 

Eventually, we ran out of energy and had to head into class. Everyone must have thought we were crazy, but we didn't care. After that point, whenever dark clouds began to appear, all we had to do was look at each other and burst into laughter again. 

Laughter really is the best medicine, and it's something my best friend and I will always cherish.
