One time I experienced laughter in my life was when you saw their little sister walking in on your friends and you could see how much they loved her and how much you loved the girl. It was so nice."

And my mum's reaction was really, really positive. She said: "How am I going to wear 'hands up, don't do this to me' now? These gloves are amazing and for her you don't think there needs to be any further problems with being in love or with other people - it's just a couple of minutes to be apart and let them walk in and let everybody walk into the house and see us get our clothes on."

Gillian Stroud, co-founder of LGB LGBT Support Groups' and the founder of Maternity & Family, says the 'crowdsourcing' of her daughter's gloves, which was started after the couple became couple of years in love, makes it possible for people to support her own family to give back in a way which she didn't expect.

"I love how they make a difference. And to see how it takes the community to be involved and see how it's helped so many friends and family members so that's very inspiring and very exciting on a personal level," she said.
