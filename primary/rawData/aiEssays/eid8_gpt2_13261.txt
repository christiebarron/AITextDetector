One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I saw someone laugh when I was talking to my girlfriend at work with her looking very funny. It just happened. It happened to him while I was in my bedroom when he was just taking a shower or something. It was hilarious. Just a simple joke.

"For me to see a person laugh that many people laugh about, is really impressive because it doesn't matter if they were in an animal movie, comic book, anyplace and even in a movie. They simply laugh because of the person. And it doesn't matter if I'm laughing or not. It doesn't matter what you're saying. It's all about your voice too. People laugh very funny because they can hear you saying it."

The idea for this app is simple enough, but that's not the key. And a lot depends on how comfortable you can be with it's simplicity on the outside.

"For people I work with, they do really well using it. They love taking notes when they're stressed and I've never seen any complaints about it. I mean, it's one of those things where you don't ever need to look for fault with it and it's just great. And a lot of people love it because it's great at that aspect because it's easy to get into the habit of looking at it that way. You don't know what the 'what' is, what's going on at the moment.
