The mood created in the memoir 'From Home is' is an optimistic optimism.

The author says:

The most difficult part was actually to convince parents who wanted to have an opinion about a child or a relationship. They need to feel good about their own family and the values of the children they're holding. 'From Home is' about the way families and friendships work and whether children of different generations should be raised in the same family.

It is a 'one-stop shop' for parents in a time of rising anxiety, depression, frustration and despair; but a 'working-man's' book.
