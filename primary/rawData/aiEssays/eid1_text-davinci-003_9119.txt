To the Editor:

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects that computers have on people. Over the past decade, computers have had a profound impact on the way humans interact, communicate, and work. With the invention of the Internet and social media, computers have changed how we interact with one another, leading to an unprecedented level of connectivity.

However, while computers are incredibly beneficial, there are also some potential drawbacks. Computers can leave people feeling more isolated and detached from other people. This can lead to a lack of meaningful relationships, leading to increased feelings of loneliness and depression in some people. In addition, computers can also act as a means of distraction, eating up precious time that could be better spent on activities such as socializing or recreation.

While computers have opened up a world of possibilities, it is important to remember the potential drawbacks of our reliance on them. My opinion is that it is necessary to limit our exposure to computers in order to ensure we maintain our human connections and personal relationships. We need to remember that computers cannot replace real-life interaction and should not be used as a substitute for meaningful engagement with those around us.

I hope that I have persuaded you to agree with my view, and that you can join me in advocating for moderation when it comes to computer use.

Sincerely, 

[Your Name]
