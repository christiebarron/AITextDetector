I was sitting in the back of the classroom during a lecture, taking notes on my laptop, when out of nowhere, my computer suddenly stopped working. I felt frustrated and my concentration began to slip, but I quickly remembered to take a deep breath and stay patient.

I asked the professor if there was a break coming up soon so that I could try to fix my problem. He said no, but he could slow down to give me more time to try and sort out my issues. I thanked him for offering his help and told him that it wasnâ€™t necessary and that I could wait.

I then turned to my neighbor and asked if I could borrow their laptop so that I could continue taking notes. They happily obliged and I took their laptop, making sure to thank them for the favor.

The rest of the lecture passed by without any further incidents and at the end of it, I thanked the professor for his patience and my neighbor for lending me their laptop.

I took my laptop to the IT department later that day and it turns out that all I needed was a quick restart. I was so relieved and thankful that I had taken the time to stay patient instead of getting flustered and angry.
