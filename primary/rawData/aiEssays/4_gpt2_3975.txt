The book Winter Hibiscus ends the way it does because it has a certain amount of humor and is told here at no cost. UDPP, you know that.

"Couple of words to explain, this really got me started because I haven't listened to a single one of these original tunes. I still haven't realized how good the music is, how good I actually did sound as I'm listening. In my whole life it wasn't that I wanted to play some obscure rock sound but I've never heard it sound good. I think at the same time it was a huge plus because it reminded me that I was not only playing something that I thought I could play but was something I could actually really play. It made me happy and so I just needed some time to look at my music and try to make it better. Sometimes it can take quite a while, but it was really worth the read. It really got me out of my comfort zone and allowed me to truly explore my sound and figure out how to make it sound even better." -Michael Jackson
