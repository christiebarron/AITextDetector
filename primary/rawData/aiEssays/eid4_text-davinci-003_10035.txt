At the end of the story, the narrator, a young Chinese girl, has taken a test and failed it. She reflects on how, since she was born into a world with unfair expectations, she can't help but feel a certain level of failure. She examines how the winter hibiscus flowers, which thrive in spite of the winter months, are a metaphor for her own resilience despite the hardships she faces. The ending of the story is meant to offer a glimmer of hope for the narrator, suggesting that her resilience will remain and she will have another opportunity to take the test until she succeeds. The final line serves to express this hope, reassuring the narrator that when she regroups and returns in the spring, she can continue to try until she achieves her goals.
