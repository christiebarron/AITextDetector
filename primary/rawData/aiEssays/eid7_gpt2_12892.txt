An example of a time someone in my life was patient was when I was living in the South.

When the first generation of women entered our country, they were not a natural selection agent. We saw great change in our society with advances in medicine and research on sexuality. But they were also part of an evolving family, including members of immigrant groups in the developed world. The country in which they lived got a lot richer in those years, both on education standards as well as quality of life. People felt the need to develop children, especially single women, because of the cost of work and the demands of families. The more we took steps in education like more affordable education to help get the women back on track and have children. It also changed our educational system. It also contributed to our sense of inequality. In many countries, women in their thirties are still doing well. For them, having children is a gift, but the economic impact is small. Today, nearly one in seven young women is poor; not even getting an early education will significantly reduce the life expectancy of low-skilled workers by a staggering 85 years. If those women are left too poor to contribute to the economy, they won't become citizens in any practical sense, and our educational system will continue to struggle with high unemployment rates.
