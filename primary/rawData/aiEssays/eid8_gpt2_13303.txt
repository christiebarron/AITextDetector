One time I experienced laughter in my life was when I had the first laugh or when I was feeling depressed about my mother's suicide. So I was very happy. But when someone really hurt my mother it really went away. So I want to talk less about what's in the past and more about the things in the future.

In my case. And I will always say that I was a little disturbed. My mother was not the one that killed my brother but my grandparents. My grandmother. So I understand that for some people who are suffering from depression and others who are suffering from anxiety it is possible. But because of my own family and my own upbringing I was raised on the same level as me. And when it comes to my family I am different. I am still alive, but I no longer look like that. My mother died. She's survived a great many times.

I remember when I was 13 and I was at school. We are the same age. You know when I was 13 it was my dadxia. He wasn't healthy and, unfortunately my dad was too young for our own good. He was dying of cancer. And in my heart I remember him always saying that I was such a burden, even while he was alive. In that moment I also heard one voice who said it would give me the strength from the present, from the future. And then later on I heard the other voices who saidâ€¦ I am as strong!
