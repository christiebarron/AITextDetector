I recently had the opportunity to watch my cousin demonstrate her patience. Her children were arguing and fighting, and she wanted to step in and stop it. As I watched her, I was impressed at her level of patience and understanding. She calmly tried to explain to the children how their words and actions were hurting each other. She even fielded questions from the kids, offering explanations for why their behavior was not appropriate.

As the children continued to be defiant and argue, she didn't escalate the situation or make it worse. Instead, she stayed firm in her tone and demeanor, and I could tell she was being as empathetic as possible. She smiled often, and when the situation finally calmed down, she thanked the kids for eventually listening. 

I was incredibly impressed by my cousin's patience in that situation, and it made me proud to be related to her and witness her own personal growth.
