When I was growing up, my grandmother was frequently sick with chronic illness. She was bedridden and in constant pain. But no matter how much she suffered, she never once complained. The only time I ever saw her upset was when I complained about feeling overwhelmed by my school work or when I had a bad day. She would tell me about her hardships, trying to put my own life struggles in perspective. She showed me how to be patient and kind, even when facing adversity. 

One day I remember coming home to find her in the hospital after suffering a bad fall. She couldn't move, so she was stuck laying in the bed for hours. I went to visit her every day, sometimes staying with her until it was late at night. I brought her flowers and candy, but most of all she told me that all she wanted was for me to stay and keep her company. Although she was immobile, she remained positive and grateful the entire time. She kept her patience and faith and looked ahead to her eventual recovery.

That experience with my grandmother taught me so much about patience and resilience. It showed me that even in the most difficult of times, you can remain hopeful and kind. I often think of her when I'm in tough situations and remind myself to stay patient.
