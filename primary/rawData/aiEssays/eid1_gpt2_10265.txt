Computers have many effects on people. For instance, it may make everyone with Alzheimer's feel better. And, of course, it can make people feel less anxious.

But it's also an effect of some of the social pressures facing many Americans -- more importantly, it's a consequence of a very different set of circumstances: a few years of being rich too early. And while it has been reported to be a large part of social stressors for many for many, the exact effects have been less clear.

One study suggests the same effect may go on in a couple of other countries.

A group of Australian university students, who have been asked to provide evidence to support their claims for being well off, say they may experience a negative psychological and physical response to the economic crisis of 2008, where they spent much of their time.

They say the effects were particularly severe among those taking part in a recent, five-week survey sponsored by the Australian Federal Police.

In that survey, the University of Queensland's psychologist Dr. Richard Dix and colleagues analyzed data from 12,000 workers on three social services, including the NHS, Medicare, Social Security and Medicare.

They said workers' perceptions of their own earnings and how much they had changed between 2007 and 2013 - and about the quality of their work, their social lives, and their outlook for their professional potential.

Those in the new study had much more favorable attitudes toward their wealth.
