I remember the first time I noticed that my best friend and I had gotten to the point in our friendship that we could freely share a good laugh together without feeling obligated to hold back. 

We had been best friends since high school, but it wasn't until we got into college that the two of us started to really find our footing in terms of our friendship and understanding each other on a more personal level. 

One afternoon, as we were walking through the quad on campus, we started talking about some of the classes we were taking. I must have said something funny because the next thing I remember we both simultaneously burst into laughter that echoed through the big, empty quad. 

It really felt like we were connected. In that moment, it felt like we both got each other, and it was one of the first real, authentic moments that we shared with each other. In hindsight, that shared moment of laughter helped to kickstart our friendship bond and helped us to realize how alike our senses of humor were. 

It's been nearly four years since that moment, and to this day whenever we remember it, it still brings a smile to our faces and a shared fondness for the bond that we both have.
