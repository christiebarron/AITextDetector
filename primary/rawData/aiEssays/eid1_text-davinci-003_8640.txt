My closest friend Amanda and I had been inseparable since we first met. We had a strong bond that was built on shared experiences, and we could understand each other without needing to speak.

One day, we were talking about our day and the struggles of adulting when she told a joke which I had heard before. I knew the punchline, so instead of laughing, I made a face.

Amanda burst out laughing. She was doubled over and couldn’t stop. Everyone in the room was looking at us and smiling. 

It wasn’t just the joke that was funny; it was the fact that I didn’t get it. Amanda was laughing not because she found the joke funny, but because of the absurdity of my facial expression.

We laughed so hard that tears began to fall from our eyes. It felt so good to let go and just be silly with each other.

Laughter is an incredibly powerful tool in a relationship and it can bring people together. Amanda and I will cherish that moment forever.
