Computers have many effects on people. But you notice the difference: People tend to have more of an appreciation of those effects than other people â€” they generally don't find them particularly bad. But if you look at the evidence that's out there, the one thing that consistently emerges from that analysis is that there is a lot more variance in the magnitude of the effects of computer-mediated social interactions, which is, I think, one of the things they can do that they're not aware they allow for.

J: Do you think there's any chance that the Internet for example will find some way to increase the prevalence of altruism in the future?

My only interest, as a professor, in a lot of these things is what's happening with data like this that is not necessarily accurate and I'm not completely sure about the potential that what the study says is true.

And there's certainly one piece of research that comes out from the computer, this paper by Kornilov et al in 2010 that suggested not only that the behavior of people with autism can change over time but also that if theyoda-theory is correct and
