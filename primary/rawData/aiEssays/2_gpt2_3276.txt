I believe that censorship of materials in libraries is not limited to the press. Public censorship of books is only limited to the publisher. If there are many publishers within a bookstore, those publishers will also have access to all materials that are published under that publisher's legal name. The publisher would then be able to keep all of the materials he or she requests censored, including the pages of books in that bookstore.

What will a bookstore do?

The library has the authority to prevent a publishing company from publishing books in a bookstore. They also have the authority to remove books by the author in a book.

What should a bookstore do?

The library can censor a book when the publisher is prohibited from publishing by court orders

All legal works that are classified by the law are removed prior to publication

A bookstore might publish or re-sell a book based on "controversial" content, such as a quote attributed to a foreign diplomat

In many areas the author of a book has a lot of political or moral influence within his or her family

In some states a publisher may not allow a book that is considered part of a larger family to continue due to copyright concerns

The Library of Congress has authority to regulate books not included under the law

The Library of Congress has access to the entire database, but can't access the contents of a few books

The Library of Congress does not censor works that are not part of the library's
