The Empire State Building was perhaps the most ambitious and daring construction project of its time when first proposed in the 1920s. Originally conceived as a project with a unique feature—plans for docking of dirigibles at the top of the structure—the project faced significant technological hurdles in order to become a reality. In her book “The Mooring Mast”, Marcia Amidon Lüsted dives into the technological and practical issues associated with allowing dirigibles to dock at the skyscraper, and this essay will discuss these obstacles in detail.

To begin, the task of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was a complex one. The building was designed to be a rigid steel and concrete structure, and the structure would not be strong enough on its own to support the substantial weight of a large dirigible. Moreover, the Empire State Building was much taller than any of the dirigibles of the day, and the handling issues associated with getting a dirigible up to and docking with the mooring mast atop the building were significant. For these reasons, the architects of the building had to come up with creative solutions to get the job done.

To address the issue of supporting the weight of the dirigibles, Lüsted reports that seven mooring, or docking, masts of steel and concrete were added to the top of the Empire State Building. These enormous masts would provide the necessary support for docked dirig
