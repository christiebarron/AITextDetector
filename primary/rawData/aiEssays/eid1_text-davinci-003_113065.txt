Dear Editor, 

I am writing to discuss the effects that computers have on people. I believe that, in many ways, computers can have a hugely positive impact, allowing us to access information, keep in touch with friends, and even perform delicate operations with greater accuracy and safety. But I strongly caution against assuming that computers are inherently helpful.

Studies have shown that too much screen time can lead to a range of negative effects, from poor posture and obesity to anxiety and depression. Computers can also be extremely distracting, making it hard to focus and do the important things in life. Computer games, social media platforms, and the popularity of streaming services can lead us to spend too much time online, which in turn can make procrastination and aimlessness more likely.

I recognize the value of computers in our lives, but I would like to strongly caution against assuming that they are always beneficial or that they should take priority over other activities. We need to think critically and carefully about the role of computers in our lives, and also be mindful of the serious risks posed by excessive screen time. 

Sincerely, 

[Name]
